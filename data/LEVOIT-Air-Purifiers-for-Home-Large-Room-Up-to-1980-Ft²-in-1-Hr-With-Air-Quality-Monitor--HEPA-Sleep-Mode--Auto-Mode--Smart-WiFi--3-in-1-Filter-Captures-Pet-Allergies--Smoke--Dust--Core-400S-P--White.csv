Amazed at how sensitive the readout was to simple things like cooking in another room. Upon increased reading, the fan speeds up until the number goes back down. Fan changes are super quiet, you don’t even know the fan is running. It works and works well. Hardest thing is remembering to shut it off if you open the windows (no sense filtering the universe and using up your filter capacity scrubbing the neighborhood air LOL). I bought a second unit based on satisfaction. Can’t comment on odor reduction, but it certainly excels at particulate removal and I love the fact I can read the level on the meter.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Keith,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2024","Love this unit. The auto mode is great. 2nd it picks up any traces of bad air. It kicks on. Or run it on the highest setting and it’s makes the air real clean!!!
We have an older house. Not the first owners. Got the old farm smell. We live in the country so plenty of smells and bad air. This was a huge upgrade for this living room. Love the app, super easy to use. Control the unit when you are not home. Filter is of high quality. Works really well. You can turn the lights off and go dark. It’s not that loud, if on 4 it’s a bit loud but if you think about it. Beyond worth it. Super easy to change the filter. Looks great. The price was is worth it. I worked at a school for 2 years where fire smoke is a real threat. The school would run these all the time. They really work. When you clean and replace the filters. The proof is all over the screens. If you don’t believe me try it. Women based company. Just be sure to get the right size unit for the room, depending on the room size. There are all kinds of air purifiers on the market. They all scrub the air. Just some have sensors. Some have better filters. They all do the same thing. Just some have more stages of filtration. Mode buttons. Sleep modes, timer setting and best of all is auto mode.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Wyatt,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2023","1-Year Update:

I've had 2 Everest Air units in my 1-bedroom apartment for a little over a year now and thought I'd come back to update. All in all, I can say this is still a 5-star product and still one of the best on the market. Everything I said originally still is true to this day. No issues whatsoever to report with either unit. The one and only negative thing I can possibly find is the cost of the replacement filters, which are $99 each, and never seem to go on sale. I have to change both filters pretty much twice a year. The first change I did I tried an off-brand that was less than 1/2 the price, but they did not fit the unit quite right and left a gap, and noticeably did not perform as well. When I just changed them a few days ago I bit the bullet and spent the $200 on the real filters and it was nice to have them fit snugly into the machines.

Original Review:

Love my Levoit EverestAir! I researched air purifiers for over a month, trying to determine which had the best performance, quality filter, and lots of modern features. I watched hours of video reviews, sorted through articles, and evaluated each, including Levoit, of course, Dyson, Mila, Molekule, Coway, and Blueair, just to name the most popular that I looked at. When it came down to it, the Levoit EverestAir has the best of what I was looking for – so much so that I just ordered a second one to put in my bedroom!

FILTRATION: Like another reviewer mentioned, starting at the filter and then working your way back is best, and the filter on this thing is a beast! It is massive and has a large amount of carbon pellets that you can actually see. Many other brands use a tiny sheet of carbon that does almost nothing to capture VOCs or odors, but Levoit packed a ton of carbon pellets into this filter. Plus, the laser air quality monitoring is the best you can get. It reacts almost immediately, maybe a 5-10 second delay, to any change in the air quality. I notice that it kicks up right when I expect it to.

DESIGN: It is definitely not a ""small"" machine, but it also isn't the largest. It is sleek and looks nice in my living room, considering it is powerful enough to clean my entire 900 sq.ft. apartment. The display gives you all of the information you need without being an obnoxiously bright touchscreen monitor. I really like that you can control the display or enable the ""light detection"" mode which would be great for a bedroom as it automatically lowers the fan speed and turns off the display when it gets dark.

APP: The app is great, I have had a Levoit Core 200 for several years and it is still running perfectly to this day, which also uses the same app as the EverestAir. However, the main difference is the EverestAir app is PACKED with features. You can view everything you can on the machine itself, like air quality %, PM1.0, 2.5, and 10, change the fan speed or place it in auto mode, view the filter life, and turn the display on or off.

PRICE: Considering some of the competitors like Dyson and Molekule can reach $800 after tax, the EverestAir is a great value! Of course the sticker shock can be a bit jarring, but overall it is 100% worth it.

DOES IT HELP PURIFY: It sure does! I suffer from severe seasonal allergies in both the spring and fall, and when I was home, I did not have to take any allergy medications, eye drops, or nose sprays whatsoever and I have EverestAir to thank for that! I sleep better and my furniture stays cleaner with the particulates being filtered out of the air before they have a chance to settle. My apartment is brand new and there was a bit of construction dust still in the air, in the carpet, and on the walls, and I am confident this is keeping that at bay, too, while the carbon is absorbing any Formaldehyde offgassing from the fresh paint.

THE BOTTOM LINE: If you're on the fence about ordering the EverestAir and are looking at any of the brands I mentioned, absolutely buy the EverestAir! You will not regret it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2024","We live in the desert so I bought this to remove some of the dust that gets into the house. It works great. It removes almost all the dust and any dusty smells that go with it. It is a larger machine and can remove almost all the dust in half of the whole house. I put it on high in the morning when I get up. Within an hour I kick it down to ""Auto"" mode as it has lowered the dust to almost nothing. Auto mode controls the fan according to how much dust it senses. It works very well. The sleep mode drops it so quiet I have to check it sometimes to see if it is actually running. The Wifi just makes it easier so I don't have to get up to change it. I can just pull it up on my phone and use the app to adjust it. We just bought this so its not been used enough to rate durability. It seems to be well built, but only time will tell. Its not cheap enough to just go out and buy another if it dies, so I'm hoping it lasts. Further posts will be made if it breaks.",5.0 out of 5 stars
SLM,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2021","I have owned this product for less than 24 hours as of this writing. More updates as I have more to say/remember to do them. Also, I will be very verbose, the sort of in-depth information I want when I am researching products over $99 for purchase, so you really know what's going on. Hopefully it helps, but it may be TL;DR for some.

My background: I am not a smoker and never have been. I was raised by a chain smoker and have spent the majority of my life around second hand smoke from parents, family and friends. I have stress induced asthma and have also been through experimental chemotherapy that has apparently permanently damaged my lungs. Over time, my lungs are slowly degrading, and as they do I become more and more sensitive to more and more things, which trigger my lungs to get irritated and produce phlegm to coat my lungs and prevent the irritation, which causes me to cough more and more over time. (It has been a lot of fun having this sort of lung disorder during the pandemic, let me tell you.)

""Well, why don't you see a doctor then?"" you may reasonably ask. My experience with doctors in the past has consisted of watching both my mother and grandmother die with (no joke) 30+ prescriptions each all at once (with 3 to 5 doctors all prescribing simultaneously and admitting to me in private that A) they were not consulting with one another, and B) nobody on earth could possibly keep track of the side effects of so many prescriptions at once), and my uncle wasn't far off that number when he died. I also have repeated personal experience with the medical industry that strongly supports my experience and belief that going to the doctor is going to be a financially insane choice (whether or not I have insurance) that I get little to nothing out of regardless. So I choose to avoid doctors and the medical/drug big business establishment like the plague whenever possible.

When I realized recently that my lungs were noticeably irritated all the time when I was in my own home, but I was fine if I went outside, I decided it was time to step up my game. Enter this unit, which I researched before buying.

My unit is brand new, not a returned unit. Upon turning it on, it told me that my air in all areas of the house tested was as good as it gets, with a reading of 001. This did not please me, because I know it's nowhere near that good. So I did an update of the firmware to see if that would fix the issue, and it did. The new display read 005, which was significantly lower than I expected, but the unit reduced that to 3, then 2, then 1 relatively quickly.

Within about 15 minutes, the air in my (door closed) office started to smell noticeably different. Lighter, cleaner, fresher, more neutral. I was surprised. I also noted that over the next few hours, my coughing decreased significantly as long as I stayed in my office.

When bed time came, I put the unit in my bedroom and turned it on full blast with the doors closed while I went to the kitchen to have a snack. At first, the bedroom registered 5. The unit quickly brought it down to 1. I noted that my coughing increased when I was in parts of the house that had not had the benefit of this device to clean the air.

Returning to my bedroom after my snack, I noted that once again, there was a nice difference in how the air smelled in my bedroom compared to my kitchen.

Normally it takes me a while to stop coughing enough to fall asleep when I got to bed each night, but last night while there was still coughing before sleep, it was markedly less, which my girlfriend commented on today. This morning, I woke up to the pleasant realization that my lungs did not feel irritated for the first time in a long time. I hadn't even realized how irritated my lungs were when I would usually awaken until it was gone.

Moved the unit into my home office again, and turned it back on. It started at 5, and again rapidly cleaned the air until it was at 1. Then I began doing more experiments. I noted that when the AC kicks on, it goes from 1 to 2 or 3. When it turns off, the unit returns it to 1. When I open the door to my office, it goes to 2, and then back to 1 when I close it. When my cat walks into my office, it goes from 1 to 2 if I close the door after him, and stays there for as long as he is moving around. If I pet him, it goes to 3.

Thinking this level of sensitivity was too good to be true, I decided to try further experiments. I closed my office door again, waited until it settled down, and sprayed some air freshener in my office. No change - it evaporated. Just as expected. Then I went down the hall and into my living room and lit a stick of natural compressed sandalwood powder incense. I returned to my office and closed the door. Within 2 minutes, this unit detected the incense in the air, rising to a 4-5-6 and then back to 3 when the AC turned off. The next AC cycle, it jumped into the teens, and then into the 20's, 30's, 40's as the smoke got going during the next cycle. When the count hit 45, it turned the ring green and stepped the fan up a notch.

I found that I could watch the numbers go up when the AC was on, and down when it was off. It got up to around 86 at one point, and the ring sometime before that turned orange and stepped the speed up another notch. Now that the incense has burned out, it's dropping, with highs in the 50's, and lows i the 20's and cycling lower each time the AC kicks on again. It's been interesting to see it power up and down to match the particulates in the air.

Build quality seems good, but the bottom can come off easier than I'd like. A couple times now I have tried to lift it only to find that it had un-screwed and the bottom and filter were not lifted with the rest of the unit. Easily fixed in a second or less, but if the bottom had a bit of ""click into place"", this would not happen when moving the unit.

It is so quiet in sleep mode that last night when we went to bed, after I had it running on high for a few minutes while we had our snack before bed, that even three feet from it, my girlfriend could not tell if it was running and asked. This was with the AC not active. That's pretty darned quiet. It also was no issue for me to handle, and I am extremely sensitive to sound when I am trying to sleep.

The top two levels of fan speed are relatively loud, with the highest speed being louder than my AC when it's kicked in. It is, however, the most smooth and beautiful white noise I have ever encountered, and I am an audio engineer.

So far my experience with this is almost entirely good. Here;s what I don't like.

1. The bottom unscrews too easily. No big deal, but irksome.
2. The sensor didn't work when I got it until I updated the firmware, which forced me to download the app, sign up, and then give the app location permissions and blue tooth permissions. I also naturally had to sign it into my wifi network. I didn't want to use the app, or give the app these permissions. The app, however, will not run without them. Ostensibly, it uses location data to give you a report on local 2.5um particulate levels in your area (which it does), but I don't know what else it is being used for, and I don't much like having my location tracked by Google and every other company on earth these days.

So far so good. It appears that particulates in my house are probably not as much of an issue as what those particulates are made of, and that I need to be more focused on reducing VOCs in the air in my house. But so far this unit has helped me breathe significantly better, and I'm very happy with how well it works.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Tech49,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2023","Update August 2024 -- Levoit sent me a replacement for the issue. I'm updating my review to reflect the great customer service provided.

Update July 2024 -- Unfortunately my air purifier has started making a nasty grinding noise coming the air sensor on the left side. I have included a video of what it sounds like. It's loud/jarring enough that it has woken me up several times in the middle of the night. Disconnecting the purifier from power for a couple hours is the only thing that seems to help but the issue comes back randomly. I've reached out to Levoit for help but they've giving me the runaround.

Original Review -- I've owned so many air purifiers from BlueAir to Levoit to Dyson to Mila. The Levoit EverestAir has been the best so far for several reasons:

1. The filter itself. Always start with the filter and work your way backwards with air purifiers. Some really fancy air purifiers (like one from a company that sound like molecule) don't really filter much of anything and its pure hype. The Levoit Everest has a high quality HEPA-13 filter that also has proper granules of activated carbon to absorb VOCs. It also has a fabric type ""seal"" around the filter so it's snug when you install it to minimize unfiltered air bypass. There is also a nice pre-filter (which you should clean weekly or every 2 weeks) that catches the bigger particles that would otherwise degrade the life of the main HEPA filter.

2. The sensors. They're really accurate and respond instantly to changes in air quality. When I say instant, I don't mean 5 seconds, I mean within 1 second. The app also shows you these readings in realtime with accurate historic information as well. The sensors do not measure temperature, humidity, or VOCs, but I found that this is actually a good thing; the VOC and Humidity/temp sensors suffer from drift over time and will lose their calibration and accuracy. These are advanced laser-based (not infrared like in most other air purifiers) particle sensors that will last the life of the unit.

(updated June 14th 2023):
One big thing to note: this unit doesn't sugarcoat. The particle sensors are so precise that you will constantly get readings in the PM1.0, 2.5, and 10 ranges. This is perfectly normal of any living space as stuff is constantly being generated; even by yourself. The air purifiers that give you 0s for any of these readings for more than a few seconds are indicative of infrared sensors that are less accurate.

3. How quiet it is. Even on level ""3"" which is the highest that it can go automatically, it's not loud. At level ""1"", you just hear a low hum. It's amazing how quiet it is. Things start to get loud when you use ""turbo"" mode, but you'd only use that mode in case of an emergency.

(updated June 14th 2023):
4. The app. It's far more feature rich than I was expecting. It's so fast and responsive that you can get away with keeping the screen locked perpetually (if you have kids or nosy dogs) and just using the app and automations to control the air purifier. It also doesn't mind if you're using a separate IoT wifi network. (for those ultra concerned about security) there are no features lost by using a secure IoT network.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Update;
I sent the first one back within the 30 days, Amazon sent me out a replacement, this one works as promised, the laser smart sensor works as described, I have had it now for over 3 months and it has been working like a charm, once again Amazon has amazing customer support they took back the first one and in two days had the replacement just wanted to give it sometime before doing another update, this is my favorite easy to use efficient air cleaner yet, the 360° filter is so easy to replace I have asthma and this has helped me breathe much better, if they made one of these even bigger with this type of circular drum filter, I would buy it in a heartbeat",5.0 out of 5 stars
Texas Son,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2024","Pros:
Moves a ton of air
Noise is not too bad for the volume of air it moves. The air moving across the fan blades is fine, it's the air moving through the filter that makes the noise.
Alexa integration

Cons:
VeSync network is laggy
Air quality detection is not very good
Display mounted on the top where you can't see it unless you are right next to it.

I bought this unit for my ""cigar room."" It is rated for 3X the square footage of my room and it really moves a lot of air. If you are close to it then it is obviously going to be noisy, so be realistic before complaining. Do you want a quiet or do you want it to move a lot of air?

It filters really well, even though I don't have the ""smoke filter"" in it, and there is no doubt it's going to have a positive effect on the cigar smell.

I have my unit about 3 or 4 feet off the floor because the cigar smoke goes up, not down, and it works much better that way. In fact I can see it drawing the smoke toward it from 5 feet away. For non-smokers, I'm sure on the floor is fine.

However…

The sensor to detect smoke and adjust is not very good at all. Depending on the cigar, I can be 5 feet away from the unit and it tells me the air quality is ""good."" Good? Really? I have an older Taotronics unit I bought 3 or 4 years ago that responds to the smoke just as well, even at its age, so I always have to change the speed manually, through Alexa (see complaints on that, below). Understandably, most people won't be happy with this, but I would be setting it to high anyway because I want it to filter as much smoke out of the air as it possibly can. I don't think any unit is going to be sensitive enough to do that. In fact, a sensitivity setting should absolutely be included on these units.

As others have complained, Alexa tells me the unit is off-line way too much, but I think this is a problem with the VeSync network, not the unit itself. I have a toaster oven that also uses VeSync and it often behaves the same way. Anyway, even though it says it's off-line, it will usually respond 30 or so seconds later. For the most part, the response time is very laggy. Only once has it responded normally, within one or 2 seconds. But again, I blame VeSync.

The display is kind of cool, but it's on the top where literally no one will see it unless they are right next to it. So, beyond using it for manual control, it's 95% useless. It's one of those ""I wonder what the air quality is? I don't know, let me whip out my phone, open the app, log in and look. Or I have to get up and walk over to the machine."" A side-mounted air quality digital display would have been a smart addition.

If I post an update, it won't be because something good happened. :-)",4.0 out of 5 stars
Matthew Rothenberg,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2024","We've had a few different air purifiers and I decided to upgrade the one in our bedroom after me and my wife both had itchy eyes and woke up stuffed up for a few weeks in a row.

For context, we have two double coated dogs who shed like crazy, we live in a town that is 65% conservation land, IE a lot of nature so there is a ton of pollen, ragweed, etc.

After putting this (600) in our large bedroom we almost instantly stopped getting itchy eyes and stuffed up noses. FYI, neither of us have allergies as far as we know but there is only so much anyone can take before their body starts fighting back and even with the other air purifier in the room, it wasn't working well enough even on high.

As soon as I set up this new one and put it aon auto-mode it kicked into high gear and cleaned the air within a minute.

Having another and larger air purifier in our living room on another floor of the house, I decided that I would replace it, but wait until the filter needed to be changed. Well, after a few weeks I decided I couldn't wait any longer, especially now that this went on sale. So I bought a 2nd one, got it the next day and after the setting it up in 2 minutes and connecting it to the app, it did the same thing as the first one...IE it recognized the air wasn't clean, kicked into high gear for a bit and now has been steadily on low showing 1pm / 2.5 since.

Sure it goes back into high hear if we open a window for a bit, or we're cooking, etc but that's exactly what you want it to do. Even on high it's quiet and i know that it's recognizing there is something in the air that should be filtered out and it does it so effectively.

I've also done my research and these products rank right at the top with more expensive options on the market so I know it's good bang for your buck.,

Lastly, it does (as all air purifiers do) recommend that you have at least 18 inches of space all around it. I have mine in places where this is not possible bc I dont want it sitting in the middle of the room. I bring this up bc I'm sure if I did, it would work even better but I'm not sure I can imagine how it could work better.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Don Battles,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2024","So my purchase of the Levoit CORE400s was driven by a few factors.

It’s well regarded by its users and reviewers.

It was on sale plus a $25 dollar coupon (only good for one unit).

The room/space I keep my kitty’s litter box gets air drawn down the hallway by the HVAC return. Draws bad orders into the rest of the house.

Aside from the smells from kitty I assumed my air quality was poor/bad.

Upon turning on the unit and putting turning the fan on I was surprised by two things. The fan is SUPER quiet and my air quality was immediately assessed as “good” (blue ring 2.5 ppm). So it would appear the air quality inside my home is pretty good.

I also installed the VeSync app and connected my new device, could not have been easier! So now I can track air quality over time (hours,days,weeks) to how things may change. As for smells after a few hours the odors from kitty’s litter box seem less strong. Also, FWIW, it’s cleaned daily and I use PrettyLitter.

Laura Hubka,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2024",Just received this last week. We live out in the country on a gravel road and deal with a lot of dust. I have a lot of allergies so we're trying to find something that will keep the air more clean in our home. We got central air last year so that made it a little easier to keep the windows shut. Still a lot of dust gets in because of people driving by. It's interesting to see it fluctuate depending on how often the doors getting open and closed during the day. It's stayed at the lowest setting during the week but once all the grandkids were over and going in and out of the house it shot up to the midpoint for most of the day until after they were gone and then back down to a one. I'll put another review in here after a month to let you know how it's going. I did go around the house just dust everything to see how long it takes for everything to get covered again.

The app and filter connect with Alexa, allowing me to easily tell it to switch to Turbo mode when searing meat etc, getting a jump on the smoke and avoiding it ever getting too bad. Previously I would open two doors and run a fan to cycle the air. Not necessary any more! In daily life, this has significantly reduced cat allergies for two regular guests, and has reduced my baseline PM5 when first installing the filter from 35 to a consistent 2-3 per the app. Filters are not exactly cheap, but they do the job and if desired, there are alternatives available on Amazon.

LilyOfTheTower,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2024","I bought two and, so far, I am extremely happy with my purchases. I have one in my livingroom and one in my children's room. They're whisper quiet, very nice and sturdy. Easy to set up and connect to with an app and to my existing Alexa units. The app is easy and simple to use with built in settings for auto off and on so you don't need to program a long tedious schedule of off times and on times.
I noticed a measurable difference with the 24 hours I've had them. My house smells fresher and cleaner. I returned home from a quick errand and the house didn't smell. (You know it's bad if you smell your own house.)
Prior to receiving them, I did a thorough dusting, vacuuming and shampooed the carpets. My house was long overdue for a deep clean. I and my family were waking up with headaches, coughing, sneezing, just overall feeling unwell for what seems like years. Falling asleep was difficult due to an indescribable uncomfort too.
I had the idea it is probably the dust build up, as one night I finally had a clearing of my sinuses and I smelled old dusty dust really thick. And I'm not one to dust often which is not good but lesson learned.

I live in a 100 year old craftsman house on a gravel driveway on a very busy countryside road. We have a dog and 2 cats and they are about 70/30 indoor outdoor pets respectively. It gets dusty and grimey and there are so many places for that dust creep in and settle. We also have wildfires in our area that become so thick with unhealthy levels of smoke and particles.
I'm beyond happy and comforted knowing I have these quality machines to help keep our home clean, fresh a most important healthy.

Jack Ruby Built The Pyramids,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2024","***Minor update***
I forgot to mention the 'app' for this device. If you are buying this for the Wifi or app control - I highly recommend you reconsider using this app (or *any* app on your phone) to control silly things like an air purifier or a light bulb. This app, like many other apps, require invasive permissions in order to mine your data (track your location, track your contacts, etc). Additionally, once these things are connected to your WiFi network they now have the ability to scan other things on your network and potentially mine data from those devices for sending back to the manufacturer (95% of the cases this goes back to the Chinese manufacturer.)
So, just keep things like this in mind when you decide to take advantage of the ""smart features"" of devices and apps. It's not just the device the app has access to - it will have access to just about anything connected to your network.
Aside from this caveat - I still love this purifier - it is surprisingly effective!

We have a couple of the much smaller Levoit units for various uses and those have worked on a decent level for our needs. However, we were having an event in the house that was going to involve cigar smoke and put this 400S in the living room. This thing made quick work of the cigar smoke - within minutes the air in the room had been exchanged - very impressive.
I think I might just leave this thing out at all times. Again, very impressed for the capability at <$200",5.0 out of 5 stars
Litefever,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2023","We purchased one of these on sale in the hope it would help moderate the severity of pollen season in upstate NY and the dander generated by two large labradors. It has a nice, clean look and small foot print, which we feel is important.

The HEPA filter was shipped inside it in a bag that needs to be removed but doing so was incredibly quick and easy to do. Twist the top a quarter turn and place to one side. Lift out the filter, remove the bag, lower the filter back in using the two tabs provided on it for that purpose, lift the lid back on and quarter twist to close. It takes 2 mins. Then its' plug-in, turn on and choose """"Auto"" or a fan speed using the touch sensitive panel on top. You can control it from your iphone if you're into that but it certainly isn't necessary.

The first thing we noticed is how quiet it is. Effectively soundless in sleep mode and at fan speed 1. Barely noticeable at fan speed 2, unless you're right next to it, noticeable at fan speed 3 when you are in the same room as it but not obnoxious. Noticeably louder at fan speed 4 which should be considered a 'Turbo"" mode. Then we noticed the impact of running it - vastly reduced swelling of the eyes and sinuses of those suffering from hay fever and a significant reduction in the doggy smell of our labradors. It works really well.

We have taken advantage of the ability to control this by iPhone to set a schedule where it automatically runs in sleep mode (low, continuous fan) from 10pm to 5am. Then at fan speed 2 from 5am to 5:30am, ramping up to fan speed 3 from 5:30am to 8am before switching to auto from 8am to 10pm. Because of the relatively severe allergies suffered by a couple of our family members the P2.5 micron threshold is set to 2 ug per meter cubed and this filter has been able to attain that incredibly low level with that schedule within a few hours of all windows and doors to the outside being closed to the 1800 sq. ft area it services. At this point we have an oasis for our hay fever sufferers to return to each evening and it's made an incredible difference to their comfort. Do they still take Claritin or Allegra during pollen season? Yes, we've found it necessary to deal with the pollen at work and in the garden. Are they doing better than they were before we got this filter? Yes, the continuously swollen and itchy, weeping eyes are gone. The inflamed nasal passages are gone. Their sleep deprivation is gone. Their quality of life has improved dramatically. We had no idea how dramatic an impact adding a quality, appropriately sized HEPA filtration system would have. This unit is rated for something like 3000 sq. ft. We're using to control air quality in a 1800 sq.f.t open plan area and its doing a great job of that without having to run the fan at high speed for prolonged periods of time.

We've had this for several weeks now and experienced 1st hand how well it can deal with really terrible air quality when the smoke from the fires in Quebec blew into NY. Opening the door to come into the house with the shopping during the worst of it briefly dropped the air quality from a PM2.5 of 001 to as high as a PM2.5 of 185 within 12 feet of the door. This was then quickly reduced to a PM2.5 of less than 20 in an hour and back to 001 in about 2 hours after the door was closed. The outside airs PM2.5 was apparently North of 300 at this time (sources accuweather and the news), the air was literally a hazy brown like smog and this filter was able to detect it, automatically adjust its fan speed to clear it and maintain perfect air quality in the house.

Does it work? Absolutely, quietly and brilliantly.

Would we buy this again? Yes, in fact we have so that we can control the air quality for one of our allergy sufferers in another area where they have to spend prolonged periods of time. That one's been in place for about 3 weeks and has done exactly what we hoped it would do - improve the quality of life at work in a 7000 sq.ft. open plan office area. Now this is well beyond the manufacturers claimed coverage for a unit and it looks like they're right based on who's apparently benefiting and who isn't but here's the important point. The benefits to the workforce have been so noticeable to management they're now considering upgrading the offices HVAC system to include HEPA filtration. I think that speaks volumes.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sls701,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2024","We have two large breed dogs. When I would come home from work or traveling, I would notice a “dog smell”. Drove me crazy. Read the reviews on this air purifier and gave it a try. It is nothing short of OUTSTANDING. I wish I would have purchased the 2 pack.
For context of how well it works- the air quality light would be blue, my husband would cook something and the smell would loft through the house- the air quality light would immediately turn orange, slowly turning to green and then back to blue. Within ~20 minutes, no more smell.

llivingstons,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2024",I have been pleased with this product since purchase. Preparation included cleaning the furnace and heat pump vents across the house. This helped significantly to reduce pollen and other bacteria across the house. We also cleaned the carpets and fireplace to ensure the whole house was at the same level of cleanliness. The unit excels in identifying increased scents whether good or bad. It really helped our home to maintain proper levels and reduce the PM 2.5 pollen challenges experienced before we cleaned and sanitized our home. At the slightest changes in foreign bacteria/elevated scents the unit turns on and eradicates the smell then goes back to standby mode and also sends you a message of what it did and what it about to do. Really next level technology that scrubs the air when needed without wasting energy. We have Levoit products across our home and love the piece of mind they provide. We have 2-600S for the large rooms; 2-400S for the smaller areas; 3-300 series for the bedrooms. “This is not a sponsored review.” They just do a great job scrubbing the air and we love them!!,5.0 out of 5 stars
DB1,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2024","Since buying the Core 400S/Core 400S-P this unit has vastly improved our home's air quality.
The fan is not noisy at all. As any fan, the higher the setting the more sound. It's not even close to being as noisy as an actual fan unit.
Our PPM reading on first start up (at 5pm) was 016, which is great to begin with. By 10pm PPM were at a 004. The next day it went down to a 001. During remodeling, when our contractors gutted the bathroom, the PPM shot up to 037 and it brought it back down to 001 within a couple hours before they finished.
While the contractors sanded the drywall the PPM shot up to 076. By day's end PPM was 002.
A great thing about the unit is also its mobility. The handles make it easy to move. If a room smells a bit off, like musty or stagnant, placing this unit in the room or just outside the room moves air, filters it, and gets it smelling fresh/clean.
Our dog's crate is located in our office room. It was a bit odorous. One day of this unit running in the room cleared the scent up.

Teresa,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2024","My wife has been getting random hives all over her body throughout the day. We thought it was specific foods or medication but when we stopped those for a period of time, she was still getting the same hives. Finally was able to get an appointment with an allergist and after the panel testing, they determined that she was allergic to indoor and outdoor mold spores. Our home was built in 1994 and while it is not terribly old, it is not as tight as most of the newer homes these days. Therefore, outdoor air is able to make it inside when stove fans or AC runs drawing outdoor air through cracks in doors and windows.

We purchased these so we could try to tackle her hive issue. Before these were ordered, we only had 2 smaller purifiers set up at each return vent for our upstairs AC unit. Unfortunately, those purifiers are only rated for about 365 sq ft of purification. Our whole upstairs is roughly 2k sq ft. Fast forward through 2 days of intense research, I decided to get 2 of these units and 3 more of our other units to purify our whole home in 30 minute cycles. So with the combined purifiers for our home (4600 sq ft), every 30 minutes the existing air would be purified. That sounded pretty good to me.

Not only did her hives stop, my skin became less itchy. Never really bothered me but I definitely noticed less skin irritation after we started using the combined with our other purifiers. We chose this one because of its HEPA replacement cost. It was significantly less compared to its rival COWAY airmega. So long run, this device should be easier on the pocket. We run all our air purifiers 24/7 so having the ability to set schedules on all of them is so convenient. The option to turn off the display at night is nice but since we have ours on a schedule we just leave the display off. Watching the particulate counter crank up and down showing how much work it is doing to purify the air is really neat.

I truly hope that these units last a lifetime. We are only 1 month into using these and life has gotten better. Will update with any issues or comments about the device as they arise.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Alfonso Dee,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2023","So I was looking for an air filter for my Florida room, which is the only room in my home where I smoke cigarettes.

In the non summer months I just keep all the windows open and the room airs out. But in the summer months when the humidity is unbearable down here, I have to run an air conditioner in the room. Which means I have to close the windows, which means the cigarette smoke doesn’t air out. So it’s a dilemma for me.

It’s either sit in the room sweating and uncomfortable in the humidity with the windows open and let the smoke out - or shut the windows and use the AC and have the room filled with lingering smoke. Neither of which are ideal options.

So I figured an air filter might be a solution. I found though that it wasn’t that simple, because then it turns into which air filter to get that’s actually going to work, without breaking the bank as well.

I was trying to find the best air filter to solve this issue within a reasonable price point. I really did not want to spend more than maybe $200 or so. Before finding this one, I tried 2 others that literally did nothing, that were admittedly a bit cheaper than this one.

Then I found this one, and it was delivered the same day. I got this one today, hooked it up and did a real time test.

I put this unit on a stand in a good spot in the room, set it up, plugged it in, and the air quality in the room was reading very good - indicated by the blue ring and very low number on the screen. I then closed all the windows, turned on the AC, and then lit up a cigarette.

I purposefully blew the smoke right onto the unit every time I took a drag and exhaled. I knew immediately that this was going to work when this filter INSTANTLY detected the cigarette smoke, and the blue light ring which
means excellent air quality, turned red, and the air quality numbers on the screen jumped from around 20 (which means excellent air quality) to about 900 (which means the air quality is horrendous).

Once the machine detected the smoke, it immediately began filtering it out of the air, and I literally sat there and watched the numbers on the screen going down in real time as it was removing the smoke.

The red lights also gradually turned to orange, then green, then I left the room for 10 minutes.

When I came back in the room (which is not very big, maybe 600 sq ft tops) there was no visible smoke in the air, and the light ring was back to blue, and the air quality numbers were back well below 30. So this had cleaned the air and removed all the smoke.

This machine is beyond impressive.

Now, I will say that even though the smoke was gone in the air, there still was a lingering faint odor of cigarette smoke in the room. But I also did not give the machine a full hour to run for the test. My thinking is that if I did, it would have removed the odor as well in a bit more time.

Given what I watched this do in the short test though, and how it performed? This air filter is truly remarkable, and I’m beyond happy with this purchase so far.

I would highly recommend this product for anyone trying to deal with any kind cigarette, or other kinds of smoke in a dwelling of any kind. A ++++++",5.0 out of 5 stars

I really didn't see anything negative, so I made the purchase. About a week ago, I noticed when I turned it on it would immediately turn off. I thought it might have been the outlet, so I plugged it somewhere else, and had the same result. On my 3rd attempt, it finally worked. The very next day it did the same thing. I then realized that it worked depending on how the power cord was turned. I believe there's an issue with it, but since it's not a power cord that detaches and can possibly be replaced, it simply is not gonna work.

The unit itself looks nice, we have ours sitting in the dining room area in a corner.

I mainly got this because when we are away from the house for several hours, and come back there is a musty type odor and we really can't figure out what the cause is. So far I have to say this has been pretty impressive, the last few times we have been away for the day and came back, the smell was not there.

We leave this running about 12 hours during the day only, this seems to work pretty good for us.
As for it being quiet, well on low speed and even the second speed you could hardly hear this thing running.
Now when I turn it on in the morning, it will ramp up to high speed for about 20 minutes or so and you definitely know it is running. But the majority of the time it is nice and quiet.
Have to say the sensors are really good and very sensitive, they pick up the air quality when we cook and adjust the fan speed, in no time the digital readout is back to normal.

flpalmtree,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2024","I recently had to get a new HVAC system. It’s a higher-end unit that has a filter in the indoor unit [some indoor units are in the garage, others in a closet inside the house], which eliminates the need to have filters in the return vents in the house.

When deciding on what type of filter to use, I found quite a few DIYers who say it’s not worth getting the really high-priced dense filters, even though those filters say they trap particles that mid-priced filters cannot. These DIYers reasoning ― the high-priced dense filters make it more difficult for air to pass through them, which requires your HVAC unit to work harder and longer, which leads to higher monthly electric bills. What they say to do instead is use the mid-priced filter and use a high quality in-room air purifier (or air purifiers in multiple rooms).

My house has an open floor plan where the kitchen, eating area, and main TV room are all, essentially, one room. So I placed this Levoit in the middle. It does a fantastic job of clearing the air!

CafeSociety,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2023","The title says a lot. Fantastic, reliable, easy, informative, accessible. The app works (almost) top notch. What I really appreciate is that they are spot on reliable using wifi apps at any location away from my house to inside my house. Their response time is fast from the app. Scheduling, setting up smart home features all run well through the app, easy to learn and use. I will be buying more, trying to get a friend to get one (two). No regrets buying them.

Not so great things that I wish they’d develop or get rid of:
Adding ability to control locally through Bluetooth (or zigby or z-wave) and not only through wifi and the cloud. This was problematic when internet was cancelled or interrupted. Thankfully they kept their schedules, but I had to run them on phone wifi hotspot to access them through the app. The base units work manually, but will keep the schedule in the app, unless you do a full reset.

The app room arrangement doesn’t really work, and their readings don’t exactly match or refresh. (But this is in development, but probably won’t take off.)

I do not like that the app can be an bit invasive on every part of my privacy/life. Like trying to get me to buy into their health tracking logging what I eat, or making it mandatory to set location etc. in setup. The ploy to be there for health to basically gain marketing data. Too many apps and even work apps play this game and it’s a bit deceptive marketing data gathering. I’m totally techy smart home and software junky, but there’s a clear line that is getting crossed. The company sends me prodding emails to track my health. I cannot get rid of the icon in the app, wish it wasn’t a part of this.

That was negative, Back to positive. Because they are fantastic. I’ve watched every YouTube video on all the brands repeatedly. I now have 4 of these and a few smaller finer filter ones from Medify, and two Winnix 5500’s. The Levoit are hands down my favorite. They are quiet and easy over wifi. I’ve turned my non-smart Winnix to smart by adding switch bots to them, but the Levoit are smart from the start. The smaller med brand one cannot be turned smart as there’s no place to put switchbots on them. They get too loud in medium and high, so I will not buy that brand again, keep with the Levoit. (Possibly try Austin Air someday, but that’s just more money.)

Levoit is Not glitchy. A favorite feature when I’m cooking in the kitchen is the number and color reading. It shoots up so fast when cooking certain ways or foods. It’s funny because a Winnix will turn orange or red in a heartbeat when I pour alcohol in a glass 4 feet away in front of it! But it doesn’t provide a number, which the Levoit 600 shows.

These filter the air so well, that when I drop peppermint oil at doorways or spots in a room (deters spiders and I think ants, I use a lot on a sailboat. Works like a charm), if my Levoit is running, it removes the essential oil smell too fast. Way too fast. It’s a battle I will not win if I run these air filters, because they work so well.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Super simple set-up, consisting of removing the HEPA filter from its protective plastic (a well-placed warning sticker makes this hard to miss!) and replacing the cover. All the controls are located on the top of the device; there is no remote. I use mine to filter air in a space approx. 900 square feet, which includes a kitchen. Although I am not a fan of syncing countless devices to Alexa, I did it this time using the VeSync app to see how user friendly the process is., and it took only a few minutes. There are some additional features available through the use of the app. The device itself moves a lot of air and, except when on the fan is used at the highest setting, is nearly silent.

MistrRoboto,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2024","I like the idea of clean air in my house, and have been running multiple purifiers for years. All of my other units are Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty. They have been on for 5 straight years with filter changes and not a single issue.

For no good reason, I wanted to try something new with a higher sq/ft rating.

Ordered a BLUEAIR Blue Pure 211i Max and it made a weird sound right out of the box. Clicking, and the unit shook so something was out of whack. Instead of having it replaced, I returned and went with the Levoit.

As best as I can tell so far, its an excellent unit. Feels sturdy and high quality. Extremely quiet on auto mode, which runs lower than the low setting when the air is clean. Set to low, its still very quiet. High its loud, but not louder than my Coways, and the amount of air its passing is staggering.

I really like the idea of scenario specific filters, which I will try next. Levoit offers 600c filters specific to houses with pets, smokers, etc.",5.0 out of 5 stars
kvolaf,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2024","This air purifier is so amazingly quiet, you can just plug it in and forget it! I love the ring of lights on top of the purifier that lights up blue when the air quality is excellent, green for when the air quality is good, and red when the air quality is bad. There is also a digital readout of the particle count in the air, for those who want a more exact information.
I use the automatic setting so I can truly forget about it. When I was making brunch that included bacon, the ring of lights turned red and the air purifier automatically kicked into high gear. Then the air purifier automatically adjusted it's fan speed as the air particle count lowered. The amazing thing is the air purifier is on the other side of my house from my kitchen!
I purchased the air purifier because my husband was suffering from allergies. Given that the pollen count was currently low and mold count was high for the area we were living in and the time of year, we suspected that mold spores in the air might be the reason for his allergies. However, when the air purifier arrived and we set it up, it showed that the air quality in our house was good. Honestly, I don't know if this means that the air purifier didn't sense mold spores, or that we actually had no mold spores in our house. However, I am happy with the quality of the air purifier and how well it works for smoke from cooking and our wood burning stove. So we are keeping it.
One thing that prospective buyers may want to keep in mind is that the instruction states that the air purifier should have a clearance of 15"" on all sides. This means that you can't just put it against the wall, like I had originally intended. But I supposed this would be true for all air purifiers as air circulation is needed.",5.0 out of 5 stars

goldnboy,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023","I have purchased many different types/brands of air purifiers/filters, over the years. Ionizing types, non-HEPA and HEPA types with ‘auto’ settings to adjust for ‘smells’, ‘VOC’s, etc. They have each had things that I liked… and each has had something I did not like… until now.
I love the build quality, the design/look, the ‘noise’ level… wow! I mean, you ‘can’ crank it up to full… and you can definitely hear it… but what I noticed most is that, when you do that, you can ‘feel’ the air movement… and I’m talking about the ‘inward’ airflow movement… not just the ‘output’. It MOVES some air! It even seems to cool the room if you crank it up (not that that is a listed feature, but it really moves that much air).
When it is running normally (auto), I don’t hear it unless I’m sitting in silence and, even then it is not irritating… I just think, oh yeah, that’s running.
I’m not excited about replacing the filter. I never enjoy that cost. I have decided that, for the differences I have seen in ‘original’ vs. ‘knock-off’ filters, that I will spring for the originals… and I like that they haven’t tried some way to make the machine disable itself if you choose a ‘non-genuine’ option. I like them just for that!
The app has quite a number of functions/monitoring/notification settings. I like how it works.
I also bought a couple of the smaller 300 model series units and I like them very much, as well. If you have the funds, and especially if you are filtering a larger space, I would really recommend this 600 series unit.
I can/do definitely recommend this product. Other than maybe lifetime free filter replacements, there is very little I think would be an improvement… I’m so glad I found these! Thank you.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Michelle,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2023","I’ve had the core 600s for about a month. We have other, smaller levoit purifiers in our bedrooms but wanted something for a larger open living space. We live in a rental and it seems like mold is a big issue for many people in homes near us. It makes us paranoid, so anything we can do to help keep our air clean and safe is important to us! I compared this to online reviews of Air doctor and other more expensive units, and this one seems comparable at a much better price. This is a big unit, but the design is very clean and modern and it blends well with our furniture and decor. It is extremely quiet… you barely hear it on its low settings. At first I had an issue that some other reviewers were mentioning; it turns on and reads 005 and then within minutes goes to 001. I moved it around my house and was getting the same result. So that seemed suspicious to me… especially since I had turned off our other purifiers to run the experiment. So I sprayed aerosol hairspray into the room for a moment and watched the numbers. Within seconds it rose into the mid 30s and then steadily decreased as the purifier worked its magic. It seems that kicked our sensor into working order, and now it picks up little things here and there and I’ll see the numbers are not always at 001. Makes it feel like a much more accurate read.

Adrian,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2024","I bought this for a small 100ft2 bedroom, overkill, I know, but that is the point. The bigger the unit, the more efficient it is, so I can get away with using a lower fan speed. This is ideal since it is quieter and won't get dirty as quickly due to the lower speed; also, if I need to clean the air ASAP, this purifier can do it quickly. Although, it is a bit louder than the 400s. It also has the same variety of modes and settings to tinker with and the device is pretty easy on the eyes. The app used to control the device is also very well made, which I found a bit surprising since companion apps tend to be mediocre at best.

However, the air sensor is not the most reliable since it only detects the air in the immediate vicinity, but I knew this before purchasing it. For a more accurate air quality level, I suggest a separate air quality detector. The filters are also on the pricier side, but they supposedly last 6 months. After two weeks of use, mine is hardly dirty and I have a dog, a bird, as well as a steady flow of food odors.

Overall, I am satisfied with the performance, it leaves my room with the faint smell of a freshly cleaned hotel room. The purifier also does does not emit ozone, if that is a concern. It was for me due to my pets as well as general health concerns.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2024","I've had this purifier for a little less than a month and it works fabulously in a 600 square foot space with high ceilings. Early on I set it up in one part of the space, turned it on ""auto"" until it showed blue circles, then moved it to the furthest parts of the space and it still showed blue.

My main complaint--which is a big deal considering this is an investment--is that under a month in the dust particle sensor stopped working. The unit was running all day and showing red/high particle counts at the end. I followed the manual instructions and vacuum cleaned the outside entry to the particle sensor but no dice. Today I took apart the entire unit with a screw driver, found the particle sensor and blew into it really hard. It seems to have done the trick and the ""auto"" function is working as it should now, fingers crossed. But it's still really frustrating to have a key component stop working after so little use, and is especially so given that Levoit has not provided an easy way of accessing the sensor to clean it. Other companies have little doors on their purifiers that you can open to clean the sensor lens with a q-tip.

Tom Tomato,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2024","I purchased two Levoit Core 300s and one Core 400s in 2021 and 2022. At the time, they were marketed as ""True HEPA"". I have been very satisfied with these air purifiers and considered these to be 5 star products. However, I am leaving a 1 star review because I am now unclear as to whether I can trust these products.

As I researched the purchase of one more Levoit air purifier, I came across many articles discussing how after a challenge from Dyson in 2023, Levoit removed the “True HEPA filter” labels on three air purifier models. I wrote Levoit asking if the 300S and 400S that I purchased were or were not HEPA filters. I received this reply from Levoit:

""Thank you for your inquiry. The Core 300S and Core 400S filters were tested as manufactured to meet HEPA standard, IEST RP CC001.6 Class H, tested per IEST RP CC007.3. We stand by the quality and effectiveness of our products. Levoit is simply making changes to some of its advertising, which it does in the ordinary course of business from time to time. I do not have any further information regarding these changes at the moment.""

After a bit more research, I followed up asking Levoit if the older CC001.6 standard from 2016 still means that the original and smoke remover filters can be considered to be HEPA filters, given there is a newer and current CC001.7 standard. I received the following reply.

""Thank you for your reply. The Original and Smoke Remover filters both were tested as manufactured to meet HEPA standard, IEST RP CC001.6 Class H, tested per IEST RP CC007.3. This is all the information I am able to provide at this time. I appreciate your understanding! ""

So, after the challenge from Dyson, Levoit stopped marketing their air filers as ""True HEPA."" Levoit also does not seem to be in a position to respond in a clear and transparent way to direct consumer inquiries about whether their products are HEPA filters.

Bottom Line: I purchased a new Medify air purifier instead of another Levoit because Medify clearly states it uses True HEPA H13 and H14 filters. I am not sure what to do about the $500 worth of Levoit Air Purifiers I already own. Possibly they are ok to use as HEPA filters, but maybe not? Maybe just keep the air purifiers in the closet until Levoit comes out with filters that actually say they are ""HEPA"" - which is not the case right now? Unfortunately, the biggest outcome of Dyson's challenge seems to be that consumers who previously purchased Levoit products are the ones who are screwed because we have no clear information.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Karen S,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024","Do NOT buy this air purifier or any other product from this company. When you get your purifier, you have to submit all kinds of info including product ID, Model #, Serial #, invoice #, where you purchased the product, your name, address, phone number, etc..

Then Levoit issues a Warranty Number. Sounds good.....right? Wrong! When the unit fails after 6 months they ask you for all of the information again plus a ""short video of the problem"" so they can ""review it.""

Then they also want to know if the unit is ""sitting on carpet"" as this can cause the unit to ""freak out"" or words to that effect....

From Levoit:

""Try running the unit without the filters. Please let us know if the noise persists.
- Ensure the unit is placed on a hard and flat, level surface. If it is tilted or placed on anything soft (such as carpet), it may not run properly.

- Carefully check to see if anything has fallen into the fan.

We hope this helps! If you have any other questions, kindly provide a short video and your order invoice or receipt for our team to review""
_______________________________________________________________________________

They have all my info and I have a ""Warranty Number"", but no.... now they want a video of the ""problem"" so they can review it after I answered 10,000 questions.

I'll tell you what the problem was ...the unit shuts itself off, and makes a humming sound until I unplug the Core 600s. When I plug it back in, the humming starts again. Simple....It's not working, and now I have to send them a video of the ""Humming"" noise coming from the unit when I plug it in.

I also purchased a Vital-100 from Levoit, and it died on me after 28 days forcing me to RMA that unit back to Amazon (thank you Amazon) now the new Core 600s is ""broke"" after 6 months, and all I get from Levoit is ""Can you send ____________"" (Fill in the blank)

I told Levoit that I was going to file a complaint with the State Attorney Generals Office- Business Division and then they agreed to replace my unit. They said ""Please cut the power cord and send a picture"", and I did (Item number 10,001).

Oh...yeah... I got my ""new"" Core 600s, and it malfunctioned after 60 days of part time service. The LED panel went dark. Permanently.

Kevin,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023","I was excited to upgrade my air purification game with the LEVOIT Air Purifier for Home Large Room, boasting its ability to handle up to 1980 square feet and equipped with smart WiFi technology. However, my enthusiasm quickly turned to frustration and regret after experiencing the lackluster performance of the LEVOIT Core 400S.

First off, the air quality monitor was about as accurate as a broken compass. It claimed to provide real-time insights into my indoor air quality, but it seemed more like a random number generator than a reliable indicator. At times, it would flash green while I could practically see a haze of dust particles floating in the air. It's safe to say that this so-called ""smart"" feature left me scratching my head in disbelief.

Auto mode? More like ""no mode."" The promise of the purifier intelligently adjusting its settings based on detected pollutants was nothing more than smoke and mirrors. It consistently failed to respond adequately to changes in air quality, leaving me to wonder if it was on vacation mode instead.

As for the HEPA filter's prowess in capturing pet allergies, smoke, dust, and pollen, I'm still waiting for those superpowers to manifest. My sneezes and the lingering scent of smoke were persistent reminders of the Core 400S's inability to live up to its claims. I felt like I had been sold a ticket to a grand show, only to find out that the curtains never opened.

Let's talk about the WiFi feature. Oh, the WiFi feature! I had visions of adjusting settings from my phone, monitoring air quality remotely, and feeling like a tech-savvy purifier owner. Instead, I was met with connectivity issues that rivaled a spotty satellite connection from the '90s. It was more frustrating than trying to decipher a toddler's finger-painting.

In conclusion, the LEVOIT Air Purifier for Home Large Room Core 400S turned out to be a series of disappointments packaged in sleek white casing. From unreliable air quality monitoring to lackluster performance in purifying the air, this purifier left me wondering where all the promised benefits had disappeared to. If you're in the market for an air purifier that lives up to its claims, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere. The Core 400S failed to meet even the most basic expectations, leaving me feeling like I invested in nothing more than an overpriced air circulator.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Java1924,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2023","I recently purchased 8 (EIGHT) Levoit air purifiers for my 2700 sq ft open floor plan home. (The screenshot photo could only fit 6 of the 8) According to Levoit specifications, I should be able to clean a total of almost 11k sq feet PER HOUR using the units I purchased.

But for units that supposedly take dust and odors out of the air, they COULD NOT BE A BIGGER FAIL! The photo of the cloth shows the amount of dust from my dining room table just 24 hours after I dusted it. It has a 200s about 15” away AND a 400s within 12 feet in an open area living/dining are that total under 800sq feet combined. At first, I had the units on auto, but when it was clear that didn’t work because they weren't turning on, I manually turned them all the way up. However, short of becoming extremely loud, nothing changed. Also fried some bacon and that smell, despite having a 600S 12 feet from my stove, stayed in the house for at least 3 hours. According to Levoit- 💯 of the air in my entire house should have been changed 3 times over in that period of time!

I attempted to contact support via phone since, no matter where I put them, or what I do, the units that have the air quality display feature do not go above 12. - notice in the photo that regardless of all the dust, the purifier shows air quality at an “excellent” rating of 5- no matter where they are (including inside the dirty garage or if I have 1 of my 3 German shepherds shake right next to them) but they apparently do not take calls. I sent an email and got an auto reply with a case number - that was 3 days ago, and I have heard nothing since.

So in summary, spent more than $1100 on product that should clean air in a space more than 3x the size of mine, product does nothing, no one answers the phone, email support seems to be is non existent, air in house as dirty as ever!

Save yourself the trouble and BUY A DIFFERENT BRAND!",1.0 out of 5 stars
mroo,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2023","This is an update to what I wrote before. I decided to send the Levoit unit back. I gave it a good length of time and I am not satisfied with the removal of dust (I am very allergic). I see a lot of disparaging remarks about Honeywell air cleaners online, that they are cheeep. I have a 3300B, which only Home Depot and 1 other online store sells. It's not cheaper than most of the stuff everybody says they like. It costs more than the Levoit or Blue Air, too. Don't care what they say, it beat the Levoit to bits when it came to dust removal and it has a lower CADR. Why do so many rave about Levoit?
My search will continue. I still need another air cleaner but the 3300B is kind of heavy to move around and I want something that gets the microdust, when my landlord decides to renovate an apartment and doesn't tell anybody.

1 of the deciding factors in getting this over a few other large room air cleaners was that it had the ionizing feature. I've had small ionizers off and on for many years and they work. They do wear out after a while so I thought it would be good to have it in 1 item. When I did specific Amazon and Google searches for the 600S with plasma, THIS came up. I bought it, with the Black Friday deal and thought I did well. When I took it out of the box to use it, NO IONIZER. I thought I got something faulty. The 1 that has it is more elusive and they don't sell it on Amazon. I was and still am angry. I'm not sure if I'll send this back yet or not.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Proudvet,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2022","If you are thinking of buying this supposed air purifier to clean the air in your house ,think again. This is the worst piece of garbage impersonating an air purifier. Now if you want something with pretty lights and an app that you can use to impress your techie friends but not as a purifier this is your new TOY. And TOY is all it is. Where these favorable reviews came from is pretty suspicious . I have several Purifiers at my house due to allergies , 3 5500-2 Winnex ,and a IQair healthpro plus. That is what is here now I have had others through the years. I do know what works , this Levoit thing is about as worthless as ----- you fill in the blanks . The app is also a confusing joke . I know what apps work and don't work .I use many ,from outdoor cooking controllers for smokers ,Alexa since its inception to house alarm system and thermostats . If you made the mistake of buying this ripoff and did not send it back, try spraying something around it that it is supposed to sense . Try a nasty cleaner that you might use put it on a paper towel put it next to sensor and see how nothing changes on unit. As far as smoke goes your house would have to burn down around it for this toy to detect smoke. If you want colored lights and something to install on your phone this is your purifier . If you are looking for clean air in your home look elsewhere because you will not find it at levoit. Oh buy the way don't bother trying to call Levoit you will get a message saying they are too busy to answer phones,probably all the people calling about their crap products ,and the y tell you to use Email and you will hear from them in a couple of days. And just to add insult to injury they also say to stay on phone and you can leave a voice message ,funny thing is right after that message the phone hangs up . Kinda says something ,don't it.",1.0 out of 5 stars

They have a 2 yr warranty but refuse to honor it because now its working. Question would you leave it running if your not home, kind a defeats the purpose of having one.

ckd,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2024","We initially LOVED these air purifiers. I have two-both purchased in April. They worked great for two months. Then the humidity in the house reached 60 percent one day, so I stopped using them (because the information stated they don’t perform well in humid environments). I restarted them after a couple of days, once the humidity dropped. They now stink like gross sour plastic-very unhealthy smelling. We vacuumed the filters and blew them out with a compressor, even though maintenance was not indicated by the machine. On further inspection, we realized that the filters don’t smell-the motorized areas at the top of both machines do.

I would expect a device to perform better than this. A complete waste of 190 dollars each. When you call the company, you are asked to send an email because of the volume of customer service calls they receive. I will see how they respond to my complaint.

Jay and Amy,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2024","I wish I could give this product an actual review but unfortunately I can't.

I opened the box, unpacked everything and then started the setup per the provided instructions. Minutes after I had the entire setup complete, it shut off and won't turn back on. I checked multiple outlets and still nothing.

The instructions tell you that if the unit won't turn on, check the outlet and so on. If it still doesn't work, you should contact them via phone or email. This was a Friday night and I was getting ready to leave so I just emailed them so I didn't have to spend hours with them on customer service redoing everything I had already done.

I got a response on Monday asking me for a video of the problem, a pdf of my receipt, and a picture of the model tag. I did everything they asked for and sent it back to them Tuesday morning. After receiving no response to my email, I tried calling customer service only to get an automated message saying that they are not accepting calls and that I should email them if I have an issue.

I purchased the unit because of it popularity and high rating and I am willing to let them fix the issue. I understand that every product out there eventually has a defective batch but 2 days without a reply is just ridiculous.",1.0 out of 5 stars
reesah mouse,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2023","When I ordered this at the beginning of October, the ads on this site stated these used True HEPA filters and the replacement filters were also advertised as True HEPA. When I came back to order replacement filters, I see they are no longer advertised as True Hepa or even HEPA. Then I noticed that phrase has been removed from the product pages, too. I feel that this was a bait and switch as it’s now too late to return it.

It does work well for odors. I brought it along to an Air BNB that turned out to have a pretty bad musty odor, and this worked well to eliminate that, but I couldn’t be sure it was eliminating the allergens or that it’s useful against virus particles or how well it works against PM 2.5s and VOCs, even though the filters seem to have similar specs to a True HEPA.

I’d like to know why the change in advertising. It’s very upsetting as I bought two of these, one in this size and one in a smaller size. I read all the product pages over and over and over again while trying to make a decision, comparing these with other brands and other styles. I agonized over which brand to buy and didn’t even consider this brand until I saw they were advertising it as coming with True HEPA filters. Because of this, I’d never buy this brand again.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Andrew Sandstrom,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","My air purifier arrived today, and I was very excited and impressed! ...until the disgusting smell began. Just hours after turning it on, it started distinctly emitting a nasty wet dog type smell. I tried letting it run for awhile to see if it would stop, but the smell is just getting worse. The air in my home has been blue or green, except for when I was cooking. I don't think cooking one basic meal (just tacos) should knock out an air filter that is supposed to last 6-12 months. I also didn't have the air purifier close to the kitchen, it was in the next room. It has not gotten wet, we've followed all of the instructions. I've since found a Reddit thread where many users are having an issue with the smell from their Levoit filters. One commenter even said her VOC meter goes way up when she turns on her air purifier. I will be returning this. It's disappointing, because I was enjoying the quiet fan and the air quality readings. I was also looking forward to the health benefits for my family. Super disappointing.",1.0 out of 5 stars
catie,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2024","I bought this and LOVED it. It automatically kicked up the fan when it detected cooking odors. I could remotely control to run higher before we came home so everything was fresh. Then it freaked out one night, ran til air was clean and then the air quality sensor suddenly jumped to very poor quality and it ran on high for over an hour with no improvement of air quality on the sensor. There were no environmental changes to have prompted the poor air readings in the first place. After running on high for over an hour, the purifier started to emit a weird smell. Kind of like a smoky plastic… maybe electrical smell. Hard to describe but definitely not pleasant. I run it in my garage like suggested when I tried to research some trouble shooting. It did not help. I cleaned off the filter. The smell was there only when it was running. I returned the purifier.

Bullwinkle495,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2024","***Update! Now the second one is buzzing loudly. This was right after I vacuumed the filter and casing also .These things are crap! To the garbage heap. What a waste of money!

Within a month of purchasing one, it started buzzing, even when I turned it off. I had to unplug it to stop.
I had maintained them and treated them well (I bought another one month before), but every time I turned it on, an annoying loud buzzing came from within. I tried vacuuming around where the buzzing occurred. It was past the return window, so they make you talk to the manufacturer, and when I did, it was a long, circuitous conversation on possible troubleshooting, and I did not want to deal with all that. Not even a 90-day return warranty on an obvious problem? I threw it in the garbage. I still have the other one. They have a special ""pet filter"" but it looks exactly the same as the standard filter, but is slightly yellow. Not sure if it's helping me with the cat dander.

Tswift,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2022","I bought a Levoit Core 600s a few months ago when it first came out and that unit has worked great. Nothing but positive things to say about it: functions quiet, purifies well, filter lasts a long time, no issues at all really.

Now when I wanted to get a 2nd one for a different room, I ordered it and it arrived new/sealed with a noticeable clicking noise that other people mentioned and another reviewer made a video of. I submitted it for replacement and sent it back to Amazon, and received another new/sealed Core 600s. Lo and behold, this one has the exact same issue. Tried to do another replacement myself and the app/site wouldn’t let me, called customer service and they processed another replacement eventually. Sent the 2nd one back and got the 3rd one also brand new and factory sealed. Guess what? It has the same issue.

Obviously this can’t be just bad luck with some rare defective units, this is obviously the sign of a bad batch and I highly recommend holding off on purchasing one of these until it is resolved. I even contacted Levoit to ask them if I purchased one directly through them if they could pre-test it for me and received a completely irrelevant response. So just know if you do decide to purchase one of these (which is an amazing product when you don’t have a defective one), you’re really going to be playing defect roulette with it, at least with the current batch that Amazon is shipping to customers.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Inner Child,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2022","I was disappointed in the auto feature. It is based on the air quality sensor which said my air was perfect straight out of the box. If it thinks the air is fine, auto mode will run the fan lower even than the lowest fan speed (so its doing nothing). For kicks I plugged in the device outside and amazingly it still had perfect air. Additionally, the unit needs clearance for air around it on all sides. This wasn't obvious to me from the listing. I contacted their support to see what kind of a company this was. They never would admit the device sounded faulty (air sensor) and thought it was perfectly fine to buy a $300 device that idled down and never did anything. The reps I spoke with even when cornered logically would still never say I should return it or that it needed fixing. Because of that, I would definitely not do business with this brand at all.

Now possibly my unit was defective, but I chose not to set up the WIFI features as I wasn't sure I was going to keep it. Coincidentally, my router crashed 4 times in the 5 days I had it running. I had to unplug and reset the router each time. It has been a month since I returned it and my router hasn't crashed once. So, either the device is very spammy until you configure it or it had malware in it attempting to attack available routers.",1.0 out of 5 stars

However, after two months it has stopped working. It never reads above ""5"" anymore indicating my air quality is good even when my apartment reeks of smoke. I tried cleaning the air purifier, filter and detecting port according to the user manual and it didn't help. I lit a candle and blew it out right in front of the detection port so it had candle smoke right in front of it and it barely registered it.

Julius J,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2022","I want to love the 400s. It’s sleek looking, the app is great, the features are great, but it has an overpowering smell of plastic coming out of the top. The filter smells great and the plastic on the bottom is good, but smelling the top of the unit I get a distinct burned plastic smell. When the unit is on that smell fills the hole room. To be fair my girlfriend says she just barely smells it, but to me it’s overpowering and gives me a bit of a headache. I have an old winix air purifier that smells great when it’s on, but has no features and the light on it keeps me up at night. I wanted to get a smart air filter as an upgrade… I’m running it in my living room now to see if the smell goes away with time. I’ll update the review if it does.

Edit: The smell never went away though it did get somewhat better, say ~30% less smell after two weeks.

So I emailed the company and asked since I now have 3 of these units if they’d be willing to simply mail me a replacement filter. They took 5 days to write back and then told me that they would not send me a replacement filter and it was Amazon’s problem.

So I returned all of the units since they were within the return period. The company chose to get nearly $700 in units returned to them instead of just sending me a replacement filter and appreciating their customers.

I went with Germ Guardian systems. Much better customer service, and even more reviews than these units. Will not purchase from Levoit again.

Rapze,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2022","purchased this product back in September 2021, and worked really well up until last week when the fan died on the device, so as I had registered the warranty after purchase, I figured this would be an easy process for a claim, no had to jump through so many hoops to get this claim off the ground, even though I had proof of warranty, I had to provide a video of the malfunction, a picture of the product sticker, which the certificate of warranty from the Levoit App had all this information contained already ... and furthermore also had to produce the invoice from Amazon which the Amazon order number is on the certificate of warranty. Nice try at your piss poor attempt to dodge a warranty claim, I also have 2 smaller ones that we have bought to combat allergens in my home. Other than that, the device worked perfectly until it crapped out less than a year into ownership.

Update: I have done all that was requested of me and I have yet to receive a response from Levoit regarding my warranty claim mind you I have not had this a year yet.",1.0 out of 5 stars

As soon as I tap for the update, the unit shuts itself off with and error message comes up stating update failed. The same procedure with the 400 model worked flawlessly. So possibly a defective unit. The most frustrating part is Levoit offers an 888 number for customer assitance but is currently not taking calls only leaving an email or voicemail option.

Then, less than a week later, it just stopped working. It powered itself off, so I turned it back on. It turned on for a few seconds and immediately shut down. Thinking maybe the filter was clogged, I checked and it was pristine white. Not so much as even on dust particle or dog hair on it or in the unit. I checked the cord, the outlet, all were in working order. Tried turning it on again, stayed on for a few seconds, then immediately shut itself off.

It is supposed to automatically adjust the fan base on the air quality, however, it has failed in this area. When you set to (A) for Automatic, it will never adjust the fan speed beyond low, despite the air quality indicator increasing beyond 10s or 20s. I have another unit from a different manufacturer and that unit will also detect when air quality condition changes, it will automatically increase the speed of the fan or lower the fan as needed.

For example, when someone is cooking something that generate flavor/smell/something, the air quality indicator will go from 1 to 15, but the fan will remain low. I can switch to manual fan from 1, 2, 3, 4 and it will work to clean up the air as expected.",1.0 out of 5 stars

I won't write about my experience, the previous reviewer says it all. It does nothing even for minor odors, such as a musty small closet or room. The only reason I tried this was because of the misleading picture stating ""more carbon"". The picture shows a cheap useless black foam pad used in most of these junk purifiers, which are useless. Next to this picture is a pic of carbon pellets, which Levoit claims they use. Well don't expect carbon pellets, just another black foam filter that does nothing at all for any odors or VOC's. In my opinion this is false, misleading advertising, which is unacceptable. I should've realized by the price this would not live up to it's claim of trapping and neutralizing odors.

I guess I'm planting trees and living in an oasis of purified air while running this pos.

Claims to remove odors while cooking. Yeah ok.
What it actually does is suck in the odor from what you're cooking, traps them in the filter, then pumps that stale stench out through the top fan.

In addition to that ass experience, now the device has a clicking noise in the fan.

Avoid.

You'd be better off buying a $20 fan and placing it your window.
At least that $20 fan doesn't have a spammy app.

But after only two months of using it exclusively at night - several weeks of which I was out of town and it wasn’t being used at all - it’s developed a high-pitched whining that sure sounds like a bearing failing.

zarxs,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024","I bought two, they operated the exact same way. All the features worked and the Alexa integration was great. I have two Alexa Air quality meters that give the same readings. They will give a rating between 0 and 99. 99 is the highest air quality. I've owned purifiers that could get to 98-99 in the down stairs (owned two filters). I had to replace them both so I have tried several in an attempt to replace them since I could no longer get filters for the old ones. The Honeywell HPA5300b's could get the numbers to 95-98 but out of 6 I purchase I had to return 4 due to noise issues. So i used the honeywells upstairs. So I bought the Levoit 600s for downstairs. I loved the levoits on paper. But at night they sensor read 83 before bed so I thought, I'll just turn it up to Turbo mode so the air is clean in the morning. I woke up and the air quality had dropped to 80. They did a better job cleaning at medium than they did on Turbo. That tells me that they didn't size the filter correctly and I've read countless comments online that they are not HEPA filters which could explain alot. In order to get the air movement they are claiming (and they do blow hard if you put them to turbo), the filters would have to be huge or very porous. When it comes down to it, I returned both of the ones I bought. I went on to buy Coway Airmega 400s. The Airmegas actually clean the air. They got to 96 on high run over night, but their app sucks, in the end the Airmegas work with Alex. So thats good enough for me.

Smallcapceo,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2024","Ok… we confess we bought this and a smaller version out of desperation due to a dead animal smell. We even bought the VOC absorber filters as well. We were convinced due to a recent rat sighting on our cameras that a rat had either died inside our attic or nearby. After calling an exterminator. We found the beast in a wire duct outside, but the duct leads to our air handler inside. It had only been three days in Florida heat before the smell was unbearable. We installed these air purifiers and I can say without hesitation they did nothing to suck up or abate the smell. We have since moved the purifiers into a more logical area and they are oversized for our needs. After a full two days of running we can tell you that they do not kill dead animal smell. These might be fine machines for other airborne pollutants or pet smells, but we don’t have an animal so we can’t comment on that.

Debra Rivera,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","We purchased this air purifier for a bedroom back in February of this year. It worked fine or so we thought. About a month after plugging it in, the entire upstairs of our home smelled like a locker room. It was awful! We couldn't figure out why until I happened to be cleaning and found the odor came from the purifier. It was horrific! We thought it was the filter, so we paid $50 and ordered a new one directly from the vendor. It did not solve the problem. We did some research and found that there were numerous customers that experienced a smell issue and were unable to receive any satisfaction from the company. We contacted Levoit support via telephone and received a message asking for an email. We did as they asked and sent a detailed email early April. The response we received said a representative would reach out to us in two business days. No response received. We emailed again on April 24th and still no response. We cannot use the air purifier and there doesn't seem to be any recourse. We have tried calling the company multiple times. Those of you that have a working unit are lucky that you do not have to try to communicate with this company.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2024","I suffer from severe allergies so I was hoping this would help eliminate dust particles in the house. My home is just over 1000 sq ft, I set the purifier in a central location. I don't have pets and there is no indoor smoking. I bought it in March and wanted to give it a chance to do the job. My allergic reactions didn't improve. I ran it on auto-fan, but it didn't seem to automatically adjust to remove odors or increase to remove dust or pollens. I am a clean freak but the dust here is relentless. I dusted all surfaces today, vaccumed the whole house, and still had a film of dust on glass surfaces within a few hours. The auto-fan is worthless. Even when I know there is more pollen and dust in the air, the fan never responds accordingly. So, now I have to manually increase the fan speed in hopes that it will work as intended. When the fan is at higher speeds it is really noisy. So, long story short, I am not happy with it's performance. If it worked as described, I would expect my indoor allergies to improve. Now that the return window has passed, I guess I'm stuck with it.

yobuck,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2023","Linking the 600s was an effort in donating time to the frustration gods. You'll find this be a common issue with many websites providing solutions to the linking issue. Leviot also provided the same solution and it doesn't work. Levoit support implies that your router is the problem, it's not, but wants you to basically go through troubleshooting steps for your router, not the 600s.

If you like the 600s & are having connectivity issues there is a solution that works. After troubleshooting your router fails, Levoit suggests to connect the 600s through your phone's hotspot. The 600s connected no problem via the hotspot and it immediately suggested a firmware update for the 600s. After the firmware update the 600s disconnected from the hotspot and would not reconnect. I had to reconnect through the routers wifi and it linked without a hitch. So the problem is some 600s have old firmware and will not link, it's not your router. Unfortunately, I did not write down the firmware # prior to updating.

The 600s emits a clicking noise that's different than just a fan blowing air. It's not very loud, but a fan emitting sounds other than moving air will eventually get worse because friction will wear it down and you'll be past your warranty.

I have also started to notice a different smell after a couple weeks of use. The 600s has a carbon filter, so what gives?

After a week of being linked to the Levoit cloud I received an email from Levoit support saying the troubleshooting must have worked since they can see that the 600s is linked to their cloud server. That got me thinking, why does an air purifier need to connected to their cloud???",2.0 out of 5 stars

Chaz,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023","We have a dog, two kids and dust seems to cover things a little too frequently. This purifier had amazing ratings, so I figured purchasing it was a no-brainer. I was suspicious at first start-up with such a low number, showing very good air quality, when the actual air quality outside isn't great today and you can see particles inside the house through the sunlight. I burnt some incense to see what was going on. On manual mode the light went red. On auto mode, the number dropped back to very good... I changed the position of the incense to see if it made a difference. This purifier is suppose to work a decent square footage, so it shouldn't really matter, right? Wrong. If the incense was held near the top of the purifier, it barely read on the display. I literally had to hold it near the bottom for the purifier to do its job...and remember, that only worked on manual mode. Auto mode seems to be non-existent. For the money, I would at least expect this machine to function as expected. I'll leave it running to see if there's any improvement or other misfunctions, as the return period is 30 days...but regardless, it's going back. As I'm writing this the air quality number jumped from 5 to 300 back to 69...and now is around 50. The incense stopped burning 5 minutes ago.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Ingot Marker,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2022","This air purifier looks awesome, it works great, it's affordable, it's easy to set up, it has a small footprint, it's lightweight, it uses very little electricity, its interface is great, the particle sensor and display are great, the cost of replacement filters is very reasonable, and it can be monitored and controlled via apps (which is fun, albeit pretty useless).

So why 2 stars instead of 5? Because of fan bearing noise. When the fan is set to a lower speed (sleep or 1) then the sound of the fan bearings is clearly audible. It's quiet but annoying. It's like an inconsistent squeaking sound but much lower pitch, around 500 hertz. It's clearly audible in a quiet room from 10+ feet away. Good luck trying to sleep, or watch a movie at night, without being distracted by this air purifier.

I bought three Levoit air purifiers to purify the air in my entire home (this Core 400S and two Core 300s) and they all make this fan bearing noise. So there seems to be a problem with the design or the manufacturing of these devices, rather a unit or two being defective.

It's a shame that the web sites that review air purifiers only measure the amount of noise coming from a purifier, and not the character of the noise. I would much prefer an air purifier that was somewhat louder but didn't make this ""squeaking"" noise.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Maurisun,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2021","This Core 400s air purifier looks good, and probably accomplishes its basic functions, BUT it is incredibly loud in comparison to all of my other purifiers, and it is not just a fan sound, there is a sort of mechanical hissing sound coming from the machine, I thought maybe I got unlucky so I ordered another one, and it had the same exact issue. I like a little white noise in the bedroom at night, but the sound this machine makes is not nice. I have a unit rated for 1500 sq. ft. and even that one is quitter on all comparable settings. The smart features are pretty cool, and it was super easy to set up, BUT when I set the machine on auto, it stays on the lowest setting, regardless of the air quality. I lit a candle and an incent to test this, the PM2.5 levels shot up to the 70s yet the machine stayed on low, meanwhile all my other machines in the house ramped up the fans to compensate.
In the end, the machine looks nice, the app works great, I love the portability, but I paid extra for a quite machine and the auto features, and both of those have massively let me down, so I will be returning this machine and cannot recommend at this time.

Maybe my unit is just wonky or got knocked around too much during shipping but there's a distinct whir to the fan that is not present in the Core 200S, 300, or 600S models I have. I'm no sound engineer but I downloaded a NIOSH decibel app and turning this 400S on to Sleep mode or Speed 1 consistently knocked the decibel reading 1/1.5dB above what the 600S reads at the same fan speeds. The difference is honestly negligible but that's definitely contra the manufacturer specs. The whole reason I opted for the smaller unit for the bedroom was for lower noise levels at night -- so if I can get a higher CADR at a quieter level, without that annoying whir, I'll opt for another 600S.",2.0 out of 5 stars

The purifier eventually started making a loud groaning sound that would constantly migrate up and down in pitch, and occasionally fluctuate. It started doing this towards the end of the 2-year warranty period. I eventually opened it up and found that the sound was coming from the air sampler mounted to the side of the top. I'm guessing the bearings went bad in the tiny fan for the sampler (since the sampler runs 24/7, regardless of whether the purifier is running), because it makes a buzzing noise when it's sitting by itself. Once it's mounted into the casing, that's when the buzz turns into the groaning sound.
To fix this, you can just remove the sensor module. There's a connector on the side of the sensor that you can just disconnect. The unit runs fine without it, though it will no longer display the current air quality. Also, auto mode obviously doesn't work. If you try to put it in auto, it lights up just the third LED above the speed indicator, which I'm guessing is some diagnostic code for the factory. It doesn't look like the sensor is available for individual purchase, so the purifier will never be fully functional again.
Having taken this apart, and even ignoring the sensor failing, I can say without a doubt that this should NOT cost $300. There is very little to it, and they're definitely overcharging their customers. It's well-built in general, but probably costs them a fraction of that price to make. They also gouge on the replacement filters. The filters should cost $10, $20 MAX. Not the absurd $60 they charge. Just take an air hose and blow out the filter from the inside. Just make sure you do it outside, far from any windows or doors, because the filter holds a LOT of dust.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on July 17, 2024","This is designed for 83m^2, my room is 18m^2. It was supposed to be overkill. It's not.

- When I first turned it on, the quality of air was 004, while on auto mode in a closed environment, it will randomly cycle between 002-004 (basically reaching the air quality of not even having it). I live alone, no pets, sit stationary at my pc most of the day. Why doesn't the number drop in a room a quarter of the recommended size? Random number generator much?
- The air doesn't smell ""fresh"". In fact, when I leave the room in the morning and come back into it a minute later, the room smells like chemicals.
- The HEPA label is misleading, They use an outdated standard and got in trouble last year for using the label True HEPA, which this is not. Found out after buying it.
- It's not quiet, not even on the slow night mode. You don't just hear a consistent sound of air coming out, you hear the motor which has an annoying .!.!.!.! pattern, which you actually notice.

N. Bajza,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2024","I liked the auto feature if air quality dropped eg it would kick into high if there were strong cooking odors. I liked everything about it mechanically. I have had 3 different levoit air purifiers and I them awkward to clean the pre filter. First I found it annoying to have to flip them upside down to remove the filter.
Second, The filters are circular, and I found it awkward to vacuum them. I would have to rotate the filter as I vacuumed. With these two roadblocks I didn’t vacuum the pre-filter often enough because it was a pain to do. I only discovered that this was a factor when I had to clean the air purifier at work. It’s a rectangular shape and you just pull the front off and remove a flat filter easy to remove and easy to vacuum. I could even leave it in place and vacuum it if I wanted to. This motivates me to vacuum the pre-filter as often as once a week.

When I discovered the rectangular air purifier at work, I started researching the rectangular shape. In my research, I found there is a rating called CADR or clean air delivery rate. This rating is more accurate, and I found a different brand that had a higher CADR was rectangular shaped easy to remove the filter and cheaper. So I suggest do a lot of research and decide what shape works for you. With the rectangular flat ones, you can put them against the wall. I found that the white color and the round shape of the levoit made the air purifier stand out a lot more. My new air purifier Is simple effective discreet and doesn’t cost as much. Levoit makes a rectangular unit in darker colors, but the whole brand cost a little more for about the same performance if not less. Make sure you look for the CDR rating and not just the square footage there’s a difference
Another thing to really pay attention to is the number of reviews the unit I ended up purchasing had over 30,000 reviews.

Alex,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2024",I really wanted to like this air purifier and I’m sure it does a great job but unfortunately it is too loud for me even at the lowest and sleep settings. The unit produces a grinding metal ball bearing whirring noise that is just too much to have in the bedroom as it has woken me up and prevented me from going back to sleep. I have 2 units and the same noise was heard on both. On the plus side all lights on the unit can be turned off so it can be kept in a dark bedroom.

Lina,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2024","I purchased this air purifier after extensive research and customer reviews but here's the thing ...it only reacts to the smoke and will not catch anything else in the air. I also happen to have winnix that catches most of what levoit doesn't but not so much the smoke. If you combine the two you will get an almost perfect product!
In reality levoit shows number 1 (meaning good quality air) 99% of the time which means the air is always clean in my Brooklyn apartment where it cannot be that clean by definition. I clean the unit regularly and always set it up correctly but this is not the product for you if you want it to protect your house from harmful smells... formaldehydes and the like.
I guess I will stick with winnix which reacts to most smells even perfume..at least I know it works",3.0 out of 5 stars
steambc,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2023","I REALLY wanted to like this purifier. The overall design is excellent in terms of taking in air and filtering it. However, the filter smells bad, sort of ""industrial"". It actually makes the room smell like the filter. I also have a Levoit 600S and the filter does not smell bad on that one.

The air sensor really doesn't work. It barely indicates bad air even when there is smoke. My 600S detects odors much better. Neither of them appreciably increase the fan speed when odors are detected. I think the sensor is more of a marketing thing than a useful function.

The other thing about this machine is that the fan motor makes a constant chirping or whistling sound. Many people have commented on this. It's enough to be very annoying. This is not intermittent. Rather, it is a steady sound that does not fluctuate. It is always there.

The integration with the app is very good. No issues.

Overall, I really thought this air purifier was going to be great, but I was disappointed. The sensor can't be taken seriously, the filter spells weird and the constant chirping is maddening, although I'm sure there are some people who wouldn't mind it. I can't recommend this unit.",3.0 out of 5 stars

D. Lewis,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2023","I’m really not impressed by this air purifier.

This filter does nothing for odors, be they from a dog or cooking or the kitchen garbage. Absolutely no change. It might be helping with removing dust and allergens from the air, although I’m somewhat dubious. At least the filter was dirty when I changed it, so I guess it’s doing something.

On the note of filters - they’re very expensive. I got the pet/odor one, thinking that would help with the dog smell (for the record, I only have 1 small dog who doesn’t shed!) but I’ve been disappointed.

Viviana's Mommy,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2022","I really wanted to like this model. I love the Smart features on the app for this model, but the Leviot 300 was much better. I never owned an air purifier before, but I bought that particular model when I had COVID and quickly realized my allergies also disappeared when using it. So, I moved the 300 to a smaller room for my mom to use while visiting and bought this larger smarter model thinking it would be even better for my master bedroom due to the square footage. The app says it is running well and all is good, but my allergies came back immediately after moving the 300 to the other room. So, unfortunate I have to say I like the Leviot 300 much much better. I would buy another one for my 3rd small room. The 300 does not have Smart features which is the only drawback for me, but it is very simple to use. I kind of want to return this model this the reason for 3 stars. Sorry-at twice the cost it should be much better and my allergies should still be fine when run at the same speeds and times! I have to run it all day, the 300 I only ran at night and worked beautifully!

If you are concerned about noise it doesn’t bother me. But, I love white noise and have some hearing issues. It really has the same noise level as the 300.

Sleep mode is great and the same on either machine.

Doug Pixler,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2023","I have had the 400s for about 7 weeks now. It does a nice job of getting rid of cooking smells and smoke from the kitchen. I like the handles that are on the sides and the easy to use touchscreen controls.

It is very unlikely that my filter cartridge will last 8 months. According to the filter life readout, it has 67% of its life left. The price of one filter is $49.99. I do not trust the after market filters that are available. Too many negative reviews on them.

There is a small whine in the motor at low speeds. If you plan on placing it close to you and little noises bother you, you might want to look at another manufacturer.

If your internet connection is lost, the only way to reconnect your Wi-Fi to the unit again it is to delete it from the app, unplug the unit then plug it back in, and then go through the process of adding it like it is a new device in the app.

Overall, I like the actual performance of the unit. If you can afford the filters, don’t mind reconnecting the Wi-Fi once in a while, and don’t mind a little noise from the motor, I would recommend this unit.",3.0 out of 5 stars
evie,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2023","I purchased the core 600s model. It measures 12 inches wide and 23.5 inches in height. I really wanted to love this air purifier so I tested it for a month and just don’t know if I can trust it. First, the PM guideline levels are off compared to what airquality.gov stated is good air vs poor air. So you’ll have the color green light up when some of the range should be in the orange if following the government website. Next, the VeSync app needs work. The app has a feature for wild fires and stated there aren’t any when there were. The app showed outdoor levels as safe air quality when the air quality government website stated the air was poor. Finally, the air didn’t feel better if that makes sense. Compared to a cheaper hepa air purifier I just didn’t feel a difference.

Cindy Cat NC,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2023","Purchased April 2023. Three months later : Lots of bells and whistles with this one(I dont know that they they really work). NO idea how long it was registering ""BAD air"", it didnt notify me . Have manually turned it way up trying to clean the ""bad air"", and at high fan speed it is of course noisy, but if the air suddenly changed from Good to BAD, I don;t want it to take all night to rectify that. On turbo noisy high it changed to ""Good"" from bad in about 10 minutes, so there is that. Low pollen count in this area today, no smoke, did fry up some eggplant in olive oil (I dont think it likes olive oil, but we do!) It is already saying the filter has 54% remaining. Filters are not cheap for this. I have THREE Levoit 100 purifiers running along with this one and this is a 1500 sq foot house!

Cheshire756,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2021","UPDATE: So, after two months.. the filter is noticeably weak in filtering out particles from the air. This is after I have taken the filter out and cleaned it a few times to see if it would help filter the air better. It works for maybe a day. A new filter just cost me $50.. That means in a year I will have paid more for new filters than I did for the device itself. As mentioned in other reviews, it feels much cheaper than other models, whose filters came at a much more reasonable cost. The bottom is also a huge pain in the butt! If I move the purifier the bottom tends to unscrew very easily. I do feel that more dust gets stuck for this reason, requiring that the expensive filter be changed more frequently.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: Ferrets have really delicate respiratory systems and air quality seems to be a big factor when it comes to my fur-babies. With smokers living in the home, I have been through three different air purifiers in my ferret's room (aka, my office) before I was satisfied with the level of air quality. What drew me to this one was that PM data readout (as opposed to just a change in color to show a drop in quality). First thing my husband did when I set it up was blow smoke from a vape pen into it. I was surprised at how fast that thing shot up! I moved it into my office and it seems to be able to clear the air in less than 20 mins (an average sized bedroom). It's great at sucking all the pet hair to the sides, and I just gather and throw it out when I notice it.",3.0 out of 5 stars
R. Eddy,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2022","It seems to work. I’m on my second one because the first one developed a whining noise at low speed that was probably bearing noise from the motor.

The sensor does register more or less correctly. However if you want it to remove larger particles from the air like pet dander, dust, etc, you’ll have to run it on high a lot and not on sensor mode. It’d be nice if it had a large particle sensor as well. The airflow is not great enough to pull in large particles unless you leave it on high. The sensor just measures microscopic contaminants, which may be what you’re looking to filter. Allergens such as dust and dander don’t really register. Cigarette smoke does because I tested that. So you’re best bet is to set up a schedule to have it run on high when you’re either not in the room or not at home.

It does an excellent job at odor control, if you run it on high when an odor is present.

It is HUGE! I guess physic’s requires it to be. It takes a certain size fan to move a certain amount cfm of air.

Filter replacements seem a bit on the pricey side. And I wonder about the long term availability of replacements. I guess I’ll find out.

Apple HomeKit compatibility would be a plus but unfortunately you have to deal with Alexa or whatever googles voice assistant is.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Alan J Beckett,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2021","This is my third Levoit air filter. My first, an LV-PUR131S, in auto mode it would kick on for all sorts of things. Air freshener, walking across the carpet, farting. Also the LV-PUR131S always had a ton of dust on the filter when I would check it. I could really tell that it was taking things out of the air. But the two new ones, this 400 series and the 300 series make me doubt that they are doing much of anything. When it auto mode, my default setting, it NEVER kicks on because of detected air pollutants. I even went so far as to spray some air freshener over the device. No change in numbers on the display and no change in speed. When I check the filter monthly, there appears to be little dust accumulated. We live in a very dusty part of the country, so I thought I would see a lot of dust on the filter when I checked it but no. Also I am not sure how good the activated charcoal filter is. If I put the old LV-PUR131S in a musty smelling room and turned it on high. It would freshen the room of. I tried that with the 300 and couldn't really see any difference.

Nov 1, 2021 - followup to original review: Have talked to Levoit Customer Service which was helpful Basically if you have a DUAL Router (auto recognizes 5G or 2.4G) this device will not connect. You must be able to select a 2.4G Frequency. The Optimum (Altice) route does not allow for this option so that is why I could not connect.

Christopher,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2021","I have zero issues with the air purification. It worked at removing pet odor and just made the air fresher no matter where I placed it----I also tried it in the Master closet and wow what a difference too! It has the Hepa 13 filter, sensor for auto mode that will turn it up if contaminants detected--which I tested. It's a great air purifier!

The negative----I could never get it to connect to my wifi---I have a smart home with well over 60 devices and I have connected all of them. I even called Levoit and they couldn't get it to connect. The purpose of ordering this unit was also the connectivity. I am sure I got a dud and sent it back, I just didn't want to deal with getting another and the same thing happening later paying the additional cost for the ""S"" . The other negative is the 400S is HUGE! My fault though for not keeping in mind the dimensions.

Brett,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2021","I'll skip the reasons for needing an air purifier. We all have the same reason(s) in common. First off, there's no doubt that to a degree it does what it's built to do. Clean the air that's being drawn into the unit. The air is drawn thru the housing vents and pass thru the filter, up thru the ""processor/analyzer"" then out thru the top. Now, the app says that the air in my room is a 6 meaning very good. This is complete crap. The air passing thru the analyzer after it's been filtered is a 6, not the air in my room. How could it possibly know what the air quality is in my room if it analyzes it AFTER it's already been cleaned. There's no outboard detection. Just a bunch of gimmicks. Now, is it working? theoretically, I'm inclined to say it should. It's a glorified far and filter. That's all it is. With a bunch of bells and whistles that you really don't need. Just adds unnecessary cost. The only way to tell if it's actually working is to check the filter over time to see if there are any contaminants.

Great, I thought, guess I don't need the product and the indoor air quality is good despite the wildfires nearby.

Since I have continued using it, the score is usually between a 2 and a 1 when I switch it on, which is great for peace of mind if nothing else, if the score is believable (I choose to trust it now and am hoping it was just playing up).

Overall it really seems to do the job however since initially linking it, I haven't been able to remote control it via their app - it doesn't seem to detect it anymore, and unfortunately I can't delete and re-add it from the app to try force it to connect again.

Jessica,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2022","These purifiers are so much better than GermGuardian purifiers because of the PM 2.5 function. It's good to have, but it's less important when your remaining filter life isn't actual. When you replace your filter, YOU MUST indicate that it's been replaced by tapping ""Done Replacing Filter"" on the app. If you don't indicate that it's been replaced, then your purifier will indicate that your (new) filter needs to be replaced. Therefore, the ""filter life"" percentage reading isn't actual. It's an estimation.

However, I find that the purifier is better than GermGuardian. It has a sleep mode that's very considerate. The PM 2.5 feature is help, but it's not necessary. Especially since it doesn't indicate what's actually in the air.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Texas Son,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2024","Pros:
Moves a ton of air
Noise is not too bad for the volume of air it moves. The air moving across the fan blades is fine, it's the air moving through the filter that makes the noise.
Alexa integration

Cons:
VeSync network is laggy
Air quality detection is not very good
Display mounted on the top where you can't see it unless you are right next to it.

I bought this unit for my ""cigar room."" It is rated for 3X the square footage of my room and it really moves a lot of air. If you are close to it then it is obviously going to be noisy, so be realistic before complaining. Do you want a quiet or do you want it to move a lot of air?

It filters really well, even though I don't have the ""smoke filter"" in it, and there is no doubt it's going to have a positive effect on the cigar smell.

I have my unit about 3 or 4 feet off the floor because the cigar smoke goes up, not down, and it works much better that way. In fact I can see it drawing the smoke toward it from 5 feet away. For non-smokers, I'm sure on the floor is fine.

However…

The sensor to detect smoke and adjust is not very good at all. Depending on the cigar, I can be 5 feet away from the unit and it tells me the air quality is ""good."" Good? Really? I have an older Taotronics unit I bought 3 or 4 years ago that responds to the smoke just as well, even at its age, so I always have to change the speed manually, through Alexa (see complaints on that, below). Understandably, most people won't be happy with this, but I would be setting it to high anyway because I want it to filter as much smoke out of the air as it possibly can. I don't think any unit is going to be sensitive enough to do that. In fact, a sensitivity setting should absolutely be included on these units.

As others have complained, Alexa tells me the unit is off-line way too much, but I think this is a problem with the VeSync network, not the unit itself. I have a toaster oven that also uses VeSync and it often behaves the same way. Anyway, even though it says it's off-line, it will usually respond 30 or so seconds later. For the most part, the response time is very laggy. Only once has it responded normally, within one or 2 seconds. But again, I blame VeSync.

The display is kind of cool, but it's on the top where literally no one will see it unless they are right next to it. So, beyond using it for manual control, it's 95% useless. It's one of those ""I wonder what the air quality is? I don't know, let me whip out my phone, open the app, log in and look. Or I have to get up and walk over to the machine."" A side-mounted air quality digital display would have been a smart addition.

Early on I set it up in one part of the space, turned it on ""auto"" until it showed blue circles, then moved it to the furthest parts of the space and it still showed blue.

My main complaint--which is a big deal considering this is an investment--is that under a month in the dust particle sensor stopped working. The unit was running all day and showing red/high particle counts at the end. I followed the manual instructions and vacuum cleaned the outside entry to the particle sensor but no dice. Today I took apart the entire unit with a screw driver, found the particle sensor and blew into it really hard. It seems to have done the trick and the ""auto"" function is working as it should now, fingers crossed. But it's still really frustrating to have a key component stop working after so little use, and is especially so given that Levoit has not provided an easy way of accessing the sensor to clean it.

My units sensor no longer works properly. On the auto setting, in the presence of smoke, it no longer cycles the unit up in fan speed. It’s always on the lowest normal fan speed even if my smoke detectors nearby are beeping. I contacted customer service and was instructed to power cycle my device and perform a sensor test with burning paper. Even in the most extreme of circumstances the sensor reading barely made it to 200. Typically this environment would have read over 900. After performing the test and showing the sensor was faulty, customer service instructed me to power cycle again and perform the test again…after doing so they determined it was working properly and to power cycle the device if there becomes an issue. This is their “solution” to the problem. The fact that I can be standing next to the device in a room full of smoke and there is no increase in particulate reading or fan speed means there is an issue. And the solution?

Pixelmover,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2023","I was excited to get this air purifier, especially after so many great reviews and head to head comparisons with other brands. It has everything going for it - inexpensive filter replacements, app-driven features, low noise from the fans, great filtration, and even has handles... Just lots of features and great performance.

Unfortunately, I ended up first replacing it, then returning it, due to a metallic high-pitch motor noise, mainly at the lower two fan speeds - out of the box. I even ran it for a few hours on high speed and low to see if it would go away. No luck.
I thought maybe I just had a faulty one, but the replacement had the same issue.
I dropped one star due to the motor noise. Otherwise, 5 stars!

It is not very loud, but for me, it is like having a mosquito buzzing around the room and it really started to bug me (no pun intended). For most, it may not be an issue, since it is not super loud. And if you are not in the same room it will not matter. I just wanted to point out the high possibility that you may have this issue, since I have seen many others on YouTube with the same issue.

Customer service was great (though not available by phone unless you request a call after a chat or leave a VM). I gave them all the details I had, and they assured me they would bring the issue up with the product team. I also attached a video with the sound I mentioned.

I would still recommend this purifier if the motor sound does not bother you.
I ended up getting a Blueair 311i Max, which I am also very happy with, and has most of the same cool features as the Levoit (minus handles and motor noise). And about the same price I paid.

I hope this helps with your search!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Gene P. Louie,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2023","The air purifier has many ""pluses"" and a few ""minuses.""
.
.
ADVANTAGES
.
1. DESIGN: It is a marvel in design for simplicity. It employs a square plastic tower with small holes on the bottom four sides. Raw air enters the device and is forced through a large cylindrical HEPA filter. The air is drawn inside via a propeller, that is attached to a brushless motor, with a lit control panel on top.
.
2. COST: For a $300 large room air cleaner that handles an advertised 3,175 square feet of coverage, the price point is near the ""low end"" for its class. Very often, Amazon has ""customer returns."" At $193.50, it becomes a ""steal.""
.
The HEPA filter is rated for 6 months to a year. Replacement price for a comparable to an original unit is $47 to $60. This is cheap in comparison to $100 panel-type filters.
.
3. PERFORMANCE: I purchased this product to handle my chronic coughing. The bottom of my left lung has a permanent inflammation. From November to Spring, I suffer a dry cough that lasts eight months or more. FORACORT 400 inhaler is used to control the medical problem. In addition, a HONEYWELL electronic air cleaner with two UVC lights are used to minimize irritating airborne dust and molds. Unfortunately, the equipment does not intercept the smaller particles, germs, and viruses.
. . . . . The HEPA filter is designed for the latter. Upon its 24/7 deployment, I notice a reduction in coughs. So, the product does work as advertised.
.
.
DISADVANTAGES
.
1. NOISE: The two highest speeds are noisy. In fact, I can hear it 60 feet away and through an insulated wall.
.
2. CUSTOMER SERVICE: According to most Amazon users, it is useless. The company employs maximum effort to refuse returns and repairs. So, its 2-year warranty is totally meaningless.
.
Unfortunately, this is the ""normal state of affairs"" for almost all firms. In fact, I have experienced only two third-parties on Amazon, that has outstanding customer service. The reality is that there are very few customer-centric Amazon and Costco-like companies in the business world.
.
3. LOW QUALITY/NON-FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS: Common Amazon user complaints are a noisy motor and non-functional features. On these issues, I can personally attest to the top two speed settings. They are loud. Also, the AUTO feature is useless. It only functions at the lower two speeds and always indicate that the room air is good.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Shawn A,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2024","Surprised at how light this thing is, and how simple it was to just make it work. Auto mode so far has been great, nice and quiet...I don't hear the motor at all like I saw some folks on YouTube complain about. Size is great for the back bedroom aka my computer room/reptile room. Only complaint is the app on iOS. It was terrible - Apple kept trying to autofill the registration and the app would just derp out and there's no back so you have to completely close the app and relaunch it. Then when you get to the part for putting in the verify email code, if you exit the app screen to pull up your email on your phone....good luck. App doesn't recognize the keyboard when you tab back over to it from the background and again, you have to close the app and completely start the sign up process all over again. Very annoying, but eventually just used my computer to load email...not a deal breaker, just a really dumb workaround to something that shouldn't be a problem in the first place.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jill,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2023","I bought a Levoit 400s, a Levoit Vital 200s, a Winix 5500-2, and a Coway ap-1512hh to test for my bedroom and open concept living/dining area. The intent is to keep one one device in each space and 2 purifiers will be returned.

For sound/loudness, Winix wins the award for being the quietest machine at all 4 speed levels. The Levoits and Coway get significantly louder at higher levels (3/4), but are whisper quiet on settings 1 ,2, and auto sleep. The Levoit devices sound like typical white noise fans when running, whereas the Coway has a distinctive motor noise that has a bit of a click that is bothersome to me.

For sensor testing/reliance on auto settings, the Levoit 400s picks up smoke/incense quicker and better than the other 3 machines, followed by the Winix 5500. The Levoit 400s is the only device that seems to notice my incense every time it's lit, so it is now the winner for my living/dining space and the Winix will be returned. This machine also covers more space sq ft, which makes more sense for this part of my home. I am still deciding between the Levoit Vital 200s and the Coway ap-1512hh for my master bedroom. I haven't tested the smart functionality of my Levoits yet, but having smart features were major selling points. I also can't say if any of these machines help with my allergies yet, as ragweed season won't hit for another few months, but my fingers are crossed!

One important note about the Levoit 400s - I tested this purifier sitting flat on the ground in my living room and also tested it in the same place, but raised sitting on a 7in stool. Some research indicates that some purifiers work better raised a bit off the ground. This is not one of them. The 400s sensor responded better to incense smoke when the device was on the ground. Raising it caused it to repeatedly miss my incense smoke (sensor would stay blue indicating clean air), then as soon as I placed the purifier down on the ground again, the sensor indicator numbers would shoot up and the machine would kick to green or orange finding the smoke. This seemed to make a significant difference, so if you purchase the 400s, I would plan to keep it on the ground if the sensor response/auto functionality is important to you.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Granny Trish,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2021","First off I have two large room Levoit Air Purifiers and I've used them for a few years. They work good when the filters are clean but not so good when they are bad. The lights don't turn off on the so I had to put gaff tape on them for night as it bugs me. The older ones are easy to change filters on and with them on the filters last about 2 months for me. They are heavy a bit though.

The older ones also only shoot the air one direction so you have to move it around to change air direction.

That being said this one has some improvements and some fails so here we go:

Improvements :

1) lighter, has four speeds instead of three

2) you can turn off the lights (they must have heard complaints about that from people like me)

3) the best improvement is the air now shoots straight up plus it collects air in a 360 degree ""cone"" BUT (read fails)

4) Really cool touch screen on top and easy to use for sure, easier to use than the older ones

5) I think this is bit more quiet than the other two ""large"" room Levoits I use.

6) has two indented handles on top, you have to move it around like R2D2 and be careful because for the tenth time...the bottom is cheap feeling.

Fails:

1) the filter is sort of tricky to put in because the bottom is thin and cheap feeling

2) the bottom is a 360 ""cone"" that collects from the ground up with huge gaps login to the filter (this may cause more dust to get picked up yes but it also means replacing filters quicker

3) the cheap feeling plastic bottom that ""screws"" tight but once on the ground can come off easy. To avoid you need to life it up carefully and put down carefully as to not bust the cheap feeling bottom.

4) did I meantionthe cheap feeling bottom !!!

5) FILTERS COST $36.00!!! WT FUDGE man....?

6) the older ones fell way more sturdy , they traded off weight for a thinner plastic weird design that may have looks cool CAD designing but feels cheap as all heck.

7) feels like I'm login to break the bottom when I put in the filter.

I've only had it too weeks so I'll update in a little while after further use, want to see how long the WAY TOO EXPENSIVE filters will last.

Matt C.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2023","Bottom line up front, I am returning this.

BUT, not because it's a bad item. In fact, it's rather good. It's large, but not TOO large, and it's very nicely built and aesthetically pleasing. Even at it's highest setting, it isn't LOUD, and it's almost suspiciously quiet when in auto mode. The auto detection on this thing is top notch. It can always, almost immediately, detect when I am cooking, and shows red on the display and goes into high gear to clear the air. The particle detection is crazy good.

So, WHY am I returning it then? Because it doesn't do the one thing I need it to do, which is ""freshen"" the air. I have 2 dogs, and the air in our house can sometimes get a little ""stale."" Not smelly, just very heavy. I always have the ceiling fans running, or the door open; just to introduce some fresh air to the house. I figured this thing would recirculate the air, thus freshening up the interior of the house. It doesn't, and I must have great quality air IN the house, because other than when I am cooking, the display is always at 000-001 and it is on the lowest fan setting.

I would actually love to keep it, just so that it can filter the air when I cook, but for $200 (Amazon Warehouse), I just can't justify the cost. I have smaller Levoit air filters throughout the house, and they will just have to do. (Core 200s). If it were $100, I'd keep it.

If you are just looking for something to increase the breathability or ""quality"" of your air, this is a definite recommendation. But if you're looking to have it remove musty odors, or take the smokiness out of a smokers apartment, this isn't your device.",4.0 out of 5 stars
shine_on,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2023","This review is strictly for cigar smokers. I did purchase the additional replacement smoke filter which I use. Hard to say if it is necessary or made a difference. So this item will clear the whole room of smoke, I use it on the highest setting when I’m smoking a cigar and do have to turn the tv on louder when the purifier is on the highest setting. So while it does clear the smoke and clean the air, a slight cigar smell will linger and actually seems to also make the filter smell. However, I came up with a solution that works for me and my 800 sqft apartment no longer has cigar nor cigarette smell (my girlfriend smokes cigarettes). I included photos if what I use. No it has not caused the machine to malfunction, it’s been about 3 weeks now. The machine sucks in air from the side and blows air out of the top. I do close the door to my bedroom and bathroom and I do make sure no clothes are in my living room which can hold smell. I have a leather couch and hard wood floors. I do place towels under the door to my bedroom and to the hallway door to my apartment, I live on the first floor. I have zero complaints from other tenants. I do open the outside door or window on one end of the apartment and suck air out with a fan in the window. If it’s nice out I will do this while smoking if not, I will air out the place as soon as I’m finished. I do put a ceiling fan on low speed in the room, not sure if that makes any real difference though. What you see in the photos are activated charcoal filters and an 8oz jar of Ozium. The charcoal filters are reusable apparently you let them sit in the sun to recharge which I have not done. I help this works for you as is has for me.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2023","Bought to be ready for wildfire smoke, which hasn't happened yet (great!) so I don't really know how well it works.

I leave it in Auto mode and it very occasionally turns on at the lowest speed (when the PM2.5 goes up, I think), not for long, and then it turns itself off and goes completely dark. All in all, pretty unobtrusive.

The unit I got made a very slight rattle which I could only hear because my chair is right next to where I put the unit, and it's the kind of noise my hearing aids over-amplify, I suspect most people at normal distances would never notice it. I recorded it and asked Levoit if it was normal, and they had me cut the cord on that unit and they sent me another brand new complete unit ... which also has that very slight rattle. So that's probably just normal, but now I have a spare filter :)

T. COTON,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2023","This is more a standalone air filter than an air purifier, there is no ionizing taking place nor any UV treatment of the air passing through this air filter. I really do like the low level of noise it makes and the wifi connection to it to get alerts and set it up but it is totally useless at removing any odor whatsoever. If you cook, the house will still smell cooking, if you have an open fireplace as I do, you will still get some nasty whiffs out of it. The only use I found it worthwhile was to remove the particle in the air during the episode of smoke coming from Canada to Connecticut/New-York. It went on red as soon as I opened the windows in the morning and ramped the fan up and sent me alerts on my iDevices until I closed the windows and it finished its air cleaning. The air in my house is usually very clean, we live in the middle of the woods in a clean house with no pets and no smoker so it usually only displays between 001 and 020 depending on activities. The only noise level acceptable for us is on the very low setting, above that it is very noticeable and annoying, let alone when it ramps up to max, it is way too loud.

I like that it has wheels and can easily be carted from room to room. It covers a large area and leaves our room feeling fresh. I have noticed my husbands snoring to be less which could be totally unrelated, but might also be because of this air purifier. I love the design and the app feature.

BG golfer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2023","Super easy to set up, including setting up the app. Whisper quiet on auto and level 1 setting. Setting 2 has a bit of background noise, but tolerable. Setting 3 is noticeable. Setting 4 is like an airport. Very loud.

App allows you to do as many schedules as you like. Display can be set to on or off at a specific time or based on ambient light. Has fun metrics to look at. Wished it had more than just on/off setting when connected to Google Home app. There’s no other available settings unless you use their app or on the unit.

The unit is BIG. I mean 2 feet tall big. I knew that when I bought it, but don’t think this is some table top unit. It isn’t.

Now, for the nitty gritty. Does it actually purify the air? My wife and I have been besieged by allergies this year so I invested in this unit.

I really don’t notice any difference, really. I have it set to Setting 2 most of the morning and auto the rest of the day. It’s been a week and the sneezes are still there.

Our house doesn’t have very good ventilation upstairs, so we got this purifier. It works very well and quickly. Has improved our overall quality of air in the house, helping us sleep better. The air quality sensor does work, but I wish it was a little more sensitive. For example, we turned on the self-cleaning oven and the smell gave me a headache it was so strong. I had hoped the purifier would reduce the smell or kick on and say the air was really bad, but it didn’t register the oven smell very much. Not as significantly as I expected. However, the air quality fluctuations my nose CAN’T smell, like deadly outdoor pollutants, the purifier does register quickly and efficiently. If we have any windows open and run the purifier at the same time, we get a message on our phone noting the toxicity level. Pretty impressive.

Adolphe,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2023","The first device that is true to its labs ratings in noise. In my 30+ yrs, this device by far has the most quiet fan I've ever seen/heard. The reason why I don't give it full 5 stars is because of 2 issues.
1st issue is the delivery of all my Levoit products where routed to USPS and marked that they missed me when the packages never reach me at all because USPS doesn't open on weekends. All my other purchases made at the same time were delivered by Amazon on the weekend.
2nd issue is that the VeSync connects to only 2.4 ghz wifi. Many routers like mine don't have 2.4 ghz anymore and it would be great if Levoit mentionned it so that customers don't end up being unable to connect to wifi because this air purifier only connects to 2.4 ghz wifi. If you're going to buy more smart devices that connect to wifi, I advise you to buy a 5 ghz to 2.4 ghz wifi converter like I did. If you don't, then you'll need to buy another router that might not be compatible to your internet service or your internet speed and if you change your internet provider, you might need again to buy a whole different router again.
Another thing to mention is that this air purifier works when humidity level is below 85% RH. So, you should avoid using it near your bathroom or a Master Bedroom after showering. I have a device that measures humidity and everytime I take shower(no more than 15 min showers), my Master bedroom's humidity goes above 85%.",4.0 out of 5 stars

•Very quiet on its 2 lowest setting
•Moves a alot of air, especially on 2 higher settings
•Has 4 fan setting ( 5, Has a hidden extra low setting that is accessible through its auto function if the air is clean enough( the ring is in the blue))

I removed the filter to inspect the cause of the odor and it is definitely coming from the filter.

I sent a note to Levoit calling out the problem and didn’t get reply.
Why would this happen so soon and is there any way to “refresh” the filter?

The Air Quality sensor never registered anything other than “Very Good”, so I can’t think of it being a problem with the filter. Bummed that I had to spend $49 more to get a replacement filter within a week of ownership.

Other than the filter issue, I really like the product. The unit is powerful, quiet (especially on sleep mode) and connects easily to the app.

Should be a 5 star item, but I had to knock it down a star (probably should have dropped it down further) just because of the stupid filter issue.

Damien W. Lombardi,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2022","***Update***After posting my earlier review I was in contact with customer service. I was dealing with Sharon and she was very helpful! The company only wanted for us to be happy with the purifier and asked several questions to diagnose an issue. She helped us by recommending a slightly different filter cartridge and provided us the first one. Good customer service is hard to find, and she and the company proved they actually do care. It has only been a few days so the improvement is starting to be noticed.

We bought 3 of these and we were hoping for them to work. It says we have very high quality air in the rooms but we still can see tiny particles in the air when the sun shines in after days running on high. If there is a slight odor in the room and you put your nose up to where the purified air comes out it still has the same smell. So I don’t know what it actually does if we still have particles in the air and the supposed purified air still smells the same. I can’t imagine we have 3 defective purifiers but the actual purifying is not good at all. The smart features are great and the machine is easy to connect and control, but I care more about clean air than cool features.",4.0 out of 5 stars
JulieMKY,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2023","We've only had this for a couple of weeks, but so far it does seem to help. I bought it mainly due to Air Quality Alerts in our area and a partner with asthma. It does struggle to keep the air at a healthy level (PM2.5 of 12 or lower), but our AQI has been 60+, so it has its work cut out. I like being able to control it with the app to change the fan level and create schedules as needed. I only hear it when the fan is on level 3 or 4, otherwise it's very quiet. As another review noted, the app always says the air is ""very good"" regardless of the PM2.5 reading.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2023","2 days after operation started, this became fairly noisy (fan). I did reset it and the loud ""grating"" noise disappeared (and has not returned), but you need to know it's not silent. It's not loud unless you crank up the fan, and honestly on low setting or sleep it's great white noise. I have to move TV volume up 1 or 2 points on low. Overall performance: this thing is a beast. Not only have the Canada wild fires made going outside risky (and this has kept the inside house area NOTICEABLY easier to breath), but I fried up a whole pack of bacon, the red indicator went off and it went to work. In a few hours, my house smelled better. Good value for the money.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Doctor Ken,"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2022","Overall, we like it. It looks nice. It can be very quiet on the low settings. The highest setting is a windstorm like a box fan on full, so presumably very effective. The display of particle levels is almost useless as it displays low single digits all the time, from the moment it came out of the box. It's good to know we don't have a lot of large particles in our air--and always did apparently--but there is no more sensitive setting to show ongoing effectiveness. Also, it would be far more useful if you could program the fan settings during day to be quiet and dark at night and a higher speed, etc. otherwise. It's easy to remember to turn the noise maker down, but not so easy to remember to turn it back up. Clock chips cost pennies, so why not? I could plug it into a timed outlet to just turn it off at night, but when powered up, it does not return to your chosen settings. For the money, it could be so much better.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The app and scheduling work well, though.
I've used air filters for years, and one of the things I like is the white noise of the fan while sleeping.

If we are cooking or the machine is detecting a reduction in air quality we crank it up to 3 or 4 and it cleans very quickly. The fresh air is very noticeable. I have allergy issues and have also seen improvement with my symptoms (sneezing, coughing, hacking). The sleep mode feature is nice as well because it turns all display lights off and the fan quiets down to allow you to sleep while it still continues to clean throughout the night.

Spicy60s,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2023","Because this is pricey (for me) I feel need to let others know.

When I learned that the purifier needs to be more to the middle of room for maximum performance - this requires me moving out for use and moving it back to wall. Also, taking to each room every week or so - bottom coming off becomes an aggravation with each move. This may likely only apply to those with bending difficulties with how it needs to be carried - It is Very Light Weight And extremely quite!!!!!

This Airpurifier is amazing! The app interface is simple and user friendly. Alexa connection was flawless and quick. The system itself is quick to sense and filter out impurities. The sensor is on the back of the unit and I assume it has been placed there to be discreet. I am giving 4 stars overall because of the build quality. The only reason I am rating harshly on the build quality is because I believe for over $200 Levoit could have used some metal. Atleast on the outside casing to give it a more quality feel. The weight of the system itself is nice and gives it that more pricey feel but if the outside had a metal casing. I think that would just be the cherry on top. If I where to price this item myself without seeing the actual price I think I would pay $150 at most, although I am not disappointed what so ever.

Wyatt,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2023","1-Year Update:

I've had 2 Everest Air units in my 1-bedroom apartment for a little over a year now and thought I'd come back to update. All in all, I can say this is still a 5-star product and still one of the best on the market. Everything I said originally still is true to this day. No issues whatsoever to report with either unit. The one and only negative thing I can possibly find is the cost of the replacement filters, which are $99 each, and never seem to go on sale. I have to change both filters pretty much twice a year. The first change I did I tried an off-brand that was less than 1/2 the price, but they did not fit the unit quite right and left a gap, and noticeably did not perform as well. When I just changed them a few days ago I bit the bullet and spent the $200 on the real filters and it was nice to have them fit snugly into the machines.

Original Review:

Love my Levoit EverestAir! I researched air purifiers for over a month, trying to determine which had the best performance, quality filter, and lots of modern features. I watched hours of video reviews, sorted through articles, and evaluated each, including Levoit, of course, Dyson, Mila, Molekule, Coway, and Blueair, just to name the most popular that I looked at. When it came down to it, the Levoit EverestAir has the best of what I was looking for – so much so that I just ordered a second one to put in my bedroom!

FILTRATION: Like another reviewer mentioned, starting at the filter and then working your way back is best, and the filter on this thing is a beast! It is massive and has a large amount of carbon pellets that you can actually see. Many other brands use a tiny sheet of carbon that does almost nothing to capture VOCs or odors, but Levoit packed a ton of carbon pellets into this filter. Plus, the laser air quality monitoring is the best you can get. It reacts almost immediately, maybe a 5-10 second delay, to any change in the air quality. I notice that it kicks up right when I expect it to.

DESIGN: It is definitely not a ""small"" machine, but it also isn't the largest. It is sleek and looks nice in my living room, considering it is powerful enough to clean my entire 900 sq.ft. apartment. The display gives you all of the information you need without being an obnoxiously bright touchscreen monitor. I really like that you can control the display or enable the ""light detection"" mode which would be great for a bedroom as it automatically lowers the fan speed and turns off the display when it gets dark.

APP: The app is great, I have had a Levoit Core 200 for several years and it is still running perfectly to this day, which also uses the same app as the EverestAir. However, the main difference is the EverestAir app is PACKED with features. You can view everything you can on the machine itself, like air quality %, PM1.0, 2.5, and 10, change the fan speed or place it in auto mode, view the filter life, and turn the display on or off.

PRICE: Considering some of the competitors like Dyson and Molekule can reach $800 after tax, the EverestAir is a great value! Of course the sticker shock can be a bit jarring, but overall it is 100% worth it.

DOES IT HELP PURIFY: It sure does! I suffer from severe seasonal allergies in both the spring and fall, and when I was home, I did not have to take any allergy medications, eye drops, or nose sprays whatsoever and I have EverestAir to thank for that! I sleep better and my furniture stays cleaner with the particulates being filtered out of the air before they have a chance to settle. My apartment is brand new and there was a bit of construction dust still in the air, in the carpet, and on the walls, and I am confident this is keeping that at bay, too, while the carbon is absorbing any Formaldehyde offgassing from the fresh paint.

THE BOTTOM LINE: If you're on the fence about ordering the EverestAir and are looking at any of the brands I mentioned, absolutely buy the EverestAir! You will not regret it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2024","We live in the desert so I bought this to remove some of the dust that gets into the house. It works great. It removes almost all the dust and any dusty smells that go with it. It is a larger machine and can remove almost all the dust in half of the whole house. I put it on high in the morning when I get up. Within an hour I kick it down to ""Auto"" mode as it has lowered the dust to almost nothing. Auto mode controls the fan according to how much dust it senses. It works very well. The sleep mode drops it so quiet I have to check it sometimes to see if it is actually running. The Wifi just makes it easier so I don't have to get up to change it. I can just pull it up on my phone and use the app to adjust it. We just bought this so its not been used enough to rate durability. It seems to be well built, but only time will tell. Its not cheap enough to just go out and buy another if it dies, so I'm hoping it lasts. Further posts will be made if it breaks.",5.0 out of 5 stars
SLM,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2021","I have owned this product for less than 24 hours as of this writing. More updates as I have more to say/remember to do them. Also, I will be very verbose, the sort of in-depth information I want when I am researching products over $99 for purchase, so you really know what's going on. Hopefully it helps, but it may be TL;DR for some.

My background: I am not a smoker and never have been. I was raised by a chain smoker and have spent the majority of my life around second hand smoke from parents, family and friends. I have stress induced asthma and have also been through experimental chemotherapy that has apparently permanently damaged my lungs. Over time, my lungs are slowly degrading, and as they do I become more and more sensitive to more and more things, which trigger my lungs to get irritated and produce phlegm to coat my lungs and prevent the irritation, which causes me to cough more and more over time. (It has been a lot of fun having this sort of lung disorder during the pandemic, let me tell you.)

""Well, why don't you see a doctor then?"" you may reasonably ask. My experience with doctors in the past has consisted of watching both my mother and grandmother die with (no joke) 30+ prescriptions each all at once (with 3 to 5 doctors all prescribing simultaneously and admitting to me in private that A) they were not consulting with one another, and B) nobody on earth could possibly keep track of the side effects of so many prescriptions at once), and my uncle wasn't far off that number when he died. I also have repeated personal experience with the medical industry that strongly supports my experience and belief that going to the doctor is going to be a financially insane choice (whether or not I have insurance) that I get little to nothing out of regardless. So I choose to avoid doctors and the medical/drug big business establishment like the plague whenever possible.

When I realized recently that my lungs were noticeably irritated all the time when I was in my own home, but I was fine if I went outside, I decided it was time to step up my game. Enter this unit, which I researched before buying.

My unit is brand new, not a returned unit. Upon turning it on, it told me that my air in all areas of the house tested was as good as it gets, with a reading of 001. This did not please me, because I know it's nowhere near that good. So I did an update of the firmware to see if that would fix the issue, and it did. The new display read 005, which was significantly lower than I expected, but the unit reduced that to 3, then 2, then 1 relatively quickly.

Within about 15 minutes, the air in my (door closed) office started to smell noticeably different. Lighter, cleaner, fresher, more neutral. I was surprised. I also noted that over the next few hours, my coughing decreased significantly as long as I stayed in my office.

When bed time came, I put the unit in my bedroom and turned it on full blast with the doors closed while I went to the kitchen to have a snack. At first, the bedroom registered 5. The unit quickly brought it down to 1. I noted that my coughing increased when I was in parts of the house that had not had the benefit of this device to clean the air.

Returning to my bedroom after my snack, I noted that once again, there was a nice difference in how the air smelled in my bedroom compared to my kitchen.

Normally it takes me a while to stop coughing enough to fall asleep when I got to bed each night, but last night while there was still coughing before sleep, it was markedly less, which my girlfriend commented on today. This morning, I woke up to the pleasant realization that my lungs did not feel irritated for the first time in a long time. I hadn't even realized how irritated my lungs were when I would usually awaken until it was gone.

Moved the unit into my home office again, and turned it back on. It started at 5, and again rapidly cleaned the air until it was at 1. Then I began doing more experiments. I noted that when the AC kicks on, it goes from 1 to 2 or 3. When it turns off, the unit returns it to 1. When I open the door to my office, it goes to 2, and then back to 1 when I close it. When my cat walks into my office, it goes from 1 to 2 if I close the door after him, and stays there for as long as he is moving around. If I pet him, it goes to 3.

Thinking this level of sensitivity was too good to be true, I decided to try further experiments. I closed my office door again, waited until it settled down, and sprayed some air freshener in my office. No change - it evaporated. Just as expected. Then I went down the hall and into my living room and lit a stick of natural compressed sandalwood powder incense. I returned to my office and closed the door. Within 2 minutes, this unit detected the incense in the air, rising to a 4-5-6 and then back to 3 when the AC turned off. The next AC cycle, it jumped into the teens, and then into the 20's, 30's, 40's as the smoke got going during the next cycle. When the count hit 45, it turned the ring green and stepped the fan up a notch.

I found that I could watch the numbers go up when the AC was on, and down when it was off. It got up to around 86 at one point, and the ring sometime before that turned orange and stepped the speed up another notch. Now that the incense has burned out, it's dropping, with highs in the 50's, and lows i the 20's and cycling lower each time the AC kicks on again. It's been interesting to see it power up and down to match the particulates in the air.

Build quality seems good, but the bottom can come off easier than I'd like. A couple times now I have tried to lift it only to find that it had un-screwed and the bottom and filter were not lifted with the rest of the unit. Easily fixed in a second or less, but if the bottom had a bit of ""click into place"", this would not happen when moving the unit.

It is so quiet in sleep mode that last night when we went to bed, after I had it running on high for a few minutes while we had our snack before bed, that even three feet from it, my girlfriend could not tell if it was running and asked. This was with the AC not active. That's pretty darned quiet. It also was no issue for me to handle, and I am extremely sensitive to sound when I am trying to sleep.

The top two levels of fan speed are relatively loud, with the highest speed being louder than my AC when it's kicked in. It is, however, the most smooth and beautiful white noise I have ever encountered, and I am an audio engineer.

So far my experience with this is almost entirely good. Here;s what I don't like.

1. The bottom unscrews too easily. No big deal, but irksome.
2. The sensor didn't work when I got it until I updated the firmware, which forced me to download the app, sign up, and then give the app location permissions and blue tooth permissions. I also naturally had to sign it into my wifi network. I didn't want to use the app, or give the app these permissions. The app, however, will not run without them. Ostensibly, it uses location data to give you a report on local 2.5um particulate levels in your area (which it does), but I don't know what else it is being used for, and I don't much like having my location tracked by Google and every other company on earth these days.

So far so good. It appears that particulates in my house are probably not as much of an issue as what those particulates are made of, and that I need to be more focused on reducing VOCs in the air in my house. But so far this unit has helped me breathe significantly better, and I'm very happy with how well it works.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Tech49,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2023","Update August 2024 -- Levoit sent me a replacement for the issue. I'm updating my review to reflect the great customer service provided.

Update July 2024 -- Unfortunately my air purifier has started making a nasty grinding noise coming the air sensor on the left side. I have included a video of what it sounds like. It's loud/jarring enough that it has woken me up several times in the middle of the night. Disconnecting the purifier from power for a couple hours is the only thing that seems to help but the issue comes back randomly. I've reached out to Levoit for help but they've giving me the runaround.

Original Review -- I've owned so many air purifiers from BlueAir to Levoit to Dyson to Mila. The Levoit EverestAir has been the best so far for several reasons:

1. The filter itself. Always start with the filter and work your way backwards with air purifiers. Some really fancy air purifiers (like one from a company that sound like molecule) don't really filter much of anything and its pure hype. The Levoit Everest has a high quality HEPA-13 filter that also has proper granules of activated carbon to absorb VOCs. It also has a fabric type ""seal"" around the filter so it's snug when you install it to minimize unfiltered air bypass. There is also a nice pre-filter (which you should clean weekly or every 2 weeks) that catches the bigger particles that would otherwise degrade the life of the main HEPA filter.

2. The sensors. They're really accurate and respond instantly to changes in air quality. When I say instant, I don't mean 5 seconds, I mean within 1 second. The app also shows you these readings in realtime with accurate historic information as well. The sensors do not measure temperature, humidity, or VOCs, but I found that this is actually a good thing; the VOC and Humidity/temp sensors suffer from drift over time and will lose their calibration and accuracy. These are advanced laser-based (not infrared like in most other air purifiers) particle sensors that will last the life of the unit.

(updated June 14th 2023):
One big thing to note: this unit doesn't sugarcoat. The particle sensors are so precise that you will constantly get readings in the PM1.0, 2.5, and 10 ranges. This is perfectly normal of any living space as stuff is constantly being generated; even by yourself. The air purifiers that give you 0s for any of these readings for more than a few seconds are indicative of infrared sensors that are less accurate.

3. How quiet it is. Even on level ""3"" which is the highest that it can go automatically, it's not loud. At level ""1"", you just hear a low hum. It's amazing how quiet it is. Things start to get loud when you use ""turbo"" mode, but you'd only use that mode in case of an emergency.

(updated June 14th 2023):
4. The app. It's far more feature rich than I was expecting. It's so fast and responsive that you can get away with keeping the screen locked perpetually (if you have kids or nosy dogs) and just using the app and automations to control the air purifier. It also doesn't mind if you're using a separate IoT wifi network. (for those ultra concerned about security) there are no features lost by using a secure IoT network.",5.0 out of 5 stars

R.Tintinger,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2022","First of all from reading the reviews on this machine is deceiving because most of the reviews are for the 400 machine, not the 600, although the 600 does have favorable likes, from all the positive reads on this machine it sounded almost to good to be true, I already have 5 air cleaners in the house ranging from $160-$600 not to mention a whole house filtration electrostatic cleaner, what I liked about this machine is that it has a drum 360° filtration Hepa 13 filter..very easy to clean and change out, the machine is almost silent until you move up to speed #3, where this machine falls short and fails in its highly Touted AirSight Plus ‘’Laser Smart Sensor’’ technology claims to be so accurate is 2x as accurate as an ‘’infrared laser , great claim only the one I purchased, only detected 5ppm for the first minute than dropped down to 1, that was in our den, than I decided to put it in our bedroom, thickly piled carpet lots of traffic same exact results started out on 5 than dropped to 1 again, same thing in the spare bedroom, living room than I ever shook the pets planet he sleeps on, I know it’s full of dust and dander and shook it right up against the sensor…same exact result, another 5 than after a min it dropped to a 1, than I took it down into the basement again 5-1 reading, than finally opened the big sliding patio door and put the machine right up against the screen , it’s got to show a different reading than 5-1…but no, so there is an astronomical coincidence all of the rooms I tested this in, my den, living room, bedroom basement and then outside all had the same exact reading, or it’s not functioning correctly so I called Amazon customer service and they Concurred and sent me out a replacement so I just received it, brand new, opened it today set it up and immediately again the sensor started out on 5 and within a minute dropped down to 1…this machine has a major major major flaw, it’s AirSight Plus technology is not working properly, I’ve seen YouTube videos showing detected readings as high as 80+ ppm and than the longer the Levoit 600s unit ran, that number would drop down until eventually red (bad air quality) ring dropped down to yellow than the blue ring (good air) was finally present, so somewhere these are working, and I also took the replacement machine in 4 different rooms plus the pets bed shake test and patio screen door test…again all rooms plus outside air 5-1 , not 5,4,3,2,1, it would 100% of the time go from 5-1, another defective unit, I hope this is an isolated situation but I have a feeling I will be returning the replacement also.
Update;
I sent the first one back within the 30 days, Amazon sent me out a replacement, this one works as promised, the laser smart sensor works as described, I have had it now for over 3 months and it has been working like a charm, once again Amazon has amazing customer support they took back the first one and in two days had the replacement just wanted to give it sometime before doing another update, this is my favorite easy to use efficient air cleaner yet, the 360° filter is so easy to replace I have asthma and this has helped me breathe much better, if they made one of these even bigger with this type of circular drum filter, I would buy it in a heartbeat",5.0 out of 5 stars
Matthew Rothenberg,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2024","We've had a few different air purifiers and I decided to upgrade the one in our bedroom after me and my wife both had itchy eyes and woke up stuffed up for a few weeks in a row.

For context, we have two double coated dogs who shed like crazy, we live in a town that is 65% conservation land, IE a lot of nature so there is a ton of pollen, ragweed, etc.

After putting this (600) in our large bedroom we almost instantly stopped getting itchy eyes and stuffed up noses. FYI, neither of us have allergies as far as we know but there is only so much anyone can take before their body starts fighting back and even with the other air purifier in the room, it wasn't working well enough even on high.

As soon as I set up this new one and put it aon auto-mode it kicked into high gear and cleaned the air within a minute.

Having another and larger air purifier in our living room on another floor of the house, I decided that I would replace it, but wait until the filter needed to be changed. Well, after a few weeks I decided I couldn't wait any longer, especially now that this went on sale. So I bought a 2nd one, got it the next day and after the setting it up in 2 minutes and connecting it to the app, it did the same thing as the first one...IE it recognized the air wasn't clean, kicked into high gear for a bit and now has been steadily on low showing 1pm / 2.5 since.

Sure it goes back into high hear if we open a window for a bit, or we're cooking, etc but that's exactly what you want it to do. Even on high it's quiet and i know that it's recognizing there is something in the air that should be filtered out and it does it so effectively.

I've also done my research and these products rank right at the top with more expensive options on the market so I know it's good bang for your buck.,

Lastly, it does (as all air purifiers do) recommend that you have at least 18 inches of space all around it. I have mine in places where this is not possible bc I dont want it sitting in the middle of the room. I bring this up bc I'm sure if I did, it would work even better but I'm not sure I can imagine how it could work better.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Don Battles,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2024","So my purchase of the Levoit CORE400s was driven by a few factors.

It’s well regarded by its users and reviewers.

It was on sale plus a $25 dollar coupon (only good for one unit).

The room/space I keep my kitty’s litter box gets air drawn down the hallway by the HVAC return. Draws bad orders into the rest of the house.

Aside from the smells from kitty I assumed my air quality was poor/bad.

Upon turning on the unit and putting turning the fan on I was surprised by two things. The fan is SUPER quiet and my air quality was immediately assessed as “good” (blue ring 2.5 ppm). So it would appear the air quality inside my home is pretty good.

I also installed the VeSync app and connected my new device, could not have been easier! So now I can track air quality over time (hours,days,weeks) to how things may change. As for smells after a few hours the odors from kitty’s litter box seem less strong. Also, FWIW, it’s cleaned daily and I use PrettyLitter.

Anyway I will keep the unit and give it some time. If a distinct improvement isn’t noticed I will gift the unit to a friend or member of my family.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Laura Hubka,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2024",Just received this last week. We live out in the country on a gravel road and deal with a lot of dust. I have a lot of allergies so we're trying to find something that will keep the air more clean in our home. We got central air last year so that made it a little easier to keep the windows shut. Still a lot of dust gets in because of people driving by. It's interesting to see it fluctuate depending on how often the doors getting open and closed during the day. It's stayed at the lowest setting during the week but once all the grandkids were over and going in and out of the house it shot up to the midpoint for most of the day until after they were gone and then back down to a one. I'll put another review in here after a month to let you know how it's going. I did go around the house just dust everything to see how long it takes for everything to get covered again.

My unit has been working great for nearly two years now. It makes a great difference to air quality especially when cooking. The app and filter connect with Alexa, allowing me to easily tell it to switch to Turbo mode when searing meat etc, getting a jump on the smoke and avoiding it ever getting too bad. Previously I would open two doors and run a fan to cycle the air. Not necessary any more! In daily life, this has significantly reduced cat allergies for two regular guests, and has reduced my baseline PM5 when first installing the filter from 35 to a consistent 2-3 per the app. Filters are not exactly cheap, but they do the job and if desired, there are alternatives available on Amazon.

They're whisper quiet, very nice and sturdy. Easy to set up and connect to with an app and to my existing Alexa units. The app is easy and simple to use with built in settings for auto off and on so you don't need to program a long tedious schedule of off times and on times.
I noticed a measurable difference with the 24 hours I've had them. My house smells fresher and cleaner. I returned home from a quick errand and the house didn't smell. (You know it's bad if you smell your own house.)
Prior to receiving them, I did a thorough dusting, vacuuming and shampooed the carpets. My house was long overdue for a deep clean. I and my family were waking up with headaches, coughing, sneezing, just overall feeling unwell for what seems like years. Falling asleep was difficult due to an indescribable uncomfort too.
I had the idea it is probably the dust build up, as one night I finally had a clearing of my sinuses and I smelled old dusty dust really thick. And I'm not one to dust often which is not good but lesson learned.

I live in a 100 year old craftsman house on a gravel driveway on a very busy countryside road. We have a dog and 2 cats and they are about 70/30 indoor outdoor pets respectively. It gets dusty and grimey and there are so many places for that dust creep in and settle. We also have wildfires in our area that become so thick with unhealthy levels of smoke and particles.

Jack Ruby Built The Pyramids,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2024","***Minor update***
I forgot to mention the 'app' for this device. If you are buying this for the Wifi or app control - I highly recommend you reconsider using this app (or *any* app on your phone) to control silly things like an air purifier or a light bulb. This app, like many other apps, require invasive permissions in order to mine your data (track your location, track your contacts, etc). Additionally, once these things are connected to your WiFi network they now have the ability to scan other things on your network and potentially mine data from those devices for sending back to the manufacturer (95% of the cases this goes back to the Chinese manufacturer.)
So, just keep things like this in mind when you decide to take advantage of the ""smart features"" of devices and apps. It's not just the device the app has access to - it will have access to just about anything connected to your network.
Aside from this caveat - I still love this purifier - it is surprisingly effective!

We have a couple of the much smaller Levoit units for various uses and those have worked on a decent level for our needs. However, we were having an event in the house that was going to involve cigar smoke and put this 400S in the living room.

Litefever,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2023","We purchased one of these on sale in the hope it would help moderate the severity of pollen season in upstate NY and the dander generated by two large labradors. It has a nice, clean look and small foot print, which we feel is important.

The HEPA filter was shipped inside it in a bag that needs to be removed but doing so was incredibly quick and easy to do. Twist the top a quarter turn and place to one side. Lift out the filter, remove the bag, lower the filter back in using the two tabs provided on it for that purpose, lift the lid back on and quarter twist to close. It takes 2 mins. Then its' plug-in, turn on and choose """"Auto"" or a fan speed using the touch sensitive panel on top. You can control it from your iphone if you're into that but it certainly isn't necessary.

The first thing we noticed is how quiet it is. Effectively soundless in sleep mode and at fan speed 1. Barely noticeable at fan speed 2, unless you're right next to it, noticeable at fan speed 3 when you are in the same room as it but not obnoxious. Noticeably louder at fan speed 4 which should be considered a 'Turbo"" mode. Then we noticed the impact of running it - vastly reduced swelling of the eyes and sinuses of those suffering from hay fever and a significant reduction in the doggy smell of our labradors. It works really well.

We have taken advantage of the ability to control this by iPhone to set a schedule where it automatically runs in sleep mode (low, continuous fan) from 10pm to 5am. Then at fan speed 2 from 5am to 5:30am, ramping up to fan speed 3 from 5:30am to 8am before switching to auto from 8am to 10pm. Because of the relatively severe allergies suffered by a couple of our family members the P2.5 micron threshold is set to 2 ug per meter cubed and this filter has been able to attain that incredibly low level with that schedule within a few hours of all windows and doors to the outside being closed to the 1800 sq. ft area it services. At this point we have an oasis for our hay fever sufferers to return to each evening and it's made an incredible difference to their comfort. Do they still take Claritin or Allegra during pollen season? Yes, we've found it necessary to deal with the pollen at work and in the garden. Are they doing better than they were before we got this filter? Yes, the continuously swollen and itchy, weeping eyes are gone. The inflamed nasal passages are gone. Their sleep deprivation is gone. Their quality of life has improved dramatically. We had no idea how dramatic an impact adding a quality, appropriately sized HEPA filtration system would have. This unit is rated for something like 3000 sq. ft. We're using to control air quality in a 1800 sq.f.t open plan area and its doing a great job of that without having to run the fan at high speed for prolonged periods of time.

We've had this for several weeks now and experienced 1st hand how well it can deal with really terrible air quality when the smoke from the fires in Quebec blew into NY. Opening the door to come into the house with the shopping during the worst of it briefly dropped the air quality from a PM2.5 of 001 to as high as a PM2.5 of 185 within 12 feet of the door. This was then quickly reduced to a PM2.5 of less than 20 in an hour and back to 001 in about 2 hours after the door was closed. The outside airs PM2.5 was apparently North of 300 at this time (sources accuweather and the news), the air was literally a hazy brown like smog and this filter was able to detect it, automatically adjust its fan speed to clear it and maintain perfect air quality in the house.

Does it work? Absolutely, quietly and brilliantly.

Would we buy this again? Yes, in fact we have so that we can control the air quality for one of our allergy sufferers in another area where they have to spend prolonged periods of time. That one's been in place for about 3 weeks and has done exactly what we hoped it would do - improve the quality of life at work in a 7000 sq.ft. open plan office area. Now this is well beyond the manufacturers claimed coverage for a unit and it looks like they're right based on who's apparently benefiting and who isn't but here's the important point. The benefits to the workforce have been so noticeable to management they're now considering upgrading the offices HVAC system to include HEPA filtration.

llivingstons,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2024",I have been pleased with this product since purchase. Preparation included cleaning the furnace and heat pump vents across the house. This helped significantly to reduce pollen and other bacteria across the house. We also cleaned the carpets and fireplace to ensure the whole house was at the same level of cleanliness. The unit excels in identifying increased scents whether good or bad. It really helped our home to maintain proper levels and reduce the PM 2.5 pollen challenges experienced before we cleaned and sanitized our home. At the slightest changes in foreign bacteria/elevated scents the unit turns on and eradicates the smell then goes back to standby mode and also sends you a message of what it did and what it about to do. Really next level technology that scrubs the air when needed without wasting energy. We have Levoit products across our home and love the piece of mind they provide. We have 2-600S for the large rooms; 2-400S for the smaller areas; 3-300 series for the bedrooms. “This is not a sponsored review.” They just do a great job scrubbing the air and we love them!!,5.0 out of 5 stars
DB1,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2024","Since buying the Core 400S/Core 400S-P this unit has vastly improved our home's air quality.
The fan is not noisy at all. As any fan, the higher the setting the more sound. It's not even close to being as noisy as an actual fan unit.
Our PPM reading on first start up (at 5pm) was 016, which is great to begin with. By 10pm PPM were at a 004. The next day it went down to a 001. During remodeling, when our contractors gutted the bathroom, the PPM shot up to 037 and it brought it back down to 001 within a couple hours before they finished.
While the contractors sanded the drywall the PPM shot up to 076. By day's end PPM was 002.
A great thing about the unit is also its mobility. The handles make it easy to move. If a room smells a bit off, like musty or stagnant, placing this unit in the room or just outside the room moves air, filters it, and gets it smelling fresh/clean.
Our dog's crate is located in our office room. It was a bit odorous. One day of this unit running in the room cleared the scent up.
Thinking about buying a second unit for our unfinished basement.

Teresa,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2024","My wife has been getting random hives all over her body throughout the day. We thought it was specific foods or medication but when we stopped those for a period of time, she was still getting the same hives. Finally was able to get an appointment with an allergist and after the panel testing, they determined that she was allergic to indoor and outdoor mold spores. Our home was built in 1994 and while it is not terribly old, it is not as tight as most of the newer homes these days. Therefore, outdoor air is able to make it inside when stove fans or AC runs drawing outdoor air through cracks in doors and windows.

We purchased these so we could try to tackle her hive issue. Before these were ordered, we only had 2 smaller purifiers set up at each return vent for our upstairs AC unit. Unfortunately, those purifiers are only rated for about 365 sq ft of purification. Our whole upstairs is roughly 2k sq ft. Fast forward through 2 days of intense research, I decided to get 2 of these units and 3 more of our other units to purify our whole home in 30 minute cycles. So with the combined purifiers for our home (4600 sq ft), every 30 minutes the existing air would be purified. That sounded pretty good to me.

Not only did her hives stop, my skin became less itchy. Never really bothered me but I definitely noticed less skin irritation after we started using the combined with our other purifiers. We chose this one because of its HEPA replacement cost. It was significantly less compared to its rival COWAY airmega. So long run, this device should be easier on the pocket. We run all our air purifiers 24/7 so having the ability to set schedules on all of them is so convenient. The option to turn off the display at night is nice but since we have ours on a schedule we just leave the display off. Watching the particulate counter crank up and down showing how much work it is doing to purify the air is really neat.

I truly hope that these units last a lifetime. We are only 1 month into using these and life has gotten better. Will update with any issues or comments about the device as they arise.",5.0 out of 5 stars

It's nice that they sense the air quality and increase the speed automatically. I also like that it lets you know when it is time to change the filter element. I seem to get almost 6 months out of a filter. My only issue is the price of replacement filters. For all 6 units it was costing around $250 to change them all even with sales and discounts.

Alfonso Dee,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2023","So I was looking for an air filter for my Florida room, which is the only room in my home where I smoke cigarettes.

In the non summer months I just keep all the windows open and the room airs out. But in the summer months when the humidity is unbearable down here, I have to run an air conditioner in the room. Which means I have to close the windows, which means the cigarette smoke doesn’t air out. So it’s a dilemma for me.

It’s either sit in the room sweating and uncomfortable in the humidity with the windows open and let the smoke out - or shut the windows and use the AC and have the room filled with lingering smoke. Neither of which are ideal options.

So I figured an air filter might be a solution. I found though that it wasn’t that simple, because then it turns into which air filter to get that’s actually going to work, without breaking the bank as well.

I was trying to find the best air filter to solve this issue within a reasonable price point. I really did not want to spend more than maybe $200 or so. Before finding this one, I tried 2 others that literally did nothing, that were admittedly a bit cheaper than this one.

Then I found this one, and it was delivered the same day. I got this one today, hooked it up and did a real time test.

I put this unit on a stand in a good spot in the room, set it up, plugged it in, and the air quality in the room was reading very good - indicated by the blue ring and very low number on the screen. I then closed all the windows, turned on the AC, and then lit up a cigarette.

I purposefully blew the smoke right onto the unit every time I took a drag and exhaled. I knew immediately that this was going to work when this filter INSTANTLY detected the cigarette smoke, and the blue light ring which
means excellent air quality, turned red, and the air quality numbers on the screen jumped from around 20 (which means excellent air quality) to about 900 (which means the air quality is horrendous).

Once the machine detected the smoke, it immediately began filtering it out of the air, and I literally sat there and watched the numbers on the screen going down in real time as it was removing the smoke.

The red lights also gradually turned to orange, then green, then I left the room for 10 minutes.

When I came back in the room (which is not very big, maybe 600 sq ft tops) there was no visible smoke in the air, and the light ring was back to blue, and the air quality numbers were back well below 30. So this had cleaned the air and removed all the smoke.

This machine is beyond impressive.

Now, I will say that even though the smoke was gone in the air, there still was a lingering faint odor of cigarette smoke in the room. But I also did not give the machine a full hour to run for the test. My thinking is that if I did, it would have removed the odor as well in a bit more time.

Given what I watched this do in the short test though, and how it performed? This air filter is truly remarkable, and I’m beyond happy with this purchase so far.

I would highly recommend this product for anyone trying to deal with any kind cigarette, or other kinds of smoke in a dwelling of any kind. A ++++++",5.0 out of 5 stars

Slicky Moxy,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2024","I purchased this air purifier less than a month ago. It was in the top recommended lists of research I did and all over my tik tok fyp. I really didn't see anything negative, so I made the purchase. About a week ago, I noticed when I turned it on it would immediately turn off. I thought it might have been the outlet, so I plugged it somewhere else, and had the same result. On my 3rd attempt, it finally worked. The very next day it did the same thing. I then realized that it worked depending on how the power cord was turned. I believe there's an issue with it, but since it's not a power cord that detaches and can possibly be replaced, it simply is not gonna work. I requested a refund, but amazon is replacing it with a new one. If I have issues with the new one, I'll try the shark air purifier, but I'm really hoping everything will be ok with the new one. I really like this air purifier and I'm hoping to update this review of it. So for now, I'm giving it 3 stars.

Richard Bennett,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","Been wanting to give one of these a try for awhile now and after watching some reviews on this LEVOIT Air Purifier I decided to go for it.
The unit itself looks nice, we have ours sitting in the dining room area in a corner.

I mainly got this because when we are away from the house for several hours, and come back there is a musty type odor and we really can't figure out what the cause is. So far I have to say this has been pretty impressive, the last few times we have been away for the day and came back, the smell was not there.

We leave this running about 12 hours during the day only, this seems to work pretty good for us.
As for it being quiet, well on low speed and even the second speed you could hardly hear this thing running.
Now when I turn it on in the morning, it will ramp up to high speed for about 20 minutes or so and you definitely know it is running. But the majority of the time it is nice and quiet.
Have to say the sensors are really good and very sensitive, they pick up the air quality when we cook and adjust the fan speed, in no time the digital readout is back to normal.

flpalmtree,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2024","I recently had to get a new HVAC system. It’s a higher-end unit that has a filter in the indoor unit [some indoor units are in the garage, others in a closet inside the house], which eliminates the need to have filters in the return vents in the house.

When deciding on what type of filter to use, I found quite a few DIYers who say it’s not worth getting the really high-priced dense filters, even though those filters say they trap particles that mid-priced filters cannot. These DIYers reasoning ― the high-priced dense filters make it more difficult for air to pass through them, which requires your HVAC unit to work harder and longer, which leads to higher monthly electric bills. What they say to do instead is use the mid-priced filter and use a high quality in-room air purifier (or air purifiers in multiple rooms).

My house has an open floor plan where the kitchen, eating area, and main TV room are all, essentially, one room. So I placed this Levoit in the middle. It does a fantastic job of clearing the air! Couldn’t be happier. It’s really easy to control, whether you prefer using the buttons on the unit, controlling with an app, or controlling via Alexa. And it is very simple to change the filter.

CafeSociety,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2023","The title says a lot. Fantastic, reliable, easy, informative, accessible. The app works (almost) top notch. What I really appreciate is that they are spot on reliable using wifi apps at any location away from my house to inside my house. Their response time is fast from the app. Scheduling, setting up smart home features all run well through the app, easy to learn and use. I will be buying more, trying to get a friend to get one (two). No regrets buying them.

Not so great things that I wish they’d develop or get rid of:
Adding ability to control locally through Bluetooth (or zigby or z-wave) and not only through wifi and the cloud. This was problematic when internet was cancelled or interrupted. Thankfully they kept their schedules, but I had to run them on phone wifi hotspot to access them through the app. The base units work manually, but will keep the schedule in the app, unless you do a full reset.

The app room arrangement doesn’t really work, and their readings don’t exactly match or refresh. (But this is in development, but probably won’t take off.)

I do not like that the app can be an bit invasive on every part of my privacy/life. Like trying to get me to buy into their health tracking logging what I eat, or making it mandatory to set location etc. in setup. The ploy to be there for health to basically gain marketing data. Too many apps and even work apps play this game and it’s a bit deceptive marketing data gathering. I’m totally techy smart home and software junky, but there’s a clear line that is getting crossed. The company sends me prodding emails to track my health. I cannot get rid of the icon in the app, wish it wasn’t a part of this.

That was negative, Back to positive. Because they are fantastic. I’ve watched every YouTube video on all the brands repeatedly. I now have 4 of these and a few smaller finer filter ones from Medify, and two Winnix 5500’s. The Levoit are hands down my favorite. They are quiet and easy over wifi. I’ve turned my non-smart Winnix to smart by adding switch bots to them, but the Levoit are smart from the start. The smaller med brand one cannot be turned smart as there’s no place to put switchbots on them. They get too loud in medium and high, so I will not buy that brand again, keep with the Levoit. (Possibly try Austin Air someday, but that’s just more money.)

Levoit is Not glitchy. A favorite feature when I’m cooking in the kitchen is the number and color reading. It shoots up so fast when cooking certain ways or foods. It’s funny because a Winnix will turn orange or red in a heartbeat when I pour alcohol in a glass 4 feet away in front of it! But it doesn’t provide a number, which the Levoit 600 shows.

These filter the air so well, that when I drop peppermint oil at doorways or spots in a room (deters spiders and I think ants, I use a lot on a sailboat. Works like a charm), if my Levoit is running, it removes the essential oil smell too fast. Way too fast. It’s a battle I will not win if I run these air filters, because they work so well.",5.0 out of 5 stars

MistrRoboto,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2024","I like the idea of clean air in my house, and have been running multiple purifiers for years. All of my other units are Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty. They have been on for 5 straight years with filter changes and not a single issue.

For no good reason, I wanted to try something new with a higher sq/ft rating.

Ordered a BLUEAIR Blue Pure 211i Max and it made a weird sound right out of the box. Clicking, and the unit shook so something was out of whack. Instead of having it replaced, I returned and went with the Levoit.

As best as I can tell so far, its an excellent unit. Feels sturdy and high quality. Extremely quiet on auto mode, which runs lower than the low setting when the air is clean. Set to low, its still very quiet. High its loud, but not louder than my Coways, and the amount of air its passing is staggering.

kvolaf,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2024","This air purifier is so amazingly quiet, you can just plug it in and forget it! I love the ring of lights on top of the purifier that lights up blue when the air quality is excellent, green for when the air quality is good, and red when the air quality is bad. There is also a digital readout of the particle count in the air, for those who want a more exact information.
I use the automatic setting so I can truly forget about it. When I was making brunch that included bacon, the ring of lights turned red and the air purifier automatically kicked into high gear. Then the air purifier automatically adjusted it's fan speed as the air particle count lowered. The amazing thing is the air purifier is on the other side of my house from my kitchen!
I purchased the air purifier because my husband was suffering from allergies. Given that the pollen count was currently low and mold count was high for the area we were living in and the time of year, we suspected that mold spores in the air might be the reason for his allergies. However, when the air purifier arrived and we set it up, it showed that the air quality in our house was good. Honestly, I don't know if this means that the air purifier didn't sense mold spores, or that we actually had no mold spores in our house. However, I am happy with the quality of the air purifier and how well it works for smoke from cooking and our wood burning stove. So we are keeping it.
One thing that prospective buyers may want to keep in mind is that the instruction states that the air purifier should have a clearance of 15"" on all sides. This means that you can't just put it against the wall, like I had originally intended. But I supposed this would be true for all air purifiers as air circulation is needed.",5.0 out of 5 stars

When it is running normally (auto), I don’t hear it unless I’m sitting in silence and, even then it is not irritating… I just think, oh yeah, that’s running.
I’m not excited about replacing the filter. I never enjoy that cost. I have decided that, for the differences I have seen in ‘original’ vs. ‘knock-off’ filters, that I will spring for the originals… and I like that they haven’t tried some way to make the machine disable itself if you choose a ‘non-genuine’ option. I like them just for that!
The app has quite a number of functions/monitoring/notification settings. I like how it works.
I also bought a couple of the smaller 300 model series units and I like them very much, as well. If you have the funds, and especially if you are filtering a larger space, I would really recommend this 600 series unit.
I can/do definitely recommend this product. Other than maybe lifetime free filter replacements, there is very little I think would be an improvement… I’m so glad I found these! Thank you.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Michelle,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2023","I’ve had the core 600s for about a month. We have other, smaller levoit purifiers in our bedrooms but wanted something for a larger open living space. We live in a rental and it seems like mold is a big issue for many people in homes near us. It makes us paranoid, so anything we can do to help keep our air clean and safe is important to us! I compared this to online reviews of Air doctor and other more expensive units, and this one seems comparable at a much better price. This is a big unit, but the design is very clean and modern and it blends well with our furniture and decor. It is extremely quiet… you barely hear it on its low settings. At first I had an issue that some other reviewers were mentioning; it turns on and reads 005 and then within minutes goes to 001. I moved it around my house and was getting the same result. So that seemed suspicious to me… especially since I had turned off our other purifiers to run the experiment. So I sprayed aerosol hairspray into the room for a moment and watched the numbers. Within seconds it rose into the mid 30s and then steadily decreased as the purifier worked its magic. It seems that kicked our sensor into working order, and now it picks up little things here and there and I’ll see the numbers are not always at 001. Makes it feel like a much more accurate read. Anyway- I totally love this thing! I haven’t used the smart features yet, nor do i think I will, but it’s nice to have the option for the super tech savy or “smart home” people.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Adrian,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2024","I bought this for a small 100ft2 bedroom, overkill, I know, but that is the point. The bigger the unit, the more efficient it is, so I can get away with using a lower fan speed. This is ideal since it is quieter and won't get dirty as quickly due to the lower speed; also, if I need to clean the air ASAP, this purifier can do it quickly. Although, it is a bit louder than the 400s. It also has the same variety of modes and settings to tinker with and the device is pretty easy on the eyes. The app used to control the device is also very well made, which I found a bit surprising since companion apps tend to be mediocre at best.

However, the air sensor is not the most reliable since it only detects the air in the immediate vicinity, but I knew this before purchasing it. For a more accurate air quality level, I suggest a separate air quality detector. The filters are also on the pricier side, but they supposedly last 6 months. After two weeks of use, mine is hardly dirty and I have a dog, a bird, as well as a steady flow of food odors.

Overall, I am satisfied with the performance, it leaves my room with the faint smell of a freshly cleaned hotel room. The purifier also does does not emit ozone, if that is a concern. It was for me due to my pets as well as general health concerns.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Shaun,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024","The purifier eventually started making a loud groaning sound that would constantly migrate up and down in pitch, and occasionally fluctuate. It started doing this towards the end of the 2-year warranty period. I eventually opened it up and found that the sound was coming from the air sampler mounted to the side of the top. I'm guessing the bearings went bad in the tiny fan for the sampler (since the sampler runs 24/7, regardless of whether the purifier is running), because it makes a buzzing noise when it's sitting by itself. Once it's mounted into the casing, that's when the buzz turns into the groaning sound.
To fix this, you can just remove the sensor module. There's a connector on the side of the sensor that you can just disconnect. The unit runs fine without it, though it will no longer display the current air quality. Also, auto mode obviously doesn't work. If you try to put it in auto, it lights up just the third LED above the speed indicator, which I'm guessing is some diagnostic code for the factory. It doesn't look like the sensor is available for individual purchase, so the purifier will never be fully functional again.
Having taken this apart, and even ignoring the sensor failing, I can say without a doubt that this should NOT cost $300. There is very little to it, and they're definitely overcharging their customers. It's well-built in general, but probably costs them a fraction of that price to make. They also gouge on the replacement filters. The filters should cost $10, $20 MAX. Not the absurd $60 they charge. Just take an air hose and blow out the filter from the inside. Just make sure you do it outside, far from any windows or doors, because the filter holds a LOT of dust.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I have two Alexa Air quality meters that give the same readings. They will give a rating between 0 and 99. 99 is the highest air quality. I've owned purifiers that could get to 98-99 in the down stairs (owned two filters). I had to replace them both so I have tried several in an attempt to replace them since I could no longer get filters for the old ones. The Honeywell HPA5300b's could get the numbers to 95-98 but out of 6 I purchase I had to return 4 due to noise issues. So i used the honeywells upstairs. So I bought the Levoit 600s for downstairs. I loved the levoits on paper. But at night they sensor read 83 before bed so I thought, I'll just turn it up to Turbo mode so the air is clean in the morning. I woke up and the air quality had dropped to 80. They did a better job cleaning at medium than they did on Turbo. That tells me that they didn't size the filter correctly and I've read countless comments online that they are not HEPA filters which could explain alot. In order to get the air movement they are claiming (and they do blow hard if you put them to turbo), the filters would have to be huge or very porous. When it comes down to it, I returned both of the ones I bought. I went on to buy Coway Airmega 400s. The Airmegas actually clean the air. They got to 96 on high run over night, but their app sucks, in the end the Airmegas work with Alex. So thats good enough for me.

Don Battles,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2024","So my purchase of the Levoit CORE400s was driven by a few factors.

It’s well regarded by its users and reviewers.

It was on sale plus a $25 dollar coupon (only good for one unit).

The room/space I keep my kitty’s litter box gets air drawn down the hallway by the HVAC return. Draws bad orders into the rest of the house.

Aside from the smells from kitty I assumed my air quality was poor/bad.

Upon turning on the unit and putting turning the fan on I was surprised by two things. The fan is SUPER quiet and my air quality was immediately assessed as “good” (blue ring 2.5 ppm). So it would appear the air quality inside my home is pretty good.

I also installed the VeSync app and connected my new device, could not have been easier! So now I can track air quality over time (hours,days,weeks) to how things may change. As for smells after a few hours the odors from kitty’s litter box seem less strong. Also, FWIW, it’s cleaned daily and I use PrettyLitter.

Texas Son,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2024","Pros:
Moves a ton of air
Noise is not too bad for the volume of air it moves. The air moving across the fan blades is fine, it's the air moving through the filter that makes the noise.
Alexa integration

Cons:
VeSync network is laggy
Air quality detection is not very good
Display mounted on the top where you can't see it unless you are right next to it.

I bought this unit for my ""cigar room."" It is rated for 3X the square footage of my room and it really moves a lot of air. If you are close to it then it is obviously going to be noisy, so be realistic before complaining. Do you want a quiet or do you want it to move a lot of air?

It filters really well, even though I don't have the ""smoke filter"" in it, and there is no doubt it's going to have a positive effect on the cigar smell.

I have my unit about 3 or 4 feet off the floor because the cigar smoke goes up, not down, and it works much better that way. In fact I can see it drawing the smoke toward it from 5 feet away. For non-smokers, I'm sure on the floor is fine.

However…

The sensor to detect smoke and adjust is not very good at all. Depending on the cigar, I can be 5 feet away from the unit and it tells me the air quality is ""good."" Good? Really? I have an older Taotronics unit I bought 3 or 4 years ago that responds to the smoke just as well, even at its age, so I always have to change the speed manually, through Alexa (see complaints on that, below). Understandably, most people won't be happy with this, but I would be setting it to high anyway because I want it to filter as much smoke out of the air as it possibly can. I don't think any unit is going to be sensitive enough to do that. In fact, a sensitivity setting should absolutely be included on these units.

As others have complained, Alexa tells me the unit is off-line way too much, but I think this is a problem with the VeSync network, not the unit itself. I have a toaster oven that also uses VeSync and it often behaves the same way. Anyway, even though it says it's off-line, it will usually respond 30 or so seconds later. For the most part, the response time is very laggy. Only once has it responded normally, within one or 2 seconds. But again, I blame VeSync.

The display is kind of cool, but it's on the top where literally no one will see it unless they are right next to it. So, beyond using it for manual control, it's 95% useless. It's one of those ""I wonder what the air quality is? I don't know, let me whip out my phone, open the app, log in and look. Or I have to get up and walk over to the machine."" A side-mounted air quality digital display would have been a smart addition.

JB,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024","I purchased the LEVOIT Air Purifier (Core 600S) in April 2023, and it has been a game changer for our home. We have pets, suffer from bad seasonal allergies, and often deal with lingering cooking smells. This purifier has handled all of these challenges with ease.

The air in our home feels noticeably fresher. It detects contaminants in the air and will adjust fan speeds accordingly. The smart WiFi functionality and Alexa control make it incredibly convenient to adjust settings without getting up.

A particularly impressive moment was when we had friends stay over who are extremely allergic to cats. We ran the purifier on high before they arrived, and they had no issues at all with our cat. They stayed again and we forgot to use the air purifier (we did some projects and had moved/unplugged the device) and they had an allergic reaction to the cat.

Overall, it’s a powerful, versatile air purifier that covers large spaces effectively. If you're dealing with pets, allergies, or just want cleaner air, this is an excellent choice. Highly recommend!",5.0 out of 5 stars

For context of how well it works- the air quality light would be blue, my husband would cook something and the smell would loft through the house- the air quality light would immediately turn orange, slowly turning to green and then back to blue. Within ~20 minutes, no more smell.

Jules Kitty,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2024","I do not recommend! Save your money!!

Not only does this unit have very expensive filters, it doesn’t have a prefilter that can be replaced. The carbon layer is built into the filter in the inner layer, and it is well known that activated charcoal does not last as long as a hepa filter, so the “smell fighting” is basically non-existent. In my Honeywell you can replace the pre-filter and what a world of a difference it makes!

The Levoit does NOT filter smells! It just pushes that stink around, which is so disappointing! Honestly it makes me wonder if it really is doing anything to the air.

I run my Honeywell purifier in the same room and it takes out all the litter box smells and you can even tell it’s there. The Levoit pushes that smell throughout the whole house as it jets the air in and out of it!

My unit has been working great for nearly two years now. It makes a great difference to air quality especially when cooking. The app and filter connect with Alexa, allowing me to easily tell it to switch to Turbo mode when searing meat etc, getting a jump on the smoke and avoiding it ever getting too bad. Previously I would open two doors and run a fan to cycle the air. Not necessary any more! In daily life, this has significantly reduced cat allergies for two regular guests, and has reduced my baseline PM5 when first installing the filter from 35 to a consistent 2-3 per the app. Filters are not exactly cheap, but they do the job and if desired, there are alternatives available on Amazon.

I have a lot of allergies so we're trying to find something that will keep the air more clean in our home. We got central air last year so that made it a little easier to keep the windows shut. Still a lot of dust gets in because of people driving by. It's interesting to see it fluctuate depending on how often the doors getting open and closed during the day. It's stayed at the lowest setting during the week but once all the grandkids were over and going in and out of the house it shot up to the midpoint for most of the day until after they were gone and then back down to a one. I'll put another review in here after a month to let you know how it's going. I did go around the house just dust everything to see how long it takes for everything to get covered again.

Smallcapceo,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2024","Ok… we confess we bought this and a smaller version out of desperation due to a dead animal smell. We even bought the VOC absorber filters as well. We were convinced due to a recent rat sighting on our cameras that a rat had either died inside our attic or nearby. After calling an exterminator. We found the beast in a wire duct outside, but the duct leads to our air handler inside. It had only been three days in Florida heat before the smell was unbearable. We installed these air purifiers and I can say without hesitation they did nothing to suck up or abate the smell. We have since moved the purifiers into a more logical area and they are oversized for our needs. After a full two days of running we can tell you that they do not kill dead animal smell.

Matthew Rothenberg,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2024","We've had a few different air purifiers and I decided to upgrade the one in our bedroom after me and my wife both had itchy eyes and woke up stuffed up for a few weeks in a row.

For context, we have two double coated dogs who shed like crazy, we live in a town that is 65% conservation land, IE a lot of nature so there is a ton of pollen, ragweed, etc.

After putting this (600) in our large bedroom we almost instantly stopped getting itchy eyes and stuffed up noses. FYI, neither of us have allergies as far as we know but there is only so much anyone can take before their body starts fighting back and even with the other air purifier in the room, it wasn't working well enough even on high.

As soon as I set up this new one and put it aon auto-mode it kicked into high gear and cleaned the air within a minute.

Having another and larger air purifier in our living room on another floor of the house, I decided that I would replace it, but wait until the filter needed to be changed. Well, after a few weeks I decided I couldn't wait any longer, especially now that this went on sale. So I bought a 2nd one, got it the next day and after the setting it up in 2 minutes and connecting it to the app, it did the same thing as the first one...IE it recognized the air wasn't clean, kicked into high gear for a bit and now has been steadily on low showing 1pm / 2.5 since.

Sure it goes back into high hear if we open a window for a bit, or we're cooking, etc but that's exactly what you want it to do. Even on high it's quiet and i know that it's recognizing there is something in the air that should be filtered out and it does it so effectively.

I've also done my research and these products rank right at the top with more expensive options on the market so I know it's good bang for your buck.,

Lastly, it does (as all air purifiers do) recommend that you have at least 18 inches of space all around it. I have mine in places where this is not possible bc I dont want it sitting in the middle of the room. I bring this up bc I'm sure if I did, it would work even better but I'm not sure I can imagine how it could work better.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Wyatt,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2023","1-Year Update:

I've had 2 Everest Air units in my 1-bedroom apartment for a little over a year now and thought I'd come back to update. All in all, I can say this is still a 5-star product and still one of the best on the market. Everything I said originally still is true to this day. No issues whatsoever to report with either unit. The one and only negative thing I can possibly find is the cost of the replacement filters, which are $99 each, and never seem to go on sale. I have to change both filters pretty much twice a year. The first change I did I tried an off-brand that was less than 1/2 the price, but they did not fit the unit quite right and left a gap, and noticeably did not perform as well. When I just changed them a few days ago I bit the bullet and spent the $200 on the real filters and it was nice to have them fit snugly into the machines.

Original Review:

Love my Levoit EverestAir! I researched air purifiers for over a month, trying to determine which had the best performance, quality filter, and lots of modern features. I watched hours of video reviews, sorted through articles, and evaluated each, including Levoit, of course, Dyson, Mila, Molekule, Coway, and Blueair, just to name the most popular that I looked at. When it came down to it, the Levoit EverestAir has the best of what I was looking for – so much so that I just ordered a second one to put in my bedroom!

FILTRATION: Like another reviewer mentioned, starting at the filter and then working your way back is best, and the filter on this thing is a beast! It is massive and has a large amount of carbon pellets that you can actually see. Many other brands use a tiny sheet of carbon that does almost nothing to capture VOCs or odors, but Levoit packed a ton of carbon pellets into this filter. Plus, the laser air quality monitoring is the best you can get. It reacts almost immediately, maybe a 5-10 second delay, to any change in the air quality. I notice that it kicks up right when I expect it to.

DESIGN: It is definitely not a ""small"" machine, but it also isn't the largest. It is sleek and looks nice in my living room, considering it is powerful enough to clean my entire 900 sq.ft. apartment. The display gives you all of the information you need without being an obnoxiously bright touchscreen monitor. I really like that you can control the display or enable the ""light detection"" mode which would be great for a bedroom as it automatically lowers the fan speed and turns off the display when it gets dark.

APP: The app is great, I have had a Levoit Core 200 for several years and it is still running perfectly to this day, which also uses the same app as the EverestAir. However, the main difference is the EverestAir app is PACKED with features. You can view everything you can on the machine itself, like air quality %, PM1.0, 2.5, and 10, change the fan speed or place it in auto mode, view the filter life, and turn the display on or off.

PRICE: Considering some of the competitors like Dyson and Molekule can reach $800 after tax, the EverestAir is a great value! Of course the sticker shock can be a bit jarring, but overall it is 100% worth it.

DOES IT HELP PURIFY: It sure does! I suffer from severe seasonal allergies in both the spring and fall, and when I was home, I did not have to take any allergy medications, eye drops, or nose sprays whatsoever and I have EverestAir to thank for that! I sleep better and my furniture stays cleaner with the particulates being filtered out of the air before they have a chance to settle. My apartment is brand new and there was a bit of construction dust still in the air, in the carpet, and on the walls, and I am confident this is keeping that at bay, too, while the carbon is absorbing any Formaldehyde offgassing from the fresh paint.

THE BOTTOM LINE: If you're on the fence about ordering the EverestAir and are looking at any of the brands I mentioned, absolutely buy the EverestAir! You will not regret it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2024","We live in the desert so I bought this to remove some of the dust that gets into the house. It works great. It removes almost all the dust and any dusty smells that go with it. It is a larger machine and can remove almost all the dust in half of the whole house. I put it on high in the morning when I get up. Within an hour I kick it down to ""Auto"" mode as it has lowered the dust to almost nothing. Auto mode controls the fan according to how much dust it senses. It works very well. The sleep mode drops it so quiet I have to check it sometimes to see if it is actually running. The Wifi just makes it easier so I don't have to get up to change it. I can just pull it up on my phone and use the app to adjust it. We just bought this so its not been used enough to rate durability. It seems to be well built, but only time will tell. Its not cheap enough to just go out and buy another if it dies, so I'm hoping it lasts. Further posts will be made if it breaks.",5.0 out of 5 stars
SLM,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2021","I have owned this product for less than 24 hours as of this writing. More updates as I have more to say/remember to do them. Also, I will be very verbose, the sort of in-depth information I want when I am researching products over $99 for purchase, so you really know what's going on. Hopefully it helps, but it may be TL;DR for some.

My background: I am not a smoker and never have been. I was raised by a chain smoker and have spent the majority of my life around second hand smoke from parents, family and friends. I have stress induced asthma and have also been through experimental chemotherapy that has apparently permanently damaged my lungs. Over time, my lungs are slowly degrading, and as they do I become more and more sensitive to more and more things, which trigger my lungs to get irritated and produce phlegm to coat my lungs and prevent the irritation, which causes me to cough more and more over time. (It has been a lot of fun having this sort of lung disorder during the pandemic, let me tell you.)

""Well, why don't you see a doctor then?"" you may reasonably ask. My experience with doctors in the past has consisted of watching both my mother and grandmother die with (no joke) 30+ prescriptions each all at once (with 3 to 5 doctors all prescribing simultaneously and admitting to me in private that A) they were not consulting with one another, and B) nobody on earth could possibly keep track of the side effects of so many prescriptions at once), and my uncle wasn't far off that number when he died. I also have repeated personal experience with the medical industry that strongly supports my experience and belief that going to the doctor is going to be a financially insane choice (whether or not I have insurance) that I get little to nothing out of regardless. So I choose to avoid doctors and the medical/drug big business establishment like the plague whenever possible.

When I realized recently that my lungs were noticeably irritated all the time when I was in my own home, but I was fine if I went outside, I decided it was time to step up my game. Enter this unit, which I researched before buying.

My unit is brand new, not a returned unit. Upon turning it on, it told me that my air in all areas of the house tested was as good as it gets, with a reading of 001. This did not please me, because I know it's nowhere near that good. So I did an update of the firmware to see if that would fix the issue, and it did. The new display read 005, which was significantly lower than I expected, but the unit reduced that to 3, then 2, then 1 relatively quickly.

Within about 15 minutes, the air in my (door closed) office started to smell noticeably different. Lighter, cleaner, fresher, more neutral. I was surprised. I also noted that over the next few hours, my coughing decreased significantly as long as I stayed in my office.

When bed time came, I put the unit in my bedroom and turned it on full blast with the doors closed while I went to the kitchen to have a snack. At first, the bedroom registered 5. The unit quickly brought it down to 1. I noted that my coughing increased when I was in parts of the house that had not had the benefit of this device to clean the air.

Returning to my bedroom after my snack, I noted that once again, there was a nice difference in how the air smelled in my bedroom compared to my kitchen.

Normally it takes me a while to stop coughing enough to fall asleep when I got to bed each night, but last night while there was still coughing before sleep, it was markedly less, which my girlfriend commented on today. This morning, I woke up to the pleasant realization that my lungs did not feel irritated for the first time in a long time. I hadn't even realized how irritated my lungs were when I would usually awaken until it was gone.

Moved the unit into my home office again, and turned it back on. It started at 5, and again rapidly cleaned the air until it was at 1. Then I began doing more experiments. I noted that when the AC kicks on, it goes from 1 to 2 or 3. When it turns off, the unit returns it to 1. When I open the door to my office, it goes to 2, and then back to 1 when I close it. When my cat walks into my office, it goes from 1 to 2 if I close the door after him, and stays there for as long as he is moving around. If I pet him, it goes to 3.

Thinking this level of sensitivity was too good to be true, I decided to try further experiments. I closed my office door again, waited until it settled down, and sprayed some air freshener in my office. No change - it evaporated. Just as expected. Then I went down the hall and into my living room and lit a stick of natural compressed sandalwood powder incense. I returned to my office and closed the door. Within 2 minutes, this unit detected the incense in the air, rising to a 4-5-6 and then back to 3 when the AC turned off. The next AC cycle, it jumped into the teens, and then into the 20's, 30's, 40's as the smoke got going during the next cycle. When the count hit 45, it turned the ring green and stepped the fan up a notch.

I found that I could watch the numbers go up when the AC was on, and down when it was off. It got up to around 86 at one point, and the ring sometime before that turned orange and stepped the speed up another notch. Now that the incense has burned out, it's dropping, with highs in the 50's, and lows i the 20's and cycling lower each time the AC kicks on again. It's been interesting to see it power up and down to match the particulates in the air.

Build quality seems good, but the bottom can come off easier than I'd like. A couple times now I have tried to lift it only to find that it had un-screwed and the bottom and filter were not lifted with the rest of the unit. Easily fixed in a second or less, but if the bottom had a bit of ""click into place"", this would not happen when moving the unit.

It is so quiet in sleep mode that last night when we went to bed, after I had it running on high for a few minutes while we had our snack before bed, that even three feet from it, my girlfriend could not tell if it was running and asked. This was with the AC not active. That's pretty darned quiet. It also was no issue for me to handle, and I am extremely sensitive to sound when I am trying to sleep.

The top two levels of fan speed are relatively loud, with the highest speed being louder than my AC when it's kicked in. It is, however, the most smooth and beautiful white noise I have ever encountered, and I am an audio engineer.

So far my experience with this is almost entirely good. Here;s what I don't like.

1. The bottom unscrews too easily. No big deal, but irksome.
2. The sensor didn't work when I got it until I updated the firmware, which forced me to download the app, sign up, and then give the app location permissions and blue tooth permissions. I also naturally had to sign it into my wifi network. I didn't want to use the app, or give the app these permissions. The app, however, will not run without them. Ostensibly, it uses location data to give you a report on local 2.5um particulate levels in your area (which it does), but I don't know what else it is being used for, and I don't much like having my location tracked by Google and every other company on earth these days.

So far so good. It appears that particulates in my house are probably not as much of an issue as what those particulates are made of, and that I need to be more focused on reducing VOCs in the air in my house. But so far this unit has helped me breathe significantly better, and I'm very happy with how well it works.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Tech49,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2023","Update August 2024 -- Levoit sent me a replacement for the issue. I'm updating my review to reflect the great customer service provided.

Update July 2024 -- Unfortunately my air purifier has started making a nasty grinding noise coming the air sensor on the left side. I have included a video of what it sounds like. It's loud/jarring enough that it has woken me up several times in the middle of the night. Disconnecting the purifier from power for a couple hours is the only thing that seems to help but the issue comes back randomly. I've reached out to Levoit for help but they've giving me the runaround.

Original Review -- I've owned so many air purifiers from BlueAir to Levoit to Dyson to Mila. The Levoit EverestAir has been the best so far for several reasons:

1. The filter itself. Always start with the filter and work your way backwards with air purifiers. Some really fancy air purifiers (like one from a company that sound like molecule) don't really filter much of anything and its pure hype. The Levoit Everest has a high quality HEPA-13 filter that also has proper granules of activated carbon to absorb VOCs. It also has a fabric type ""seal"" around the filter so it's snug when you install it to minimize unfiltered air bypass. There is also a nice pre-filter (which you should clean weekly or every 2 weeks) that catches the bigger particles that would otherwise degrade the life of the main HEPA filter.

2. The sensors. They're really accurate and respond instantly to changes in air quality. When I say instant, I don't mean 5 seconds, I mean within 1 second. The app also shows you these readings in realtime with accurate historic information as well. The sensors do not measure temperature, humidity, or VOCs, but I found that this is actually a good thing; the VOC and Humidity/temp sensors suffer from drift over time and will lose their calibration and accuracy. These are advanced laser-based (not infrared like in most other air purifiers) particle sensors that will last the life of the unit.

(updated June 14th 2023):
One big thing to note: this unit doesn't sugarcoat. The particle sensors are so precise that you will constantly get readings in the PM1.0, 2.5, and 10 ranges. This is perfectly normal of any living space as stuff is constantly being generated; even by yourself. The air purifiers that give you 0s for any of these readings for more than a few seconds are indicative of infrared sensors that are less accurate.

3. How quiet it is. Even on level ""3"" which is the highest that it can go automatically, it's not loud. At level ""1"", you just hear a low hum. It's amazing how quiet it is. Things start to get loud when you use ""turbo"" mode, but you'd only use that mode in case of an emergency.

(updated June 14th 2023):
4. The app. It's far more feature rich than I was expecting. It's so fast and responsive that you can get away with keeping the screen locked perpetually (if you have kids or nosy dogs) and just using the app and automations to control the air purifier. It also doesn't mind if you're using a separate IoT wifi network. (for those ultra concerned about security) there are no features lost by using a secure IoT network.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I sent the first one back within the 30 days, Amazon sent me out a replacement, this one works as promised, the laser smart sensor works as described, I have had it now for over 3 months and it has been working like a charm, once again Amazon has amazing customer support they took back the first one and in two days had the replacement just wanted to give it sometime before doing another update, this is my favorite easy to use efficient air cleaner yet, the 360° filter is so easy to replace I have asthma and this has helped me breathe much better, if they made one of these even bigger with this type of circular drum filter, I would buy it in a heartbeat",5.0 out of 5 stars
Texas Son,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2024","Pros:
Moves a ton of air
Noise is not too bad for the volume of air it moves. The air moving across the fan blades is fine, it's the air moving through the filter that makes the noise.
Alexa integration

Cons:
VeSync network is laggy
Air quality detection is not very good
Display mounted on the top where you can't see it unless you are right next to it.

I bought this unit for my ""cigar room."" It is rated for 3X the square footage of my room and it really moves a lot of air. If you are close to it then it is obviously going to be noisy, so be realistic before complaining. Do you want a quiet or do you want it to move a lot of air?

It filters really well, even though I don't have the ""smoke filter"" in it, and there is no doubt it's going to have a positive effect on the cigar smell.

I have my unit about 3 or 4 feet off the floor because the cigar smoke goes up, not down, and it works much better that way. In fact I can see it drawing the smoke toward it from 5 feet away. For non-smokers, I'm sure on the floor is fine.

However…

The sensor to detect smoke and adjust is not very good at all. Depending on the cigar, I can be 5 feet away from the unit and it tells me the air quality is ""good."" Good? Really? I have an older Taotronics unit I bought 3 or 4 years ago that responds to the smoke just as well, even at its age, so I always have to change the speed manually, through Alexa (see complaints on that, below). Understandably, most people won't be happy with this, but I would be setting it to high anyway because I want it to filter as much smoke out of the air as it possibly can. I don't think any unit is going to be sensitive enough to do that. In fact, a sensitivity setting should absolutely be included on these units.

As others have complained, Alexa tells me the unit is off-line way too much, but I think this is a problem with the VeSync network, not the unit itself. I have a toaster oven that also uses VeSync and it often behaves the same way. Anyway, even though it says it's off-line, it will usually respond 30 or so seconds later. For the most part, the response time is very laggy. Only once has it responded normally, within one or 2 seconds. But again, I blame VeSync.

The display is kind of cool, but it's on the top where literally no one will see it unless they are right next to it. So, beyond using it for manual control, it's 95% useless. It's one of those ""I wonder what the air quality is? I don't know, let me whip out my phone, open the app, log in and look. Or I have to get up and walk over to the machine."" A side-mounted air quality digital display would have been a smart addition.

If I post an update, it won't be because something good happened. :-)",4.0 out of 5 stars
Matthew Rothenberg,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2024","We've had a few different air purifiers and I decided to upgrade the one in our bedroom after me and my wife both had itchy eyes and woke up stuffed up for a few weeks in a row.

For context, we have two double coated dogs who shed like crazy, we live in a town that is 65% conservation land, IE a lot of nature so there is a ton of pollen, ragweed, etc.

After putting this (600) in our large bedroom we almost instantly stopped getting itchy eyes and stuffed up noses. FYI, neither of us have allergies as far as we know but there is only so much anyone can take before their body starts fighting back and even with the other air purifier in the room, it wasn't working well enough even on high.

As soon as I set up this new one and put it aon auto-mode it kicked into high gear and cleaned the air within a minute.

Having another and larger air purifier in our living room on another floor of the house, I decided that I would replace it, but wait until the filter needed to be changed. Well, after a few weeks I decided I couldn't wait any longer, especially now that this went on sale. So I bought a 2nd one, got it the next day and after the setting it up in 2 minutes and connecting it to the app, it did the same thing as the first one...IE it recognized the air wasn't clean, kicked into high gear for a bit and now has been steadily on low showing 1pm / 2.5 since.

Sure it goes back into high hear if we open a window for a bit, or we're cooking, etc but that's exactly what you want it to do. Even on high it's quiet and i know that it's recognizing there is something in the air that should be filtered out and it does it so effectively.

I've also done my research and these products rank right at the top with more expensive options on the market so I know it's good bang for your buck.,

Lastly, it does (as all air purifiers do) recommend that you have at least 18 inches of space all around it. I have mine in places where this is not possible bc I dont want it sitting in the middle of the room. I bring this up bc I'm sure if I did, it would work even better but I'm not sure I can imagine how it could work better.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Don Battles,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2024","So my purchase of the Levoit CORE400s was driven by a few factors.

It’s well regarded by its users and reviewers.

It was on sale plus a $25 dollar coupon (only good for one unit).

The room/space I keep my kitty’s litter box gets air drawn down the hallway by the HVAC return. Draws bad orders into the rest of the house.

Aside from the smells from kitty I assumed my air quality was poor/bad.

Upon turning on the unit and putting turning the fan on I was surprised by two things. The fan is SUPER quiet and my air quality was immediately assessed as “good” (blue ring 2.5 ppm). So it would appear the air quality inside my home is pretty good.

I also installed the VeSync app and connected my new device, could not have been easier! So now I can track air quality over time (hours,days,weeks) to how things may change. As for smells after a few hours the odors from kitty’s litter box seem less strong. Also, FWIW, it’s cleaned daily and I use PrettyLitter.

Still a lot of dust gets in because of people driving by. It's interesting to see it fluctuate depending on how often the doors getting open and closed during the day. It's stayed at the lowest setting during the week but once all the grandkids were over and going in and out of the house it shot up to the midpoint for most of the day until after they were gone and then back down to a one. I'll put another review in here after a month to let you know how it's going. I did go around the house just dust everything to see how long it takes for everything to get covered again.

The app and filter connect with Alexa, allowing me to easily tell it to switch to Turbo mode when searing meat etc, getting a jump on the smoke and avoiding it ever getting too bad. Previously I would open two doors and run a fan to cycle the air. Not necessary any more! In daily life, this has significantly reduced cat allergies for two regular guests, and has reduced my baseline PM5 when first installing the filter from 35 to a consistent 2-3 per the app. Filters are not exactly cheap, but they do the job and if desired, there are alternatives available on Amazon.

The app is easy and simple to use with built in settings for auto off and on so you don't need to program a long tedious schedule of off times and on times.
I noticed a measurable difference with the 24 hours I've had them. My house smells fresher and cleaner. I returned home from a quick errand and the house didn't smell. (You know it's bad if you smell your own house.)
Prior to receiving them, I did a thorough dusting, vacuuming and shampooed the carpets. My house was long overdue for a deep clean. I and my family were waking up with headaches, coughing, sneezing, just overall feeling unwell for what seems like years. Falling asleep was difficult due to an indescribable uncomfort too.
I had the idea it is probably the dust build up, as one night I finally had a clearing of my sinuses and I smelled old dusty dust really thick. And I'm not one to dust often which is not good but lesson learned.

I live in a 100 year old craftsman house on a gravel driveway on a very busy countryside road. We have a dog and 2 cats and they are about 70/30 indoor outdoor pets respectively.

Jack Ruby Built The Pyramids,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2024","***Minor update***
I forgot to mention the 'app' for this device. If you are buying this for the Wifi or app control - I highly recommend you reconsider using this app (or *any* app on your phone) to control silly things like an air purifier or a light bulb. This app, like many other apps, require invasive permissions in order to mine your data (track your location, track your contacts, etc). Additionally, once these things are connected to your WiFi network they now have the ability to scan other things on your network and potentially mine data from those devices for sending back to the manufacturer (95% of the cases this goes back to the Chinese manufacturer.)
So, just keep things like this in mind when you decide to take advantage of the ""smart features"" of devices and apps. It's not just the device the app has access to - it will have access to just about anything connected to your network.
Aside from this caveat - I still love this purifier - it is surprisingly effective!

Litefever,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2023","We purchased one of these on sale in the hope it would help moderate the severity of pollen season in upstate NY and the dander generated by two large labradors. It has a nice, clean look and small foot print, which we feel is important.

The HEPA filter was shipped inside it in a bag that needs to be removed but doing so was incredibly quick and easy to do. Twist the top a quarter turn and place to one side. Lift out the filter, remove the bag, lower the filter back in using the two tabs provided on it for that purpose, lift the lid back on and quarter twist to close. It takes 2 mins. Then its' plug-in, turn on and choose """"Auto"" or a fan speed using the touch sensitive panel on top. You can control it from your iphone if you're into that but it certainly isn't necessary.

The first thing we noticed is how quiet it is. Effectively soundless in sleep mode and at fan speed 1. Barely noticeable at fan speed 2, unless you're right next to it, noticeable at fan speed 3 when you are in the same room as it but not obnoxious. Noticeably louder at fan speed 4 which should be considered a 'Turbo"" mode. Then we noticed the impact of running it - vastly reduced swelling of the eyes and sinuses of those suffering from hay fever and a significant reduction in the doggy smell of our labradors. It works really well.

We have taken advantage of the ability to control this by iPhone to set a schedule where it automatically runs in sleep mode (low, continuous fan) from 10pm to 5am. Then at fan speed 2 from 5am to 5:30am, ramping up to fan speed 3 from 5:30am to 8am before switching to auto from 8am to 10pm. Because of the relatively severe allergies suffered by a couple of our family members the P2.5 micron threshold is set to 2 ug per meter cubed and this filter has been able to attain that incredibly low level with that schedule within a few hours of all windows and doors to the outside being closed to the 1800 sq. ft area it services. At this point we have an oasis for our hay fever sufferers to return to each evening and it's made an incredible difference to their comfort. Do they still take Claritin or Allegra during pollen season? Yes, we've found it necessary to deal with the pollen at work and in the garden. Are they doing better than they were before we got this filter? Yes, the continuously swollen and itchy, weeping eyes are gone. The inflamed nasal passages are gone. Their sleep deprivation is gone. Their quality of life has improved dramatically. We had no idea how dramatic an impact adding a quality, appropriately sized HEPA filtration system would have. This unit is rated for something like 3000 sq. ft. We're using to control air quality in a 1800 sq.f.t open plan area and its doing a great job of that without having to run the fan at high speed for prolonged periods of time.

We've had this for several weeks now and experienced 1st hand how well it can deal with really terrible air quality when the smoke from the fires in Quebec blew into NY. Opening the door to come into the house with the shopping during the worst of it briefly dropped the air quality from a PM2.5 of 001 to as high as a PM2.5 of 185 within 12 feet of the door. This was then quickly reduced to a PM2.5 of less than 20 in an hour and back to 001 in about 2 hours after the door was closed. The outside airs PM2.5 was apparently North of 300 at this time (sources accuweather and the news), the air was literally a hazy brown like smog and this filter was able to detect it, automatically adjust its fan speed to clear it and maintain perfect air quality in the house.

Does it work? Absolutely, quietly and brilliantly.

Would we buy this again? Yes, in fact we have so that we can control the air quality for one of our allergy sufferers in another area where they have to spend prolonged periods of time. That one's been in place for about 3 weeks and has done exactly what we hoped it would do - improve the quality of life at work in a 7000 sq.ft. open plan office area. Now this is well beyond the manufacturers claimed coverage for a unit and it looks like they're right based on who's apparently benefiting and who isn't but here's the important point. The benefits to the workforce have been so noticeable to management they're now considering upgrading the offices HVAC system to include HEPA filtration. I think that speaks volumes.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sls701,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2024","We have two large breed dogs. When I would come home from work or traveling, I would notice a “dog smell”. Drove me crazy. Read the reviews on this air purifier and gave it a try. It is nothing short of OUTSTANDING. I wish I would have purchased the 2 pack.
For context of how well it works- the air quality light would be blue, my husband would cook something and the smell would loft through the house- the air quality light would immediately turn orange, slowly turning to green and then back to blue. Within ~20 minutes, no more smell.

llivingstons,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2024",I have been pleased with this product since purchase. Preparation included cleaning the furnace and heat pump vents across the house. This helped significantly to reduce pollen and other bacteria across the house. We also cleaned the carpets and fireplace to ensure the whole house was at the same level of cleanliness. The unit excels in identifying increased scents whether good or bad. It really helped our home to maintain proper levels and reduce the PM 2.5 pollen challenges experienced before we cleaned and sanitized our home. At the slightest changes in foreign bacteria/elevated scents the unit turns on and eradicates the smell then goes back to standby mode and also sends you a message of what it did and what it about to do. Really next level technology that scrubs the air when needed without wasting energy. We have Levoit products across our home and love the piece of mind they provide. We have 2-600S for the large rooms; 2-400S for the smaller areas; 3-300 series for the bedrooms. “This is not a sponsored review.” They just do a great job scrubbing the air and we love them!!,5.0 out of 5 stars
DB1,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2024","Since buying the Core 400S/Core 400S-P this unit has vastly improved our home's air quality.
The fan is not noisy at all. As any fan, the higher the setting the more sound. It's not even close to being as noisy as an actual fan unit.
Our PPM reading on first start up (at 5pm) was 016, which is great to begin with. By 10pm PPM were at a 004. The next day it went down to a 001. During remodeling, when our contractors gutted the bathroom, the PPM shot up to 037 and it brought it back down to 001 within a couple hours before they finished.
While the contractors sanded the drywall the PPM shot up to 076. By day's end PPM was 002.
A great thing about the unit is also its mobility. The handles make it easy to move. If a room smells a bit off, like musty or stagnant, placing this unit in the room or just outside the room moves air, filters it, and gets it smelling fresh/clean.
Our dog's crate is located in our office room. It was a bit odorous. One day of this unit running in the room cleared the scent up.

Teresa,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2024","My wife has been getting random hives all over her body throughout the day. We thought it was specific foods or medication but when we stopped those for a period of time, she was still getting the same hives. Finally was able to get an appointment with an allergist and after the panel testing, they determined that she was allergic to indoor and outdoor mold spores. Our home was built in 1994 and while it is not terribly old, it is not as tight as most of the newer homes these days. Therefore, outdoor air is able to make it inside when stove fans or AC runs drawing outdoor air through cracks in doors and windows.

We purchased these so we could try to tackle her hive issue. Before these were ordered, we only had 2 smaller purifiers set up at each return vent for our upstairs AC unit. Unfortunately, those purifiers are only rated for about 365 sq ft of purification. Our whole upstairs is roughly 2k sq ft. Fast forward through 2 days of intense research, I decided to get 2 of these units and 3 more of our other units to purify our whole home in 30 minute cycles. So with the combined purifiers for our home (4600 sq ft), every 30 minutes the existing air would be purified. That sounded pretty good to me.

Not only did her hives stop, my skin became less itchy. Never really bothered me but I definitely noticed less skin irritation after we started using the combined with our other purifiers. We chose this one because of its HEPA replacement cost. It was significantly less compared to its rival COWAY airmega. So long run, this device should be easier on the pocket. We run all our air purifiers 24/7 so having the ability to set schedules on all of them is so convenient. The option to turn off the display at night is nice but since we have ours on a schedule we just leave the display off. Watching the particulate counter crank up and down showing how much work it is doing to purify the air is really neat.

I truly hope that these units last a lifetime. We are only 1 month into using these and life has gotten better. Will update with any issues or comments about the device as they arise.",5.0 out of 5 stars

It's nice that they sense the air quality and increase the speed automatically. I also like that it lets you know when it is time to change the filter element. I seem to get almost 6 months out of a filter. My only issue is the price of replacement filters. For all 6 units it was costing around $250 to change them all even with sales and discounts.

Alfonso Dee,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2023","So I was looking for an air filter for my Florida room, which is the only room in my home where I smoke cigarettes.

In the non summer months I just keep all the windows open and the room airs out. But in the summer months when the humidity is unbearable down here, I have to run an air conditioner in the room. Which means I have to close the windows, which means the cigarette smoke doesn’t air out. So it’s a dilemma for me.

It’s either sit in the room sweating and uncomfortable in the humidity with the windows open and let the smoke out - or shut the windows and use the AC and have the room filled with lingering smoke. Neither of which are ideal options.

So I figured an air filter might be a solution. I found though that it wasn’t that simple, because then it turns into which air filter to get that’s actually going to work, without breaking the bank as well.

I was trying to find the best air filter to solve this issue within a reasonable price point. I really did not want to spend more than maybe $200 or so. Before finding this one, I tried 2 others that literally did nothing, that were admittedly a bit cheaper than this one.

Then I found this one, and it was delivered the same day. I got this one today, hooked it up and did a real time test.

I put this unit on a stand in a good spot in the room, set it up, plugged it in, and the air quality in the room was reading very good - indicated by the blue ring and very low number on the screen. I then closed all the windows, turned on the AC, and then lit up a cigarette.

I purposefully blew the smoke right onto the unit every time I took a drag and exhaled. I knew immediately that this was going to work when this filter INSTANTLY detected the cigarette smoke, and the blue light ring which
means excellent air quality, turned red, and the air quality numbers on the screen jumped from around 20 (which means excellent air quality) to about 900 (which means the air quality is horrendous).

Once the machine detected the smoke, it immediately began filtering it out of the air, and I literally sat there and watched the numbers on the screen going down in real time as it was removing the smoke.

The red lights also gradually turned to orange, then green, then I left the room for 10 minutes.

When I came back in the room (which is not very big, maybe 600 sq ft tops) there was no visible smoke in the air, and the light ring was back to blue, and the air quality numbers were back well below 30. So this had cleaned the air and removed all the smoke.

This machine is beyond impressive.

Now, I will say that even though the smoke was gone in the air, there still was a lingering faint odor of cigarette smoke in the room. But I also did not give the machine a full hour to run for the test. My thinking is that if I did, it would have removed the odor as well in a bit more time.

Given what I watched this do in the short test though, and how it performed? This air filter is truly remarkable, and I’m beyond happy with this purchase so far.

I would highly recommend this product for anyone trying to deal with any kind cigarette, or other kinds of smoke in a dwelling of any kind. A ++++++",5.0 out of 5 stars

Slicky Moxy,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2024","I purchased this air purifier less than a month ago. It was in the top recommended lists of research I did and all over my tik tok fyp. I really didn't see anything negative, so I made the purchase. About a week ago, I noticed when I turned it on it would immediately turn off. I thought it might have been the outlet, so I plugged it somewhere else, and had the same result. On my 3rd attempt, it finally worked. The very next day it did the same thing. I then realized that it worked depending on how the power cord was turned. I believe there's an issue with it, but since it's not a power cord that detaches and can possibly be replaced, it simply is not gonna work. I requested a refund, but amazon is replacing it with a new one. If I have issues with the new one, I'll try the shark air purifier, but I'm really hoping everything will be ok with the new one.

The unit itself looks nice, we have ours sitting in the dining room area in a corner.

I mainly got this because when we are away from the house for several hours, and come back there is a musty type odor and we really can't figure out what the cause is. So far I have to say this has been pretty impressive, the last few times we have been away for the day and came back, the smell was not there.

We leave this running about 12 hours during the day only, this seems to work pretty good for us.
As for it being quiet, well on low speed and even the second speed you could hardly hear this thing running.
Now when I turn it on in the morning, it will ramp up to high speed for about 20 minutes or so and you definitely know it is running. But the majority of the time it is nice and quiet.
Have to say the sensors are really good and very sensitive, they pick up the air quality when we cook and adjust the fan speed, in no time the digital readout is back to normal.

flpalmtree,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2024","I recently had to get a new HVAC system. It’s a higher-end unit that has a filter in the indoor unit [some indoor units are in the garage, others in a closet inside the house], which eliminates the need to have filters in the return vents in the house.

When deciding on what type of filter to use, I found quite a few DIYers who say it’s not worth getting the really high-priced dense filters, even though those filters say they trap particles that mid-priced filters cannot. These DIYers reasoning ― the high-priced dense filters make it more difficult for air to pass through them, which requires your HVAC unit to work harder and longer, which leads to higher monthly electric bills. What they say to do instead is use the mid-priced filter and use a high quality in-room air purifier (or air purifiers in multiple rooms).

My house has an open floor plan where the kitchen, eating area, and main TV room are all, essentially, one room. So I placed this Levoit in the middle. It does a fantastic job of clearing the air!

CafeSociety,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2023","The title says a lot. Fantastic, reliable, easy, informative, accessible. The app works (almost) top notch. What I really appreciate is that they are spot on reliable using wifi apps at any location away from my house to inside my house. Their response time is fast from the app. Scheduling, setting up smart home features all run well through the app, easy to learn and use. I will be buying more, trying to get a friend to get one (two). No regrets buying them.

Not so great things that I wish they’d develop or get rid of:
Adding ability to control locally through Bluetooth (or zigby or z-wave) and not only through wifi and the cloud. This was problematic when internet was cancelled or interrupted. Thankfully they kept their schedules, but I had to run them on phone wifi hotspot to access them through the app. The base units work manually, but will keep the schedule in the app, unless you do a full reset.

The app room arrangement doesn’t really work, and their readings don’t exactly match or refresh. (But this is in development, but probably won’t take off.)

I do not like that the app can be an bit invasive on every part of my privacy/life. Like trying to get me to buy into their health tracking logging what I eat, or making it mandatory to set location etc. in setup. The ploy to be there for health to basically gain marketing data. Too many apps and even work apps play this game and it’s a bit deceptive marketing data gathering. I’m totally techy smart home and software junky, but there’s a clear line that is getting crossed. The company sends me prodding emails to track my health. I cannot get rid of the icon in the app, wish it wasn’t a part of this.

That was negative, Back to positive. Because they are fantastic. I’ve watched every YouTube video on all the brands repeatedly. I now have 4 of these and a few smaller finer filter ones from Medify, and two Winnix 5500’s. The Levoit are hands down my favorite. They are quiet and easy over wifi. I’ve turned my non-smart Winnix to smart by adding switch bots to them, but the Levoit are smart from the start. The smaller med brand one cannot be turned smart as there’s no place to put switchbots on them. They get too loud in medium and high, so I will not buy that brand again, keep with the Levoit. (Possibly try Austin Air someday, but that’s just more money.)

Levoit is Not glitchy. A favorite feature when I’m cooking in the kitchen is the number and color reading. It shoots up so fast when cooking certain ways or foods. It’s funny because a Winnix will turn orange or red in a heartbeat when I pour alcohol in a glass 4 feet away in front of it! But it doesn’t provide a number, which the Levoit 600 shows.

These filter the air so well, that when I drop peppermint oil at doorways or spots in a room (deters spiders and I think ants, I use a lot on a sailboat. Works like a charm), if my Levoit is running, it removes the essential oil smell too fast. Way too fast. It’s a battle I will not win if I run these air filters, because they work so well.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Kevins Dad,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2024","Ordered and received this product in a timely fashion. Product came undamaged. Super simple set-up, consisting of removing the HEPA filter from its protective plastic (a well-placed warning sticker makes this hard to miss!) and replacing the cover. All the controls are located on the top of the device; there is no remote. I use mine to filter air in a space approx. 900 square feet, which includes a kitchen. Although I am not a fan of syncing countless devices to Alexa, I did it this time using the VeSync app to see how user friendly the process is., and it took only a few minutes. There are some additional features available through the use of the app. The device itself moves a lot of air and, except when on the fan is used at the highest setting, is nearly silent.

I would buy this product again, or additional ones if needed.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Chris L,"Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2024","The purifier itself is very high quality and I highly recommend it.
The Amazon listing says it will cover 3175 ft2. This number is nowhere in the manual. The manual says ""635 ft2 for 5 exchanges/ hr or 1588 ft2 for 2 ex/hr. Effective for larger rooms but purification will take longer.""

MistrRoboto,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2024","I like the idea of clean air in my house, and have been running multiple purifiers for years. All of my other units are Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty. They have been on for 5 straight years with filter changes and not a single issue.

For no good reason, I wanted to try something new with a higher sq/ft rating.

Ordered a BLUEAIR Blue Pure 211i Max and it made a weird sound right out of the box. Clicking, and the unit shook so something was out of whack. Instead of having it replaced, I returned and went with the Levoit.

As best as I can tell so far, its an excellent unit. Feels sturdy and high quality. Extremely quiet on auto mode, which runs lower than the low setting when the air is clean. Set to low, its still very quiet. High its loud, but not louder than my Coways, and the amount of air its passing is staggering.

I really like the idea of scenario specific filters, which I will try next. Levoit offers 600c filters specific to houses with pets, smokers, etc.",5.0 out of 5 stars
kvolaf,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2024","This air purifier is so amazingly quiet, you can just plug it in and forget it! I love the ring of lights on top of the purifier that lights up blue when the air quality is excellent, green for when the air quality is good, and red when the air quality is bad. There is also a digital readout of the particle count in the air, for those who want a more exact information.
I use the automatic setting so I can truly forget about it. When I was making brunch that included bacon, the ring of lights turned red and the air purifier automatically kicked into high gear. Then the air purifier automatically adjusted it's fan speed as the air particle count lowered. The amazing thing is the air purifier is on the other side of my house from my kitchen!
I purchased the air purifier because my husband was suffering from allergies. Given that the pollen count was currently low and mold count was high for the area we were living in and the time of year, we suspected that mold spores in the air might be the reason for his allergies. However, when the air purifier arrived and we set it up, it showed that the air quality in our house was good. Honestly, I don't know if this means that the air purifier didn't sense mold spores, or that we actually had no mold spores in our house. However, I am happy with the quality of the air purifier and how well it works for smoke from cooking and our wood burning stove. So we are keeping it.
One thing that prospective buyers may want to keep in mind is that the instruction states that the air purifier should have a clearance of 15"" on all sides. This means that you can't just put it against the wall, like I had originally intended. But I supposed this would be true for all air purifiers as air circulation is needed.",5.0 out of 5 stars

goldnboy,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023","I have purchased many different types/brands of air purifiers/filters, over the years. Ionizing types, non-HEPA and HEPA types with ‘auto’ settings to adjust for ‘smells’, ‘VOC’s, etc. They have each had things that I liked… and each has had something I did not like… until now.
I love the build quality, the design/look, the ‘noise’ level… wow! I mean, you ‘can’ crank it up to full… and you can definitely hear it… but what I noticed most is that, when you do that, you can ‘feel’ the air movement… and I’m talking about the ‘inward’ airflow movement… not just the ‘output’. It MOVES some air! It even seems to cool the room if you crank it up (not that that is a listed feature, but it really moves that much air).
When it is running normally (auto), I don’t hear it unless I’m sitting in silence and, even then it is not irritating… I just think, oh yeah, that’s running.
I’m not excited about replacing the filter. I never enjoy that cost. I have decided that, for the differences I have seen in ‘original’ vs. ‘knock-off’ filters, that I will spring for the originals… and I like that they haven’t tried some way to make the machine disable itself if you choose a ‘non-genuine’ option. I like them just for that!
The app has quite a number of functions/monitoring/notification settings. I like how it works.
I also bought a couple of the smaller 300 model series units and I like them very much, as well. If you have the funds, and especially if you are filtering a larger space, I would really recommend this 600 series unit.
I can/do definitely recommend this product. Other than maybe lifetime free filter replacements, there is very little I think would be an improvement… I’m so glad I found these! Thank you.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Cropperhopper,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2024","After receiving my air purifier, all I had to do was remove the plastic from the filter, and start it up. It is very easy to setup, and control with the app. If you have Alexa, you can hook it in with Alexa, and control it through her. I have COPD, so I am very sensitive to any particulates in the air, and I can tell when I starts to get even a little bit. The eco setting is nice, but it's not as sensitive as I need it to be. I need it to be on the highest setting during the daytime due to potllants in the air. I am trying to eliminate dust in my home room by room to help as well. I highly recommend this air purifier!

Calen,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2024","I live in a dusty house.
The house is clean and there’s a weekly maid yet the house is just dusty.
I have the vents cleaned regularly.
My allergies and this dust have gotten to the point where I can’t take it.

I did a ton of research and found this.

This thing I use on 3/4 fan during the day and sleep mode at night.

I cooked crab cakes in the house and I kid you not this made the smell disappear within 5 minutes.

Also, I’ve noticed the dust amount has lowered drastically.

My ac filters don’t need to be changed as much.

For someone with chronic allergies this is a miracle device and it’ll have you asking yourself why you didn’t get it earlier.

Buy it!
Download the app and you’ll see how clean or dirty your air really is.
This thing I’ve recommended to everyone.

Michelle,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2023","I’ve had the core 600s for about a month. We have other, smaller levoit purifiers in our bedrooms but wanted something for a larger open living space. We live in a rental and it seems like mold is a big issue for many people in homes near us. It makes us paranoid, so anything we can do to help keep our air clean and safe is important to us! I compared this to online reviews of Air doctor and other more expensive units, and this one seems comparable at a much better price. This is a big unit, but the design is very clean and modern and it blends well with our furniture and decor. It is extremely quiet… you barely hear it on its low settings. At first I had an issue that some other reviewers were mentioning; it turns on and reads 005 and then within minutes goes to 001. I moved it around my house and was getting the same result. So that seemed suspicious to me… especially since I had turned off our other purifiers to run the experiment. So I sprayed aerosol hairspray into the room for a moment and watched the numbers. Within seconds it rose into the mid 30s and then steadily decreased as the purifier worked its magic. It seems that kicked our sensor into working order, and now it picks up little things here and there and I’ll see the numbers are not always at 001. Makes it feel like a much more accurate read. Anyway- I totally love this thing! I haven’t used the smart features yet, nor do i think I will, but it’s nice to have the option for the super tech savy or “smart home” people.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Adrian,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2024","I bought this for a small 100ft2 bedroom, overkill, I know, but that is the point. The bigger the unit, the more efficient it is, so I can get away with using a lower fan speed. This is ideal since it is quieter and won't get dirty as quickly due to the lower speed; also, if I need to clean the air ASAP, this purifier can do it quickly. Although, it is a bit louder than the 400s. It also has the same variety of modes and settings to tinker with and the device is pretty easy on the eyes. The app used to control the device is also very well made, which I found a bit surprising since companion apps tend to be mediocre at best.

However, the air sensor is not the most reliable since it only detects the air in the immediate vicinity, but I knew this before purchasing it. For a more accurate air quality level, I suggest a separate air quality detector. The filters are also on the pricier side, but they supposedly last 6 months. After two weeks of use, mine is hardly dirty and I have a dog, a bird, as well as a steady flow of food odors.

Overall, I am satisfied with the performance, it leaves my room with the faint smell of a freshly cleaned hotel room. The purifier also does does not emit ozone, if that is a concern. It was for me due to my pets as well as general health concerns.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2024","I've had this purifier for a little less than a month and it works fabulously in a 600 square foot space with high ceilings. Early on I set it up in one part of the space, turned it on ""auto"" until it showed blue circles, then moved it to the furthest parts of the space and it still showed blue.

My main complaint--which is a big deal considering this is an investment--is that under a month in the dust particle sensor stopped working. The unit was running all day and showing red/high particle counts at the end. I followed the manual instructions and vacuum cleaned the outside entry to the particle sensor but no dice. Today I took apart the entire unit with a screw driver, found the particle sensor and blew into it really hard. It seems to have done the trick and the ""auto"" function is working as it should now, fingers crossed. But it's still really frustrating to have a key component stop working after so little use, and is especially so given that Levoit has not provided an easy way of accessing the sensor to clean it. Other companies have little doors on their purifiers that you can open to clean the sensor lens with a q-tip. This would be enormously helpful and would have saved me a full afternoon.",4.0 out of 5 stars
