Daphne Martin,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2023","It arrived within the window frame. I was very skeptical of buying refurbished watch, after reading reviews of scratched up watches, with dents, low batter life, defective in one form or another. So when I opened it, it really was in excellent condition! No cosmetic flaws, a brand new band, and charger looked new too! I was elated. Set up was a breeze. I have only had it for 3 days….so far so good! I bought a flower bumper guard for it. I plan on buying more bands too. I pray it continues to work as well as it does! I will write an update in one month. The pic shows me holding it up and it’s winding down for my sleep mode. Buy one, but pick “Excellent Condition “.

Update it is 7/28/23 My watch is still working well! Excellent investment.
*******Update****** 7/22/24
The watch is still working, however due to the fact that it is a refurbished product you have to take into consideration, so is the battery. It still works fine, but needs to be charged everyday, for a good amount of time. The battery becomes very weak at the end of the day around 7pm after being on the charger for 9 hrs. No matter how long you charge it, that battery drains around the same time of day and will die out. So it was a great starter watch, but eventually you will want to upgrade, for a few more dollars to a brand new one. Battery last all day long on my new one and never goes dead, even if I get it on the charger late at night. New one cost me $200 Target. Walmart sells em for $189.00 Brand New. I kept the old one for a back up, it’s on my shelf now taking a long rest 😂",5.0 out of 5 stars

Jessica H.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2023","I was really excited to find out that I could buy an Apple Watch for such a good price. I went ahead and bought it in best condition for what I believe was $140 at the time. However, when I got it, the case was scratched up fairly badly, the new screen wasn't marked but it seemed to be put on 98% perfectly - it wasn't too responsive and the way it was placed on was just a little bit off if you looked very closely. The worst part of it all was the battery capacity - I'm pretty sure it was at about 80%, which is not what you want in a watch with one-day battery life. Over time it degraded down to 76%, and it would cost $100 to replace It still had a lot of the good features, but I began to realize that it was just too old and over time it just became annoying, with bad dictation, frequent OS glitches, and a frankly awful Siri experience - the voice assistant hardly ever acts like it understands me, even when I'm connected to the WiFi and my iPhone. I ended up finding a deal at Target for a factory-sealed series 8 around Christmas time this year, and Apple claimed it to be $60 for trade-in value. At the end of the day, if you still consider buying this, I would just say be prepared for some annoying gimmicks and an expensive battery replacement, without the original Apple box, charger, and band that it came with (they'll all be off brand). I'd say give this to someone who is not tech-savy, or just buy straight refurbed from Apple a 7 or later where you get smaller bezels.",3.0 out of 5 stars

morningglory,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2024",Watch looked very good upon arrival. Easily paired with iPhone (also purchased renewed). Specifically purchased these two for fall detection function. Today I discovered that the function works. My small dogs were jumping up my legs and I was concerned about falling. In frustration I shook my hands fairly hard and the watch began ringing. It indicated that it seemed I had a hard fall. This allowed me to see how to indicate that I had not had a fall. I found the experience very helpful and satisfying (to know that it actually functions for the purpose I needed).,4.0 out of 5 stars

Joey & Bonnie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022","Pros:
- This is for my used watch, each is different -
• Affordable compared to new
• Mine had no visible signs of wear
Cons:
- These are for a used watch -
• No instruction manual
• Battery charger doesn’t work
• No care in packaging
This is my very FIRST Apple Watch, so there’s been a bit of a learning curve. The first 3 days was literally a headache. I almost returned it.
On the surface…everything looked great. There were no visible signs of wear. No scratches or flaws.
However, mine didn’t come with a user manual or instructions, so setting it up was a little difficult. Luckily, my iPhone was able to walk me through the process. I had to update my software on the iPhone, so it was a longer process. Once I got them both synced everything “seemed” to be working fine. However, the battery life drained within a few hours. I charged it overnight, but it only charged to 60%, and would rapidly drain. I scoured the internet to see what the problems might be. Deleted Apps, lowered brightness, turned on backup power reserve, etc. My last ditch effort before returning was to buy a different charger……and Voila…it worked! I also got a message to update the watch software once I plugged it into the new charger, so that may have also been the problem. So, the charger that mine came with was a dud. I imagine that might be the case for a lot of others since I’m seeing a lot of reviews about the battery life now.
The good news is that it’s working like a dream now! It charges to 100% now, and my battery lasts all day!
Overall, I’m happy that I finally made the leap to get an Apple Watch. I’ve had it for a month now, and I’m still finding new things to do with it. If you’re struggling with battery life on your watch I hope you found my comments helpful!",4.0 out of 5 stars

Panda Pandemic,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","I was extremely worried about buying a refurbished watch from Amazon. I wanted to buy from Apple, but the cheapest refurbished watch they had was $339.00 and I'm just unwilling to pay those prices for a watch. I had a Series 2 from January 2018 - fall 2021, when the watch face simple fell open (I was appalled but I don't blame the watch, I wore it all day every day during that period of time. It got me through 60 lb weight loss, I'm surprised it made it that long).
Watch arrived today. I will note that it took a really long time to charge. That is the con here, it took about an hour to charge to 68% which suggests that either - it takes Series 4 longer to charge, or there may be a battery issue here.
Besides that, the watch is in great condition. There is one tiny ding at the very top of the watch. You only notice it if you have your eyeball an inch from the watch, like I did. Otherwise, no scratches or defects on the watch screen or in the watch when it is powered up (I saw others had dots or other irregularities in their refurbished watch screens - none on this one). The watch set up and paired to my phone without any problems. I have been unable to set up cellular - I keep getting an error. This may be an AT&T issue, I'm not sure yet. Despite this being a 4 year old watch, it doesn't feel like a 4 year old watch. It's new TO ME. I like the new features (ECG, the slightly bigger screen DOES make a difference .. I always put my passcode in wrong at least 2x with the Series 2, with this that issue is gone).
I'll revisit this review after I've had it a while, or uncovered answers to any of my other issues. As a note, my seller was The Camera Guyz in Brooklyn NY. My delivery date was initially towards the end of next week, next Thursday (I ordered yesterday, Friday)... watch came within 24 hours.",5.0 out of 5 stars

lashanda Harris,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2023","The first watch I received looked great out of the box. I set it up then updated it while on the charger and it never came on again.
I reached out to the company through Amazon and the customer service was great ! I received a new watch within a week.
My problem now is the new watch is not keeping a full charge longer than 4hrs. The watch used to last over 12hrs. I tried to look past the two scratches on this watch because the watch worked.. but I will be returning this. It was really nice using the watch for about 2 months I’m going to get a new one this time.
Updated 5/3/23
I tried to use the watch a little longer despite the charging issues. It became uncomfortable and frustrating to use the watch because it started to burn my wrist after I took it off the charger. The imprint from the bottom of the watch left a mark on my wrist. I thought that if I let it cool after charging it wouldn’t burn my skin. I was wrong! The second time was worse and happened as the watch was dying.
I really would like to give the watch 0 stars!
The 3 stars are for the customer service! Every interaction was great start -finish. I applaud them for sending that replacement watch. I think there should be detailed inspections prior to selling the product. If those are already conducted, it would be nice to have possible issues listed in the description so these issues wouldn’t be a surprise.
I enjoyed the watch while it lasted. my experience convinced me to purchase a new watch, if no issues occurred with the second watch I would’ve kept it. Scratches and all.",3.0 out of 5 stars

It took a little time (longer than normal) to setup, and battery health was at roughly 80% (higher than my 5 year old series 5). After a few weeks of him wearing it, he discovered that it wouldn’t hold a charge, he had to take it off after less than 8 hrs to charge it. We adjusted settings, did not work. After a few more weeks, he literally had to charge it every 2-3 hrs. Eventually it got to the point where he could put it on the charger, it reads fully charged (and even actively charging), and as soon as he took it off the charger it would die. And when he did wear it before, it would randomly shut off and then back on. Normally I’ve had good luck with refurbished electronics, but this was a bust.

Me gusta mucho su diseño, tiene una pantalla súper nítida y brillante que se ve genial. Además, hay un montón de opciones para personalizarlo con diferentes correas y carcasas. ¡Me encanta tener un reloj que se adapte a mi estilo!
En cuanto a su rendimiento, es rapidísimo para realizar tareas, desde responder mensajes hasta navegar por aplicaciones. Y lo mejor de todo es que la batería dura todo el día, incluso si le doy un uso bastante activo. Pero solo eso demora un día exacto 24 horas luego hay que cargarlo, he optado por cargarlo mientras voy en el auto.
A nivel estético tenía detalles de arañazos en la pantalla y alos lados señales de previo uso pero nada que impida su funcionamiento.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2022","Terrible and disappointing. The watch arrived quicker than expected, which was nice. There was a sticker on the back of the watch that was a real pain to get off. The first time I charged it, it seemed normal. Didn’t take too long to charge. When I tried to pair with my phone, it would not connect. Kept asking for the password to an apple account that I no longer have (from a previous job). Looked online and it said you need to request the removal of an activation lock. Started the process for that, but after several days, still nothing from apple and no luck pairing devices. I called apple, expecting them to be able to help me but they told me the process to remove an activation lock takes ten days and is processed through satellites?? And there is nothing they can do to speed things up. Ok, I have no choice but to wait. Ten days pass and I receive an email from apple saying the request to remove the activation lock was unsuccessful. Luckily, I was able to figure out how to change my password to the apple account I no longer have, despite not being able to access that email anymore, and I finally got the watch paired with my phone. Once it was paired, I was happy with the interface and the watch itself for the most part. I was a little disappointed with the battery life and hardly being able to get through a day before needing to recharge. This was a nuisance but not a deal breaker. It worked well for about a week and then one morning after it had been on the charger all night, I got the green snake of doom. I left it on the charger all the next day but still would not turn on. I started the process for a return and it showed me a video on how to fix the issue. I tried the solution it offered and it did seem to do the trick. The watch turned back on and was able to charge it again. I got about 10 days out of it working fine, but now the green snake of doom is back and nothing seems to be working to make it charge. Will be returning this item and I will not be going with another Apple Watch.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Beatrice S.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2024","UPDATE 4/19 - The battery wouldn't even last 6 hours. I requested a replacement which was ordered on 4/9 and ten days later, we still haven't received it. I don't know where the replacement is. Tracking only shows one update which is ""Carrier picked up the package."" Removed a star because this has been an awful experience. Order from this seller at your own risk.
I finally got the watch set up with a cellular plan through T-Mobile and I’m just now exploring it. First, the screen is badly scratched with vertical lines going from top to bottom. At first I thought it was just smudges but these don’t come off.
I wouldn’t have minded the scratches since this was for my 10yr but the battery life is pretty bad. I had it charged to full and I just set everything up, deleted unnecessary apps and set up walkie-talkie. Just 20 mins of this and the battery is down to 30%. I don’t know if this will even last her a day, or even the 8 hours she’s at school. I don’t know if I should even give it to her. I checked the battery setting and it shows “Service Recommended” and that max capacity is at 66%. I just turned on battery saver mode to see if that helps, though I’d really rather not have to use it like that.
I’m leaning towards returning it, I’m just hesitant because of how much work it took to even get this watch set up. This was posted as Refurbished in Excellent condition but in reality, it’s really not excellent at all. I wouldn’t be upset if the actual condition matched the description.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Janice Luther,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2024","False advertisement that promises excellent condition refurbished watches. The battery needs to be replaced; the first day I wore the watch, it only lasted for 4 hours after being fully charged. Seems like it is common after going through all of the other reviews. Will have to pay $100 for battery service at Apple or go through the absurd process of return.
Let me also give you the run down on how returns for Apple products work so you can truly avoid this hassle at all costs for a sub par item from this seller. You will have no other option for return other than UPS pick up. No, you cannot drop it off yourself at UPS/other Amazon drop off locations. You will have to choose between leaving the unlabeled package outside for UPS to hopefully pick up, or hope that you are home and by the door to hand over the unlabeled box to UPS. This whole process has been incredibly frustrating. It’s like Amazon wants the process to be as difficult as possible to return so you just give up and keep the item.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Nate,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024","The watch is great, as long as you don’t need the battery to last longer than four hours.
I work twelve hour days and have to answer emails and texts through out my day. I use my watch to see if I need to respond immediately or if it can wait and that’s it, I respond with my phone or computer. The first day I had it, it lasted four hours. So the next day I made some tweaks to try and make it last longer, and it did. It made it eight hours, this was on a Sunday though not that many emails and texts. The next day back to only four hours. So I researched more and did everything I could to make the battery last its longest, nine hours into the day I still have 53% battery life. I’m happy thinking I’m good now, then I made the mistake of responding to one text through my watch. 53% went straight to 0%.

BUT as of about a month ago, it won’t turn on at all, despite being fully charged. Surprisingly, just 2 months after the. 90 day warranty. I can’t even do a hard reset. Nothing from the Apple Forums have worked. I absolutely hate this watch and do not recommend AT ALL.
Original review:
It only lasts until about 4pm. And turn off Wi-Fi, it’s not on cellular just Bluetooth, doesn’t wake on lifting, no extra apps. I checked the battery health and it’s at 80%. I bought it refurbished to replace my Series 3 that I LOVED. It lasted all day into the night. Until it just stopped working one day…but after years of daily wear. I don’t know why I assumed this one would have a whole working battery. Other people have said the same thing in reviews though. I really only use it for heart rate, ECG and steps. Kinda hard to go that when it’s sitting on the charger.
And the lock button is gone from the workouts screen, so you’re supposed to go to the control center and press the water drop to lock it. But it STILL pauses during a workout! I hate this thing. Worst Apple purchase ever. I would definitely not purchase again.",1.0 out of 5 stars

The touchscreen will not function properly on either of them while it is on my wrist however when I take it off the screen seems to correct itself. They both had some sort of short or glitch.

Both watches came with a card that said they were guaranteed for 90 days or they would refund or replace. The representative I dealt with ran me through a very useless trouble shoot, some of which wouldn’t even apply to an Apple Watch. I told her I simply wanted a replacement as per the guarantee and she tried to tell me that the guarantee was for the trouble shooting service. When we finally reached returning and replacing as a solution, she told me I would have to be home in order to have the items picked up (didn’t have to be there when they were delivered, always drop off at ups because I work). She told me if I wasn’t home they would leave a label (they did not).

Lauren,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2021","When I bought this, I fully expected it to be a refurbished watch that was in “like new” condition. What I received was a watch that I could’ve purchased cheaper on Facebook marketplace and expected the same “used” quality. This watch has scratches all over the face and sides. The band on the watch isn’t even an Apple Watch band. The dial on the watch is after market, which is fine, but it doesn’t even resemble the one that normally comes on the watch. The charger sent with the watch is much older than series 4. The charger is from the series 2 or 3 because it has the silver around the charger. The newer charging cords are solid white. There was no block included. I have tons of blocks so it doesn’t affect me, but if someone purchases the watch and expects there to be a block, there wasn’t. The price of this watch was $229.99, and the Apple Watch SE is currently $279.99. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $50 to get a brand new watch with a manufacturer’s warranty. This watch needs to be sold as a USED watch. Selling it as a refurbished watch makes the consumer believe they are getting a new quality watch like you would purchase from Apple. There was nothing new about it, except maybe the cheap watch band. If they’re going to sell watches of this quality, the price needs to reflect that. I would never accept a watch of this quality and pay top dollar as I did for this. I will be sending this watch back and purchasing the SE.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Alayna,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2022","So I never write reviews for anything. But this product made me so upset, that I thought I should. First of all, when I opened the package, it was in this cheap bent up box that didn’t even have an apple logo or anything on it. It came with a Samsung charger box which I thought was extremely odd. Then I notice all these scratches on the screen. The charger was super dusty and sticky, so I had to wash it off and so was the back of the watch almost like honey was all over the charger and watch . Then I charged the watch and for some reason, it was all zoomed in and I couldn’t read anything so I had to restart it again which made me repeat the process all over again. When it finally fully charged, it worked great for a couple of days. Everything worked great, no problems until the 5th day came and it died on the charger. I thought I just placed it on wrong but after messing with it for 3 nights. I’ve made the decision that this is just a terrible product and I need to send it back asap. It now won’t even turn on, it just shows the apple logo like it’s turning on but then the screen turns black when it does seem like it will turn on. As I said I’m very disappointed and wish I never bought this in the first place.",1.0 out of 5 stars

To return the device there is only one option and that is to have an ups driver come to your house to pick it up.
This happens over the course of 3 business days. They will come at an unknown time over the course of those 3 days and you have to be there to give them the item. Who can accommodate that? I guess if you’re retired or don’t work.

Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2023","First of all the customer service from this company is really bad.

It’s the battery that is the problem. I kid you not when I say the battery dies within two hours of being charged fully. I thought something was wrong, but I did factory reset a number of times and still the same issue. What’s worse is that the company did not help me at all. They did not pick up their phone or respond to their email. I was lucky enough to speak with an amazon employee who was able to set up a refund with me and pick up the watch for it to be returned. I thought the battery would get better but it did not so I am warning you, please do not waste your time buying from this company.

Michaela and William,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2022",Even when battery is fully charged it dies after 4 to 5 hours. So upon appearance the watch looks like it’s in pretty good condition outside of a few scratches on the glass at the very top. Watch turned on and paired perfectly. I charge it overnight put it on the next day and it was dead within 4 to 5 hours. Recharged it throughout the night to 100% put it back on I’ve been wearing it now for about five hours and it’s below 10%. I fully understand that this is a refurbished watch but it should at least stay charged. My thought process is if you’re going to refer to watch you would put a new battery in it. Now I understand that you get what you pay for but this watch is only maybe 50 $60 less than the new one and I only really needed to keep track of time and run a stopwatch because I’m a coach . I don’t run any background apps that I know of on it since it’s brand new. I have contacted the seller and I am hoping that they are willing to rectify the situation.

I’ve even gone as far as turning off all notifications and removing every app I am able and it still doesn’t last more than 8 hours. This also defeats the purpose of the watch. The seller suggested I close all apps, factory reset, put on low power mode and reduced brightness to resolve. It shouldn’t be such a hassle with a “like new” watch. It was also extremely difficult to pair initially. It took hours to do and several attempts. I don’t recommend buying from here.

Stephanie L. Betz,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2024","I originally bought another watch from this seller which also had poor battery life. The first watch said ""maximum capacity: 77%"". I was having to charge it very frequently, less than 24 hours between charges. So, I sent it back and they replaced it with the same watch size/model. This one (pictured) has a ""maximum capacity: 73%"" so it's actually worse than the first one. I have bought several renewed Apple products on Amazon and they've all been guaranteed to be at at least 80% maximum capacity. I realize and appreciate that the purpose of purchasing a renewed product is to extend the life of an electronic and reduce waste. However, if the product has to be recharged this frequently, it's more of a hassle to maintain. I paid extra for the insurance. When contacting them and filing a claim, they instructed me to contact Apple because the first watch was believed to still be under manufacturer warranty. Apple ran a diagnostic and said nothing was wrong with the watch so I sent it back to the seller hoping a replacement would solve the problem. No luck there. I will keep the watch and continue frequent charging then eventually purchase a new watch.

Other than that it works well, my only problem is the battery (which may last less than 12 hours without even using it).",2.0 out of 5 stars
Cox Family,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2024","Purchased for my non verbal son who has Autism. Watch arrived in BEAUTIFUL condition. I was very excited to set it up and show him how to use it. Mainly that he can speak with it. Set it up. Simple, own 1 myself, to find that every few minutes the watch would set off an SOS signal 3 or so times then power off. This would prove to be more challenging than beneficial for ANYONE, let alone someone with sensory issues. Wanted to make communicating easier for him…Very disappointing",2.0 out of 5 stars

Dave in Texarkana,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2019","The good:
-Watch looked like new
-Battery life was better than I expected from reviews and other research (depending on use, would last an entire day)
-Received on time exactly as promised and pretty fast (4 days from order) - the 2 day Prime promise - that's 50% at best
-Came with a protective plastic cover that seems pretty durable - did not cause the issue below because the issue was frequent, but intermittent
The bad:
-Touch screen interface very buggy - for 1 of dozens of examples, wouldn't accept my 4th number to unlock the watch many times, could see the number show up in the entry screen then would disappear and could not unlock - no error message
-Band not what is pictured - got one with some double pin arrangement you had to fit in two holes, a bit difficult to put on, but was secure
-Software only 5.3 on watch, had to upgrade phone to 13, to get watch to 6 to try to resolve issues
-Verizon Tech Coach is awesome as reported by my IT folks, and last person there said this touch interface is a known issue, Apple working on they said
I will be returning the watch - not faulting the seller unless they're actually doing the refurbishing which I cannot tell - I suspect they're just a re-seller though of these watches once some other company does the refurbishment.
I really liked the productivity and flexibility of the watch. I have an iPhone 10max which is too heavy when I wear shorts plus the watch makes a quick check of any incoming text or email, or phone call receipt easy if not close to, or not carrying the phone.
Verizon connectivity good on it for the cell, really never got to try the GPS function of the watch.
I marked value lower because in one week I see this now priced $40 less than I paid. I also marked giftable lower because the box it comes in is not really descriptive of the product (says it's a smart phone) and has nothing to describe it or where to get help - the charging cord wasn't even bound, just rolled into the box.
I'm debating to accept a replacement or just get my money back and try again.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I tired everything any article recommended to extend battery life but nothing helped. I sat on the phone with apple tech support for an hour running diagnostics and they couldn’t tell me. Other than that it was super great! But I wouldn’t get half way through the work day without it dying. On the up note I loved using it for my workouts! That was great. I sadly had to return it in the end. I thought I was getting a replacement but instead I got a refund. The company was helpful and quick during the process so that was nice. I bought it during Black Friday,however, so since then the price has gone up.

nerd_up,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2020","for the money, I would go with
— something that has less useless apps (that can't be deleted) that drain the battery.

— a strap that doesn't turn gray and disgusting (re: apple iPhone cases)
— more comfortable
— more accurate standing detection
— has better app
— has better sleep tracking... I'm convinced its not picking up HALF of my sleep some nights
— isn't so expensive considering all of the above.
I ended up finding a tracker ring. I'm going to wear both for a week and see how they compare. in my opinion the Fitbit equivalent is way better than this. I might end up going back to that.

The watch itself came in its original packaging and all original parts were included. The only major issue was that the watch face had a serious crack, right down the middle. It was much more than the “minimal scratches or dents” as in the product description. I decided that it was not at all worth the price due to this significant defect. It is obvious that the inspection was not as thorough as described, or that they figured it was worth the risk of dealing with returns and refunds, in an attempt to unload defective products.

First, the battery doesn’t charge to 100%. It charges to 95% after an all night charge.
Second, after a 1 hour workout while playing music downloaded on the watch (not even connected to internet/wifi/cellular) through Bluetooth, the battery drops to 65% and by mid-day it’s giving me a notice that there’s 10% left and recommending power saving mode.

Al,"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2023","So I understand that this is a refurb, but it's definitely not in ""excellent condition"" as stated. The bottom of the watch face looks as if it has been banged against concrete and the release buttons for the bands are a mess and don't release without an excessive amount of force. It crashed four times trying to set up/pair it and it caused me to have to start the process over every time, including an unpair process every time, which took forever. It was a three hour process to get this paired. The biggest issue is the battery drains INSANELY fast, I left the house at a full charge and went on a 20 minute errand, and the battery was drained to 75% by the time I got home. My first Apple Watch was a refurbed Gen 1 (that I got when the Gen 4s were new) and it worked flawlessly and held a charge better than any of my other Apple products, so I don't know if this is just a standard awful Apple battery issue or if there's an issue, but either way it's quite plausible that I'll need to get a replacement/refund ordered before the month is over.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I can in fact see scratches from more than 12 inches away. The battery life is also at 85% of its original capacity, so it dies quite quickly. While yes, Amazon's criteria is that the battery has to have 80% or more of its original capacity, with the scratches and 85% of the battery I would not call this product ""Excellent"". I would call it good, but not excellent.
Just to top it all off, on the outside of the box that the watch came in, nowhere on it does it mention the quality the watch is supposed to be in, and the paperwork that is included lists the watch as new. (The watch isn't new). This makes me come to the conclusion that in the company's warehouse, they could pull a random box off the shelf for someone's order and have no clue what the quality of the watch is without looking inside. Basically, all of this shows me that this company doesn't know how to run a good business. (Amazon is not shipping these, the one I bought came from the factory itself).",3.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2020","Finally decided to upgrade my old series 1 Apple Watch. After a lot of research and price comparisons with the series 3 and 5 I decided I’d go for the updated model. I knew apple didn’t sell the 4 series anymore but I happen to stumble upon this with the Amazon renew program for refurbished watches. I read some other reviews and thought, what the hell. Price was in my budget for what I was looking for so I ordered the space grey one. It ended up arriving a day early, which is great cuz I was super excited to get this. When I unboxed it I was impressed because this thing looked brand spanking new. Then I noticed a small gash on the bottom right corner of the aluminum. Kind of a bummer but I knew there could be a chance there would be minor cosmetic defects. So that’s why I did give this only 4 stars. I’m just glad the screen has no scratches. So once I got it all charged up and paired with my phone everything seems to be working just fine. I’m very excited to able to wear my watch in the lake and the pool now. That’s one of the main reasons I wanted to upgrade. The processor is definitely faster than my old watch and I really like the look and feel of this new one. I also workout a good bit and hike when I can so I’m excited to see how it differs on tracking my activity compared to the older model. I also bought a 3rd party band that’s a dupe for the Pine Green/Cactus color Apple Watch band. Overall, if you’re thinking about upgrading on somewhat of a budget, do it. This is worth it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jocelyn Blake,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2023","Although I wanted to keep this watch as it is a good price for renewed, however, the Left side of the watch has a scratch that is visible to the eyes.

My friend has the same exact watch and she was able to slide the bands with ease. She tried to replace this watch and she couldn't do it either. Prior to purchasing this watch, it was described as ""Excellent"" condition which I believe is not accurate because of the scratch of the watch as well as the bands were dirty.

Hrand,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2023","Was skeptical at first when I saw the price and that the product was refurbished. But honestly, I’m pleasantly surprised so far!
Obviously It is not brand new, it did not come with original packaging. It also has a few scratches on the face but you would have to look real close to see them.
One odd thing: It did come with a screen protector on, so at first I thought it had 0 scratches..but then I went to set it up and noticed the screen wasn’t reacting to touch. Very glitchy; not registering. It was then I realized a protector was on and took it off; after then the screen worked perfectly fine!

Megan H,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2021","Overall I’m thrilled. I couldn’t afford a new watch, so this was a great option. MINOR damage to the screen, but it doesn’t bother me at all. My one complaint is that the battery life sucks. I take it off the charger at 6:30AM and by 5:30PM it’s on 10%. My 3rd generation lasted a day and a half at least, so it’s something I’ve had to get used to. It does charge fast, though, so if you have 10-20 minutes mid-day for a quick charge, you won’t have a problem. Another tip I have is that if you have a day where you need to preserve battery life, swipe up on the homepage on the watch and tap the theater faces. This is “theater mode” and it will make it so the watch only turns on when you touch the screen, rather than when you move the watch towards you. This will preserve your charge. Well worth it, in my opinion. A lot of people have complained about the watch not coming in an Apple box, and mine didn’t either, but I don’t think it really matters. I did get an Apple band though, so I was happy about that.",4.0 out of 5 stars

DebbiR,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2020","At first I gave this company a 1-star review. It appeared that my watch had come already linked to someone else's account and if that's the case, there's no way to unlink it without that person's password. Along about 3am I sat bolt upright in bed with a realization. What if it was in demo mode? I searched the trusty internet and there was a great video on YouTube from a guy who bought a used watch that was in demo mode and how he cleared it. It's the easiest thing in the world to do. Five minutes later, my watch was set up to my account and was rocking along beautifully. Thus far, everything I've tried has worked beautifully, including the ECG (EKG) and the cellular function.
So why the 4-star review for a watch that I'm rapidly coming to love? It's because of the company. Sending the watch in demo mode with no documentation whatsoever was unprofessional. If they are going to sell refurbished watches, the watch should have a factory reset performed and be ready to link to the new user's account on arrival. This cost me quite a bit of distress until it dawned on me after hours of fighting with it that the watch might have been in demo mode. And at that, I had to research until I found the YouTube video. Was it worth it? I think so, but if you're wanting a watch that will come to you in the same state that it would have from Apple, this probably isn't the place to shop.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Whatthewhat,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2021","This is more of an FYI rather than a review. Apple incorrectly lists ALL series 4 models as having sapphire glass. THIS IS NOT TRUE. The aluminum case models come with Ion-X glass which is NOT as scratch resistant as sapphire. I purchased a 4 series with an aluminum case and confirmed with a Diamond Selector (used to test diamonds, but is commonly used to test watch glass) that it does not have sapphire. See the attached video. I compared the Apple watch to two other Citizen watches. The one on the left has a mineral crystal, the one in the middle has a sapphire crystal. Red means sapphire, NO red means something else (Mineral, Gorilla, Ion-X etc.).
Now, Ion-X glass is not necessarily a bad thing. Sapphire glass is FAR more scratch resistant than Ion-X. However, Ion-X is FAR more shatter resistant. If you are going to be hard on your watch like working manual labor, constantly hitting it against hard objects, prone to dropping, then you should go with the Ion-X glass. Yes it is going to scratch on you, but it is much less likely to completely break/shatter. If you are simply wearing it for everyday activities with no regular threat of smashing or dropping it, then you should go with sapphire. There is still the possibility of it shattering when dropped or hit on a hard surface, but it will remain virtually scratch-free.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Are they good as new? No, butI would say 95%. The screens each has moonier scratches... but I put on a screen protector and they look great.

The only complaint I have so far is that the battery life is so short. I own one of the newer fitbit models and the battery only has to be charged like once or twice a week. This watch needs charged everyday, sometimes twice a day. A full charge only lasts a few hours depending on how much you use the watch.

booshmom,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2019","Update to original review: shortly after we bought this watch, Xfinity added cellular service for Apple Watch. My husband has been using this watch on cellular since about June 2019. The cellular service is great and that just improved the functionality of the watch. This watch is still going great with no problems. We will definitely consider Amazon refurbs again.
We have never ordered any “refurb” items on Amazon and are especially wary of buying electronics this way. However, the watch was a good price and backed by Amazon for 90 days, so we took a chance...glad we did!
The watch arrived exactly when promised and in exactly the condition advertised. If it had been in the original package, I would have thought a mistake was made and we got a new watch! We paired it with my husband’s phone and he was off and running. He is a “watch guy” and was reluctant to get a smart watch, but is already loving it. He likes the notifications on the watch and the ability to call without digging his phone from his pocket.
TBH, we didn’t even think about buying refurb/used on Amazon-I was browsing accessories for my watch and this deal came up. It has cellular, which we haven’t tried yet since Xfinity is our provider and they don’t support watch yet; but, at this price we thought we’d take a chance and get the cellular on the assumption Xfinity will be supporting Apple Watch before he’s ready to get a new one.
After reviewing the refurb prices on Apple website, I can say with certainty this was a great price.
We are happy customers!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Nick D.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2020","UPDATE: Be extremely wary of buying any of these watched. I went to a certified Apple repair shop and he informed me that the replaced parts are not from apple. I had a cover on my watch, and it fell from maybe 18 inches and cracked. Initially, I thought it was the glass screen protector, but that didn't break, the watch face did. This watch is supposed to have Sapphire glass which would have never been broken from a drop that small. I was sold a renwed watch that used cheap replacement parts. Now I have a watch that is shattered, and cannot get wet. To fix it with real parts would cost me $300+. So do yourself a favor and buy a new one or a used one that is Apple cartified.
Initially I was a little worried about ordering a renewed watch. But since it was an Amazon certified rep or I decided to take the chance. My watch didn’t come in the original packaging but it was brand new. There wasnt a scratch on it or a blemish. Not a finger print. Nothing. It was pristine. So I was very excited until I charged it. It was charging for over four hours and I couldn’t get past 25%. So I thought the watch was defective and emailed the seller. He got back to me immediately and had no problem letting me return it but I used my wife’s Apple Watch charger and it was charged in under 30 minutes. So the seller sent me a brand new charging cable. My watch now is perfect and well worth not getting and paying for the brand new one. So I would like to say thank you to the seller you have been great and I will be purchasing from you in the future.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Heather H,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2019","You DO NOT have to use the cellular feature. I am starting my review off with that because that was the main question I had and could not find an answer to, readily.
Having not been very versed in Apple watches any longer, I had one of the 1st ones when they came out and no one had them and I had not paid much attention to them since, I had done some researched and asked some customers at work about them. I still was unclear as to whether I wanted the cellular option or not, mainly because I did not want to pay for another device. I figured I would get the one capable and see what happened, hoping I did not have to use the cellular feature, but knowing I had it in case I would want to in the future. I am happy to report, you DO NOT have to set up cellular on this watch to utilize it completely. I can answer my calls, reply to messages and check ""find my friends"" without cellular. My phone is usually fairly close by, I am just not able to have it readily available at work and have small children, hence wanting to be able to see who was calling or texting, should there be an emergency, and I am happy to say that I am able to use my watch greatly.",5.0 out of 5 stars
