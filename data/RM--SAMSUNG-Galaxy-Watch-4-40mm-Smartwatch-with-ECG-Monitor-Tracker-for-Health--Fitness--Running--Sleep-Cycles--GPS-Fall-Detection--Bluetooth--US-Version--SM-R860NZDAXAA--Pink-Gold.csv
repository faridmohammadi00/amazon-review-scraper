Dan Baxley,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2023","05/13/2023: A really, really nice smartwatch. My wife has an Apple watch and it is nice, but I have to say that this Samsung 4 is a notch better. Her watch cost $280 after a deal with her phone service. My Samsung 4 was just under $90 from Amazon, and it is a real beauty. I am still learning some things about it, but love it, love it. Quality plus. But, another BUT -- like the Apple Watch, the battery life is terrible. You have to charge it every day -- that is, unless you shut everything off, or down. There is a feature on the watch, where you can select Battery Saver features. Still, so disappointed in battery life. I have a cheap smartwatch that gets me 5 plus days, and it does nearly all of the things needed to keep track of sleep and Heart rate. The cheap watch also has a Blood Pressure reading -- yep, BP. On the other hand, the Samsung 4 has ECG, which is pretty cool, and it keeps a running record that you record for your doctor. I will be trying the different settings on the Samsung, after all, I do not need all of the features that come with the Samsung 4. But, like many others, I do wonder why the cheap smartwatches are able to get so much use out of their batteries, as opposed to these HIGH priced, name-brand watches. As it is, if you plan on using the sleep feature, then you will need to charge every day, or night before going to bed. Getting 2 days of use is a pipe dream if you use the watch to track your movements and monitor your cell phone and massaging, which I do not really need, but it is pretty handy. Maybe you could get 2-3 days, if you shut everything but the TIME off. I will find out. Remember, by shutting all of the AUTO features off, you still have access to manually use, or turn on a feature you want to use for the moment. What a nicely built watch -- more later --

05/15/2023 Update: Battery life is terrible. You can extend the battery life by shutting everything off, but that defeats the purpose of having one of these Smartwatches, right? Last night, as I went to bed, shut everything down, leaving only the sleep mode on, with a full charge. Got up this morning and it had 86% left. I turned everything back on, played with the settings, on, off, and other features, etc. Also, had to reconnect to my phone to record my sleep activity. I have been up for 2 hours now and the battery reads, 45%. I got up, just under 2.5 hours ago, activated the watch, turned wifi back on to communicate with my Samsung Galaxy 22 phone, and have already used up half the battery capacity. My wife says it is not big deal, after all, she has to recharge her Apple watch every day. Great, so that makes me NOT feel better, not after owning some cheapy watches that never needed charging for 5-7 days, and they tracked my sleep, my BP, my steps, and, really, the cheapy apps were easier to navigate. Seriously, the Samsung is a beauty, but am I really buying jewlery?",5.0 out of 5 stars
swt,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2023","This is my 3rd ""Smart Watch"". My 1st was a Garmin which was very basic and bought by my wife. I was an avid runner and that was the Garmin's main intended purpose. However, shortly after receiving it, I had to give up running due to prolonged issues with my hip. So, it became a very expensive heart rate monitor - a function at which it excelled. My 2nd watch was a Fossil watch which was an impulse buy. It was visually attractive but excelled at nothing else. It sits on my bedside table and is rarely worn - poor integration with my phone and poor battery life make it slightly better than useless. [A cautionary tale against impulse buying.] I have been hesitant to pull the trigger on a more expensive smart watch but I lost the Garmin watch and really missed having a continuous HR monitor when I exercised. I am an old dude but my fitness is very important and HR zone targets have a proven benefit. It also keeps me on track in the gym. Well, I saw the ""renewed"" version of this watch, and the price point made it an almost painless proposition to give it a try. So far I love it. I have a collection of watches and usually rotate them for work but since buying this watch all of my other watches are collecting dust. The setup was painless. I have begun using an exercise app that has a continuous HR monitor and workout timer. This is the feature that is most important to me but I love playing with the other features. I emphasize ""playing"" because none of the other features are terribly important to me - they are merely novelties. But over time I feel some of the features will become second nature. I love being able to see my messages on the watch while at work but with Android I can just as easily see my messages on my laptop while at work [can't do that with Apple!]. Overall, a solid watch. MAJOR CON: battery life. Given the small footprint of this watch, and all that it is doing in the background, I feel a bit like an entitled brat complaining about the battery life but, if I could change one thing, that would definitely be it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Highly recommend this watch. The accuracy of it is perfect.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","The watch itself, is stunning! It's by far the best looking in all of it's features i.e., color of watch band, texture of the band and over all style of the round clock face and accents. LOVE the cost! I paid $149.99. LOVE that I can answer incoming calls and the reception is clear as a bell! Texting on it as well, is phenomenal. So many watch face choices and customizing features, I can't keep count. The colors on the screen and all it offers are more than I will ever use. I have only one HUGE complaint! After everything I was shocked to love and discover, the BATTERY LIFE IS TERRIBLE! I was so shocked. One charge lasts 24 hours. Even when I follow all of the suggestions about how to conserve the battery life. Of all the watches I've had over the years, the is by far the worst for battery life. My last 2 watches were Garmin Fitbit Versa 2, and the battery life for that watch would last 3 days at a minimum! I am honestly perplexed that Samsung could figure out to match the battery life as in a Fitbit.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Sammie,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2022","because it is kinda like an iphone on your wrist, it takes up a lot of batteries. If I turn on power-saving mode and pick the most simple watch-face, then from 6am-8pm I will have 64% left when I don't receive text message or text back.
Images are good, almost like looking at my phone, contrast, colors, and accuracy of pixel is good.
Texting- I like how I can text talk and it'll respond in what I say. This usually drops my battery life most. Btw, the texting language has to be the language of the programmed language of the watch, so don't try to respond using voice-texting in a diff language than the one programmed on the watch. Like if I programmed it as ""English"", I can voice-text only in english and not Vietnamese or Spanish.
Sleep-monitoring- in the morning it'll tell me how many hours of sleep, light-sleep, REM, and more. It's good, through the pulse-oximeter reading of my sleep patterns, I learned I had sleep apnea. It gives a range of your Pulse-Ox when you sleep at night like 85-95% detailing perhaps that night I was more stressed and didn't work out, so lung capacity decreased. It's a good monitoring tool.
Water-resistant- I'm a nurse at a hospital, I wash my hands all the time, so far no water issues. I never had to turn on the water resistant option, and use it all the time. Though, after 12 hours, the heaviness of the watch drains me, so I like to give my wrist a break and take it off to charge.
Battery life- I have to charge daily with this, can't go a day without it. But the upsize is that it charges QUICKLY. Within 15 minutes of charging, it can go from 15% to 50%, and from 85% to 100%. It charges quickly, but drains quickly too.
Phone reception- I used it once or twice bc I don't use my phones for calls much but more for instant messaging. Clear reception, my mom heard me well, and we were able to carry a convo while I shopped at Walmart. Wouldn't recommend using this option in confined space though.
Steps- it over calculates my steps, giving me the impression that I've walked longer, but no.
EKG- It's good, idk how accurate it is, but so far it's good.
Benefits- when you are on GPS mode, it'll have it on your watch, and beeps or vibrates when a turn or stop is needed. Really cool, in case you lose your phone while driving, or don't have a phone holder in your car, this function is cool.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Anonymous,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2021","Reviewing 40mm LTE Silver option, which comes with a white band in small/medium size
(Samsung's website lets you pick either the small/medium or medium/large band in whatever color you want, FYI)
The most recent update (not sure of exact date) causes the double-press shortcut to randomly be lost. I have it set to Google Wallet (formerly Google Pay) and of course this bug always happens when I'm trying to pay and I have to pull my phone out to pay anyway.
2022/04/24 UPDATE (2 STARS): The latest update broke more things in LTE mode (including ""Remote connection"" and Google Voice support) and sending/receiving texts in LTE mode still hasn't been fixed since the last update broke it. I've also discovered the heavy battery loss is when the watch is out of cell network range in LTE mode (e.g. inside a building with no cellular signal). When paired with the phone, it works great now, but I don't recommend the LTE model. They're still haven't figured it out yet and I'm doubtful it will be fixed by the time the Watch 5 comes out, if ever.
2022/02/12 UPDATE (2 STARS): Samsung sent an update to the watch which fixed group chat in Samsung Messages but sending or receiving texts in LTE mode does not work now. I don't always receive calls in LTE mode now either. Google Messages still can't send or receive texts in LTE mode either. The update did at least fix the problem of not being able to receive Google Voice calls in LTE mode. Samsung seems to not understand the purpose of having LTE because the only thing that I've found to reliably work in LTE mode is the phone app (outgoing calls only), but if you use the phone app your battery will die rapidly. I also finally got a response from a fellow user in the Samsung forums (not the various Samsung tech support agents I spoke to, who know nothing about the Watch) to fix getting notifications from the phone in LTE mode: go to Settings > Advanced > turn on ""Remote connection"" (it's at the bottom and appears to be under the ""Gestures"" heading, but it's actually just in it's own section without any heading, which is how I initially missed it).
2022/01/23 UPDATE (2 STARS): I've had the watch 2 months now and haven't had any updates in December or January to fix any of the bugs. The same problems persist and occasionally the battery life drops significantly with the same usage. Sometimes the battery life has been as short as 8 hours without using LTE. In LTE mode, I've had it lose 60% in 3 hours when I haven't even been using the watch. I'll update this review if Samsung ever decides to finish the software for this device properly.
2021/12/05 ORIGINAL REVIEW (3 STARS):
► TAKEAWAY
Samsung has a great concept here, but I can't help but feel I'm still testing a beta product that has been launched prematurely (and this review is being written more than 3 months after its release). Many problems could be resolved with alternate apps and future software updates, but even if all the software issues are fixed, you're still left with a watch that can only sometimes get you through a full day of use. In my opinion, the LTE model is not ready for market yet, and it's quite a bit more expensive when you factor in the monthly charge that at least some carriers charge for it. If you're okay always having your phone nearby, you'll probably enjoy this watch, but that kind of defeats the purpose for me.
► DESIGN
The design of the watch itself, as well as the interface, is clean and simple. The watch is thicker than I'd like (about twice as thick as a non-smartwatch), but that's a necessary sacrifice to fit a battery in. The watch is slightly bigger compared to my non-smartwatch and I'm really glad I got the 40mm version, as the 44mm one would have been too large proportionally to my wrist. I'm a 6-foot tall, 175 pound male, so even the 40mm version will probably be comically large on a smaller person.
The included band is soft and supple, far more than I expected (not stiff at all). The clasp is well-designed and looks great.
The display is not as crisp as I was expecting it would be, but it's not bad enough to really bother me either. The display surface is not very scratch resistant. After one week of use it already has a scratch. I've had my Galaxy S9 for over three years without a scratch.
An unexpected feature of the display is a toggle to turn on extra sensitivity so it works with ordinary non-conductive leather gloves. Leaving the setting on all the time doesn't hurt use without gloves either so you can set it and leave it. To turn the feature on, swipe down from top of the display, press the power icon, scroll down to the bottom, and turn ""Touch sensitivity"" on. Something I didn't consider when buying the watch is that you could have screen burn-in, depending on the watch face(s) you use. Turning ""Always On Display"" off should help with this.
► BATTERY LIFE
The battery life is nowhere near the 40 hours advertised. Many of its other limitations could conceivably be corrected with future software updates, but I just don't think the battery life is going to get better by the leaps and bounds it needs to hit the 40-hour mark. The initial setup, which included 2 software updates and a few app installs, drained the battery from 100% to 19% in 3 hours.
In normal usage I get at best 24 hours, but that's only possible when LTE isn't being used. I'm normally seeing battery life in the 14- to 18-hour range using mostly Bluetooth and LTE in auto mode, but even less if any calls are made (it loses nearly 1% per minute of talk time). Having the ""Always On Display"" turned off and using Bluetooth almost exclusively puts me in the 16- to 23-hour range, typically. In the 14 charge cycles I've tracked so far, there has been a lot of fluctuation. Bear in mind that batteries degrade over time, so this is likely the best it'll ever be.
The battery takes 90 minutes to charge from 0% to 100%.
► APPS
The next biggest problem this watch has is a shortage of useful, functional apps. The Samsung Messages app can't respond to group chats like the Android version can on my Samsung Galaxy S9, and it's not fun to get messages from 9 other people in a group chat saying ""you only sent this to me"". You can install Google Messages and it's a much better developed app, but it doesn't work in LTE mode using your main phone number (even when set to SMS mode only). I experienced a bug in setting Google Messages as the default app via the app prompts, but was able to set it in Settings > Apps. There is no Google Voice, Google Translate, nor Google Assistant (and the built-in Bixby app can't do much at this point). Useful smarthome apps like Alarm.com and myQ are also unavailable. You can't install the Ring app, but notifications with snapshots do come through to the watch so long as it is paired to a phone (notifications don't come through at all in LTE mode).
The built-in Outlook app is really buggy. You can't delete an email in a notification (even though there's a ""Delete"" button, it doesn't work). Outlook doesn't work at all in LTE mode either, unfortunately. There's no compose option, but you can reply to emails (without being able to change the subject line). The Google Keep app is handy to have my grocery list on while shopping hands-free, but there's no ability to edit notes, only create and tick off list items and read notes. Gboard is also available and is a must have for this watch because Samsung really bungled the default input (although the Gboard voice input doesn't work in LTE mode). Google Maps is awkward to use while driving, but would probably be good for walking directions. However, the app requires processing from your phone and therefore doesn't work at all in LTE-only mode, so you might as well just use your phone.
The nicest app for me – and one of the main reasons I bought the watch → is Google Pay. Contrary to information I found online, you do not need to unlock the watch before making each transaction. You just have to enter your pin one time when putting the watch on and it stays unlocked until the watch is next removed from your wrist. The only downside is that you have to open the app first before each transaction, unlike on an Android phone where you just have to hold the (unlocked) phone near the NFC point to make the transaction. I made Google Pay one of my shortcut keys to open the app, though, so I just double-press the home button and hold my wrist near the NFC point to make a transaction. I've tested the app at several terminals without issue in both paired and LTE modes without issue, but it doesn't work in any mode at one business I shop at; at that place, I have to get out my phone and pay. The inconsistency doesn't inspire confidence about leaving my phone behind.
I didn't buy this watch for the health features and don't really intend to use them much. Assuming they're accurate (a big assumption on any smartwatch), the simple apps for measuring steps, pulse, etc. seem fine. The built-in music app works and connected to my Bluetooth headphones without issue, but transferring music to the watch is painfully slow. Nevertheless, it'd be handy to have for workouts or running, if that's your thing. Pressing and holding the home/Bixby button works great for setting reminders, timers, and alarms.
► LTE
Both AT&T and Verizon charge $10/month (AT&T, at least, is about $15/month after hidden taxes and fees) to use the watch as a standalone device, despite vague language on both of their sites about connecting it to your phone's plan and sharing its data (seemingly implying it's not its own extra line). It makes the cost of this $250 watch more than $600, and that's if you only keep it for two years (and assuming they don't raise the monthly fee).
Getting it connected to AT&T was an ordeal. I chatted with a rep on the AT&T website and they said I needed to go into the store to activate it, but the two guys trying to help me in the AT&T store couldn't figure it out and said I needed to do it online. They mentioned that activating Samsung wearables has been an ongoing problem for AT&T for some time. I did eventually get it to work online, using the groundwork they established in the store.
To me, having the option to leave my phone at home and use this as a stand-alone device is the coolest feature, but it just doesn't work practically. For one thing, using the LTE mode drains the battery too quickly (and in an incredible fashion if you want to actually make a call), and then you're stuck somewhere without a working watch or a phone. Also, when I was testing the watch with brief calls, it dropped one of the calls and displayed a message about overheating (and this was in cooler weather).
I had weird glitches with the built-in Messages app in LTE mode as well: messages that wouldn't send, messages that appeared to send but didn't, messages sent hours later, and messages not received. As mentioned above, the Google Voice app isn't available for the watch, so I can't send texts or make calls through Google Voice either. I use my Google Voice number for work and I can receive calls to it on the watch, but cannot make outgoing ones. Without having my phone on me, I'd be limited to just my personal number for making calls/texting.
When in LTE mode, an annoying always-present icon shows up at the top of the display to let you know you are no longer connected to your phone.
► INPUT
Texting is a real pain with the default functions. I thought I'd just be able to use the microphone to speak my texts, but the speech recognition is not that great. What's worse, is after it makes a mistake, there's no keyboard to manually make corrections. You can backspace over words, but going back to the keyboard option clears the message you spoke. The keyboard is awkward to use, combining 3-4 letters per button like an old phone. It does have handy preset responses you can use/create, though, and you can edit and reorder them.
I use Google Gboard on my phone, and thankfully there is a Gboard app for the watch as well, which you will almost certainly want to install. It has a QWERTY keyboard, which of course is crazy small on a watch, but it still worked pretty well for me, including swiping words. Best of all, it has its own microphone button as part of the keyboard, so you can use both speech and keyboard input when composing messages. Unfortunately, the microphone doesn't work in LTE mode, only when the watch is connected to your phone.
► WATCH FACES
Almost all the watch faces you can get for this watch are a train wreck. The few built-in watch faces are ugly and/or awkward to use, and there aren't a lot of options on the Google Play Store right now either, especially since I want a 24-hour watch. 3rd party watch face stores offer a lot of choices and there might be a good one there if you can find it in the 100,000+ options. From what I've read, though, the 3rd party watch faces can reduce the battery life, and that's already a big problem for the watch. I settled on the ""Pixel Minimal Watch Face"" from the Google Play Store until I can find or make a better one.
► OTHER THOUGHTS
● The included band was white instead of silver (as of this writing, photos on this product page showed both colors for the LTE model). If you order directly from Samsung's website, you can pick whatever band you want.
● The watch I received appeared to have been previously opened. There was dust and scuffs on the watch, band, and box when I opened it (that cleaned off, thankfully). This is yet another reason I would recommend buying directly from Samsung's website instead of Amazon (Samsung offers an education discount, FYI).
● As of this writing, Samsung representatives I've talked to on their website say they do not sell replacement wireless charging pads for the Watch 4, so you're limited to the one that comes with the watch unless you want to get a 3rd party wireless charger, or maybe one of the charging pads for the previous Watch models will work (there's no indication they'll be compatible or not on their website).
● Samsung chat support is terrible. They know nothing about the product or its services, but will tell you whatever you want to hear regardless of its veracity. For example, I was told an impending update would ""fix everything"" including the app and battery issues I was experiencing. I'm not holding my breath for that miracle update and you shouldn't either. Perhaps multiple updates over the next 6 months will fix many of the issues.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2024","It's made my life so much easier. I had tried a knock off watch and it was very limited on what it could do, so that was a no go for me. I returned it and bought this Samsung watch and I am absolutely in love with it. I could reply to texts, which was my issue, by mic or typing it out and has all the emojis. It does so many cool things. So many different watch faces, you could change the color on the numbers as well. I was scared about the battery life reading other's reviews but I have my watch on all day, about 7 am til 9-10 pm and it's usually between 50-60%. I do charge it every night just like I do my phone, and it charges so fast. I am extremely happy with my Samsung watch 4. I bought different bands because my wrist was getting sweaty and I didn't like the feeling.

Laurent A.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2024","I liked it.
It needs recharge every 2 ~ 2-1/2 days. I am not on it every minutes like some people.
Screens are often responsible for 50% battery usage. But at least 3 days would have been better.
It captures my apnea, detects when I wake up. So that's a good point.
A few time the O2 measure didn't work during the night. it said I had to wear the watch about 1-1/2 inch higher on my wrist and a bit more tight. Since I've done it, it's better, but I don't like much having it that high and being a bit more tight there is not the most comfortable.
All measures seems within 3% accuracy... but I can't tell. about the body datat (skeletal muscle, fat mass, body water, etc.). These values don't seem right. Ex: I am often dehydrated but it shows I have too much water !!!!
The watch is not too big and not too heavy and seems robust.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Josie,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2024","I got this watch after owning a few fit bits. I saw some videos and decided this watch had a lot of features I thought would be cool. I don't use most of the features but its nice to have the options. I like the look of it. I like that you can easily move apps around, you can add contacts to easily access. It is easy to text a quick reply or call someone. You can easily see the weather, pick a new clock face, select your work out and more. The charger is magnetic so you just set your watch on it. which is nice you don't have to deal with clips or prongs getting dirty and not connecting. You can measure and record sleep and even your snoring!!!! The ONLY thing that I do not like about the watch is it said it had 3-4 days of battery life. I was so excited about that!!! BUT unfortunately it does not. I have found I get maybe a day and a half of battery life. And I always keep it on battery saving mode (which means I can't see the watch face when I'm out in the sunlight). So I end up charging it while I sleep because otherwise I forget to charge it and obviously want to have it on me during the day. I do like this watch better than my fitbit versa 2 which was what I had before. If the battery life doesn't bother you, get this watch!! I'm very happy with it!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Stella k.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2024",Some people said they didn't get an oem charger or the battery life sucked or it took forever to charge. This has not been my experience with this watch. I received it with a samsung charger and it charges in less than an hour. The battery lasts all day and I only charge it once a day. I haven't worn in a the shower or actually used any apps so I can't speak to that. I use it for Samsung health and it's motivated me to be more active and eat healthier. For me it looks better than the square watch and fits better bc it doesn't dig into my wrist.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Emily,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2022","I've only had this watch for about a day now. In some cases it meets my expectations and in others it succeeds. There are other things about it that I have mixed feelings about, but I'm sure that as I continue to use it and figure it out those areas of concern will iron themselves out.
I've owned several smartwatches in the past including a Ticwatch 2 and a Samsung Fit2. Both I liked well enough, but I found they lacked many health features. I have a Samsung phone and since my Fit2 worked more seamlessly with it than my Ticwatch 2, I decided to keep with the Samsung brand.
I'd recently updated my phone from a S8+ to an Ultra S22 Plus. While my Fit2 still worked very well with the new phone, I still had to manually enter sleep and there was no way to measure my blood oxygen. During Amazon's Prime Day, they had a great deal on the Galaxy Watch 4, so I decided to take the plunge.
I'll get the issues I have mixed feelings about out of the way first. When I got the watch yesterday, I got it fully charged and paired it with my phone easily enough. Later on while I was playing around with selecting watch faces and figuring out the AR emoji watch face, the watch somehow disconnected from my phone. I was able to get it to reconnect by turning the Bluetooth off and on through the watch. It did the same thing later on in the day while I was just sitting and watching TV and not even touching the watch. Both times the issue occurred, my phone was less than a couple of feet away from me. So I know it wasn't because my phone was too far away. Hopefully this won't be a reoccurring problem. Another issue I seem to be having is notifications that I want to show up on the watch aren't showing up. I've already gone through the notifications settings on both my phone and the watch and set things up the way I want them, but the notifications are still not showing up on the watch. I'll have to play around with it some more.
Now, on to the good stuff! It seems to do a great job of reading heart rate, sleep, steps, basic stuff for a smartwatch. I really didn't know what the body composition or the ECG was all about when I ordered it, but I thought, ""Hey! This could be cool. Why not?"" And it is interesting and gives some valuable insight. However, in order for it to take many measurements accurately I have to move the watch about a finger width above my wrist bone on my arm. I'm fine with that. A lot of other smartwatches that take the same kind of readings work the same way. It would be nice if the smartwatch industry could find a way to take those measurements without the wearer having to move the watch around, but until then those who want to keep a close eye on their health will have to choose watch bands for their smartwatches that can be easily adjusted.
Another thing that I didn't really know anything about was the stress measurement feature. I have absolutely no idea if it measures stress accurately, and, frankly, I really don't care. However, I do like that after it takes the reading it offers a built in breathing exercise. I may not know anything at all about how the watch measures stress, but I do know that breathing exercises have been known to help relieve stress and anxiety. They also help people focus and even get to sleep faster. So, having something like that built into the watch is pretty cool!
Another thing that I found really cool are all the different music features. Not only can you control music apps on your phone through the watch, but it has a built in mic and a small speaker. So, if you're away from your phone or don't want to take it out and wanted to have a voice recorder handy to make notes or something later, you have access to one right on your wrist. You can also directly download music from your phone to the Galaxy Watch 4 and can listen to music through either Bluetooth connected earbuds or directly through the little built in speaker.
As with all new gadgets, it takes some time to get used to them and figure out which apps you really need and which ones you don't, and exactly how you're going to use it. I imagine, over time, the watch and I will get used to each other.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Darlene H. / in GA,"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2024","When the smart watches first came out, me being a geek I had to have one. I had a Fitbit years ago and it was ok for the time but only had a couple of features and a decent app for the phone. Then came other versions of a smart watch.. I even had one that had a camera feature on it that was neat but awkward and low quality... bought just for grins and giggles. Then a friend showed me HER Galaxy smart watch and BOY was I impressed. I loved it but was a bit slow to order one because of the price at first. I ended up getting a gift certificate and I used Amazon points and bought my first Galaxy Smart watch years ago. It lasted a few years and I wore it 24/7 and loved it. It STILL works but the back disk came off and a couple of the features need that to work. I wore it for months after that piece came off and I'd had the watch for years, wearing it non stop... When the newer version came out, I got me a new one. I loved the old one and the new one too. I bought extra bands and accessories for the watch because I loved it and wore it all the time. I also got extra charging cables so I had one at home, and had one I kept in my luggage with my computer cords and stuff I used when traveling for work. I've been amazed at how much I DO use my features on my watch. It's MORE than a watch to tell time, it does so much more! The phone app is so easy to use and some things can be added and customized which I like a lot. Not sure why but I do have to charge my watch up every day. Probably because I wear it 24/7 and have loads of apps on it and use it for so much. It's perfect for me and if I had a battery that would last more than a day it would be good too. After I got mine, and my son saw it during the holidays a few years ago.. he was impressed and delighted when I got him one. He was surprised and he also loves his, he just doesn't wear his at night to track his sleep and snoring :) yes it does that too! LOVE MINE and won't ever wear anything else.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Nicole Martinez,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2024",Was honestly very nervous about buying this watch due to the constant reviews on the battery life being so bad. And let's be honest no it is not the best. However the charging speed makes up for that instantly! I charge it when I wake up in the morning before bed and charge it and before I got to bed I charge it. Honestly when I go to bed it's at 98% and when I wake up i am normally ariund 80% or higher and I am getting ready for bed I get to 20%. Now to give you a time frame to how long it last all day I leave my house at 6:30 am and don't charge it until 8pm. So not horrible! And a full charge is within 30 minutes.

Damien,"Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2021","Ive had many smartwatches. Moto 360, the bulky LG Sport, Fossil Gen 4 and Fossil Gen 5 (that I lost). I loved the Fossil watches because they are high quality watches using WearOS. Never liked Samsung because of Tizen. So when I lost my Fossil Gen 5, I naturally was going to upgrade to the Fossil Gen 6. I did do some other research too and the more I researched, the more I started to like the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4. I don't like bulky watches and the Watch 4 was more slender than the Classic. Reading these Amazon reviews, I was almost scared away. Anything from Google Pay not supported to the touch bezel doesn't work at all.
Let me just say, not sure if these reviews were early updates or what but Google Pay works just fine and the touch bezel works just fine (although I scroll with my finger anyways). The touch bezel is good for turning volumes up and down and it works perfectly whenever I use it.
Another contributing factor to choosing Galaxy Watch 4 over Fossil Gen 6 is the Fossil wasn't releasing with WearOS 3.0. I believe at the time of me typing this review, the Galaxy Watch 4 is the only released device with WearOS 3.0 and it is a major improvement on previous WearOS versions.
I'm not a health nut but the integration with Samsung Health is amazing. I do like to track my steps and sleep and this watch is awesome for that. For sleep, all I do is turn bedtime mode on and go to sleep. The watch does the rest. Monitors blood oxygen and how well you slept. Not sure how accurate it truly is but I do like knowing about how long I've slept.
As far as battery life, it lasts at least all day long. Usually longer. I use it moderately at work checking notifications, replying to messages and controlling my music and when I get home from working a 8-10 hour day, my watch is around 40%-30% typically. I put it on the charger before bed, put it on at 100% at bedtime and wake up to about 85% battery for the day.
DO NOT LET OTHER REVIEWS DISCOURAGE YOU! I challenge you to do your own research. Watch YouTube videos or even go to a local phone store and look/feel the watch. It's definitely the best watch I've owned to date.
If I had to give downsides, it would have to do with Samsungs integration into WearOS 3.0. The Bixby button is NOT reprogrammable to Google Assistant but can be disabled (not remapped). However, from videos I've watched, the Bixby assistant is useful on the watch as it can turn on and off settings by asking it. The other complaint is not being able to reprogram the Samsung Pay button. If you press and hold the bottom button, it opens Samsung Pay by default. Which is annoying if you want to use Google Pay. However, once you properly install and set up Google Pay (and make it default payment method), you don't need to open Google Pay to pay anywhere. Just tap your watch. But if you want to use a different card, you'd have to go into your apps and open Google Pay or assign it to open with a double tap of the top button (that action can be programmed to anything.).
With the Galaxy Watch 4 still fairly new, I'm hoping Samsung continues to provide updates from community feedback.
And by this time, I've hope you read my entire review and are placing your order now. Stop second guessing yourself, this watch in my opinion is the best out there right now.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Dan Leithauser,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2022","I am a fan of smart watches, over the years I have had a Pebble, then a progression of Samsungs-- Gear Fit, Gear Fit Pro, Gear Sport, and Active2. Before smart watches I was a collector of mid-tier mechanical watches, attracted to watch faces that I liked. (Looking at you Lum-Tec!).
Smart watches did not attract me for fitness tracking, but rather for the multitude of available watch faces. Truth be told, I do like the form factor of apple watches, but the 24-hour battery life and needing an iphone are reasons I originally decided to steer towards Samsung. My primary uses are for call / text notifications, Ring door alarms, exercise and sleep monitors, and timers/alarms. Much has been written about Samsung watches, and based on Amazon comments there seems to be a love-hate relationship with the Watch 4, so I am just going to limit my comments to a couple of points.
First, battery life. I was happy with the Active2. Battery life with both the prior Active2 and this new Galaxy Watch 4 is OK, not great, for me, usually 2-3 days...The initial setup scheme, unlike the Active2, showed less than 24 hours use from 100 to 12%--so I understand where ""poor battery"" comments come from. Over time and charging cycles, dependent on the selected watch face, along with power saving tips, I can get a solid 3 days.
Power saving tips. AOD “Always on” needs to be OFF, display set to 10 seconds, wrist flick screen OFF, HR measurements set to every 10 minutes except during daily exercise sessions, snore detection and blood oxygen at night need to be OFF, Wireless OFF, NFT toggled OFF. I also found that some settings were set to off, but actually on (blood O2 at night, set to off, but running at night. I had to reset the watch?). Battery life could be much better, Samsung really needs to look at how they implement defaults that consume power considering the vast number of comments that complain about short battery life.
Second, initial setup. With the Samsung Gear app already installed on my pixel 4a 5G phone, set-up was easy with a switchover from my Active2. Most of my prior Active2 settings were carried over with the exception of NFT toggled back on, and a required update of the Samsung Health app to show my default exercises.
Third, a new marketplace. My most frustrating moment was the fact that previously purchased watch faces are not carried over due to the switch to Wear OS, and away from Tizen. Samsung Marketplace is no longer used for Watch 4. Oh well. There are plenty of options from google play (add watch face to searches) and from Facer. Be aware, increasing the number of complications, animations, and colorful backgrounds seems to noticeably hit battery life. As indicated, I have found a number of preset options that give me a solid 3 days of battery life, with the power saving hints above in play.
As for watch operation, it is all very familiar to me. I am learning the new operating system and menu. A positive surprise was a totally flat face allowing the use of glass screen protectors, very easily positioned and attached. The Active2 had a curved edge making the install of screen protectors more challenging and less durable along that same edge. I also like the design of the watch band, which sits mostly flush against the curved case, maybe following a styling cue from apple.
If, like me, you had a prior Samsung watch, this is technically an ""upgrade""--but lots of adjustments need to be made to obtain good battery life, and some operational issues persist. With the current deal it might be worth a try. IMO, Samsung still has some firmware work to do.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2021","I previously had a really bad experience with the Samsung warranty department. They are not something I trust at all, but I am hoping beyond hope that they have improved because if I have another bad experience, I will totally switch ecosystems.
At this point in time, I am loving my new Active 4. The technology has improved so much since my Gear 3. The number one improvement is that this watch has a speaker (and mic). You heard that right. I searched online and could only find that Active 4 does not have a speaker, but indeed it does. I tried calling myself on my watch and I heard my voice loud and clear. I also have it read me my messages, since my eyes are so bad I can't read them. There is a zoom function, but that's clunky. There's also a function where it talks and tells you every function you touch, but that's even more clunky. If you have bad eyes like me, go with Bixby and let her talk to you. She'll read those texts.
The pay feature on Gear used to delete my cards on a regular basis and it wouldn't work at the registers. On Active 4, it works every time, and I have yet to see it disappear off my watch.
The health feature tracks everything I want it to track. The EKG function is cool. I don't use bioimpedance because it requires manipulation, meaning it doesn't just measure by normal wearing; I have to think about it and tell it to measure. I have a scale that does bioimpedance and gives me my weight, so I don't need it in a watch, but maybe others do. I like that it tracks steps. On the phone, I can see how many miles I've walked and how long I was active every day. Wish it would tell me the miles on my watch; maybe there is a way to do that.
The weather feature is cool. I like seeing the temp on my wrist, plus hourly predictions on rain.
I charge the battery when I sleep, so I don't use the sleep function. When I wake up with 100% charge, it tells me it will last more than 3 days. When I go to bed at night, it says there's more than 2 days remaining. That's better battery life than my Gear had (it used to die by evening).

Meredith,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2022","I had a Fitbit Sense prior to this but after drowning it shortly after the warranty expired, I decided to try out the Samsung watch since I had a Samsung Galaxy phone.
Overall, I am happy with it and would buy it again as long as I have a Galaxy phone.
However, if you are considering making the same switch, here's my take on the differences. I read a lot of reviews on both before purchasing and can provide the low down on just how bad some of the cons are that you probably read in reviews yourself.
Battery life - Yes, it is less than the Fitbit. On average I have to charge it about a day sooner. (This would be based on my personal settings on both watches, which I left quite similar.) It doesn't bother me as much as I thought, I typically charge it while I am in the shower and that seems to be enough to keep it going each day without much fuss. There is also a low power option that pops up and asks if you want to turn it on. It limits some functions but the important stuff stays so that last 10-15% can last a long time if you need it to.
Galaxy watch was missing one feature from Sense but it was one I never used (it was a 3 letter one) so I can't remember what it was. Galaxy watch allows you to measure body fat where Sense didn't. I was more excited about gaining the body composition measurements than losing any feature I lost on Sense so feature wise, Galaxy wins.
Integration of texts, calls, basically ANYTHING is better on Galaxy with my Galaxy phone. If you are a Samsung user, you will be much happier in this area. Spotify works better on Galaxy. Fitbit app often dropped connection with my phone that required troubleshooting with app versions, uninstall, reinstall, reset Bluetooth, power cycle, etc. Took hours at times.
In order to use all Sense features, you need a subscription that costs $15/month (as of when I cancelled it). No subscription need with Samsung. Basically the same readings and options in the app but I will say I liked FitBits app better. Samsung health is good enough for being free though. I don't have any regrets here.
20 months of Fitbit premium or less basically pays for the Samsung watch so in the end, I am coming out ahead here financially. Factor in the savings including the price of replacing the Sense and I'm ahead financially almost immediately!
Overall - Fitbit Sense has slightly better health tracking (better app) and battery but Samsung Galaxy has much better integration with my phone and provides nearly the same tracked items as Fitbit and some Fitbit doesn't.
If you have a Samsung phone and are considering the switch, do it!
If you don't have a Samsung phone, it comes down to how much you intend to use fitness and health related items, how user friendly of an app you need, and if you are willing to pay for all features.
Note for My Fitness Pal users: Fitbit has integration issues with My Fitness Pal sometimes but it seems to work seamlessly with Samsung health so far.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Seattle lad,"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2021","I had the 44mm Bluetooth version for about 2 weeks and then returned it. Overall it feels like an unfinished product, with noticeable software glitches. It looks like a million bucks on your wrist, and the hardware is clearly capable, but the software is so far from complete.
During the last week of owning this expensive time piece, Samsung released an update (CUID) that broke the heart rate monitoring every 10 minutes. This was the final straw for me. I could have switched to continously, but that kills the battery. Back to Amazon it went.
The software doesn't seem complete. Bixby is good at accuracy in recognizing speech, but it's functions are very limited. I'm using a galaxy s10, so I had the ""optimum"" experience, but there were still many shortcomings. You can't, for example, tell Bixby to ""navigate to X location"". (""Sorry, I don't have a capsule for that""). When I asked Bixby to create a shopping list, or add an item to a list, again no ""capsule"" for that. I found a lot of commands that would be useful haven't been programmed yet. I found a way to add ""capsules"" to Bixby, but there were very few and they weren't useful at all. Google assistant was supposed to be made available on this watch, but as of October 2021 it still wasn't available.
The app selection is also pitiful. Google has a keep app for wear OS (notes and lists), but in typical Google fashion, it's broken. It doesn't pull correct information when it syncs, it somehow pulled information that was months old, then when I made changes it failed to propagate to my phone. YouTube music was made available, but it's extremely limited. I use YouTube music premium as my streaming service, even with that it's nearly useless. You can of course pair Bluetooth headphones to the watch, but you can't stream from YouTube music. You can only download playlists to the very limited internal storage (8gb available from the start), then you can only shuffle your playlists, no option to play them in the order you created them in, or select a track. I was hoping to use wifi with the watch to stream without my phone while using the treadmill, but apparently that's not possible. You can of course use the watch to control playback on your phone, but that's only for skipping tracks and play/pause. No changing the Playlist or selecting a specific track from the watch.
I use Google voice as my primary phone #. Google voice is not available on wear os, which is a huge bummer. Whenever I want to use Bixby to dictate a text, it goes out through the default sms app on my phone (galaxy s10). This isn't ideal. I also can't browse through my text conversations like I would be able to if they were in the native Samsung sms app on my phone (it syncs to the watch, which is neat).
The selection of other apps is extremely limited. There are (often) clunky third party watch face apps, and even when they do work, they drain the battery like crazy. Just stick with the watch faces that Samsung has in the wearables companion app on your phone. Nearly all the other apps available are workout coach type things. Why do people need their hand held so badly through a workout? Totally useless garbage.
The system seems pretty quick overall, just lacking in any kind of polish. There are moments of lagging and framerate hitching, making it feel like wear OS is just a hog that can't be satisfied even with modern smart watch processors. I did manage to get a solid 2 days on each charge with always on display turned on and lift to wake turned off, so that's an improvement over the apple watch. One feature I *loved* was being able to charge the watch from my s10 using power sharing. I could plug my phone into the charger, flip it over and power share like a little Qi pad. Awesome. This means that the watch supports Qi charging, but Samsung has locked it down so it only wirelessly charges from their own wireless chargers. I found that it would take about 1.5 hours to fully charge from near-zero. It charges faster if you turn it off completely.
Unfortunately, It's just not worth $300 in its current buggy, unfinished state. Google clearly needs more time to finish optimizing wear OS 3.0 and build more apps for it.
One complaint I also have is that the ""touch bezel"" is not actually touch sensitive. The digitizer does Not extend to the bezel beyond the display. It simply reads the touch input from the edge of the display. This means when you are doing the ""bezel spin input"" you have to develop a muscle memory to find the outside of the Oled rather than literally touching the physical edge of the glass of the bezel, which would have been way better at simulating the mechanical dial input you get on the classic.
I found the bio-sensors to be pretty accurate. The ecg and body scan are cool, although the latter doesn't seem quite accurate as the results fluctuate a lot. Heart rate works well and spo2 during sleep also works well, with more data points and more detailed info than the fitbit charge 4 I got for my mother. (fitbit only gives you o2 ""variance"", low or high on a chart with no %. The galaxy actually shows you the exact saturation %). Blood pressure readings are still not available in the USA, because of the FDA. (apparently this feature goes back to the active 2, which still isn't approved).",2.0 out of 5 stars

travis,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2022","This watch is pretty good for basic things however it's accuracy on most of the medical measurements seems to be off. First off doing the body composition it quotes my base metabolic rate as being around 2400-2500 calories. I'm a 6' 5"" 345lbs man. I eat 6,000- 10,000 calories a day for the last roughly 27 years since I was 12 years old and have maintained the same weight since then except for the 45 lbs I gained during my marriage and divorce about 10 years ago. From 12 to around 25 years old I stayed within a 10lbs range averaging 300lbs ""295-305 daily"" on a diet of 6,000-10,000 calories a day. Last time I cut my calories down to the 2,500 a day calorie range I lost 80lbs In 30 days and I got screamed at by my doctor that this was dangerous for my health. So I went back to my normal 6k-10k a day intake. Also it measures my o2 levels at 93-95% yet I can measure on a oximeter from the doctors or an actual medical grade one and I never get less than 99% even with being a pack and a half a day smoker for almost 30 years. Even my doctor has never seen a o2 reading from me of less than 99% except one single time in 21 years when I had what was diagnosed as a upper respiratory infection that lasted 21 days just a month before the first news of the crown virus. This coming from someone who only gets sick once every 2-3 years and only lasts 12 hours my entire life. The watch doesn't seem to have the blood pressure monitoring that the ad claims. I've tried everything that every video online has said to do to enable it with zero luck. I also don't know what the stress meter is measuring because I have anxiety issues and it will measure no stress at all during a panic attack yet measure at the very top when I'm completely calm stress free and sitting by myself in a quiet room after my medications have kicked in. The body composition seems to be off and by doing a basic bmi calculation it appears to simply take your height and weight into account and give you the same exact numbers that any basic calculators will tell you. For instance it tells me that at 345lbs I'm 129lbs of fat and 40.1 on the bmi scale. Just so happens that a basic bmi calculator and medical chart will say that my ideal body weight is 215 lbs for my height which 345 minus the 129 puts your right at that same number. Thing is until a few months ago I worked out doors pushing carts in the heat and cold out working 4 other cart pushers put together that where all around 18 year old non smoking not overweight young men. I work out in the gym and have a lifting capacity of a perfectly healthy man when taking my size into consideration aka I can bench press my body weight leg press twice my body weight blah blah blah. For me because I'm close to the size ""height and weight wise"" of two normal men that means I'm benching right around 350lbs and leg pressing right around 700lbs so why is it that it's telling me that my body fat to muscle ratio is exactly where the medical charts say I need to be when it's supposedly measuring fat and muscle mass? Why does it say that my calorie intake is supposed to be around 2,500 calories yet I know for a fact that this isn't true because at that level I was losing close to 3lbs a day during a 30 day trial pushed on me by my doctor? If I've maintained my weight for close to 30 years taking in 6,000-10,000 calories a day? This watch appears to be junk after a few months of owning it. Now the only thing I ise it for is for the sleep tracker which I have zero faith in and to control and listen to my music text messages phone calls and tap to pay. I have zero faith in any of this watches health monitoring. It is fun listening to myself talk and snore when I wake up but other than that the health aspect is just junk.",3.0 out of 5 stars

planetmars315,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2022","The main reason I wanted to upgrade from my Fitbit which I've had for 2 years and still love it, was as I am getting older and live alone the idea to have the 911 and SOS feature if I fall was the intent. Plus I wanted to have the ability to text and make/answer calls and not be glued to my phone to do so.
I have a Samsung S21 so I decided to go with the Samsung Galaxy watch after the extensive research to find what would best suit my needs.
As with all new technology, it takes awhile to set it up and customize it. You can do pretty much everything from your watch in combination with your phone, receive texts, alerts, calls, make shopping lists, use Bixby, Google home, check weather and so much more.
I'm pretty basic and don't rely on technology for everything in my world, but the apps I do use are easy to function.
My main peeves are first, the Samsung Health app when it comes to tracking my fitness. The steps are off, the calories burned and the heart rate monitor...all read significantly higher than they should. I tested this when I thought I was about to go into cardiac arrest based on the tracker saying my HR was almost 200 when doing a moderate workout on an eliptical. The next day I wore the Fitbit on one wrist, the Samsung on the other and stopped every 15 minutes to manually take my pulse when there was a discrepancy between the two devices. My HR measured by taking my pulse and counting the beats every 15 minutes then multiplying by 4 was always in line with the Fitbit. So, I will probably continue to use the Fitbit when working out and want a more accurate reading. After 3 workouts the Samsung watch recorded me 100 more calories burned, anywhere between 15-25 higher average heart rate and at least100 more steps during an hour workout. Unless my Fitbit has always been off which I never thought it was...
The other major peeve as most have mentioned is the battery life. It's garbage. As mentioned, I'm not someone who uses a ton of apps. I use a static Samsung watch face (nothing animated or another app like facer), and keep all alerts silenced except text & calls on vibrate, which aren't many. It will hold a charge for most of the day, but never a full 24 hours. I'm not sure if there's a hack I can do to keep the battery from draining outside of putting it in battery saver mode which turns pretty much everything you WANT to use the watch for...off.
For the price, bells and whistles, you'd think the battery would last at the least long enough to track a full day of steps, exercise, sleep activity, the phone features, run a few apps, etc ...
It's at best (for my purposes) ok, I have it and it will get used, it's nice hardware for sure, it just has a couple of flaws, unfortunately to me they're big ones....but I guess nothing will ever be perfect.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Steve,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2021","The GOOD: this watch has virtually every feature you could possibly ask for in a modern smartwatch. There are actual working WearOS apps for all the important functions out there, and they all work very well for the most part. The watch-face customization options are incredible, and the two buttons are perfect in execution every time (I have my top button set to launch Google Pay with a double-tap, which has been fantastic for quick checkouts over the past month).
I love the wealth of options available - vibration length and intensity are adjustable, and there are even multiple vibration patterns to choose from (for example, one of them is called dubstep and is just as annoying as it sounds lol). I love the simple option which silences phone notifications while you're wearing the watch (no need for duplicate notifications), which is smart enough to turn itself off the instant you remove the watch from your wrist. It just works. There are many other multitudes of detail I could go into, but you've probably already read about them. Let's just say overall, the watch is great!
The BAD: battery life. Definitely less than 24 hours with moderate use and always-on display. I don't understand how people use it all day and then keep it on at night for sleep tracking. This thing needs its overnight charge. With a high amount of notifications coming in, I've noticed dramatically worse battery life. As in, full charge at 8am to start work day and then it's at 20% when I get home at 5 or 6. If you wanted to take this thing on a multi-day camping trip (I know, odd use case), it would last exactly one day before becoming useless unless you packed a charger for it. I suppose I'm really hammering this point home, but I came from a Pebble 2 (finally broke, sniff sniff) which lasted at least 7 days regardless of heavy use... so this watch's battery life was a bit of a shock for me.
Also a bit underwhelming to me was the fact that this watch, although being touted as the flagship watch for Wear OS 3, is VERY MUCH a Samsung watch. I was expecting to be able to use Google's Wear OS app to set it up. Nope, you need the Samsung Wear app plus another Samsung app specifically configured for the galaxy watch 4, PLUS the Wear OS app if you want certain functionality to work (like the camera app). That's 3 phone apps to run this watch in all its glory. Not to mention, it comes preloaded with about a dozen Samsung apps on it, which you can't remove without rooting the watch (which I have no interest in doing). Ultimately, I was expecting more of a pure Google experience, but ended up with a lot more Samsung than I bargained for.
All that being said, the watch is still a marvel of technology. In my opinion, the good outweighs the bad in this case. I love the watch, and will continue to use it heavily until Google finally releases the fabled Pixel watch.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Tommy Birdsall,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2024","The watch has many cool features, however my main gripe is the battery life, it dies within 8 hrs. So you basically have to have it charged for the morning, wear it all day then return it to the charger. Charge it and then put it on your wrist for sleep. If you remember to take it off your wrist, or remember to take it off the charger. The problem is the battery just doesn't last. My Wife has a Garmin it lasts for days! She can bring it backpacking or whatever, and has no problem. My watch has to stay at home. I guess I could bring the changing dongle with me. I will just have to get used to it.",3.0 out of 5 stars
80's Rocker,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2021","I originally brought the Galaxy Fit II, but then saw the Galaxy Watch 4 was available for pre-order and that the Tizen OS was no longer going to be used for the watches. So it was a no-brainer to return the Active II for the Galaxy Watch 4 (Especially since it was only $50 more and came with a nice wireless charger for both phone and watch.
So far I like the watch and have not had any issues with it. The changes made to the UI are nice and having it with the WearOS instead of TizenOS should mean more apps are available for it. Will be interesting to see where this partnership between Google and Samsung go and what effect is has on the non-Apple watch market. I am thinking it will be a good thing for both Smart Watch makers and User.
The watch seems to be accurate in all the biometrics it takes and the mapping of walks/runs are accurate. The auto-workout feature works pretty good and it does not take to long for it to register that you are walking/running. But if it does track automatically, it does not map your walk. You only get the mapping it you manually start the walk/run. Wish you could have it map no matter how the workout is started.
The hourly chime does not seem to work if you have your system sound set to vibrate. When set to vibrate the hour chime should vibrate or still make a small sound every hour. They could make this customizable. None of the watch faces I had on the Galaxy Active II came over to the Galaxy Watch 4, which is understandable with the new WearOS, but you still lose any investment you made with paid watch faces.
I like the electronic bezel over the physical one. It just give the watch a more polished look. I also has a Samsung Gear S with the bezel and over time it got all clogged and got harder to turn over time (and very hard to clean out). You do not have that problem with the Electronic Bezel.
Overall, this is a very good smart watch with a user nice interface. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking at a smart watch to integrate with an Android phone, especially Samsung. I have heard the integration is not as nice on non-Samsung phones, but I suspect that will get better over time and Google and Samsung continue to work together on the WearOS and the Samsung UI. For the price you cannot go wrong with buying this watch. If you buy through Amazon I would recommend also getting the extended warranty, that way if any accidents happen the watch is covered. I always but the extended warranty for electronics that are worn or carried around a lot.",5.0 out of 5 stars

clever1,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2022","I was very hesitant to buy this watch because I was scared it would break on vacation and it was kind of big for my taste. I did so much research and asked many people who already had it and those who had different watches what they liked and didn't. I basically wanted a small waterproof smartwatch because I was going on vacation and was going to be in the water, both pool and sea, for a few weeks and would actually be in the water about 6 hours a day. I wanted to make sure this would not get water logged, overheat or have battery drain. I was very impressed.
1. WATERPROOF - I did use the water block feature when I was actually in the water and it worked great. It tracked my activity correctly and logged all of my physical data. I was able to access most functions with water block on, obviously not some of the notifications, but the basic features worked well.
2. OVERHEATING- When I was out of the water, and had water block off, it worked great, I was also in the direct sun for about 6-7 hours a day and worried it would overheat like a cell phone but it didn't at all. I was in temperatures around 90° and over for 6+ hours a day in full sun and it did not overheat or even feel hot or slow down. I did take care to keep my arm in the shade tho, when possible, I wasn't looking to break it.
3. BATTERY DRAIN- I did not have any issues with battery drain at all. I did charge it every night, but that was just out of force of habit because I'd charge my phone every night too and both chargers were on my nightstand. The battery at night was always over 80% regardless of how much I accessed the features during the day. I used notifications, fitness, timers, reminders, email, and others. I traveled with it on for 19 hours straight and was in 4 different international time zones and it still had about 70% charge when I got back home.
For me personally, the face it too big. That's just personal preference though. I understand you cannot make a watch with all the capabilities this one has with a tiny face. I personally prefer a watch to actually look like a watch and not a smartwatch, I wanted something that I could wear and have it look like a real watch. Knowing I'd have to sacrifice a quality and features to get that, I decided to buy this instead. I do not regret it. It's a durable and very functional watch.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Y.Z.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2022","I had a Galaxy Watch Active 2 before. It broke while swimming even though it was rated for swimming.
Bought Galaxy Watch 4 as a replacement.
The first watch had a minor paint imperfection on the watch case. I thought it was small, but once I saw it, I couldn't unsee it. After trying to live with it for a few days, eventually I decided to exchange it through Amazon.
The second one had a broken SpO2 sensor. During sleep, it would show that my SpO2 levels dropped to dangerously low levels (below 85%) almost every night (I tried for 7 nights). I know this was not normal because the first watch didn't have this problem. Ended up returning the second one to Amazon.
I got tired of waiting for shipping and returning items, so I went to pick one up from a local Costco store. The third one had a mushy power button that was not clicky. It also had erratic sleep tracking--two nights in a row, I slept for about 8 hours and it showed only about 4 hours. Its heart rate sensor also did not match my fingertip oximeter. Ended up returning the third one as well.
Got a fourth one from Costco, and it's finally problem free.
Love the watch so far, but the quality control was not great--I shouldn't need to go through 4 watches to get a satisfactory one.
All four watches had different levels of clickyness with their buttons, but I guess people wouldn't know unless they tried multiple ones. This shows their product inconsistencies.
----------
Short product review:
Sleep tracking seems really accurate if the watch is not defective. Three out of the four watches had really accurate sleep tracking. Based on my experience, the watch can also track naps, but they need to be long enough (like longer than 1 hour.)
Heart rate tracking was extremely accurate by comparing to my fingertip oximeter (when not defective.) The one that had bad sleep tracking also had a bad heart rate tracker.
SpO2 tracking was completely off on one of the four watches. The other three seemed to do a good job: I compared to my fingertip oximeter and the error is less than <2% with the watch usually showing a slightly lower number.
WearOS was great--can download GooglePay, Spotify, and GBoard from the Play store. Can also use watch faces from the Play store.
Mobile App sometimes causes battery drain. I don't know what triggers it. Once I see fast battery drain, restarting my phone fixes it.
Overall, I would give the watch 4 stars, but the buying experience was only 2 stars. If I didn't have access to great stores like Amazon and Costco with great return policies, I wouldn't gamble my luck with this watch.",4.0 out of 5 stars
RDECO,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2022","I purchased the Samsung Watch 4 because we had so many sunny days this Spring and I could not read my old Fitbit Charge 4 in the sunlight, even in the shade on such days. I tried the Charge 5, which was readable, but lacked features that I liked on the Charge 4. I purchased the Samsung because it seemed to do everything that I wanted. This turned out to be only partly true.
First the good: the screen is very readable even in bright sunlight. It was very easy to get up and running, bonding to my Android phone quickly and easily. Its capabilities go well beyond those of the charge varieties of Fitbits, as with answering one's phone, conducting phone calls, showing map directions from google or other map programs when walking about a new city, serving as a flashlight, and many other features that I've not tried. Its like a smart phone on your wrist, except with a much smaller screen.
Second, the bads: the battery lasts 30-40 hours in my experience, with GPS turned off and Wifi on automatic. This is far less than the Charge 4 will run almost a week on one charge, and is a bit of a nuisance, but not a deal breaker since one can charge it in the evening in about an hour. It turns out that one of the features I was looking for, stair counting or elevation measuring (which is lacking in the charge 5), is a feature of the watch 4, but it doesn't work very well or consistently. It under counts them by quite a bit. (Yesterday, it counted 4 flights on a day when I walked about 20.) The other disappointment is with the software for tracking exercise. You can only use it on a phone (or perhaps an Android tablet), rather than on any device you might want to (as with a Fitbit). And the data display is inferior to that of all the various Fitbit apps (android, windows, apple). I had naively expected it to be better than Fitbit's, rather than more basic and more difficult to read and make sense of, and limited to just the phone. For example, there is no Samsung health app for a PC--at least that I could find.
Overall a very good product, with a bright clear and responsive screen, lots of apps for the watch, and the convenience of taking care of many phone chores without taking the phone out of one's pocket or pack.",4.0 out of 5 stars
dianemd,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2023","I do like this watch very much. I gave 4 stars and would give 5 if I didn't have to charge it twice a day. I hope soon an update fixes the problem. I will sure change. I am dealing with it but sure wish the battery lasted longer. It does so much more tracking and more accurate than my versa 3. Maybe that is why the battery depletes so fast. I charge in the afternoon when it's 68 percent, if I don't it won't last the night. When I get up in the morning it is at 30 percent. again I charge or it won't last the day. I love the sleep tracker and even does snoring recap. So charging over night isn't for me, plus I set morning alarm. If anyone has a suggestion other than take apps off I don't use. I have done that. Set up was super easy. I replaced the silicone band because I despise those. The watch face is very clear. If the battery lasted 2 days like fitbit versa 3 I'd be over the moon with this watch. I will not part with it. Maybe I. A year or so I can upgrade to a more recent galaxy watch but at this time it's all I could afford and with prime day it gave me 50.00 off.

That guy,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2022","UPDATE 10/17/2022: I've dropped the rating from 4 to 3 because of the OS issue. Today, Android informed me that it needed to install an update. Little did I realize that when I did so, it would completely reset the watch. For a terror-filled half hour this evening, I seriously thought that the steaming offal pile that is Google was going to make me re-purchase the watch faces I'd downloaded when I originally set up the watch, as it was impossible going through the Play store to simply zero in on the apps I've downloaded. I don't know when that changed either, but where it used to be easy to view my downloads, that feature is gone too. I've been using Android products for >10 years, so I think I know my way around the Play store. The sad thing is, I really want to like this watch. There are a lot of good things about it. The switch from Tizen to Android OS, though, is a serious problem. I don't know if it's big enough yet to make me switch to the other major brand of phones and wearables, but I'm seriously considering it after this last debacle, especially since I'm up for a new phone with my carrier. Google has the anti-Midas touch lately. Very disappointing.
Size-wise, this (40mm) watch is comparable to the Active2 that I needed to replace. I didn't realize that the OS had changed, so instead of buying/downloading watch faces through Samsung like I have been, I'm now stuck getting them from Google. Samsung had a far better selection, and there are way too many candidate faces that come up in the search that look good, only to get the, ""Sorry, this app is not compatible with your device!"" message. Hopefully this will change soon, but so far, it's the biggest disappointment.
Also, battery life through the first couple of days has been remarkably short. Plan on charging it before you can wear it; mine came completely uncharged. For the time-between-charging issue, I think I just need to find my settings and turn off what I don't need (WiFi etc.) to get longer life out of it.
Also, it's impossible to tell from any of the pics online which size bands you'll need if you don't like the one Samsung includes. From what I've been able to tell, all of the Galaxy Watch 4 models use a 20mm band. I had to go to Best Buy to look at actual watches before pulling the trigger on the Prime Days sale for this watch. Thankfully, all the ones I recently bought for the Active2 fit the GW4.
On a positive, the screen resolution is improved vs. the Active2.
Long story short, still getting used to the watch, but so far, I'm liking it. There are enough things I don't like at the moment to keep me from saying that I love it, but I'll update this review over time to let you know how I've adapted to it. This review is only after about 36h wearing it so far.",3.0 out of 5 stars

DaytonaDan,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2021","This is my third Samsung watch and is slightly improved in some ways from the Gear Sport I had before. But there are also some things that are shockingly worse, mainly battery life. A day and a half at most. Daily recharging is the norm. My old sport would easily go two days before needing a charge.
Also not a big fan of the sleep tracker, which unlike the earlier version, doesnt seem to measure how well you sleep. Sleep scores vary wildly from night to night and it seems to provide the highest scores on the nights you have worst sleep. This is odd since it does measure things the Sport did not, like REM and blood O2. (Snoring too but have not used that yet) But those do not seem to provide the information to actually measure good sleep.
Othewise, it's a fairly good watch. It is thinner and sleeker than before. Screen resolution is a bit better.
Health functions all work well. Automatic detection of walking and other activities, more than were available before. Integrates well with a Samsung phone and the excellent Samnsung Health app.
Built in speaker and microphone, which is new for me, means the watch can make notification sounds and you can handle phone calls via the watch, if your hearing is good. And use Bixby to issue voice commands, which sort of works.
The ECG heat function seems sort of pointless. It does measure it but spits out a raft of warnings about how it really does not mean anything and wont detect a heart attack or any other kind of heart problem. This was probably mandated by some worthless federal agency. But if so, why bother? All you get is a chart like you would get at a doctor if had it done. With little to no explanation of what it means. Useful if you are a cardiologist perhaps. Not so much for anyone else.
Setting up Samsung Pay was a major problem. It took several days before I could get past endless error messages ...and to try again. When it finally worked , it suddently mposed a daily ritual that was not there before. The watch is locked every morning or after charging and will do nothing, until you enter the Samsung Pay pin. A big of pain. In the past, you entered the PIN only when using Samsung Pay.
Not a big fan of the virtual scroll (my Sport has a rotating bezel) but it sort of works. The silicone band is comfortable but am not a big fan sliding the part of the band past the buckle UNDER the band , instead of through a loop. How much would it have cost to add a loop, which is available on the Classic version? The big hole in band necessary to make that necessary creates a weak point in the band and it will break in short order. I will be surprised if it lasts a year. Really dumb penny pinching idea.
In the end, a capable watch with more than its share of warts that really should not be there given how many generations it has been aroung. It should be always getting better but seems to be getting worse on some fronts.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Dan V.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2021","It's not me. It's you. The background is I've been a long time Samsung user, having started with the S7 active and then Galaxy Gear Watch 2 way back 2016. The Samsung Health app is awesome for tracking all-around fitness, from calories to cycling routes (I have become an avid distance cyclist). Unfortunately, despite having a top-rate fitness app, their products, and now their customer service, are simply lagging. It is apparent from the changes in Samsung Health that they are moving more towards a walled-garden approach like Apple. They've removed support for connected apps (like Google Fit) with the exception of Strava, and the list of non-Samsung devices they support in the fitness band Arena now contains a paltry list of sub-par discontinued products from other vendors. They want you to use Samsung devices, which is fine, BUT...
They haven't addressed a HUGE shortcoming in their wearables, which is battery life. Why is it that I can get a wearable from Garmin, Coros, or Polar that can last 20-30 hours with GPS active and 1-4 weeks without it, but Samsung still, after almost a decade making wearables, can't produce one that can last a full day of normal use? I had this problem with my original Galaxy Gear Watch 2 - it would be dead by the time I went to bed every night, and after a couple years simply wouldn't charge at all - and now several generations later the complaints about battery life are already pouring in?
I do love the Samsung Health app, and was very reluctant to change, but even the worst relationships have their bright spots. Riding over a hundred miles a week on top of having work and children takes dedication and sacrifice. I was willing to try to work within the confines of the poor battery life and use phone GPS tracking on long rides to continue using it. I wasn't happy about being forced into that decision, but was willing to accept it. So... after researching sports watches for weeks and agonizing over an expensive gadget, I pulled the trigger and pre-ordered.
I received a delivery date and when it arrived, anxiously awaited the package since I had a half-century ride planned that weekend. Except it didn't arrive. Finally that evening I got a notification that the shipment was being delayed and it would be another 5 days. Now, if the product hasn't arrived from the manufacturer, you'd think someone would have figured out how to let customers know at some point before the evening it was supposed to be at my door. So... I awaited for the new date. And when that date arrived, it said, ""Arriving today by 10pm."" Except once again it didn't, and I was given yet another delivery date two weeks away. The next day I finally cancelled the order, only to see that it had finally shipped and should arrive the following day. Nice. I had a twinge of remorse, but it was very slight. I broke up with Samsung, found other fitness tracking apps, synced my rides with Strava, and I'm done being held hostage by overpriced gadgets really meant to be consumer toys.
Thanks Samsung and Amazon for the disappointing experience with this one. Now I have accessories that I have to drive out of my way to return to get the rest of my money back. I understand things get delayed. What I don't understand is when that delay can't be communicated in a timely fashion. You sold a product on pre-order and gave a delivery date when apparently it was already being reported that supply was an issue, then failed to let customers know what was going on until the last minute. Not cool, and considering the reports of bugs and poor battery life (surprise) are already flooding in, time to pick something else.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Kereen Pinkstaff,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2021","I thought it was pretty alright when I first received it on Nov. 26th 2021. Then I noticed the battery life was crap. I never had an accurate sleep reading because it was always needing to charge at night. And it was always on battery saving! I didn't use many apps as this was my first smart watch so, I just had the standard ones that it comes with. Nothing fancy.
The mobile app is eh at best.
I had got the watch so I could start keeping track of my fitness or lack there of. With everything that goes with tracking. To start being healthier.
I never felt it was accurate. No matter if I was active or not. The heart rate was all over. But, I chalked just about all that up to me being new to the smart watch deal. And I figured because it was a good brand and I also have a Samsung phone the kinks would work out. And I was OK with that it'd be good in time.
Flash forward to last Thursday, I noticed the tear on the band by the clasp. (See photo) I contacted chat support to say I needed a new watch band. That's it! That's all I needed. All the other issues I was letting slide. I just wanted a replacement band. I haven't even had the watch a month. How hard could it be?
Well pretty damn difficult because after hours on chat, text, and phone conversations nobody was able to say they'd send a replacement band out. NOBODY! I was told I wouldn't have to keep repeating the issue with other reps, I was told ""The Team"" was going to figure it out, I was told someone would call me (I made 3 calls and was called once) each time nobody could just order me a new band. I was put on endless holds. I explained to someone and talked to her a half hour then she said she couldn't help then I was put back into the que. I text proof of purchase and the tear to them on a different line because the attachment feature on chat doesn't work. I was sent two links to click on and those people there can help. They were both dead end links. I also had two ticket numbers that were given to me regarding getting a new band. One person said it was for the watch band and another person said it was for a charger? So it was canceled. Their answers were weirdly scripted as well.
Well after a week and way too many hours I returned the watch all because they couldn't or didn't want to replace a watch band. I was going to iron out the other issues or whatever. I just needed a new watch band. If they can't get it together for that, what would have happen if I had a bigger concern. I don't buy expensive ass watches all the time or at all. But, I should be able to get a replacement band after less than a month of use.

James He,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2021","samsung's watches seem to have great difficulty at being consistently functional. this is my 2nd galaxy watch--the first being a galaxy watch active. that watch completely broke down after just under 2 years of use. the lcd stopped working and watch wouldn't turn on. I bought this watch to replace that one, and I figure this watch should blow that one out of the water. instead, this watch has the exact same issues the galaxy watch active had. the heart rate monitoring is inconsistent, and will die out randomly after the watch has been on for some time. there doesn't seem to be any way to fix it. I haven't been able to figure out what is causing it. the only thing that is certain is, it will always happen after the watch has been on for awhile. this is clearly visible on the heart rate graph in samsung's own health app, which used to show a continuous line for the measurements taken throughout the day. there will be jarring breaks showing clear discontinuities in the line, due to the heart rate sensor just failing to report the heart rate at random intervals, for extended periods of time. samsung has since replaced the line graph with an hourly bar graph, as if they are very aware of the problem and are trying to hide it. and it would have worked, if it were not for the colossal degree of the failure. it's not just skipping minutes of heart rate data, but hours and days. I rebooted my watch on Dec 10, because the GPS data apparently seems to indicate I've been darting back and forth along my running route, and I guess because I was flying, I only burned 60 calories from a 3 mile run. I expect a refresh reboot to fix whatever hicccups the watch was having, be it inaccurate gps, random slow downs, heart rate monitoring cutoffs, or all of the above. today is Dec 16, and I realized the heart rate sensor stopped updating again. I checked the health app, and apparently the sensor had stopped keeping track of my heart rate data since Dec 11, at around noon time. it took sporadic readings between Dec 12-14, only during the times when I started an exercise. it didn't take a single heart rate measurement yesterday, Dec 15. it even recommends that I use a samsung watch or band to measure my heart rate continuously. the green light on the sensor continues to flash, so it's likely still taking readings. however, it's probably some bug with the software that is keeping it from recording the readings. samsung should be ashamed. save yourself the frustration and buy a tracker that can actually track. made by anyone other than samsung.
to anyone having similar issues--it's not you, it's the watch. yes, a reboot will fix it. a reboot will fix everything. we shouldn't have to reboot the watch because the software is dysfunctional. this thing is a waste of money and time",1.0 out of 5 stars
Alberti,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2024","From few months ago I used to take my watch to the pool and after that it started to turn off and not get charged, I left it of few days and it started to charge and work normally, it doesn't make sense because this is a water proof watch up to 1 meter and I just used it to hang out in the pool not for go deep in the water. Yesterday I took again to the pool and as soon as I got into the pool it turned off, today I was shaking it and I started to see water coming out from the watch to make sure it wasn't the band I took the bands off and the water still coming out, I realized that when I press the screen, the water was coming out from the screen's frame, I really believed that there was water between the screen and the screen protector so I took it off too and I realized that the water was coming out from the inside of the watch, so I just accepted the watch has died.
The same happened to my note 10 plus, I used it in the beach and it got dirty and I rinsed it in the shower to clean it, and it turned off and wont start, when I took the cover off to clean it the back of the phone just came out.

John,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2022","Being an owner of an Active 2 watch and the Watch 4 Classic already; I figured I would dive into the Watch 4 LTE to use for work. Being a tech I thought the idea of no cell in my pocket when I'm on a ladder a very awesome idea. Ordered a Watch4 the other day, took hours to activate (provider issues) but eventually got it working and couldnt wait to try out LTE service from the watch! The calls lasted 30-60 secs before the watch OVERHEATED and went into cooling mode til it recovered. I spoke with Samsung and they told me I should buy from Samsung directly or my provider! What, really? Angrily, I hung up with Samsung and called Amazon and was assured Im getting product from Samsung directly. They processed a return but I did have to re-buy another watch til refund was processed. I received the watch the next day (today) and besides arriving with 0% charge and it takes minimum of 15% to activate and 30% to update software; this has been a nightmare!
Besides another activation issue that took another 30 mins to accomplish; this watch has overheated at least 15 times during setup (therefore having to restart every process multiple times), the NumberShare feature fails and cant get it charged past 31% for the software update where it overheats, drops to 20% charge and fails with the update; over and over and over! (right now 52% charge may seem to be enough as Im trying the update OFF the charger as anything I do on the charger (activate, program, etc) seems to overheat the watch; therfore stopping whatever process im in and forcing starting over once the watch cools, restarts and charges sufficiently).
While on the phone with my provider (ATT), they stepped up to the plate and stated they would initiate a NEW replacement for me, even tho they never even sold me this device! Thank you ATT!
So, I cant comment on the first watch from 3 days ago but the one i received today has a Manufacture date of 9/22/21 Ver 1.0.

Fired Up!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2024","I bought this for my husband and he loved it at first. For the last few months, it absolutely will NOT hold a charge. He has run the diagnostics and tried everything we can think of, and the battery only lasts maybe 4 hours - even though when he takes it off of the charger, it says it has many hours of batter life.
For example, this morning, he charged it to 100% and started wearing it around 10 am. By 3:00 it was already dead. Some days, it does not even last for 3 hours.
Not sure if we got a dud or what happened, but it is useless since he cannot charge it every 3 hours. He will not even wear it to bed any longer because it dies right after he goes to sleep and then vibrates each time it tries to restart, so it keeps him awake.
I know it was not as expensive as an Apple watch, but it is very frustrating and seems like it was a waste of money since it simply no longer works and it is not even 2 years old yet.

Amadeus,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022","It would make for a decent smartwatch if not for issues, some of which make it unusable. For instance, make sure both your phone's and Watch4's countries match, otherwise you won't even be able to pair them rendering the watch 100% useless. Both my wife and I have a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra (US version). I also have a Galaxy Watch4 US version which paired with my US S22 Ultra. I purchased an additional Galaxy Watch4 for my wife from an official Samsung Store while on a trip in China. I can't even pair her watch and phone, regardless of the hours I wasted trying all sorts of ""tricks"" recommend by others with the same issue, online. Samsung's ""customer service"" is as bad as it gets, they never responded AT ALL to ANY of my emails. I'll make only one additional comment regarding battery life: 3 days claimed by Samsung is either a joke or intentionally misleading (read lie). Maybe (and even then it's only a maybe) if you fully charge it and then leave it on a desk untouched for 3 days with all functions turned off and minimum amount of apps installed (factory installed apps?). Even so, very misleading. Personally, I would not buy this watch again unless it cost $100 or less. Either way, friendly reminder, make sure you buy the same country version as your mobile phone, otherwise you won;t even be able to pair them (""thanks"" Samsung!). Furthermore, as others have said, some of the watch's best functions/capabilities will only work with a Samsung phone and/or based on the phone's sim card (yes, Samsung will ""read"" your sim's card mobile provider and activate/deactivate functions based on that. In other words, even if you have a US mobile phone, if your sim card/mobile provider is foreign, the watch's functions/apps - like ""Health Monitor"" - will work or not work based on your mobile provider country). Too many issues to make this watch a top contender. In fact, in my opinion, it's FAR from a top contender.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2023","I ordered this watch as a replacement and presumed ""upgrade"" to an older Fossil model which had performed and lasted over 5 years of daily business use. This Samsung began malfunctioning at about 7 months in, with glitches including the inability to drag down on the screen to access the critical settings menu and quick toggles, inability to turn off alarms, inability to access/display Google assistant, inability to initiate Samsung's own workout tracking, etc. Assuming this was related to an OS update, I waited patiently for resolve via a subsequent update, only for the watch to become completely nonresponsive within another month. The screen is black, will not turn on, will not take a charge, and will not respond to the physical buttons. At this point, contacting this vendor through Amazon has been removed as an option, and I know that going directly through Samsung's support contacts will yield no results, as I also own a new washing machine with a major known design flaw for which they refuse to take responsibility. If this is not properly addressed, our family will cease our once dedicated purchasing of Samsung products, including TVs, smart phones, watches, washers, dryers, kitchen appliances, etc. It also seems that gone are the days of customer service, as I should be on Samsung's payroll at this point for the extensive efforts invested simply to make things fair for me as a consumer, after their recent products continue to fail. If one of my customers is left feeling unsatisfied, they receive not only compensation for the unsatisfactory goods/services, but also compensation beyond that for their time and inconvenience.

SL,"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2022","Purchased watch 3 months ago. The watch stopped working a week ago. Sent the watch to Samsung since it was under warranty. I was told it has water damage and the warranty is voided. Samsung wants $187 to fix it. (Samsung has lost their mind and is nothing but a money grubbing company). The only time the watch came in contact with water was when I washed my hands. The watch should be able to handle that and not stop working after 3 months.
Their website says ""The Galaxy Fit, Galaxy Fit2, Gear S3, Galaxy Watch, Galaxy Watch3, Galaxy Watch Active, Galaxy Watch Active2, Galaxy Watch4, Galaxy Watch4 Classic, Galaxy Watch5, and Galaxy Watch Pro can stay under 5 feet of water for up to 30 minutes.""

The watch has an option to let you track your exercise while you're swimming. So, forgive me if I’m confused. Is your advertising false/lies? So, I guess this isn't true!!

M Dodge Thomas,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2021","First, I want to make it clear that I am VERY familiar with Samsung smart watches and their configuration, I have owned several previous models and have spent a considerably amount of time delving into their setup menus to configure them for optimal use.
So I was astounded when I upgraded to a 44mm LTE Watch 4 and was unable to get more than 8 hours on a charge even with LTE, wifi, and bluetooth disabled, and after all software updates as of 10/26/21 had been applied.
At first I assumed that either I was dealing with a defective watch or that the watch was misconfigured, but a web search revealed that many users were having a similar or even worse experience, and that though Samsung is aware of the problem and has released a set of recommenced configuration choices to improve battery life specifically to address the Watch 4 issues, for many users battery life still remains abysmal.
In addition, many users report having an additional problem I'm experiencing: when making a cellular call, the watch overheats and disconnects 2-5 minutes into every call, you are is locked out of using the phone while it cools, and that this happens even at locations with a strong cellular signal - in addition to accounts posted in various discussion groups, there are several recent YouTube videos documenting this problem.
I realize that there are many reviews here by users who are getting somewhat better battery life, and that it's temping to assume that reports of poor battery life are the result of misconfiguration or simply expecting too much of the watch in terms of enabled functionality vs run time on a charge.
However, go to Samsung's own site (Amazon no longer allows embed external links in reviews, so you will have to do a web search yourself) and then search tor ""battery life:"", you will find MANY example of frustrated Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic owners who have done everything recommended by Samsung tech support and still can't get more than 6-12 hours on a charge, even on non LTE watches and with Bluetooth and wifi disabled.
And if you are one of them, as I was before returning this watch, a Watch 4 is going to require at least one additional two hour recharge to get through an 16 hour day.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Stefan Stoyanov,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2022","It's been disappointing from day one of getting this watch. As a galaxy phone user, I decided to upgrade from a 7 year old watch to this, thinking it can only be better. I was so wrong... Bugs that I've noticed so far:
1. Always on display is dim, so when running outside in the sun you can't see anything. There's no way to make it brighter, you have to touch the watch/raise wrist to turn it back on, rendering AOD worthless
2. GPS is slow and inaccurate. Example: running 100m sprints, according to the watch, my top speed was 10mph - yes, 10!!! This is my max out of 8 x 100m sprints. I run 10k at 10mph pace.
3. There is no heart rate zone training in the app. Old watch has it
4. Can't adjust your heart rate zones. My maximum heart rate is much higher than the watch has by default which makes all of my zones wrong. My old watch can be adjusted
5. My old watch has a mode where you race vs your previous run. Not GW4
6. It loses my heart rate all the time when using 'Other workout'
One more thing, Samsung health app shows a graph of your workout with time on the X axis. However, you can't tell what exact minute and second the point on the graph refers to. It'd be great to be able to see that (needless to say, my 7 year old watch has that functionality).
I was thinking about returning the watch from the beginning but was trying to find solutions to those issues. Now my 30 days are over and it seems these are the worst 150 bucks I've ever spent. Samsung just seem to be a decade behind true sports watch companies. I'll try to get rid of this and get a Pilar/Fitbit/etc., I know those work as they are supposed to. I do NOT recommend this watch",1.0 out of 5 stars
A La,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2022","I couldn't regret purchasing this watch more - a complete waste of money. I have had for 6 months and within 4 weeks I had my first major chip and crack on the screen. The design is completely flawed with a small lip above the watch frame where the glass face is exposed. I bought the screen protector and had no event that I can recall that would have caused the issue. Just normal wear on a very inactive middle aged lady. I tried to get it replaced under Amazon's 60 day warranty but they referred me to the seller and surprise, surprise, cracked screens aren't covered at all. Replacement cost was $200 for a watch I bought for $250 so I just kept wearing it. Picture is from today and six months in I have 5 chips around the outside, 2 major cracks and multiple small cracks. I'm looking to buy a new watch but can guarantee it won't be a Samsung Galaxy and won't be through Amazon, as they refused any assistance even though the first event was well inside their customer guarantee time frame.
I was also very disappointed with the watch face options. They advertise 100s of options to choose from but really there is like 25 choices where you can change the color and out of those, only 3 I would consider using. The watch band is also disappointing, with the rose gold color fading and discoloring within 60 days. I purchased a replacement and that band is also discoloring quickly.
I had used my Tory Burch Smartwatch for 2 1/2 years with zero chips or scratches, even with no screen protector, and loved my watch face options. It just didn't have connectivity to receive calls and wasn't compatible with Samsung Health. I'll keep looking but would warn you to stay far away from this overpriced piece of garbage.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Kato,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2022","UPDATE:
So two new big problems showed up for me with use. The worst is a voicemail notification with sound on my watch that I cannot seem to rid myself of. I have deted all my voicemails, turned off any notifications for voicemails in my settings and restarted my watch and phone. Within two minutes of clearing the notification it appears again, with sound, on my watch. Oddly, after the original notification on my phone it never appears there again. The regular, unstopable noise from the notification every few minutes is annoying but the biggest problem is it seems to double my battery drain, requireing more than one charge a day. And I'm not the only one having this problem as Samsung forums will tell.
The second problem is smaller but annoying. Text messages sent from my watch do not show up in the message thread on my texts on my phone, making it difficult to follow a thread if I have responded from the watch at any time. Again, Samsung knows about this problem, many people have it, but they have been unresponsive about fixing it. Until they can get their act together I couldn't recommend the watch in any professional setting.
ORIGINAL REVIEW: ‐‐---------------------------
Can't edit your calendar on this watch, can't use google assistant, Bixby's capabilities are still miles behind google assistant, can only use outlook to view email and calendar and unless outlook is your default handler of mail you can't functionally reply to emails, text message replies sent via your watch never show up on your phone conversation, even when permission is granted, the health app only updates via bluetooth. The two positive things I can say are I love the LTE function which allows me to leave the house and still carry my phone, and cell phone number, without the actual phone and I think the step counter on the watch is actually more accurate than my fitbit. I can go on and on. Please do your homework before purchasing and make sure this version is right for you. I hope these are just growing pains for Samsung and they will make some needed updates to the functionality and app coordination on this device. If they did they could have a truly landmark product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Scratch Monkey,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2022","I charged new watch out of the box to 100%. Turned off all connections to make a clean test. Put the watch on the table and did not touch it. In about 23 hours the charge was 20% without actively using the watch at all or turning on the screen. It is absolutely horrible. Dormant watch consumed 80% of power.
I am wearing Huawei 6 band for a week and it is still running on the same charge, it's around 15% now. It has the same sport and health functions like Samsung watch and I paid $40 for it. It is also not cumbersome like Samsung watch.
Samsung needs to fix their battery life. Thinking about return.
ECG tracker stopped working. When I try to run it on the watch , it says ""New version is available. Install the update from Galaxy App Store to continue using the app. If I click on the Update button on the watch, I get ""Page not found"" on the phone browser.
I've been through several support chats, calls, sms, they tried to remote to my phone! and still the issue with the watch was not solved. Every support team was trying to send me somewhere else. I spent several hours talking to Samsung support.
The issue with this watch is that it is using Samsung's own home brewed half-baked operating system. It is clunky. It is misleading. If you opened some app like browser on the watch, there is no way to close it. It is running draining power. I was able to resolve the ECG app issue on yhe watch by reinstalling Galaxy Wear app on my phone. It was just a wild guess. The watch tips and Samsung support troubleshooting was absolutely useless. This watch is a bad news.",1.0 out of 5 stars

David,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2022","Everything I try to do, I find myself thinking, ""This could work better. A lot better.""
The hardware engineering seems very solid. It's attractive, strong, and responsive.
However, the software mostly seems haphazard and partially developed. It's difficult to customize the faces for a power user. Some sensors won't work without a Samsung phone for no reason aside from greed. There are frequent crashes and errors for fundamental features like voice to text. The interface is cumbersome and can't be customized (you can add/remove things in certain parts, but not customize how those parts function or what parts go where, for example can't view blood oxygen during a workout). Extremely few apps are made for it and even fewer are made well. I constantly find myself wanting to do something that I feel like I should be able to only to find that I can't.
The battery life is abysmal. I had to look up multiple guides online for how to extend battery life, followed all of their suggestions, and still find myself having to charge it once or twice a day. When I look at battery statistics, everything draining the battery adds up to 18.4%. I would love to see what is using up the other 81.6%.
If you ever need to reset Bluetooth settings on your phone, you have to factory reset your watch before reconnecting it via Bluetooth to your phone. Why? I have no idea. Want to backup your watch before you have reset it? Sorry, you need to connect it first to your phone. Nothing with this watch makes any sense. This WILL NOT work properly with your phone unless it also is made by Samsung.
Overall, the device has enormous potential, but I think it has actually complicated rather than enhanced my life and the software honestly has me wondering why I didn't just get a $25 heart rate watch.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Clarke Hall,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2022","I bought this watch primarily to keep track of my heart rate without having to use my pulse oximeter. The watch consistently shows that my heart rate is ten beats higher than what my pulse oximeter says. My pulse oximeter works and is accurate and I've compared it to readings at my doctor's office and the hospital. I set up vibrating alerts for low and high heart rate. My heart can go to under 50bpm and as high as 160bpm. I set the alert for under 60bpm and higher than 110bpm. My heart has definitely reached the low end and high end of the spectrum and I haven't received any alerts.
The oxygen saturation detection does not work. It is consistently 10-20 percentage points below what my pulse oximeter says.
The fall detection does not work whatsoever. I have fallen several times while wearing my watch even after I toggled the option to be more sensitive to falls. It did alert me of a ""fall"" when I was slapping my leg to get my dog to come to me, but when I've fallen really hard, the fall alert has not come up.
I am a small person, meaning my wrists are also small. They measure 5.25"" around. The small watch band is too big even on the smallest setting. Also, because of the way the band folds under the watch, it makes the watch not sit completely flat. One side is slightly raised. I can easily fit two fingers under the band.
The sleep tracker is not accurate. It has said I'm awake when I am most definitely asleep and vice versa.
The pedometer feature does not work. It counts steps when I'm literally doing yoga on the ground.
Overall, this watch was a complete waste of money. I would advise anyone to get an iPhone and then get an Apple watch. Samsung missed the mark entirely.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Michael Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2022","Samsung does not warranty product against water. I have had this watch for 8 months when the screen started to act glitchy, and days later the watch stopped working. I have only used this watch as a daily accessory primarily for its fitness tracking and monitoring capabilities other than telling time :)
The watch is inside the warranty period so I decided to submit the claim and sent the watch in for warranty repair. Today (7/28/2022) I received an email from the repair center denying the warranty ""due to water damage"". This watch has never been in a pool, shower or any other activity that would be submerged in water. The watch has no visible damage on the exterior so I was perplexed by the denial of warranty by the Samsung repair department.
I spent the last hour on the phone with Samsung and was transferred to multiple departments with each department stating ""they are unable to assist with the explanation or reasoning for the warranty denial""
So buyer beware - the description states water resistance up to 50 meters, IP8X rating and if expose to salt/chlorinated water to rinse under clean water.. the irony being my watch has never been in any of these environments, yet the warranty was denied due to water damage.
I have many Samsung products, however as these reach end of life, they will not be replaced by any more Samsung products. I understand this sounds bitter, however the denial of the warranty after 8 months of general use tells me Samsung does not stand behind their products.
However on the bright side, my 2 year old Fitbit Versa 2 is still glitch free and now back on my wrist.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Vita93,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2022","Update to my previous review (shown below):
Do not, I repeat, do not buy this watch... if you want a cute looking watch go for it, but if you want to track your workout, sleep, oxigen, steps and get call and message notifications, this product is not the correct one for you. I have downloaded all the updates, have reset it to factory settings and nothing has worked. I am so sad because I really like the watch and had very high hopes, (even though i had the samsung 2 and it wasn't a good experienced either) it worked great for the first 2 months but now I am just utterly disappointed. I will never purchase another Galaxy watch again! (And no, I'm still not getting the square ugly looking one!)
Battery life lasts longer than I expected and it charges really fast (About an hour to fully charge); It tracks my sleep and my heart rate well... the only thing that needs improvement (I think) is better stress tracking, and even though it mentioned something about ""fall detection"" when I ordered it, I have no idea how to find it, what it does, or if that's something I need to download, enable or wha; But since that's not the reason I got my watch, I don't really care if I have it or not (just putting it out there for the ones who do care about that feature.) I love everything about my watch ⌚️size, color, watch faces, screen... everything!

Int93,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2023","I could write about it's features and what is good and not good, but at the end of the day none of it matters because of this one thing which makes it totally unwearable.
Chances are that every single person that owns one of these probably has this same problem and they just don't know it yet. See, I started to loosen my watch because it started to get in the way of the edge of my laptop when typing. That's when I discovered that, despite all appropriate settings turned off, there is a very bright green LED that randomly starts beaming into your skin that comes on randomly.
I am 110% sure I have done everything I can to change every setting I could to prevent this, but it still happens. So, not only is it bad for your skin to be exposed to this constantly, it's especially annoying for a couple other reasons. 1) it drains your battery, so the battery life is not good at all. 2) I walk my baby around at night to get him to sleep and it will randomly start going off and wake him up and then I have to start the whole process over again after taking the watch off. So, I just stopped wearing it and it's too light to even be a paperweight, so ya - I don't know what to call it. If Samsung ever fixes this, I'll reconsider, but I'd be surprised considering it's been years and they obviously don't care.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Once received I spent 3hrs on the phone with both my cell phone carrier AND Samsung customer service in attempt to get the watch to work properly. I was glitchy, had issues and was already locked to another carrier. The watch I purchased was listed as new, but it obviously wasn't. I went ahead and requested the return/refund within hours of receiving the watch. When purchasing the company boasted free returns and nowhere (I checked thoroughly) did they say there would be any charges for a return. When I went to print the shipping label there was a disclaimer that if the seal was broken on the box there would be a 50% RESTOCKING FEE. I immediately called Amazon and they reached out to the seller letting them know the item was faulty and the restocking fee would be in appropriate. Well... they only issued a 50% refund. I call Amazon again and was told they were able to speak to the seller and the seller promised to issue a full refund that would post in a couple of business days. 2 weeks later still no refund.

alaska15,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2022","First, I want to make clear that the Galaxy 4 watch is an excellent device...when it works. My issue is with Samsung customer service. We purchased two Galaxy 4 watches in September 2021 that worked pretty flawlessly for thirteen months after purchase. In the thirteenth month both watches suddenly and inexplicably died during Samsung mandated software updates. As the 12 month warranty had expired Samsung said our only recourse was to send both watches in for repair, or send both watches in as trade-in credit for two new Galaxy 5 watches. We sent the two defective watches back to Samsung via a FedEx authorized shipper, using Samsung pre-paid shipping labels. Last week, we received confirmation from Samsung that the packages containing the defective watches were received at their facility. However, just this morning, we received another email from Samsung saying one of the boxes containing one of the watches was empty, and that they were therefore denying the trade-in credit and charging our credit card for the full price of a new Galaxy 5 watch. The notion that Samsung could even suggest that we would send them an empty box is both highly infuriating and insulting. As I stated above, the Galaxy 4 watches worked excellent for 13 months...until they died during mandated software updates. My issue is that Samsung doesn't seem to stand by their own product. Just beware and advised that in the event your 12 month warranty expires, Samsung will not stand by their product or customer, even though it was their own software update that killed both watches.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Malery,"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2022","Pros:
+ Sleep tracking seems to be more accurate than previous Garmin (Vivosmart 4) and Fitbit
+ Exercise tracking keeps up with HR (unlike previous Fitbit)
+ Stress measurements seem more accurate than the Garmin
Cons:
- The battery life is a joke. Battery save mode, keep the display off, lowest brightness, still have to charge twice a day
- Sleep score is rubbish. Based on time in bed not actually asleep. Incorrectly assumed over 8 hours is bad. Based on bad research.
- Too many apps you can't remove and too many notifications
- Have to use DND, some notifications cannot be disabled otherwise, will still vibrate when far enough away from phone, still occasionally get a vibration for no reason
- Fragile paint, already have a chip around frame (light use, went for black color)
- Locks you into keeping a Galaxy phone for full functionality (Galaxy phones are not what they used to be, but this would be a whole other review)
- Daily calorie goal does not adjust for active calories
- Worksouts log multiple times/copies into MFP (have had this with other trackers but not as frequent/severe)
- Active calories from steps, not from logged exercise, does not feed into MFP (it did with Garmin
- Purchased LTE but it won't work, even though it says Verizon compatible

They could have put a link to the manual in the box, but they are too hostile or lazy. They have such contempt for their customers that they deliberately make it hard to get the right manual.
The same contempt causes them to hide the type of charger to purchase. The wrong one could destroy the watch. Then some suckers will buy another one.
I have never purchased a tech product with such unbelievably bad support. Since they have such contempt for their customers, their manual and other support will almost certainly be terrible.

Rileys,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2022","Update. 3 days past the return window, the battery life on this watch is total crap. Barely 12 hours battery, which almost defeats the purpose of having it! I use it as a sleep tracker and overall a health tracker during the day. Also, I barely even use this watch, I don't answer phone calls with it, I don't use any of the apps, I literally only turn the screen on for checking the time, and occasionally using the health tracking options. I would have expected more from this company.
I got this mainly because I've yet to have a fitbit that worked for me, and I really needed a sleep tracker. This watch not only works (already better than the 2 fitbits I've had previously), but it has features that I previously was unaware of. Only downside is that the battery life is kinda bad. It has the same battery life as my 2 year old Samsung s10 (barely more a day at this point), I was really hoping that it had at least a 2 or 3 day battery life.
The app (samsung health) that goes with it is great, and the samsung wearable app as well. There does seem to be some issues connecting Google messages with the watch.

I checked again to make sure it could work without the phone being on, was told it could, and purchased a Galaxy A20 phone and new line of service. Then I spent 6 and a half continuous hours on the phone shunted between my carrier and Samsung and my carrier again and Samsung again — having to explain everything to a new agent each time.
Each carrier-agent gave me conflicting information. Each Samsung-agent gave me conflicting information; one Samsung agent even told me the previous agent must have made up what she told me! Eventually, I was told at Samsung there were only three carriers that could activate the watch — and when I contacted one of them, that carrier said my watch was not compatible with their system! I have since spent probably another four hours trying to resolve this issue, to no avail.
This is basically equivalent to a bate-and-switch scam.

But if you have sensitive skin, I would avoid this watch like a hot poker because the watchband gave me a nasty burn-like rash about 5 weeks in. Twice. Oh, and look, now I'm outside of the return window. Great.
I've owned a couple dozen watches, some with silicone bands, and I've never had one give me a rash before I had this one.
At first I thought I had burned myself on some power tools, so I put burn cream on it, and stopped using the watch for a few days, just to make sure. My wrist got better.
Then I put the watch on yesterday, and when I woke up this morning, the same bright red angry burn-like rash was back again. At least I know burn cream works on it, but this is unacceptable.
At least I can take it to a watch shop and get a decent band for it, but I expect a LOT more from a brand like Samsung.",1.0 out of 5 stars

{As for this one} - I sent it back more than two weeks ago and see no sign of any refund, so I contacted Amazon. Now Amazon is saying I should give it 30 days from when I sent it back and contact them then if I still haven't received the refund. I hope it will be taken care of soon.

I thought it would be a nice upgrade. Big mistake. The watch is attractive with a nice slim form factor. About the only things it did which the old Huawei couldn't was display altitude during hiking workout, NFC payments and ECG. Nifty yes, but these features were more than offset by how poorly the watch and the Samsung Health app performed in most other respects. When hiking the watch thought that I covered 9+ miles on a 6 mile hike (I've done the hike for years and am certain of the distance). This happened twice. The watch was useless for tracking sleep. I woke up once in the middle of the night and the next morning the watch said that I'd only slept for two hours. It never picked up tracking the rest of my sleep. This happened several nights. The 'virtual' rotating bezel was cumbersome due to the small face.

Person from the USA,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2021","I really wanted to like this watch, however I can't.
First of all, even the LTE version is entirely dependent on the phone. For example, there is no way to set up this watch without a Samsung phone.
Second, there's no way to activate the watch outside of the big three Network providers in the United States. And again, your phone must have a data plan in order to activate the watch.
Third, even in the LTE mode when it gets its own phone number, when you call from the watch, the other party will see your phone headset number not your watch number. This causes massive confusion as you end up with two active phone numbers and everyone calls your watch but you appear to be calling from some other number.
Fourth, Google services are completely absent and you are completely dependent on the Samsung equivalents. Needless to say Samsung store is very light on apps. For example, there is no Gmail or Google meet or hangouts or Google Assistant.

Amy and Stevan Kuhn,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024","I was super excited to get the galaxy watch! I mean you hear Samsung Galaxy and you think awesome right?? Well, wrong.. It is definitely not up to the galaxy standards...
First off, every review about battery life is 1000% true. For instance I leave it on power saving mode 24/7 and I have to charge it twice a day. If I go to sleep with it at 100% battery life and leave it on power saving mode and put it in bed mode it will be at 80% battery when I get up 6-7 hours later.
It really does want you to use like 4 different apps. But you can get away with only 2. Both of those apps really suck...
The touch screen is kinda of insensitive. When I try to pull down to check battery life or take bed mode off it takes a few tries before it seems to sense my touch.
There are very little watch faces, and you can't customize it at all. I find this extremely odd since my last $30 watch I could put a picture.
The sleep tracking seems pretty legitimate as well as the step tracker. And you can answer texts which is nice.
If your watch is more then 10 feet from your phone it will disconnect which is a bit annoying.
All in all, DEFINITELY NOT worth the money.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Claudene R.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2022","UPDATE #2: So, my replacement watch has now began to overheat, twice within the last 24 hrs. I feel the heat on my wrist and the watch face says I'm only allowed to make emergency calls. After about 2 to 3 minutes the screen says ""Cooled....You can now use your watch."" I'm not sure what causes this. Both times I've been wearing the watch for a few hours and haven't been doing anything specific. The last time was early in the morning just waking up, no alarm used. I'll be calling customer service or the insurance plan carrier. Don't think I'll purchase another Samsung Watch after this one. I never had this much trouble with my Fitbit until about 2 years later. I've only had this (replacement) watch since July 10th and it's only August 28th and it's already giving me trouble. I'm only keeping it because it wasn't cheap!!
UPDATE #1: The replacement is much better!! Been wearing for about 4 days now. No issues with the alarms. Vibrating as it should. And no over heating! I only wish this watch was supported completely by the WW app so that all my data (sleep info) would sync but thats ok. I can enter this stuff in manually (which, I probably wont). My main usage for this watch is the alarm and exercise options and those function fine. Glad I made the purchase and there weren't any issues with replacing the original defective watch for a new one. Amazon customer service is THE BEST!!!
ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've only had this watch for about 2 weeks and I've had trouble since day 1 mainly due to the alarms. I've set them up the correct way (had 2 smart watches previously and alarms were used without an issue)!! Turn the Sound settings to Mute and the Vibrate to a certain vibrate setting. My issue was the watch not vibrating!!! The watch screen just lit up showing the alarm going off but no vibrating! I tried deleting the alarms, created new ones which didn't help. I lost sleep watching the clock all night in fear that I'd be late for work (good thing i did because the watch never vibrated). I then did software updates as advised which those took insanely long (about 2 hours). Eventually, the alarms seemed to work (but I never trusted it lol). I turned on a back up clock and phone alarm (which will wake my spouse), just in case the watch reverted back to its old habits. With the alarms now working, this morning the watch started to feel increasingly hot against my skin, thought I was just feeling things. But no, about 10 minutes later the screen said the watch needs to cool and the only function that will work is making emergency calls. I shut the watch down, waited a few minutes, turned it back on, and it did the same thing. I shut it down a second time, and the same thing happened!! With all these problems, i decided to just order a replacement because this most recent issue seems a little dangerous with this over heating problem. I sometimes leave my watch charging while in the shower and doing things around the house. I'm afraid of a fire beginning while I'm away due to it over heating. Or worse, I get burned because it suddenly starts heating up for no reason. Oh, and the battery life sucks! I've noticed it has something to do with the watch face, so i switched to a more simple, less active face and placed in Battery Saving Mode which resulted in some improvement however, the battery life is still pretty low at night after all day use and wont make 16-20 hours without being charged. I'll update this review once I receive the replacement watch. I really want it to work as it wasn't cheap, is super cute and i need a quiet vibrating alarm!!",2.0 out of 5 stars
Jessica,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2024","I've had quite a few smart watches, theyre usually FitBit. I'm a pretty loyal Samsung Galaxy phone user, and I always wanted a Galaxy watch. I was so excited to finally be able to get one! I have a very physical job, so i wanted to use it to track my activity at work. I used it with bare minimum features, no GPS or anything. In the 3 days I wore it (which were my days off where I wasn't even doing very much compared to when I'm working) I had to charge it 4 times, and all it really did was be on my wrist. It would be at 100% before I went to bed, and just using its sleep tracking it would be at 45% when I woke up 7 hours later. This is kind of ridiculous to me, nothing on this watch should drain the battery THAT fast. Oh, and I used the body composition feature once when I first got it. I did everything it told me to do and it still fought me to do it, but don't trust that feature at all. I'm roughly 190 pounds, and the totals it gave me for my ""body composition"" totaled up to 222.5 pounds. So yeah, an extra 30 something pounds came out of nowhere using that lovely feature. Overall, the watch is fine. I ordered a Garmin because I get a good discount through my job, and I'm excited for that one. I'd love to return this watch and get all that money back, but I can't because the packaging it came in went out in the trash even though I set it aside for this exact reason. But whatever. Bottom line: this watch does everything it says it does, but if you actually use any of the features you'll be lucky if the watch lasts more than 10 hours on a full charge.",2.0 out of 5 stars
April,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2024","I was so excited about getting a SmartWatch. It is easy to set up, it has a lot of awesome features, I loved being able to call and text from my phone and FIND MY PHONE-those were my favorite features. I used the Samsung health features which are really pretty cool. I received this on Monday, I noticed that where the watch contacted my skin that it was slightly tingly and asked my daughter if she experienced this with her SmartWatch and she said no. I made sure it was loose like I saw in some feedback online.
The tingling wasn't too crazy so I continued to wear it and charge it pretty much every day (the battery life isn't great) by Saturday (5 days after receiving the SmartWatch) when I was charging the watch I noticed that my hand felt like the watch was still on and it was numb at the site. I have left the watch off since then and today, 3 days later, it is still numb and I have opted to return the Samsung 4 SmartWatch. I am really going to miss the fun features of being able to find my phone, call on my phone etc. but health wise it wasn't a good option for me, not sure if it would have spread.
That said, I think this is probably an isolated event but I did find similar instances online where they had this issue (I'm assuming the numbness went away)--hoping for that. If it wasn't for the tingling and numbness I would definitely have given this a 5 star.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Matt,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2022","After my Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 sustained water damage from less than a meter of fresh water, I had intended to purchase a Pixel Watch, Fitbit, or Garming smartwatch, but Amazon had a great deal on this 40mm Galaxy Watch 4 I couldn't turn down. I won't go into the positives too much, as there are numerous reviews talking about them, but it is far superior to the Active 2. The animations are smoother, the app compatibility is much greater due to using WearOS and not Tizen, the health features are better, and software support is until 2026. However, there are several negatives which I will list.
First is battery life, which is about 36 hours with the always on display set to off and a non-animated dark watch face. This is pathetic considering the Active 2 lasted over 2 days easily with the same settings. This means you will have to carry the charger with you everywhere if you are going on an overnight trip, as it is not QI compatible with all QI chargers, especially Anker brand.
Second is the watch faces. On previous Galaxy watches with Tizen OS there was a wide selection of free, nice watch faces. With the move to WearOS there are very few free watch faces, a good 99% have restrictions unless you pay, and due to the way WearOS treats watch faces, which are full-fledged apps, instead of just watch faces, app developers have access to much more of your data. Also, the number of included Samsung watch faces is few, even fewer than previous Galaxy watches. This negative will apply to all WearOS watches currently, however, but Samsung could have included a larger selection of first party watch faces considering the price of the watch. I will say that updates have added some new watch faces, like the Ball Watch Face, but it's not useful or desirable vs the kind of paid watch faces which have millions of downloads, and the Pixel Watch has many more included faces.
Third is the watch band. This version is for S/M wrists, not M/L wrists. This is not listed in the description.
If you can get this watch for under $140, and you don't mind charging it every day, and you don't mind using the included watch faces or paying for one, then you won't be disappointed.",2.0 out of 5 stars
IWeeleeWantedTaWikeDisPwaduct,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2022","Update 1/2/24 after 1 year. The watch is just plain weird and functions inconsistently from one day to the next. Always on doesn't work; sleep tracking is worse than it was with prior software versions; the dang thing keeps giving me annoying notifications that I can't turn off. I can't even tell the watch to shut the frip up on all the smart features and just act like a watch lol. It's not just me there are plenty of posts on the web complaining about these issues.
I WILL say that the battery life is better than it was when I bought it presumably from software updates. Also the heart rate tracker is accurate for resting heart rate and for cycling but not any activity such as weight lifting body pump and the like where you're moving your arms a lot.
Prior review:
I''m updating my review dropping the rating to two stars and that's being generous. This watch is more maintenance than a spouse. The worst of it is that it reported AFib and I wound up going to emergency for 5 hours. The doctor looked at the graphi from the watch and said this graph doesn't even show an afib Reading. Sent me home and my insurance had to pay big time.
Anyway I keep the watch on my end table because it's such a pain in the butt and every once in a while pick it up for a laugh or to see if anything's improved like the crappy sleep monitoring - nearly useless. Today I picked it up to load the beta OS Samsung has. First off I notice that the time is off! It's showing something like 5:30 p.m. when the time is actually 8:15 a.m. I had to reset the danged watch in order to correct this. I'm not going to go on with the litany of malfunctions that followed but I'm wondering how many software project managers they had to fire or maybe they're so messed up that think stuff like this is normal. Anyway let's just say their software is a big malfunctining cluster-tuck.
Anyway I'll give it another shot after the new OS gets out of beta at which time I'll write another review either complimenting or showing me taking a hammer to this stupid watch. In the meantime I'm going back to my old solar powered Seiko that hasn't missed a beat since I bought it 7 years ago .

The look and screen is fantastic as just a watch time piece. Now I am Deaf *wear CI, and visually imp. so don't use any of the apps except the health stuff on my phone. I LOVE the clock faces..which is bright and some are really large for me to see. BUT if I was going to buy this at full price, I would definitely return.

Tony,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2022","Watched was a great product until it stopped working. Set it on the charger for about thirty minutes after it died. When I went to turn it back on the screen wouldn't come on, but I could tell it was on because it was vibrating for phone calls and messages. The backside looked like the battery leaked acid out.
Being only 8 months old Samsung told me it was still under warranty and sent me to a repair shop about 40 minutes away, who told me that they cannot repair watches, which Samsung knows but sends people to anyways, and I'd have to send it to Samsung.
The day Samsung received the watch they sent me a bill for $176 saying it was out of warranty. I called and they said it had liquid damage (if you google,many people have been told the same thing when it breaks) and was no longer powering on. The watch has never been in the shower or pool, only in rain which it is supposedly water resistant up to 200' of water. It also powered on before sending it to them.
I argued with them and Mikayla in the repair department said they would have a second person look into it and call back in 48 hours. 4 days later I recieved an email saying the watch was being returned unfixed and I never received a call back so I called and was told it was set for exchange. Talked to someone in the case management department and they said the price was going to be refunded. I asked how long and they said once the paperwork it accepted, then asked me to confirm my contact so they could START the paperwork.

Being able to record the plethysmograph and view it from the app (Samsung Health) would have been nice too, but that seems unlikely now. Maybe this was just a feature that was forgotten during the switch from Tizen OS to Google's, which, in Samsung's favor, I liked Tizen better.
The sleep Oxygen saturation traking is nice, but they could have enabled it on the previous model... but hey, then maybe you wouldn't dish out extra cash for this upgrade right!? ...and I get the feeling that samsung will probably bring back plethysmography to the next model as a ""new"" feature, if they bring it back at all... so you'll have to upgrade to get that too.
All-in-all, Samsung's business practices have me reconsidering my choice of brands because at this point, it seems like a case of good products held hostage by crappy marketing and greedy business executives.
Such a shame, great products with clever engineering held hostage by brainless bean-counters and penny pinchers.
Once this watch and my phone are due for replacement I will likely be going elsewhere unless this kind of practice changes.
There are PLENTY of Android powered products out there by other manufacturers with the same features for less money... and they DON'T make you upgrade devices just to receive what could have been software upgrades because they KNOW you will switch brands... Samsung has become cocky, and it seems they too may be headed for stagnation much like Apple did after the passing of Steve Jobs.

YnotMe,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021","Update: I've been using it for basically a week now. If I turn things off and turn down the screen I can eek out a day before I need to charge it. Touch bezel is pointless. It works but it is easier to just not use it. Unfortunately I don't have a Samsung phone, cause it just won't do certain things without one. My son has the active 2 with a s21 and it does more than my 4. Sleep detection is awful. I've kept track for some time now with my Amazfit, which was hit or miss. For most of this week I've worn both watches to compare. It's been unbelievable how different numbers are between the two. Samsung is much higher on footsteps and sleep time. 50% higher at times. And I'm still not happy about the Tizen, I mean ""wear os"" software on this watch.
The watch came yesterday, but I already have some strong opinions. It is not a wear OS watch. What it is, is a Samsung watch that may use wear os as a starting point but puts a heavy skin on top of it. I cannot use it with wear os on my phone. So in other words I'm stuck with Samsung apps to run the watch. Absolutely not what I want. Second, the battery life is a joke. The watch came in the box, flat dead. I charged it fully right before bedtime, next morning at 4am it's at 40%, that means I'll be charging it twice a day to use it as I see fit. Plus when I woke up the clasp on the watch had unbuckled itself.
Not sure if I'll learn to live with Samsung instead of Google. But not happy at the moment. It kinda reminds me of the Amazon fire phone, yeah I could get google apps, but it still wasn't google android. Same thing here, yeah I can get get google apps but it's not wear os.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Sara T,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2022","I wanted to love this. I love that it worked so well with my Samsung phone. Love the body composition option and all the cool things I could do with it. I think it counted steps and did my heart rate just fine. I liked being able to reply to texts and answer the phone from my watch and the sleep data was great. BUT....
the total calories burned data is what messed it up for me. Like one day I walked 9000 steps, 2 floors and burned 2141 calories. The next day I walked over 16000 steps 6 floors and only burned 2060 calories. The only difference is that I actually logged an actual walk on the former day. My friend, who did everything I did on the 16000 step day, had about the same amount of steps and floors, but her fitbit said she burned 2500 calories for the day. I know fitbit takes into account your heart rate and how many calories that burns....samsung doesn’t do that.....Your heart rate doesn't account for any of the exercises or steps. Maybe the fitbit I had before just spoiled me...or maybe it gives too many calories burned. I don't know, but something has got to give.

pablo s.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2021","I was really excited to finally purchase a smartwatch with sophisticated sensors so that I could track my fitness and sleep. But I'm extremely disappointed with this product. The step counter is erratic, and tracks all kinds of movements as steps. Sometimes before I get out of bed it tells me that I've got 160 steps in. Additionally, my main reason for purchasing a sophisticated smartwatch was to track my Alpine skiing fitness. The mobile app does have an Alpine ski mode for tracking, but it tracks everything as skiing, such as the ride up on the lift. It also never gives accurate speed information. The free ski tracker app on the Play store seems to give much more accurate information. On top of that, trying to use any of the fitness tracking on the watch kills my battery within 2 hours. Which makes it pretty much useless, because my phone will die while I'm on the slopes, and none of my fitness information gets saved. I'm actually privy to less data than ever because of this purchase, since I end up with a dead phone and all tracking ceases, and fitness information doesn't get automatically saved before my phone dies. On top of all that, only half of the fitness and health tracking is even accessible because I don't have a Samsung brand phone. I even went as far as to use workaround techniques to download Samsung's proprietary software to my phone, but even that doesn't work.

However, there are now three new apps required on my phone which have made it boggy (galaxy s21plus). I didn't go with the LTE because I didn't want to add a line with my carrier which already costs too much.
It tracks workouts and heart rate and sleep and stress and steps and will play Spotify which was a selling point for me. And works with Strava. All of these things are great but, if you have an incoming call and you answer on your phone, it can disconnect you. The worst part is that by 3pm, running all this stuff, even at the bare minimum, battery life was down to 23% and that's with conservative use. So then I had to take it off to charge, which stops counting my steps, and if I didn't charge it, then it would be dead by bedtime or sooner so how do you track your sleep if it's charging? I had to look up how to save battery life which requires you to turn off almost everything making it a basic watch. My old Timex with indigo light was better.

I waited 2 months to write this review, because I didn't want to jump the gun and give my initial impressions. So, let me say that I've already had to send in the watch to Samsung at the 31 day mark (well played Amazon, who said it was outside the 30 day window) because it would get the ""Samsung locked by Knox"" error and freeze. Samsung customer service was very nice, was very concerned about my issues, and did nothing other than update the software and send it right back. I've had it an additional 30 days, and let's just say that I've lowered my expectations for this watch, or I'd just chuck it off the nearest overpass.
Others have said that the battery life is terrible - it is. I can't use the sleep features because the battery is dead before I get to sleep. I can't use the Heart Rate Monitor, because it gets stuck at 117 bpm even while I'm binging Chicago PD - so there goes the health portions of the watch.

However, surprisingly, this watch is not as accurate as my Fitbit. And I miss all the medals and awards you can attain via Fitbit.
This watch has a very short battery life. After having a watch which has battery life for up to 6 days, I am unhappy with the battery life on this watch.

Cool if you want it, but it's completely unnecessary and doesn't really help with anything. Just tracks steps. Everything else is manually tracked and you don't need a watch for that
Texting is way too small with an unusable keyboard. Voice recording is handy though and I find myself using that more than anything.
Calling is actually pretty darn good. Clear sound and no one could ever tell I was using my watch vs phone.
It IS very fragile though. I only wear it to work and working out. Work is suit and tie stuff, and only use it for treadmill stuff while working out. Somehow, it chipped the screen. Bad. No clue how it happened. Never hit my arm on anything that I can recall, which leads me to believe it chipped with a relatively light hit.
Anyway, it's just a watch. Twice the price of a halfway decent g shock or normal dress watch. If you like gimmicks, this is for you. If you want functionality and durability, I'm betting no smart watch will make us happy. I'm gonna use this till it dies (because I paid so much for it), then going back to my g shock. Won't look nice, but works.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Duey,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2021","I am a very happy owner of both a Galaxy watch 3 and Galaxy watch. When I saw the price of the newest Samsung watch and saw that it was running Wear OS 3 I thought they just made a good thing better, I was wrong. I bought the Galaxy watch 4 44 mm, which means it doesn't have the physical rotating bezel. The bezel it does have is bad, I have to be a contortionist to make it move and when it does its hard to get it to stop on the app I want. Its not the only way to get to the apps so I won't bother using it any more. The rubber watchband is just plain bad, after wearing the watch for a short time I realized I didn't want to struggle with it every time I put the watch on so I ordered a replacement band. And Wear OS 3, where are all these great apps I keep reading about? Its really not a big deal, Tizen and Wear 3 both have all the apps I really want or use but really, saying the app store is so much bigger when it fact there's nothing special there is no selling point to me. So, I give it 2 stars because I'm hoping its as reliable as my old Samsung watches and zero stars for Wear OS 3 and the wristband.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Anthony Casparro,"Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2021","Being a big Samsung fan, I was happy to see a new watch released. This is my 4th Samsung smart watch and I am happy with the build quality of the watch. It definitely feels like an upgrade when compared to my previous Galaxy Active 2. The battery life however leaves much to be desired. I have most of the automatic health monitoring stuff off aside from taking my HR every 10 minutes when I'm resting. I do not use the always on display either.
We'll start with my morning. When I wake up the watch is usually at 60% or so (after being ~90% before bed). I put it on the charger as I'm getting ready for work which gives me another ~10%, so 70% and I'm off to work. As we speak, it is 5:00pm and the watch is at 34%, and will likely be under 10% by the time I get home and have a chance to charge it again. It has been like this since day one.
I received the watch 10 days ago, and Samsung has released 3 updates so far. The battery problem remains. Other than the battery the watch is great, especially the upgraded storage (when compared to my Galaxy Active2).
I'm not sure if I got a dud, if WearOS needs a bit more work, or if the watch just wasn't designed well. I will update if I find a resolution.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Kenneth Burton,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2021","This watch has one key feature that I bought it for, afib detection. However, it falls short of my other active Samsung watch in many ways. Battery life is far less and charging time is much higher. I've held on to it for a couple months now to see if any updates would improve battery life and they did to some degree. The watch face is less sensitive than my other Samsung watch, and sometimes won't respond at all. The sleep tracking fails on naps, which my other watch tracked much better. I had the research component of the blood pressure app on my other watch and Samsung has yet to get approval for it on this watch which I consider to be more important than afib detection. The blood oxygen levels record far lower than my Samsung S9 does or that I've had detected at the doctor's office so I think there's an issue there also. It may be that the operating system change on this watch is put Samsung behind on the support and development. Also the step detection does not seem to work nearly as well as my old watch. If everything on this new watch performed up to the levels of my old watch, including the new features, I'd be delighted but it hasn't happened despite multiple updates.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Other than that it's fine, but do not rely on it to track HR.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2022","This watch is very disappointing. Here is why in my opinion.
1. Short battery life. It has gotten even shorter with the most recent upgrade. The water lock feature no longer shuts the watch down while swimming and arm movement keeps it active all the time. Hence battery drain.
2. With a brief call, the watch overheats and shuts down. Huge battery drain if you leave the lte call feature active all the time.
3. Will not count steps if walking with hand resting on cart, walker, and even mowing the grass. Have to have the watch arm free and swinging to count a step.
4. If battery gets low and watch shuts down during active workout, all data is lost. The watch does not give you really detailed info about daily activities like fitbit. Companion programs are not very helpful and only give you day to day and not cumulative info.
I will not go on and on. The watch has a phone and that is the primary reason I purchased it. You can call when you are outside Bluetooth range of phone. Could be really handy in an emergency. Otherwise the watch is frustrating.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I did buy more comfortable bands from Etsy, but even that didn't help much. And I thought the battery life would be okay, but compared to the Fit, it was awful. And if it's going to track sleep, why would I want to charge it every night? I will say that it seemed to charge very fast.
It didn't seem to track my walking very well, at least automatically. It would start very late. I didn't care because I use an app on my phone for that.
I didn't learn much about the functionality, since I did return it. I decided to return it the day I had it charged it to 100%, then it did an update, and when I went to check the weather the phone was off. I tried to turn it on and discovered it was dead. Since it uses a proprietary charger and I was at work, I had to just wear a dead watch all day.

It loses service frequently and I wouldn't trust it as a stand alone phone device. It is waterproof and seems relatively durable, though sometimes it gets plugged up with salt from the ocean making it hard to hear you during phone calls. The health tracking features seem pretty good. It tends to be pretty buggy overall with most software being slow and/or simply shutting down frequently.

Being ashamed by themselves, it would offer you to change mode to battery saving.. but if you choose it, you would not enjoy the brightest screen on the market anymore, only after activation by hitting button..

I tap it a couple times a day to see the time, and I track my sleep (heart only, no snoring). That's it. And it can't make it through a single day. If I put it on fully charged at noon, I get a low battery warning around 4am. It's a beautiful watch and has a lot of cool features, but in order to use them I'd need to charge it 3 or 4 times a day.

The short moving gif clips make it look so simple but then there's nowhere to go with your further questions for how to achieve the results you want.
Second, I had four issues to consider when choosing a smartwatch. To pay this much money for a device, it needs to meet all 4 needs.
1. I need an ECG. I use a little modular unit but I'd like to have one with me all the time.
I cannot get the ECG on this watch to work at all yet, even once. I've tried it dozens of times in dozens of positions. No matter how still I sit, it tells me I was moving or that my result was unreadable.
2. I need detailed sleep tracking. How long I'm in each cycle is important for my fatigue problem.
But I can't tell if it's accurate or not. It has lots of data showing up in the morning, but there are sleep and wake patterns that don't jive with my memory of the night before.
3. I need unlimited reminders, that are silent when I finally fall asleep. So far, they are very reliable even when I'm asleep (waking me up) or on another setting they don't buzz at all, just show up quietly on the watch.
Either the reminders can't be subdued by sleep or DND, or I just need to learn how to use them correctly. So far I haven't found that info online. I get that my alarm still needs to go off, but my entire to do list doesn't need to start buzzing when I'm trying to sleep in.
4. I have a child-sized wrist. Please make a watch small enough to fit on a wider range of people. Is petite people's money not good enough for ya? As it turns out, the 'small' band on its tightest notch is not holding the watch flat on my wrist when I rotate my forearms. It lifts up on one corner or the other. Not to mention it looks ridiculous and out of scale for small people. I have already begun the process of trying to switch bands out, but so far the aftermarket ones are longer, not shorter. Even the stretchy ones. But more are coming for me to test.
If the watch functions turn out to be not working merely because it can't get tight enough, I will return the watch but change the review up to 4 because my wrist is not your fault. But if I get a successfully tight band but it turns out you just sold me some functions that don't actually work, I'll return it and lower the rating to 2.
But I hope I just figure out how to get it to work for me, so I can give it a full 5 stars.",3.0 out of 5 stars
ADB,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2023","I've been using Fitbit since 2015, but I wanted to upgrade from my band tracker (Charge 4) to a smartwatch. Disclaimer, I used this primarily as a fitness watch since I always have my phone on me. I completely turned off phone notifications as constant dinging from multiple sources was just going to annoy me. It's a very attractive device and the user interface is very intuitive, but I ended up returning this for several reasons.
1. Heart rate tracking- I didn't want to invest in a Pixel watch and the reviews on Fibtit's other watches consistently stated heart rate tracking to be off during exercise. I primarily use my device to track steps, gym and at home aerobics workouts so that was a concern for me. Well, this watch doesn't track HR during all exercise modes. I found that it worked for walking, running, and dancing but not pilates, yoga, elliptical, or step machine. The latter are my most common types of exercise it didn't work. As soon as I started the workout, heart rate data would disappear. The crazy thing is that as soon as I exited one of those workout modes and swiped to the heart rate screen, it was showing up just fine. The watch's software was updated and I tested on multiple days to no avail. Maybe my device was just defective, but the other reasons below kept me from exchanging.
2. Comfort- This felt a bit heavy compared to my previous device. I also switched wrists throughout the day due to my wrist sweating. The default band just fit on the last hole (my wrists measure 7.5 inches, for reference) whereas Fitbit offers large size bands that gave me plenty of room.
3. Syncing data to other apps- I'm a pretty active player of Pokemon Go. Part of the game is hatching pokemon eggs and the game calculates this by your walk distance. Steps must be synced through Google Fit. Despite the beta testing of Google Health Connect, it just would not pick up my steps from Samsung Health (although it did copy over workouts). I found a third party app that did the trick but it had an 8 day free trial and would have required a monthly subscription or upfront payment. Not a dealbreaker by itself but very inconvenient.
4. Battery life- Even with location and wifi turned off, I was down to 30% or so battery after 12 hours. I hated having to sync the watch nightly as it prevented me from ever using it to track my sleep unless I was going to set aside time to sync it after dinner and first thing in the morning.
5. Step tracking- I felt like my steps were being significantly undercounted. I have a pretty predictable fitness routine and I was getting 1-3k less steps than I was used to seeing, without any change to my routine.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Uncle Package,"Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2023","I love how Samsung's watches look on my wrist. They're not boxy and square like an Apple watch. So they blend in a bit more...not quite as well as perhaps a Withings smartwatch, but it blends in very well. I love how many things this watch can do. The biggest issue, however, is how glitchy it is and the fact that I believe this is Samsung's first watch that is NOT compatible with iPhones.
I bought this watch as an iPhone user, knowing that I would soon be switching back to a Samsung Galaxy and knowing that historically Samsung watches have always been compatible with iPhones, albeit with some limitations. Well that was until this model apparently...because this watch doesn't pair with iPhones.
So I held onto it for 6 months until I officially switched back to a Samsung phone. It sat safely in it's box powered off the whole time as I waited to buy my next Samsung phone. I've been using this watch for a whole 3 weeks now and I have had to reset the watch multiple times every week because it keeps glitching.
One day, Samsung Pay will choose not to work.
The next day, it will keep requiring me to type in my pin every 2 minutes because it doesn't recognize that it actually is indeed on my wrist or something.
I do miss having the rotating bezel that my previous Samsung smartwatch had. It just made it easier and quicker to move between menus, scroll through messages, etc.
Lastly, the battery life on this watch is every bit as horrible as my previous Samsung smartwatch was. You will get one day of use...maybe a day and a quarter if you're lucky...and that's with a black background turned on and the always-on display feature disable. Yikes.

Kevin Lowry,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2023","I waited two months to give the watch a fair trial. In the first week, I was in the kitchen making dinner and my wrist brushed the counter. With minimal pressure, the watch face cracked. It still worked so I moved on. Within a few weeks, I noticed the battery life shortening each day. I had the battery saver on so this was a big disappointment. I initially used the sleep tracking feature, but with the battery life compromised, I stopped using this and turned my watch off at night so I could get through a full day using features I really wanted, like step tracking. I found the GPS adequate and my manual count of steps was close to what the watch recorded. I liked pairing the watch with my Android phone and receiving texts and calls on my watch. However, even at max volume, the phone calls on my watch were barely audible. It's a basic design that's easy to set up and program IF you're comfortable with wearable technology and able to follow online procedures. There are only two buttons so it's not rocket science to use. Overall, I'm left with a meh impression. This was my first entry into wearables and because it was deeply discounted, I was using it mostly as a gauge to determine what wearable I'd purchase for the long haul.

NOSREME,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2022","I have had the watch 4 for 5 months and overall it is a good fitness tracker and sports watch but it has some significant short comings. It is a beautiful design even though I prefer the square or rectangular designs of the Fitbit. The display is clear and easy to see though the font could be a little larger to increase visibility especially when moving as in exercise. Navigating the menus on the watch face is easy and the screen is very responsive even with a glass screen protector in place. Swiping takes you easily across and a simple tap allows you to measure various things. Sleep tracking is good but I am not sure of the interpretation. I have been wearing this watch and a fitbit versa 3 to bed for 4 months and am yet to get both watches to agree as to the sleep stages. I get the impression-that the Fitbit better records REM sleep and the Galaxy Deep sleep but sometimes the parameters are reversed. Similarly in comparing the two watches for walking exercise, while the steps are similar the distances are different. I am further evaluating this parameter to see which is more accurate. The parameters for exercise recorded on the watch are very good. The wear OS installed on the phone gives very good reporting both of sleep and exercise data. The exercise data is particularly extensive and informative. The GPS works well. The O2 sat monitor 80% of the time it is triggered manually probably due to insensitivity , but it giges better readings for Oxygen levels during sleep. The graph showing sleep oxygen in the phone interpases is small and dingy and just give a crude idea of what time during the night your O2 levels fall below 90%. This can be improved. The body composition monitor is very good and though difficult to say if it is accurate it seems to follow the right trend over time. The major drawbacks. No matter what you turn off to save on battery power this watch has to be charged every day. A watch of this quality should have a better battery life.I charge at night before wearing to bed and have had it die in the middle of an exercise walk the following evening 18 hours later. I dont comment on the on screen rotating bezel as this is permanently turned off to save on the battery. Even with this we cant get 24 hrs.

Kayleigh Cyr,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2023","This is a beautiful watch. It works decently, but doesn't suit my needs. I chose this one because it syncs with Peloton and i was looking for a non-Apple option. I thought it synced with the bike, but it's just the app. It doesn't sync with the web browser. Since this is the main reason I bought it, it's a problem. That may be on me for not reading the description carefully. Besides that, I would be more happy if, when it did sync, it measured my HR every time. Even though the watch measures my HR passively, it often won't read it during my workouts and my Peloton workouts. The battery life is just okay if using this to track workouts. I have to take it off during the day to charge enough to get through the night for sleep tracking.
The HR measurements also seem unreliable at rest. Mine range from about 50, which is normal, to about 110, which isn't. The HR during activity seems more accurate, but since I don't usually measure it, I can't be sure.
It can't sync to Peloton's website, but you can connect the Bluetooth so you can get your computer audio from your phone, which is cool. It's pretty tinny. I ended up switching back to my laptop for my workouts.
Trying to text from it is annoying. But maybe that's just a learning curve.
This is a great watch if you're looking for basic tracking, albeit overpriced if that's all you need. If you're looking for an advanced option for training, I'd try something else.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Phil McKrakin,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2021","I have owned a lot of androidwear watches over the years. When I heard that Samsung was creating android watches, I got a bit excited because I feel their design and sleek interfaces would be the perfect pairing with android wear. I feel that many android wear watches that are built for sleekness are heavy, whereas the ones that are built for active lifestyles aren't particularly sleek. This watch accomplishes exactly that. It's sleek and light weight, perfect for an active lifestyle. It also looks nice when you're wearing it in everyday life. Probably the sharpest display I've seen on an androidwear yet. You can also add, remove, reorder complications and quick setting widgets, however you see fit. This allows the interface to become more of your desired experience.
Where it falls short are the same problems with almost every android watch I've had, except the most recent Tic Watch Pro. The Tic watch isn't the prettiest androidwear to have on your wrist, but the interface is completely smooth, without a hitch. The new Samsung watch android interface will experience stutters, and delays between pressing on the apps and the desired outcomes that have hindered the androidwear experience for years. Furthermore, the Samsung programs are mostly unusable without a Samsung phone, but will forcedly turn themselves on, even when you don't want them. I'll run with Google Fit GPS tracking, and the Samsung Fitness program will detect that I'm on a run and suddenly pop-up and track my workout without the accuracy of the GPS tracking. There is no way to turn it off, it will remain running on top of your google fit app until it has decided that you finished your workout. It seems very intrusive and unnecessarily redundant. Given the processor and RAM on this watch, I had some high hopes for a smooth operating experience that has almost entirely been elusive on this platform. This watch will not be the answer, but fares no worse than any watch that came before it.",3.0 out of 5 stars

N. Costanza,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2022","This is the second Samsung watch I've owned. I purchased an Amazfit watch in between. The battery life was incredible!! 3 to 4 days between charges and that was with regular heart, oxygen saturation and snore monitoring. I couldn't get the alarm and music features to sync with my phone, so I went back to a Samsung. Purchased the Samsung Galaxy 4, new, not refurbished. It's easy to use. All the features sync with my phone perfectly. However, it has the worst battery life of ANY smart watch I've ever used. Got the watch yesterday. Put a full charge on it. It was fully charged by about 8pm. It was at 5% charge by 2pm today. Absolutely awful!! I don't know if I got a bum battery, if the battery retention will improve over time, or if this is the norm for this model??? I read several reviews before purchasing and don't recall seeing many negatives about the battery. As of now, it sucks!!!...literally. I'm using all the same features that I used on the Amazfit watch and like I previously said, that watch could go 3 to 4 days without a charge. My first Samsung watch had a better battery than this 4. I had it for about 3 years and the reason I got rid of it was because the battery life was reduced to what I am getting out of this new one! Pretty pathetic!!!",3.0 out of 5 stars

Because the other big plus for me is this is also one of the first smart watches, other than Fits bits, that doesn't use nickel or cheap metals in the watches that I react to and have to send back. I'm highly allergic. And Fits bit can never get their Smart Watches to connect to my phone and keep giving me the run around and telling me to call here and there. But their batteries last FOREVER!

I bought it mainly to have easy access to reply to texts without pulling out my phone and as a fitness tracker.
It SUCKS as a fitness tracker. Mostly because the heart rate function is little more than a joke. It doesnt work half the time. Im having a heart attack about to pass out from running my heart out and the watch is tracking a cool 80bpm. Sir. Thats barely my resting heart rate. I dont need a machine to tell me that its WAY past 100bpm just by easy feel. Refresh. Nope. Wait a few minutes. Sometimes. Aaaand maybe we have a somewhat accurate heart rate again. Maybe. 115bpm after I've already started to cool off and Im back home watching a movie.
The battery life is fairly sad. It doesn't get actively used enough to justify needing to be charged everyday.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2023","I bought this watch as a Christmas gift for my Sister. She loves it. HOWEVER, I had to buy it twice. The first watch I returned because no matter what I did, it would fail to connect to my Sister’s phone (she has an LG Evo 6). I thought the watch was defective because of SO many failed attempts.
I ordered and received the second watch. I continued to fail as well. I thought there was no way I could’ve possibly received two defective watches in a row, so I decided to take it into work and see if my co-worker could get it to connect to his phone (he has a Samsung phone). He was able to successfully connect the watch to his phone. Since that was done I decided to run any updates on the watch. There was an update that successfully installed.
I then took the watch back home and was able to successfully connect to my Sister’s phone.
The issue is that a successful connection was only possible AFTER running the update. The update could ONLY be run after a successful connection. So if you have an LG phone and don’t happen to have access to a Samsung phone, you won’t be able to connect. I didn’t see any of this mentioned in my online research when trying to connect the first time.",3.0 out of 5 stars

7007,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2022","FYI - I purchased the watch used, and it came with NO CHARGER. I needed to order a charger separately. Not sure if new ones come with a charger, but I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't, considering my new Galaxy S21 came with no wall outlet, and only came with the cord.
When I bought this, it was 100% an impulsive purchase. Definitely didn't need a smart watch. It's okay. It works.... it's just not as useful as I thought it would be. I can only see this being useful if you're into working out and want to track your heart rate, steps, calories etc. Texting on the watch uses a T9 feature... I thought we left that version of texting in the mid 2000s... also, the wristband it comes with is a rubber material that can leave your wrist chafed and sweaty.
Other than that, the 2 best things the watch is useful for me is: I tend to leave my phone not by my side, so having the watch I don't miss phone calls; the step tracker helps with more accurate adventure syncing for Pokémon Go (downside is that there's no PoGo app for the watch, I thought there would be an app similar to the pokeball+ feature)
I would've returned the watch, but it's too much of a pain to mail back. No UPS store near me. So I'm just going to keep it until planned obsolescence makes the watch completely unusable. It's too expensive for the limited features the watch has.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Allie,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2022","I've worn smart watches for the past 7 years. This is my first Samsung watch. I haven't had any issues with the various other brands I've used, but this watch strap is causing a rash with oozing welts. I clean the strap on a regular basis and don't have especially sensitive skin, so I don't understand why this is happening. Since I've been wearing silicone bands for the last 7 years without any issues whatsoever, I suspect this band is not just silicone. The part that's causing problems is the very end of the strap that tucks under the buckle. I did contact Samsung through support, and they wanted me to send in my watch without any guarantee of how long it would take for me to get it back, nor a replacement to use while they have my watch in their possession. I declined, as I need a watch on a continuous basis. I'm disappointed in the quality of this watch and the poor customer service.
Oh, and I get 1.5 days of battery life, so I have to charge it daily. I know this is due to the settings I use, but my Fitbit with same settings went 3 days on one charge. Not what I expected from Samsung.

All solutions online say it's from being too tight, but that's definitely not been the case. I've been wearing it since I purchased it in June and at first it was fine, but here and there, I had some wrist pain similar to carpal tunnel that would dissipate after taking off the watch. The last week or so, the pain is more persistant. I've loosened it and worn it higher up on my arm, and neither helped. I just gave myself an hour's break from wearing it, and the moment i put it back on my wrist, before even closing the strap, the pain began radiating in my wrist again, all the way up to my elbow. It's getting really distracting, unconfortable, and worrisome to wear. My return window has already closed, otherwise I would be returning it.

I charged it to 100% and put it about an hour before falling asleep. When I woke up, the battery had drained 23%. Just over night! The battery life alone is going to cause me to return the watch, but coupled with how big it and how uncomfortable the band is, I'm having a hard time wearing it.

Then I turned the screen off so you had to hit the power button. That seemed to push the battery to a day and a bit more. But basically it had to be charged every day. Then the battery life went over a cliff, down to 12 hours. I don't know what the deal was. The best thing was the fitness tracker. I got some information, but it was the same info you can get with an app on your phone. Now I was sending the data to the phone. There were two health apps, which is confusing. Trying to add something to a list was goofy. There's a system where you draw the letters, but it barely works, even when it is pretty obvious. But it didn't know an l from a 1, that sort of thing. The little keyboard was impossible. The voice typing was hit and miss. Doesn't seem fully baked. You buy these things, you get a month of frustration, and then you return them.

I don't use any of the sports trackers or much of anything else but for those that do I'd think the battery would run out even faster.

The downsides:
Battery life is short, as expected. Charging a watch daily alongside my phone isn't the worst thing, but it would be nice if it could be stretched to weekly.
I lightly tapped my watch on the underside of my desk, and it cracked the screen. Replacement costs more than a new watch. Screen protectors are not sufficient, I would recommend a more heavy duty case - which takes away from the aesthetic that I chose this watch for originally.

I sent the watch back for repair. It came back with a little better battery life. But when I use it to track my run, the tracking would stop at 10 miles. Before 10 miles the tracking works fine. It will stops at 10 miles each every time. I don't know what they did. I called them again today to explain the problem. The rep on the phone did not seem to understand. There is no direct communication between me and the actual technical support. The rep does not understand the product at all, just a reception.

victoria baker,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2023","On low power settings, my old Samsung watch would last over a week. This one, on low power, will only last about 4 days. In full mode, everything tracking and ticking over, my old watch lasted 2 days before needing a recharge. This watch doesn't even make it to 20 hours before needing to sit on the charger.
Part of the problem is all of the advanced bells and whistles added to this. YEs, some people think they are necessary (ekg, hydration, oxygenation, etc,) but it takes a lot of time hunting down everything that runs in the background and either uninstalling it or shutting it off completely. Also, if you drive a vehicle with bad suspension (or in my case, a cement mixer) don't forget to turn off fall detection. otherwise you'll be calling for help every time you hilt a speed bump.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Marge Daly,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2023","Poor product description. Ad indicates you can call and receive calls, but Samsung support says this model canot receive incoming calls. It would help if Samsung tech people provided feedback to the Q&A questions. They never do so and in many cases customer feedback was conflicting. After several chats and calls to support I was unable to obtain the correct user manual. You have to double tap screen or start button to get apps such as phone, which often doesn't work. Instructions provided by their techs as well as in the Wear app indicate the phone app is either on the face or you slide down on the face to get apps, which may be the case on other Galaxy4 watches, but not this watch. The delays and failures to bring up the phone is unacceptable when primary use is for medical alerts. I gave up and returned two of these to Amazon.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Herb Moses,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2021","The watch does a lot of things well:
- Walk, swim and sleep tracking. I can't speak about other activity tracking since I use swim, walk, sleep and golf.
- Body composition, ECG, stress, heart rate. All these are measured when requested. There's no continual heart rate sensing.
- Someone has come up with a way to use Google Assistant with the watch. Bixby support is built in but does not meet expectations.
- Taking calls on my watch worked; however, I take calls on my hearing aids so I don't need that feature.
- Watch faces are OK. There are a lot of them and opportunities to buy more.
- Not a watch for golf. My minimum requirements are:
1)Automatic hole advance,
2)Distance to front/middle/back of green,
3)Sensing when I take a shot in order to count strokes,
4)All functions on my watch. I don't want to have to refer to my phone during a round.

To my surprise, the Watch4 and newer require you to use an app for setup that is exclusively on android phones, so they’ve gotten rid of a chunk of thier userbase! If you don’t have an android phone, you can’t set up this watch.

459849780,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2023","Look, by and large it's a great watch. The health tracking features are nice, although the step count (which is presumably based on stride) varies VASTLY from what Fitbit tracks (i'm talking at least one thousand steps per 5k, which probably makes sense since Fitbit's stride algorithm is propritary) and, as everyone says, the battery life is pretty horrible.
This watch goes above and beyond the Versa 2 in that you can set up fall alerts to go out to people, as well as ""personal safety"" alerts and you can see the images in texts, emails, etc. on your watch. They're not the easiest all the time, as the watchface is the size limit, but still, that's awesome, at least to someone coming from a Versa and being over the text notification just being ""image."" As someone not old enough to want to have a life alert thing, but living alone, that's nice. There are some other nice features as well, but I can't think of them right now.
On to the battery life: you can make your watch battery last 24 hours (maybe a smidge more) by having it on power saver for most of those 24 hours. Everything still works as a smart watch/fitness tracker should, you just have to push a side button or double tap the screen to turn on your display. It feels kind of lame to do that, but again, 24 or more hours without having to put it on the charger is nice, especially when without that, you're probably looking at 8 hours per charge, without changing any of the features that make your Samsung Galaxy 4 a smart watch and tracker.
As I implied, coming from a Versa 2, that was a little bit of a bitter pill.

bingham121,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2022","I like Samsung products in general. They usually look great and function well. I don't need a smartwatch, so I don't use it 24/7. But I think the Galaxy Watch 4 is a great piece of tech and it's so sleek and attractive. I'm a female w/small wrists but it doesn't look too bulky on me. I have a Galaxy S20 phone and it works nicely w/the watch. I love the ability to change watch bands, and the array of watch faces you can choose from, that you can also customize. Navigation on the watch works well and the display is large enough to see things. I like the digital bezel and have never accidently toggled it but I think the rotating bezel is cool too. The galaxy wearable app is straightforward and easy to use. Also syncs well w/Samsung health app for keeping track of health measurements. I used it to track my sleeping and the info was helpful. When smartphones can accurately track blood pressure I think that'll be my next purchase-I know some have this feature but the accuracy not there yet. It measures stress levels, ECG, and body composition. The watch allows you to receive/respond/answer phone calls, messages, emails. You have the option of transferring calls to/from phone. I was looking at pics someone texted me and they were very clear on the watch, so the display is pretty crisp. The cons for me-battery life-I get maybe 2 days max and I'm not a heavy user. If I use it all day then it definitely needs to be charged at night or first thing in the morning. It does charge up fairly quickly though. I can listen to music w/headphones through my phone and then control it using the watch. But I didn't see an easy way to download music to the watch itself. If you have a premium Spotify account you are able to download playlists but I don't have that type of account. Overall, I really like this watch-it's attractive, well-built, you get a lot of features/functionality for the price and works well w/Samsung Galaxy phones.

-It has all the basic features related to text/phone/call notifications, health/sleep/exercise monitoring, etc. as well as many, many advanced functionalities (e.g., ECG, speaker, optional app downloads from the google playstore, etc.). Love that I can use it to locate my phone via ringtone.
- You can use it to make phone calls when it's connected to your phone. I could hear others and they could hear me pretty clearly.
-You can actually type out and send text responses from it as well as respond with preset message options (though it is a little difficult as the keyboard is quite small) Still it's very convenient
-Battery life is decent. With my usage (looking at text/notifications throughout day, and only turning on screen when looking at watch) The charge lasts all day long.
My only slight criticism is it's a little on the clunky side and the edges are not as thin or rounded as I would like. It isn't in anyway a deal breaker for me, but did take a little time getting used to wearing it.
While you can buy cheaper smartwatches that look similar and have some of the same features they are often glitchy, with poor software design and app support. However, the Galaxy 4 watch Integrated beautifully with my phone, no glitches whatsoever, and the software design and application used to manage the watch content and settings is really quite good.
I would highly recommend this smartwatch over others (if you don't mind your watch being a tad bit on the large side).

The fact I have to charge it daily is not a plus but so far I have managed it ok. I also wanted it for sleep oxygen as I wear oxygen at night.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Brittany,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2022","So I had the very first version and while it was cool, it was limited as far as the fluidity between watch and phone. But that's not the problem here. I'm a geek/nerd not a doctor so I'm not tryin to sell anyone on the health features on the watch but from a geeks point of view, it's a cool lil doohikie to play with. Sleep tracker, body composition recorder I guess (very cool), blood oxygen level reader and a plethora of other geek features are in the mix for you to ooohhhh and aaaahhhh over as I did. There's an app to download in order to sync faces and your phone with the watch but the app isn't something that's used regularly unless your directly messing with the watch like changing faces or things like that. Speaking of such, you can personalize the faces. Even import your personal pics to be a face on the watch so that's cool. My only issue is the battery life. I'm a geek so I've got a lot goin on in my phone so I understand that its a pretty heavy battery drain. The same seems to be said for the watch. But like I said, the activity and connections that's I have goin on between phone and watch is why it drains so quickly so that's something to take into account. But if there aren't multiple apps connected and the ECG reader aren't active, the watch lasts for quite a while. Some 30+ hours. Texting on it can be a bit of a hassle but c'mon, your phone is right there. The option is just for quick yes, no, be right there kinda answers. Not carrying full convos. The feature to answer calls (if you have the Bluetooth edition) is smooth and very easy to use. Overall, no real problems and satisfaction definitely achieved on my end! Happy customer here.
Update: so cancel what I said previously about not really being able to text. An update was added and you can text and send emojis easier than imagined! Close to a complete device!",4.0 out of 5 stars

FundinFTW,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2022","After using this watch for a few months, the only purpose it serves is has a heart rate monitor and pedometer. A lot of the functionality that i had read about or even just assumed, simply is not there or is subpar. I had looked into various other functions before purchasing and had seen various used. One was it could be used to stream music or even control the music being played on the phone. While the functionality is there, there is a buffer that makes it more of a chore then a feature.
Another reason I had purchased this watch over other was that I read Pokemon Go could utilize it has an add-on accessory. That is not true. It simply enhances how the Adventure Sync calculates distance walked. Watch faces are another let down. You do have a lot of options for watch faces... at two or three bucks a pop. I often will forget to ""track"" workouts. It will automatically detect an increase in movement and heartrate and begin a workout but it is unreliable. It will often buzz at me when i get up to go on break from work or just going to the restroom.
The battery really just lasts the day, more or less. As far as ""sleep tracking"" is concerned, it just uses its built in mic to listen for movement or snoring and you have to leave it on through the night. One: I am not a fan of that and two: means you have to find time during the day to charge it. Speaking of which, it will charge in about an hour or so, which is nice.
As it sits right now, I use my watch for two things: telling the time (duh) and to check text/email notifications from my phone.

Paul Chadwick (Bonnaroo),"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2023","I got this watch as a Christmas present and immediately paired it with my Samsung S20 5G phone. The watch battery lasts all day, and I typically have 65-75% of battery charge left when I put it back on its charging pad at night. Note that this is my first smartwatch; I have experienced no major issues so far, and I'm reasonably satisfied with how it works. I haven't really taken advantage of all its features (e.g. I really don't need the dang thing to nag me about getting in my ""steps""), but I may utilize more of these in the future. The watch seems to maintain a Bluetooth connection with my phone even when they are in different rooms. In addition to the step ""nagging"", there are a few things I wish that it would do differently, including: to not repeatedly remind me of upcoming calendar events/appointments (I had to disable the calendar reminders entirely to stop those from occurring), to be able to set timers without using the phone (it does, however, allow me to dismiss those), and I think that it should support the capability to remotely zoom the phone camera (a feature that Samsung added in the latest update, but still doesn't work on this watch). Also, as to basic watch functionality, I really wish there was a watch face that would show you the seconds along with the date and the day of the week, as I have had that capability on every other watch I've owned for decades. For these reasons, I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Sue Y,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2022","This is a great watch. I use it every day. I love the sleep tracker and the app even has a improvement guide if your interested. I don’t think the guide is much help but I didn’t really finish it. I use the body composition most mornings after weighing myself and before I put anything into my body. I’m sure it’s not 100% accurate but it is one of the reasons I chose this watch.
I wish the Bluetooth would reach a bit farther. It would be nice to walk from one side of my house to the other without any issues. There is the Wi-Fi function to help with this but I don’t like to have it on constantly since it is a battery drainer.
The battery life is pretty good with the settings I have on. (Sleep tracker, heart monitor at 10 min, sound and vibration on, gps on) I don’t use the phone aspect much. You really have to have it close to your mouth for people to hear you and I feel I could just hold my phone or put it on speaker instead.
The steps need to be worked out better. I drive down the road and it will add steps. Even the the GPS drive map up. I shouldn’t hit a bump or uneven road in a newer car and still end up with steps being counted.
Overall, as a fitness/health app I think it’s pretty good but to use as a phone, not so much.",4.0 out of 5 stars

rkayakr,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2022","I'm coming off owning a series of Fitbits. My old charge 3 charging port is worn to the point that it is difficult to make a connection to charge it. The new Fitbits have a monthly subscription fee for the features that are included in the Charge 3. Rather than accept yet another death by a thousand small cuts I decided to try the Galaxy watch to pair with my Galaxy phone.
Love the features and easily read display. Two things are annoying. Battery life is terrible even with using battery saver features. The induction charge is great in theory but very slow. If you want to monitor sleep and waking activity it's hard to find the hour+ block of time needed. The watch also heats up when charging and and you have to let it cool before putting it on.
The other annoying feature is that it connects to the phone both for reporting measurements and calls and texts. I don't find calling on the watch at all useful. You have to be in Bluetooth rage to use it so might as well use the phone. The difficulty is that the phone connection prevents you from connecting to your car audio to make calls or play music and podcasts. You have to open the Wear app to disconnect the watch then open it again later to reconnect to again get updates in the Samsung Health app. I don't see a way to connect for updates alone. The Fitbit didn't have this problem.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I have tried it in multiple chargers and it does not recognize it. I contacted Samsung and the final answer was that I need to send it in to be repaired by them. I have had this watch for only 2 months and rather than replacing it they want to fix it. This is an undetermined amount of time that I will be without a watch. I find this option unacceptable. This is absolutely a malfunction of this failed watch, it should be replaced and not fixed.

P05TMAN,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2021","Don't get me wrong, this is a good watch at the price point. My sole purpose for getting this watch was for fitness tracking. The HR monitor is very good and I've found it is extremely close to a HR chest band.... but that's where accuracy for fitness ends. One of the key, promoted features of this watch was the Body Measurement capabilities. This is an absolute gimmick and is inaccurate by approx 15% when it comes to key metrics most fitness folks are interested in: body fat, body muscle, water, etc. This is a MASSIVE discrepancy and as someone who was getting started in their fitness journey it was incredibly discouraging thinking I was not losing any fat or gaining any muscle. Even if you are familiar with this kind of tracking, you'll be hard pressed to track any meaningful progress with this feature, but I wanted to illustrate this for beginners wanting something to help them track their progress.
As just a general smart watch, this one is good and has features one would expect. The low profile and sleek design is a plus as well. My problem is with the battery life. If you don't use any notifications at all or fitness monitoring, the battery can last 4 days or so.... but at that point, why even get a watch like this? With moderate notifications and workout tracking, I have to charge this watch about every 36hrs. This is pretty bad IMO. I guess for its price point, it could be deemed acceptable, but I was truly hoping for better.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The second day I boxed it up to return, then decided you have to be smarter than the watch lol! So I spent several hours learning how to use most features and I am loving it. It is a great addition to my workout. I certainly love the texting on my watch...but unless I have my ear buds in, everyone can hear my phone conversation, so I would rather use my phone for calls. I read all the reviews about battery life...so far my battery is lasting all day (with about 45% left) and it only takes a few minutes (maybe 20) to recharge to 100%. I would recommend this to anyone who works out alot or that has a very active lifestyle!
But I do have a couple of questions....
When you are starting a workout, what is the difference in treadmill running vs treadmill walking? Does it measure distance differently or cal burned differently??? 2nd...there are more than one way to start a workout...there is one tile that has all the different workouts on it, then there is a tile that has just walking....they are different...and then there is another one too...what is the difference and which one should I use to track my workouts on Google Fit?

I want to love this watch, bad, so much I ordered a refurbished one in the past that was not working with my wrist. In hopes it was due to an error when refurbished, I purchased a new, non-refurbished one.
With the band on the smallest setting it's still too big to pick up the settings from my skin. My wrists are abnormally small causing the face of the watch to look hideous. I went through the setup process to see what I was missing out on. I love the ability to make the face appear different for the style you are wearing as well as the occasion. The options available are similar to what my phone has, which is a bonus. One of my favorite perks the Samsung phone lacks is the day/date on the home screen near the time or battery percentage. I don't like having to unlock my phone to see the day and date.
Hopefully smartwatches will come out in smaller sizes in the future. For now I will have to stick with an old analog phone that looks appealing. For those with standard wrists, I wouldn't hesitate yet would choose the newer Samsung watch with the rotating bevel.",4.0 out of 5 stars
D. Kersey,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2022","I use it for cycling and running (jogging really). It provides some nice analyses. The running distance is sometimes high and sometimes low. The biking distance is always a little low, about 1/4 mile out of 15 total. I have no other way of checking my heart rate during exercise but it shoots up to as high as 165. Resting it's 55. It does a good job of measuring sleep. It reports awake time, REM, light sleep, and deep sleep along with a score and oxygen. When I get a high score, I also feel more rested.
I charge it when I shower, so once a day. Takes a long time, almost 2 hours. Would be nice if it charged quicker. My showers aren't that long.

The HR tracker is horrible during exercise, unless I actually open an exercise app to record my workout (I was running one time and it just froze on a HR of like 84 and refused to update unless I stood perfectly still - but that seemed better when I opened Strava to track my run... That said, I still had to use Strava to track a ""walk"" during my cool-down because otherwise once I stopped my run the watch couldn't figure out my HR again while I was walking).... The sleep tracker is also off, there are definitely times I'm awake and tossing in bed and it just goes on thinking I'm fast asleep, so if anything it seems to overestimate.

Sue deNym,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2022","I am a woman with big bones and often have trouble finding bracelets or anklets long enough to make it around my limbs. So I figured I could get away with this 44mm watch better than most women. I wanted the larger screen with 54 more pixels and the bigger battery. But alas, it was just too big. The watch itself spanned almost my whole wrist. That alone might not have deterred me, but the silicone band itself is excessively stiff where it adjoins the watch and won't even flex at the necessary angle to make it work. Even if I tightened it uncomfortably tight, the band stuck out away from my wrist a good 1/3 inch above and below the watch and I could just picture that getting caught on everything as I go about my day. Women with big wrists might be able to use this watch if they buy a more flexible band (the OEM silicone band is pretty boring anyway), but don't count on it.
Returned and bought the 40mm version, which fits much better but still had a bit of unnecessary bulge at the top and bottom due to the stiff band. The third party band I bought is much more flexible and attractive and sits very nicely on my wrist.

Heartful18,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2022","It is pretty well known that the battery isn't great. You have to charge this before you sleep, or it won't have the power to make it through the night. At some point you have to charge it in a 24 hour period. While this doesn't seem inconvenient on its face - it is kind of frustrating to HAVE to charge it every night before bed. 48 hour battery is almost a requirement for a watch like this, but the reduced price in my opinion make this a really good entry level watch, and you can at least try the features of higher end watches, when really the only big penalty is just the battery. Using knock off brands - you end up missing out on a bunch of the features. But everything worked great out of the box - and I have been satisfied with the purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Lemeicia R,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2023","Today is my first full use of the product and I'm perplexed about a few things. There were no detailed instructions to set this watch up. It only ells you to connect to the wearable app. However, the battery died within a few hours (after a full charge) because everything that came into the phone came into the watch; setting were defaulted automatically. Today I had to adjust accordingly so I can preserve the battery life. There was no choice for band size. My past experience with other companies I could select s/m/l. This site states one size fits all. However, the band is marked m/l. I'm in the 3rd notch from the bottom so I would have selected large if I had a choice from past experience of fitness bands/brands.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Yosh,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2022","The sleep and stress tracking is fairly accurate, I love that it's dust and water resistance is IP68, though I take it off if I'm washing my hands, taking a shower, or having to submerge my hands and arms (I hate the feeling of water under a watch band). The sleep tracking can also monitor your O2 levels and detect any kind of snoring. The only downsides to me is the short battery life. It will last maybe 30 hours if you don't check on notifications or use it a lot. If you're checking it regularly and have power saving on, it'll last between 20-24 hours so you gotta charge it everyday which doesn't take long (at most 2 hours) thankfully. It's a great watch though. I would recommend getting a screen protector for it. I know I'm really rough on anything I wear on my hands or wrists so I opted for one.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I would love a better battery life, even on battery saver it still requires at least one charge a day. Which int bad if you are constantly uses it but most days it is for notifications only. When I use it for music, I get like 3 hours tops before it is almost dead. Also I hate the limit it has from the phone. I can walk to my fridge and it disconnects from my phone.

Everything about what reviews have said about this watch is true. Great UI, sounds, screen, brightness, etc. I am not too familiar with Samsung Health, so I'll say it is ok.
This watch is easy to use, lightweight, sleek, and comfortable to wear with the band that comes in the box. I would have loved to give this five stars, butthe battery is terrible. On light usage (receiving notifications, playing Spotify, calls, texts, etc.) The battery will last just under 24 hours.
If I go snowboarding, I charge it while I'm driving to the resort. After maybe two and a half hours of snowboarding I'll charge it while I'm having luncheon. Then, hit back on to the slopes. I'll charge it on the way home too depending on how much battery is left.

I also needed something compatible with an iPhone and this watch’s summary said that it’s compatible with iPhone…
Spent a half hour with the app trying to get the watch paired with my phone only to find out that it is NOT compatible with iPhone.

It seems to be following the trend with Samsung devices in using terrible batteries. I am a die hard Samsung Galaxy fan, and I was a bit disappointed that I have had to charge this watch every day.

I have to charge it at least every other day, even with only periodic heart monitoring turned on instead of constant. My old Fitbit was cheaper and only needed to be charged every 4 days or so, I really can't see why the battery life is so poor for the price. That aside, this does everything I need it to. I like the health features and the wireless payment is useful if I ever forget my wallet, which I seem to tend to do. I use the reminders and weather on this a lot and was able to get a shopping list app for it which is helpful. It could afford to have some better fitness features, like for instance most fitness trackers offer a daily readiness score, but this one doesn't.

I purchased one of these two years ago then purchased another for my mom, we were concerned due to the fact that we were used to the thin line face of the fit pro but have found this is absolutely comfortable even more so! The battery life depends on how many messages you get how often and how you use it. I find that they are lasting about two days before needing to be charged. Charging is really fast so it's no problem at all.

Raghavendra Purohit,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2024","I was looking for a good smartwatch (which also has the features of a sports watch). My need was more for a smartwatch, one that has capabilities of receiving phone alerts/notifications and also of being able to make a call.
I decided to go in for this after reviewing all options available and I feel I made a good decision.
It fits my wrist well.
It looks quite stylish.
It can support installation of all major apps from is own Play Store.
It has a clear display.
Offers good controls.
And it's priced well for my needs.
Initially, I had almost decided to return after a few days of receiving but that was before I had fully understood it's features. I cancelled the return after opting for it, after checking out available options again and realising that this one, in this price range is my good buy.

J. Love,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2021","The only smartwatch I've ever had was a fitbit charge 2 so I don't really have anything to compare it to, so keep that in mind.
I'm a pretty sedentary and anxious human being so I got this to keep myself accountable for going on walks, meditating, and generally getting my act together. So far it's doing what I want it to.
I'm going to say the SpO2 sensor is super janky, and can't decide whether I'm perfectly healthy or on the verge of brain damage from hypoxia half the time. I have no symptoms, and my readings on a regular pulse oximeter and at the doctor are consistently normal so I'm not concerned about this.
I love that it auto detects my walks after a while because I always seem to forget to tell it I'm going. It tells me how long it took me to go a mile and how many steps I took and the breakdown after the walk is over is nice.
The ECG feature is reassuring as well, as I can share that information with my doctor easily with the interface given. I don't understand the body composition feature so I'll maybe update this review when I talk to my doctor about it in a couple months. I wouldn't use it if you have body dysmorphia though. You can take that tab off both the phone and the watch in the settings so you don't have to think about it if you're concerned.
You will need a samsung device to use ECG , SpO2, and a couple other things I can't recall at the moment, so that's a bit frustrating for those who don't have samsung everything.
Every feature is very enjoyable, snappy, and pretty much everything I wanted in a smartwatch. I'm pleased with it, am moving more, and when used in conjunction with my other stress control and fitness apps I'm starting to be able to see quantifiable results from all the effort I've been putting in. I can control my music with it, send texts, make calls. My life is easier, my exercise is more fun, and I'm getting to be a lot happier with its help.
The battery life sucks, but it's probably good to take it off for an hour or so a day anyway as the band is comfortable but can start to rub wrong.
All in all, I'm very satisfied with it. It suits my needs better than I expected. It no longer feels like a frivolous purchase. I didn't absolutely need it, but I'm very glad to have it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

It has a very easy to use app, and very easy to set up, takes no more than 5 minutes to set up, not including the time it takes for the watch itself update. It looks great and functions great. You can add nice wallpapers to the background and change how the watch face looks, with different colors and styles. It does a great job at counting steps and keeping track of exercises. Even if you don't tell the watch your about to exercise it will automatically detect that you are doing one and start tracking calories burned, steps taken, and more!
Even if you don't have a Samsung phone it still will work with any android phone for the most part. I no longer have a Samsung phone from when I bought this watch, but I still continue to the watch with my Google Pixel 7a.
The only thing about the watch that isn't the greatest is the battery life. This watch will last one day, that's all. Luckily it is easy to charge as it just uses a included wireless charger, so you won't have to plug the watch in.

joy,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2022","I've had this watch for almost a month now. I replaced a Gen 2 Fossil Smart Watch with WearOS. This watch is superior in every way. Batter life is excellent so far. I'm using a Motorola smartphone. The phone and watch work well together. Apps from Samsung function well.
I understand that the watch would have better functionality / features if paired to a Samsung phone. The ECG feature is not functional without an app installed from Samsung. The app cannot be installed from Google's Play Store. It can be side-load installed. I have not done this and do not plan to try.
Sleep tracking, Steps, Oxygen monitoring, as well as other workouts have all worked well.
The watch seems to have more than adequate memory and processor power. I have not had to reboot the watch yet. I've never drained the battery below about 40%. I generally put the watch on the charger after my evening walk and then put it back on before going to sleep. This allows it to start at 100% charge each night. It looks like it could probably make it through two full days on a charge.
Texts and phone calls can be accomplished on the watch, but I pull the phone out for these.
All in all, I feel this is an excellent smartwatch for anyone on an Android phone. There is no subscription required to use any of the features of the watch.
I did purchase a health synch app to get my sleep and workout data from Samsung to Google Fit. The app cost about $3 as a one-time purchase and has worked perfectly so far.

D. Drees,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2022","I bought this as a replacement for a FitBit that I had for 3 years. I was skeptical because of many of the reviews. However, the current Fitbit options all seem really bad, so I went for it.
Couldn't be happier that I did.
First to be clear about a few issues:
Yes, the battery tends to last about 2 days. I thought this would be more annoying than it has been. It comes with a nice wireless charger and charges quickly. I put it on the charger while sitting at my desk working, so it hasn't even been an issue. A full charge takes less than 2 hours.
Yes, to use the ECG, you need a Samsung phone and I have a Google Pixel 6 phone. However, this wasn't very important to me, so it hasn't bothered me.
No, the physical bezel is not touch-sensitive. You can rotate your finger on the screen to move through items as if there was a touch bezel, but technically you're still touching the screen itself. This doesn't bother me in the least, but reviews here seem to be concerned and confused about it.
Those are really the only two things I would criticize it for. I love how it looks, feels, and functions. It does way more than my Fitbit did and does it well. I was okay with my Fitbit for years, but this is a substantial improvement for the same cost.
It functions great with my Google phone. I use a 3rd party app to push data from Samsung Health into Google Fit, if that matters to you. I do like the Samsung Health app, but I also want the data in Google Fit personally.

Discerning Buyer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2022","I got the Watch 4 LTE version (not for any specific carrier) and it was just as I expected after doing much research on upgrading from my Samsung Active 2. Love the watch and all the new features that they've added!!!
The reviews on the battery life issues are all spot on. Battery life stinks if you turn everything on - exactly what I did to figure out what features I wanted to use. The watch never lasted more than 6 or 8 hours before needing a recharge. HOWEVER, once I tuned it to how I wanted to use it, the problem went away and I now enjoy a couple of full days before needing to recharge.
WARNING!!! I bought this watch to put on my Verizon plan. I tried online to swap it in and failed (website told me to call tech support). Brought it into a Verizon store and they failed to get it on my account (and told me to either call tech support or by the watch from them at $100 more). So, called Verizon tech support and they said to return it and get the Verizon specific watch (there's no such thing!!). Finally went to a Samsung Experience store where the manager explained what the Verizon problem was and how to tell them to fix it. Based on the Samsung manager's advice, I opened a tech ticket and asked Verizon to manually add the watch's IEMI number to their database. And... finally it worked on the Verizon network. Verizon needs to get their act together. Very frustrating experience. But this is a Verizon issue, not a Samsung watch issue.",5.0 out of 5 stars

It's fantastic! It functions perfectly as it's supposed to. I had read so much negative about the battery life but unless I'm using it to play music straight from it or on a call all day with my ear buds the watch lasts all day and all night while continuing to monitor my health and sleep.

It's be a great tool along side my new health goals. I'm getting older so I can use all the help I can get staying healthy!

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2022","First, I bought the Bluetooth edition of this watch and tried everything to get it to work with my phone but it would not connect. I have a brand new Samsung S21 and the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 40 mm Bluetooth would not recognize the phone or vice versa.
Articles abound on the internet to fix this issue - wipe Bluetooth settings, reset or factory reset watch, try older versions of the Galaxy Wearables app. None of these worked, except factory resetting my phone, which worked for about 6 days before failing again. The watch stopped staying connected and stopped detecting sleep and health indicators. The battery also died extremely quickly.
I took a chance and bought the 44 mm LTE edition of the watch because I loved the feature set of the previous one so much. It paired immediately with my phone, and has stayed connected since. The LTE is making the difference. It costs $5 more on my plan to add the watch, but it's worth it. I have more features enabled on this 44 mm edition and it stays charged through the day without the need for recharge.
I also bought a Fitbit Charge prior to both of these. It would not reliably detect sleep or other health indicators. Fitbit recommended wearing it on the inside of the wrist or not telling it you're going to sleep so it will auto detect what you're doing. This only worked some of the time.

Mainly it was heavy and bulky looking with rhinestones around the band so I felt weird wearing it as an every day item. I saw this watch and I am a fan of samsung products so I figured I'd give it a try... I am in love with it! It is light weight and sleek looking. It syncs beautifully with my phone and the functionality of the apps work so well. I love that it links up to the samsung health app and give me accurate readings. I was also so impressed that you can customize the watch face with the different components that are important to you. I read the poor reviews prior to purchasing so I was a little nervous about it but I have not experienced the problems the poor reviews are claiming. In my experience the battery life is more than what I need. I wear the watch for about 13 hours a day and I am averaging about 60% battery life when I go to charge it at night. I do not use the watch to stream music or to make phone calls on, which I am sure would drain the battery quite a bit if those functions are used frequently.

Brian W.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2021","I love this watch! I have the 44mm. I also had the 40mm for awhile until I switched to the bigger model. The battery life is better on the 44mm and the screen is better but only because it's bigger. That's the only two differences between the two. The Watch 4 is fast and good looking. Speaker on it is great for a watch. I mean everything works awesome. There really is nothing I dislike about this watch. Probably the best smart watch I've ever owned. I highly recommend this watch to any Android user. Do note that the ECG and Blood pressure monitor will only work if you have a Samsung phone. The Blood pressure monitor only works in certain countries so depending on where you live if you don't have a Samsung phone the only thing you're really missing out on is the ECG feature. Calls sound great on the watch. Messages on the watch work perfect with Google Messages and GBoard installed. Still no Google Assistant at this time so only the mostly useless Bixby is available. The screen is plenty bright for use in bright sun. I'll say it again; this is THE ANDROID WATCH TO BUY! You won't be disappointed. One more thing, battery life. The battery will last you through the day no problem on both models, smaller and bigger but not much more than a day. Maybe 2 days without AOD on. And the new Wear OS is great. Also, battery life will probably seem bad the first day you use it but give it a few days and somehow some way the battery life improves quite a bit.

I have been researching Smart watches, for a few weeks, looking for extra features like heart monitoring, sleep, and the basics like steps, etc. I use a Kids GARMIN, so you know, I usually keep things basic, but functional. Garmin is what all the runners recommend. But, Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 kept popping up as having what I needed, with some nice extras, like text on the watch! Then, I needed to upgrade my phone, so the Samsung camera quality and price point brought me to Galaxy S22. Which naturally led to an easy decision to get the watch as well, for smooth compatibility. It's nicer than expected quality. The Galaxy Watch 4 (40 mm) is just the right size, as I have a smaller wrist, and the 44 mm would be too big! The charger sits flat, and magnetic connection to the watch back is crisp. It arrived about 45% charge. I also spent $ on the Samsung charger plug, so the USB plug 15w, was a perfect match. The phone with use the c connection, at 35w. Samsung really is an upgrade, bit I was expecting less, and received more, when it comes to the watch!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Natasha Hernandez-Vazquez,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2022","Got an amazing deal (almost free) when I bought it along with a new Samsung phone. Took a little bit of time to get used to having something on my wrist for most of the day but it's very convenient to use and has a lot of cool features. This is my first ever smart watch and I'd say it's relatively user friendly. It automatically tracks movement and heart rare which encourages me to workout more often. Being able to use it to find my phone and answer texts/calls is great. I accidentally hit my arm on a daily basis and the watch face is still scratch free!
Minor things: if you answer a text on your phone while the watch is active it will consider it a new message on the watch and notify you, the constant dinging can get a bit annoying lol. The band it comes with bothers my skin a bit (something to consider for those with sensitive skin). The charger chord is a bit short so I'm constantly dropping it BUT it's extremely durable. With nothing disabled, the watch lasts about a day (from 8am one day to 8am the next, the remaining battery life will be about 4%, as a watch newbie idk what the norm is but it works for me). Apps that can be synced between watch and phone are limited.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Dom M,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2022","I upgraded to this watch from a Ticwatch E3. The Ticwatch was great and did everything I needed it to but it still hasn't been updated to WearOS 3 and doesn't integrate as well to the Samsung ecosystem. Although I still recommend the Ticwatch for non Samsung Android users, the Galaxy Watch 4 is a significant improvement over other watches.
The screen is bright and clear, but I do wish it was a bit bigger since there are decent sized bezels. All of the usual functions work without any difficulty. There's never any real lag or stuttering while navigating the watch. The battery life could be better but I have seen significant improvements over time as its learned my usage patterns. I love how it automatically begins tracking work outs when I start one from the Samsung Health app on my phone or tablet. Responding to texts or even taking a phone call on the watch is very convenient when you're busy and can't pull your phone out. It also can control my Galaxy Buds Pro which makes the whole experience seamless.
Overall if you're looking for a smart watch on the Android side of things that can compete with an Apple Watch, this is it. If you already own a Samsung phone then you won't have a huge learning curve as it runs a watch version of One UI.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Kandi Middleton,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2023","What I like is this watch connects to my Samsung Galaxy S22 phone without issues. Depending on how many apps you have running on this watch determines your battery life the same way in how your cell phones work. I found the accuracy of some features can be off as it depends where the watch sits on your wrist and how tight you make it. I love that I can receive messages and phone call notifications. I have been able to respond to text messages through my watch at no extra charge from my cell phone provider but unsure about calls. I love you can personalize your watch with your own photos or add through the apps offered. My battery usually last 2 days before I need to charge but that's because I run my music through my watch a lot. It has a lot of features you can add and change. This was a great buy and I loved that I got it as promised within the time frame quoted, and it was packaged with care. Definitely would buy this product again through this seller.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Ben,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2022","This thing did more than I expected it to do. I can see time, of coarse! But weather, maps and health data.
I ave a Samsung S21 Ultra and it pairs with this phone beautifully! It tracks steps, heart rate, sleep and a lot of other things. Not only that but the watch and the Samsung Health app share information with each other.
Example: I leave my watch at home when I go to work. When I return and put my watch back on the phone will send the watch how many steps I had at work.
Im very impressed at how advanced this tech is. The battery life would be my only real complaint, but that's with everything, right?
Other Notes:
I noticed when I allow the phone to automatically record stress levels it severely reduces battery life.
Tip: If you turn off ""raise wrist to wake"" (especially if you're at work or working out) It can save a lot of battery.
Music doesn't sound very good on the watch... I mean, it's a watch. I can't count this against it; just worth mentioning.
I think the sleep recording is a little off but I have nothing to compare it to. It does seem to be consistent, which is good. So, if the software is updated it should work really well.
Honestly, this thing is great. Really is more than anyone needs for a watch! I feel truly spoiled!",5.0 out of 5 stars
