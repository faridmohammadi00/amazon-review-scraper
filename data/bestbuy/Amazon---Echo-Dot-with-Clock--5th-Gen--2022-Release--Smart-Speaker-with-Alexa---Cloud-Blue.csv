Electronicguy53,"3 weeks ago | Aug 11, 2024 5:33 PM",This Echo Dot with clock display is a nice smart speaker.  I purchased it to replace an Insignia Google smart speaker with clock due to a lack of continued support.  It would no longer set an alarm.  I am very pleased with this Echo Dot.  It has good sound quality and I am able again to use my smart speaker to set alarms.  It controls my entire home’s smart devices.  The only thing I don’t like is that I can’t go to sleep with rain sounds in a continuous loop without paying a monthly fee for it.  I kept my old Google speaker because it plays sleep sounds for free.  I also like the look and size of this Echo Dot.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars

KenO,"2 months ago | Jul 7, 2024 2:10 AM","Not sure what it is with this particular model,  but both of the ones I bought constantly lock up.  At least twice per day, and need to have the power cycled before they'll become active.   By lock up, I mean they do not respond to voice commands, and the only buttons that work on them are volume up/down.  Amazon's website will still show them online, and will restart them but the restart in this case takes between 5 to 10 minutes. (Normal power cycle restart takes about a minute.)  They both always show ""low connection"", thought they should have some of the best connectivity in the house.  I have reset both multiple times to no effect.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

Converter,"7 months ago | Jan 28, 2024 8:24 AM","I recently got the Amazon Echo Dot, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer for me. Even though I'm not very tech-savvy, I found it really easy to set up, and its compact design fits perfectly in my home without being obtrusive. The voice recognition is amazing – it can hear me from anywhere in the room, even with background noise.

What I love most is how it's made my home life easier. I can control my thermostat, lights, and even lock my doors, all just by talking to the Echo Dot. Plus, I can use it to play music, get news updates, and check the weather. It's like having a personal assistant right in my home. I'm also impressed by how it keeps getting better with new features and skills. All in all, the Amazon Echo Dot has really improved my daily routine and made me feel more in control of my home. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone, even those who, like me, aren't tech whizzes.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Disappointed,"8 months ago | Dec 29, 2023 3:52 PM","I recently purchased the Echo Dot with Clock (5th Gen, 2022) in Glacier White, and I'm thoroughly impressed with its performance. The device is incredibly sensitive to sound, picking up voice commands even from a distance. Its responsiveness is remarkable, quickly executing commands without any lag.

Setting up the Echo Dot was a breeze. The intuitive design made it easy for me to integrate it into my smart home setup. What's particularly impressive is how it serves as a central hub for all my wireless-enabled devices. With just this one Echo Dot, I can effortlessly control various gadgets throughout my house, which is a significant convenience.

In summary, the Echo Dot with Clock is an excellent addition to any smart home, providing fast responses, easy setup, and seamless control over a wide range of devices. Highly recommended for anyone looking to enhance their smart home experience!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Until last Xmas, 2022 my mother in law, who’s 78 years old told me about 5th generation of Echo Dot LOLOL. She said to just get it and follow easy instructions. She’s guaranteed I’ll love it. So I did and it was the best present for myself EVER! It’s reasonable price (on sale) and it’s easy to follow through steps for light and link to my Sony smart TV LOLOL. Well after a year went by (so fast) I have these in every bed room and each floor (3 floors) have them for lights and TVs as my main purpose! If you’ve not had this in your house yet maybe try Echo Dot 5th gen first before moving up to other model/version. I bought mine from Bestbuy (said to myself if I couldn’t make it work I can return. However, I wasn’t planned to let my in law knows that I couldnt figure it out and had to return LOLOL).

MikeyLikesIt,"10 months ago | Oct 27, 2023 7:35 PM","I've been wanting a clock that I can see at night, and this turns out to be perfect. First of all, it's smaller than I thought it would be, which is a good thing.  The clock automatically adjusts to the lighting in the room, so it's easy to see in the daytime and not overly bright at night.  As a huge added bonus, it works as an eero Mesh Wi-Fi 6 extender. Using this as an extender, I am able to move one that I had in that room to another location to improve our wifi coverage. The cost of an eero extender alone costs more than the Echo Dot with clock. Last but not least, it's an Echo Dot smart speaker, so I can ask Alexa to set alarms, tell me the weather, give me sports scores, play music, etc. For such a small device, the sound is excellent and it even displays the artist and the name of the song using the same LEDs that the clock in scrolling text. With all those features, what's not to like. Overall, I just love my new Echo Dot and everything about it. Highly recommended!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

vagred,"1 year ago | Jun 8, 2023 12:09 PM","We like the clock function built in the smart speaker. We also have a google nest audio, on the ""smart"" level, google seems to be able to do more in general for what we need. It recognize multiple languages while Echo speaks English only, but the downside is that we cannot set up Amazon subscriptions with google, so we got three months of Amazon music for free with this purchase, but couldn't listen to any Amazon music with it. But the Echo is a great tool, if your subscriptions are with Amazon. There is one major downside, the Echo app doesn't work at all, it freezes most of the time. So it's a great device, just depends on personal needs.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
