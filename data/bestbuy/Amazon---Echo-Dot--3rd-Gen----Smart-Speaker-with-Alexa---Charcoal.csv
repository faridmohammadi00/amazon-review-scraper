AmyL,"2 weeks ago | Aug 21, 2024 6:03 PM","After using it for some time, I’m really impressed with its performance, sound quality, and smart capabilities.

Sound Quality:
The sound quality of the 3rd Gen Echo Dot is noticeably better than its predecessors. Despite its compact size, it delivers enough volume to fill a medium-sized room. The bass is fuller, and the overall sound is more balanced, making it a pleasure to listen to music, podcasts, or even conduct conference calls.

Alexa’s Smart Features:
Alexa's voice recognition is remarkably accurate, easily responding to a wide range of commands. Whether you’re controlling smart home devices, setting reminders, checking the weather, or playing music, Alexa responds quickly. It also integrates well with numerous third-party apps, making it a versatile tool in daily life. The only minor issue is that it sometimes struggles with background noise or certain accents, but this is a rare occurrence.

Design & Aesthetics:
The Echo Dot has a sleek, minimalist design that fits well in any room. The Charcoal color is particularly stylish and blends seamlessly with most home décor. Its small footprint means it can easily be placed on a nightstand, desk, or bookshelf without taking up much space.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

RobinsonU,"2 months ago | Jul 6, 2024 10:23 AM","Longer Review;

After dragging my heels for over a year, I finally bought our first Echo (2nd Generation) back in August. I loved it so much that I got us 2 more for other areas in the house. Being able to group them and play the same music or audio throughout the house is a novelty that won't grow old for me. I've only wished that they had a little more full sound, especially at higher volume. I'd considered the last Echo Plus, but the average of reviews I read didn't make it appear to perform significantly better than our already great 2nd Generation Echos.

When I saw this new Echo Plus listed, I pre-ordered it to ""replace"" the Heather Grey Echo in our kitchen and move that one to our bedroom. We tend to have music playing in the kitchen more than any other room, and I wanted slightly better sound than the regular Echo in there. I'm honestly glad we took a chance on this device without any reviews to go by.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
