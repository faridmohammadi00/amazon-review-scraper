It does it instantly and never fails. No ads, no bloatware, just a clean user interface with outstanding picture and audio quality. Of course whatever user is signed in will have access to their Music, Photos, Podcasts, Etc…. If you want to just create a generic user so your personal information is not available to whoever watches the tv, you can do that too. And, one of the best features in my opinion, if you have more then one Apple TV connected and signed in with the same user it will give you the option to keep the Home Screen identical on all those Apple TV’s. So if you change the layout, add an app or delete an app in makes those changes to the home screen on all of them.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

DavidT,"3 weeks ago | Aug 17, 2024 12:26 PM","First off I am coming from an AMAZON FIRESTICK which works pretty good but gets very laggy  and needs unplugged and rebooted 2-3 times a week which gets annoying. The APPLE TV  runs very smoothly and everything is pretty snappy in operation so overall it is better in that regard. We are an Apple household so all our devices sync up with it as well so the perks of being able to sync your Apple EarPods to listen to a movie and using your IPhones text pad to type in searches is nice.  Although it doesn’t require constant rebooting like the FIRESTICK it has locked up twice in two months and needed rebooted to unfreeze it. 
     ISSUES … When I turn on MATCH DYNAMIC RANGE it causes older movies or shows that have been remastered in HDR  such as original STAR TREK  series on PARAMOUNT to play in original SDR instead of HDR. It does the same to original STAR WARS movies. I have to turn MATCH DYNAMIC RANGE off for them to play in HDR and looks a lot better. 
     The second biggest issue is that when I use my APPLE TV on my LG C3 OLED the picture is dimmer than when I use my FIRESTICK when playing the same movie. I switched both devices to my SAMSUNG  S90C OLED and compared and again the picture is dimmer when using the Apple TV vs using the FIRESTICK when watching the same content and there is no way to turn up the brightness’s on either tv it just makes the movie much dimmer in appearance.  I’m not sure if there is something wrong with my Apple TV I or not  because it doesn’t make sense for it to do that. 
     Yesterday my Apple Remote stopped controlling the television volume and stopped turning the television on / off with the Apple Remote but all I had to do was reset the Apple Remote to get it operating again. The way you do that is you hold down the TV symbol and negative volume button down at the same time for a few seconds until the light blinks on the Apple box. Once I reset the remote it has worked fine ever since. 
   Overall I like the APPLE TV for it not needing constant reboots and staying smooth and quick to operate but I have yet to resolve the issues I’m having and for as expensive as it is compared to the FIRESTICK I shouldn’t be having any issues at all. I will probably keep it if I can figure out how to resolve the issues I’m having.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

Not sure if it was the unit itself or bloated software from Netflix and other vendors (Prime, etc.) so I thought should try the gen 3 Apple TV product.  It is amazing. The extra ram “pops” the selection up in the blink of an eye.   I have no reservations recommending this product to anyone seeing the same kind of lagging behavior on their older Apple TV unit. Best Buy had the product in stock and had it waiting for me at the front desk checkout.

JDScott,"1 month ago | Jul 26, 2024 6:17 PM","After years of using Amazon streaming devices, I decided to replace one of on my 4K Max Firesticks with a 4K 128GB Apple TV unit. Installation was simple.  I ended up zip tying the unit to the back of the TV because I didn't want to fool around trying to snake another HDMI cable through the wall.  Halfway through the mounting, it dawned on me that placing it behind the TV might interfere with reception, however, it is working great with no lag, The Apple ecosystem is definitely a step up from the Amazon operating system.  It's a much cleaner, snappier and an overall nicer looking platform. As it should be based on the extra cost. My biggest complaint is the remote.  It looks stunning, and when you hold it, you know you are holding quality product.  But using it at least for me is frustrating as #$@@, It's a little on the small size, the toggle wheel is herkie jerky and for me difficult to select images on the screen often taking three of four tries to make my selection.  The power button is very small and my thumb ends hitting the top of the toggle pad as well as the power button simultaneously canceling out the action.  The microphone button is on the right side and unfortunately, no fault to Apple I'm, left-handed. This is not a major problem just a little awkward at times.

Abby,"1 month ago | Jul 12, 2024 10:20 AM","Okay I was shocked how much we have loved this. The smart TV we had kept telling us we were running out of room for apps and it was such a pain to use. I love being able to have everything on the Apple TV now. Plus you can give it access to all your apps and be able to search for a show across them all with Siri. Love that! Also love that you can use your phone as a keyboard. We’ve had issues getting the Apple TV to recognize its on the same network as our phones, so never gotten the screen mirroring to work though. 

Two quirks we have had to work out: 1) randomly the volume button will stop controlling the TV even though the remote still works otherwise. There’s an IR reset available if you long hold the TV button and the down volume button. Just FYI because we found that quite frustrating. 

2) after a power outage this thing would brick. Would try everything to get it to turn back on. We finally figured out that we had it in one of those surge protectors that turns off the energy when nothing is being used. The problem is that when the Apple TV lost power, it lost connection with the remote. The remote couldn’t find the Apple TV after turning off because it stayed off. The surge protector thought it was off so allowed no power, therefore the remote won’t turn it on. There’s no button to manually turn the Apple TV on to alert true surge protector it’s being used. Once we moved the plug to one of the “always on” spots this was never again an issue. Just a weird quirk with there being no power button.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

I currently have a 43” Insignia 4k FireTV and it doesn’t have Airplay out capabilities. It does have Bluetooth out, but if I connect the Move(s) via Bluetooth it removes the stereo pair. I realized that Airplay would be the only way. So the simple and most convenient fix would be to purchase another AppleTV and beam the sound output to AirPlay and in turn to my stereo paired speakers.

LolaS,"2 months ago | Jul 6, 2024 11:28 AM","I will never use an iPhone for my personal phone. But, Apple products in other categories just can't be beat. 
I've been using an xbox on one tv, and the smart functions on my bedroom tv. The tv in my bedroom is a Samsung and it's a beautiful picture, but the apps are always needing me to re-sign in. It's become too annoying. So, why not try Apple TV! I actually love watching Apple TV shows & movies. 
For what it offers, I believe the price is great. It's small enough to hide. I've added all the apps I normally use for viewing movies and series. For the short time I've had it, I could absolutely get another to replace the xbox. 
I love that the remote isn't obnoxious. The touch functions on it are a plus. I love that it immediately recognizes my homepod mini AND that I can send the audio to the homepod for better listening. I'm actually awaiting another homepod mine to arrive today, so I can set up stereo sound.

The setup process was a breeze; I simply paired it with my devices, and I was ready to go. The touch-sensitive surface is responsive and intuitive, allowing me to navigate through menus, adjust volume, and play/pause with precision.

One of the standout features is its range. I can comfortably control my Apple TV from across the room, eliminating the need to constantly reposition myself for better connectivity. Plus, its long-lasting battery life ensures uninterrupted usage for extended periods.

The minimalist design is another plus. It's small, lightweight, and fits comfortably in my hand. Plus, it's so stylish that I don't mind leaving it out on my coffee table for easy access.

Overall, the Apple Remote has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance, design, and convenience. If you're looking to streamline your home entertainment setup and enhance your Apple experience, I highly recommend adding the Apple Remote to your arsenal. It's a game-changer!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Electrosoft,"4 months ago | May 4, 2024 12:37 PM","We added a newer TV to our bedroom so I moved the 2nd generation AppleTV 4k in there and picked up a 3rd generation for our living room. We went with the ethernet model since our place is hardwired everywhere.

Much smaller and the remote now uses USB-C versus lightning port which is nice.

Setup is a breeze once you already have a pre-existing AppleTV setup. It will ask if you want to use the same settings/apps and it will even configure it to look exactly the same and stay in sync at all times.

Newer model is definitely a bit faster in certain playback and a touch snappier on the interface.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

RedBeardRmrz,"4 months ago | May 3, 2024 12:49 PM","This little black box solved our daily evening dilemma of trying to get our “smart” TV to play shows.  After finally getting kids to bed, all we wanted to do was try and catch a quick grownup show, but we would end up spending between 10-15min just trying to get a show started on any given streaming platform on our Sony Bravia 4k TV.  We’d often have to restart the TV just to get it to work, and we would end up just giving up sometimes because it was so buggy.

I finally gave in and picked up the Apple TV, and I don’t know why I didn’t do it sooner!  I know that sounds cheesy, but seriously, it completely changed our TV experience.  The UI is so fast and smooth; shows start up immediately now.  Also, you can calibrate the color, sound, frame rates, etc… through the Apple TV.  Now our TV looks better than it ever did with calibrated colors, and we have our sound bar and TV all running on the Apple TV remote.  This thing just works.

If you have “smart” TV that sucks, I would highly recommend picking up an Apple TV.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Rewinding on youtube isn't done with wheel but rather you have to click on the youtube buttons, very unintuitive.

We’ve slowly begun to add the many other features particularly the control of WiFi enabled household equipment and appliances.  If in doubt about the purchase, first check out the Apple TV website to get an idea of all the features.  At the very minimum, it’s cheaper than rent a cable box.  P.S.  since I’m a little weak on current technology, I had Geek Squad do the programming.  They did an outstanding job of ensuring that the Apple TV working with the new LG 77” TV remembers all of the email addresses and passwords for each of the streaming services.

The downsides I experienced is the Dolby Atmos settings through hdmi doesn't always work. It took playing with it to make it work and not be muted.  If it mutes, you will need to select 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Apple really needs to fix the Audio with Dolby Atmos. The second minor thing is going between videos on YouTube, the screen turns black says dolby vision and shows the video...why? It is kinda jarring Apple. Turn off Dolby Vision and it doesn't happen.

The interface is as sleek and intuitive as you’d expect from Apple, making navigation a breeze—even for my technophobic relatives. The picture and sound quality are top-notch, transforming my living room into a mini-cinema that rivals the local theater.

AirPlay is a standout feature, seamlessly mirroring content from my other Apple devices. It’s perfect for impromptu photo slideshows or streaming a presentation in crystal clear definition.

But what truly sets the Apple TV 128GB apart is its integration within the Apple ecosystem. The synchronization with iCloud, Apple Music, and the App Store is flawless, creating a user experience that’s both unified and expansive.

RhysfromCostco,"5 months ago | Apr 7, 2024 3:30 PM","I am an experienced Apple TV user and believe that it is the best streaming device on the market with a fairly competitive library of apps. I owned two Apple TV 4Ks of the previous generation.


Overall, the jump to the new generation isn’t terribly noticeable. The device does seem faster if you are a heavy user constantly switching between apps. As a person who watches a lot of sports via streaming, it is always a plus to have a device that can appropriately handle switching between apps. 

The one thing keeping this from a 5 star review is the remote. The remote design is an improvement from the previous generation because the previous remote tended to be vulnerable to accidental movements or button presses. However, the battery life on the new remote is horrible. Although I use the device to watch sports, I do not use the Apple TV frequently otherwise. I still have to charge my remote once every ten days. This was not the case with the previous generation’s remote that seemed to last for several months. Not sure why Apple took a step back in this area, as it is an otherwise very impressive device.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

I have numerous TV shows and full series of classic TV, and the picture quality and ease of use allow hours of enjoyment. I did not take advantage of the free trial of Apple TV but it does look like they have a good selection of shows. Will probably sign up to take advantage of the large selection of movies and shows. Would definitely recommend.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

ShawnL,"5 months ago | Mar 22, 2024 3:40 PM","A sleek, small box that gives you all the apps you want via a HDMI input with 4k capabilities. Having owned several variations of both Roku's and Amazon Fire sticks, the major differences are the 'apple' like interface, which is much cleaner of a home page than either of the other streaming sticks, and the remote, which feels much more premium than the others, with its tactile buttons and touch enabled circle pad.  

The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that some of the apps are either neglected from Apple in this product, or have been slightly tweaked in how they work.  One example is that using Hulu Plus Live in, say, a Samsung TV Hulu app, the 'back' button on the TV remote will allow you to drop back to the live TV guide, where the back button the Apple TV will exit the Live TV session. Another example is the Netflix app and its slightly tweaked layout.  Overall, still a good product.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

Originally bought to disconnect my S90C from WiFi to avoid firmware updates, while still being able to have streaming apps, I accidentally started a complete smart home/apartment with this as the first step. Now I have a complete lighting and security system with leak sensors, smoke alarms, cameras, contact sensors with the Apple TV as my hub. Certainly enjoyed going down that rabbit hole. 

The Apple TV 4K has made my audio on my surround sound so much better. No more whisper dialog followed by blasting your face off from an action sequence. Hdr10+ support in provided apps was a HUGE deal for me as I didn’t get a tv with Dolby vision. This powerful little box gave my TV that extra little push to make the picture really amazing. I find myself saying “dang that looks good”

The remote is great. So efficient and the side button Finally showed me that I actually enjoy using Siri. The simple organization of the apps in the home menu and how it all works together has uncomplicated everything I didn’t realize was complicated before.

Ronnie,"6 months ago | Mar 1, 2024 4:53 PM","I have purchased 5 Apple TV’s from Best Buy over the years and so when I purchased the latest Apple TV I went back to who I trust. I get the Apple TV 4K home, hook it up and it works like I expect. However, I noticed the remote is different than the others, more like the old one they originally came out with but beefier and had less than half a charge. I wanted to charge it but it I noticed there was no charge cord. I tried the lightning cord but that doesn’t work. I found out that Apple changed the charge cord again but didn’t feel it was worth mentioning. They didn’t tell Best Buy and did not post it on the box that a different charge cord is required. Even their website says nothing about it but if you call Apple they will charge you about $29 bucks for a cord and plug that you will need if you want the remote to continue to work. Be prepared if you buy one, pay for the charge cord and plug separately.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

  If you are in the Apple ecosystem of devices you’ll feel right at home with the beautiful menus and icons. The smooth transitions and satisfying motion between icons. It’s the experience we come to expect from an Apple product. They just do it better. The remote, although similar to a firestick is more like a work of art. Made of a beautiful sleek aluminum body, rechargeable battery, and a lovely touch pad. The remote provides input no matter where it’s pointed or what’s blocking the Apple tv and that is a great touch. 
  You can connect a Bluetooth gaming controller to play games in the Apple Arcade, connect your AirPods for Spatial Audio listening or to not bother anyone else on the house.

Yep - there's a price difference between AppleTv and other streaming ""sticks"" but the difference is night and day! Cleaner, crisper, brighter picture (even on not so great tvs) - smoother interface, flawless mobility - Apple treats you like royalty with their offerings. They have created devices that consider YOU - not filled with bloatware either! Thats definitely a plus! 

One of my favorite things - Apple TV ""talks"" to ALL OTHER APPS!!! Yes - ALL OF THEM! Unlike Fire - who doesn't talk to anyone - 
When you search something on Apple Tv - it will tell you where it's available...whatever app (even if you don't have it) - Fire only talks to Prime - (BOOO) When I was using Fire - I spent so much money on rentals, all to find out it was on an app I was already paying for - Because Fire didn't talk to my apps - only Prime Channel offerings - 
NOT ANYMORE! Thank you Apple! 
I can now use ONE app to find whatever I want - wherever it is! 
Apple talks to prime and all others. Fire talks ONLY to prime. Its a huge difference. The entire Apple Ecosystem is amazing and this no exception! The experience you get from Apple tv is worth the price, plus some!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Also, I couldn't attach earbuds to it. I only found a way to install the Roku app on my phone and use the earbuds while using my phone's Roku app. I found there was a delay sometimes, and I couldn't hear every word. Since I have all Apple products (Mac Mini, iPad, iPhone, Airpods) I decided to buy the Apple TV 4K 128 GB. So far, I like it the best of all the TV boxes that I have tried.

Jkbhd,"7 months ago | Jan 30, 2024 3:34 PM","I bought a Samsung QN90C and even though it's a 2023 TV, I find their smart TV experience to be lacking. Tizen was never my favorite platform for streaming media. 

I decided to give the Apple TV 4k a go and was pleasantly surprised. Super small device but packs so much into it with a smooth, quick and fast user experience. Apple TV offers all the major streaming app that I use, mainly Max, Hulu, Netflix, Youtube TV, Prime and some others like Cruncyroll and Twitch. 

Compared to my TV's native apps, this thing is blazing fast with zero delay from buffering out content to just general browsing it's UI. Even if you're TV is older or feels generally sluggish, this device will breathe new life into it. 

The build quality feels premium and even the remote has a nice feel to it but I added a silicone case to it to protect it. 

Most suggest hardwiring it too if possible which I would as well but through WiFi and with gigabit internet, the speed test app shows it running about 500-600Mbps symmetrical. More than plenty and I'm impressed with it's WiFi performance overall. 

It's also has a nice auto picture calibration mode to set your picture settings to a decent picture. Probably not enough to a purist's liking but definitely good enough for your average user. 

If you have Apple Airpods, this thing is amazing using them pair with your Airpods. It introduces spatial audio and basically gives you your own private theater sound experience. I was surprised at how you can feel the rumble of explosions too through just the Airpods and Apple TV 4k setup. 

All and all I'd definitely suggest this for anyone looking to upgrade their TV experience. A little on the pricey side but well worth it for the ease of use and seamless experience.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Michael,"7 months ago | Jan 27, 2024 1:36 PM","I bought this for my parents based on my own experiences and they are slowly warming up to it. 

The tvOS is a simple yet elegant experience. Due to the nature of the platform it's my belief that streaming providers have no choice to build in a very standardized way. As a result many of the apps (certainly the big ones) function and are laid out in similar ways. No more trying to remember exactly how one app works versus another. Or at least not as much.

From a cost perspective these things are expensive, maybe even unreasonably so. However, I previously used Fire TV Sticks and found myself replacing them annually due to critical issues or poor performance. I purchased the one I am reviewing for my parents but I have my own that I've owned for a few years each and both have stood the test of time. I don't even have to restart them weekly or daily like the Fire TVs to keep them snappy.

The integration with the Apple ecosystem is of course first class and if you do Fitness+ workouts and have a watch those classes are never better than when I can watch them on my living room TV.

In tvOS 17 you can now use your phone to find your remote if you misplace it which is handy.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

JonnyB,"7 months ago | Jan 22, 2024 4:21 PM","I originally bought this because the ""Smart TV"" that I have wasn't acting very smart recently and led to more annoyances than enjoyment. Someone mentioned trying the Apple TV out, and well I was blown away and never thought it was needed until now. The Samsung TV I have is only a couple years old but its streaming features was nothing compared to how my computer or phone handle it. Additionally its bixby smart assistant wouldn't work as intended. The Apple TV handles MULTI-TASKING very very well! I could have different shows opened in a couple apps and can freely jump back and forth and resume playing without any re-loading or interruptions, even after turning off the Apple TV. I didn't know I needed this but it's frankly amazing!! 

I will add that if you use Apple's other devices and are involved in their eco-system it takes the power of this little device to the next level, such as using your phone instead of the remote, or even asking Siri on a different device to pause, play, or to turn on/off your TV.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MarkS,"7 months ago | Jan 14, 2024 12:26 PM","This is the very best streaming device period...!  Is it pricey, yes, but IMO, there is no other device available that can come close to Apple TV's specs, flexibility, options, and video/audio quality.

Before I get into the meat of things, a little FYI on my tv watching options at this time.  I reside at a Veterans residence, and we do not have the option or ability to have cable access in our rooms.  So, we have to rely on an OTA antenna for live local channels and streaming via wi-fi for any and all other content.  So, I have been using a Firestick 4K Max for quite a while now on a 13 year old Samsung 40""1080P LCD tv.  True, the tv was not a smart, 4K tv, but wanted to future proof, so that is why I went with the 4K Max Firestick.  It worked well even with its limitations compared to the Apple TV 4K.  I fortunately received a new tv for Christmas this year, (55"" Hisense U7K), and being that the onboard Google OS is, again IMO, complete junk I decided to stick with using the Firestick for all my streaming needs, (Prime Video, YouTube TV, Max, Paramount, Peacock, etc.), and hooked it up to the new Hisense.  But unfortunately, it looked like crap!  Picture was not clear, clean, or even uniform at times.  Felt like I took 2 steps back from the older Samsung.  I messed around with all the settings available to me on both the U7K and the Firestick itself, but to no avail.  Became very frustrated and disappointed.  Was beginning to think that maybe the U7K was a defective unit from the get-go.  So, I jumped on the computer to find out about other streaming options available.  A new Firestick wasn't an option, as was a Chromecast dongle, and I really don't care for the Roku interface and operating system as well.  So, by a process of elimination, Apple TV 4K was basically my last option.  To be honest I was not necessarily looking forward to shelling out $150 for a streaming device, but I was out of options.  So, yesterday I purchased the 128GB version of the Apple TV 4K.  Going with the 128GB vs the 64GB version was a no brainer.  For only $20 more for the 128GB, you get twice the storage and an ethernet port.  

So, I got back to my room and hooked it up and activated the unit.  Being that I am somewhat immersed within the Apple ecosystem, (iPhone, iPad), I was very familiar and comfortable with the process.  Got everything up and running in just a few minutes.  And when I was finished downloading my preferred apps, turned on YouTube TV, I was frankly blown away by the picture quality.  It is phenomenal...!  There is no other streaming device that can even come close to both the video and audio quality of an Apple TV device. In regard to just the video resolution and quality, IMO, it is very, very, close and very, very comparable to a hi-def/4K cable feed.  And that is all due to the processing power of the A15 Bionic chip within the unit.  Very customizable to fit all of your viewing needs.  One of the ""things"" I like the most is that it doesn't limit your ability to fine tune the picture settings on your tv, unlike the Firestick.  With the 4K Firestick and Fire TV, everything is streamed in Dolby Vision.  So, it's been my personal experience, with that being the case that the 4K Firestick primarily streams in Dolby Vision, the TV will default to one form or another of Dolby Vison, and one cannot access any other picture options on the TV, (Vivid, Sports, Filmmaker Mode, Theater Day/Night, etc.) Quick disclaimer, if the content was originally filmed and streamed in Dolby Vision on the Apple TV, your tv settings will default to Dolby Vision and that will leave you only four options for picture customization, (Dolby Vision IQ, Dolby Vison Dark, Dolby Vision Custom, Dolby Vision Game).  Well, that's the case with my tv, (Hisense U7K), it could be different on yours.  I honestly don't know if that will or will not be the case with your experience.  With my Hisense U7K, when Dolby Vison is in use, I use the ""Dolby Vison IQ"" option with just a couple of tweaks.  For all other content I use the ""Theater Day"" picture option, with again, a couple of small tweaks.  

In regard to the remote. It is a very good, but not great.  It is relatively easy to use and navigate, but with a couple of caveats.  One; I wish it had the learning ability to control and navigate the settings menu on whatever tv the unit is being used with. Two; not sold on the ""track pad"" as of yet.  To be fair, I've only been using it for a little over one day, probably just need a little more time using it.     

Pros:
1) Video and audio quality.  It is far above and beyond its competitors.
2) It's powerful processor with lighting quick response times navigating through any and all apps.
3) 128GB of storage.
4) Ethernet connectivity.
5) No trash adds whatsoever within the OS.
6) Very good rechargeable remote
7) Pretty much future proof.  With Apple's constantly tweaking and updating their software and operating system(s) for optimum efficiency and better user experience, there should be no need to update the hardware in the foreseeable future.

Cons:
1) Price.  At $150 it is considerably more money that its competitors.
2) The remote.  It could be more intuitive regarding controlling the tv it is hooked up to.

In closing, IMO, overall, this is a great streaming device.  and it is the best device available at this time.  True it is a pricey unit, but with its performance from a video/audio aspect, its capabilities, its build quality, and all the technology that Apple has incorporated within it, I feel it is a fair price.  Another way to look at this, is this.  There is that saying when purchasing a Sony product, one has to pay the ""Sony Tax"" for whatever type of Sony product being purchased.  One has to pay the additional cost of the Sony product compared to their competitors.  IMO, that same principle applies to Apple products.  You're paying those extra dollars for the best technology, the best build quality, the best longevity, etc.  I hope this has been of some help and thank you for taking the time to read all of this.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

SimonL,"8 months ago | Jan 10, 2024 5:39 PM","The Apple TV 4K 128GB (3rd Gen) in sleek black is a cinematic powerhouse that effortlessly combines style with substance. With an expansive 128GB storage, it's a digital haven for your content, eliminating the need for space dilemmas.

The design is chic, seamlessly fitting into your setup with a touch of sophistication. Its 4K HDR display and A12 Bionic chip deliver stunning visuals and smooth navigation, transforming your living room into a movie set.

The minimalist remote, featuring Siri for voice commands, adds to the user-friendly experience. Connectivity is top-notch with Wi-Fi and Ethernet options, ensuring seamless streaming and multitasking.

In my opinion, it delivers better quality that the in-built HULU player of my Samsung TV and better than the firestick. I bought another for my other TV in the Bedroom too",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

This is hands down my new favorite home entertainment stream box and to top everything off its way faster than any other stream box i've ever used and having no adds on the homescreen is such a breath of fresh air. I would very much recommend it. It may be a bit expensive but it is worth every penny!

jason,"8 months ago | Jan 5, 2024 5:10 PM","I had an Apple TV way back a decade ago when they didn't support apps.  I switched over to the Amazon Fire TV and used that on every TV forever, but now the Fire TV has become laggy and inundated with advertising.  When they updated it recently to use full-screen ads as you turn the thing on, I unplugged it, filed a trade-in and went out and bought this more expensive Apple TV.

WOW is this better!!!  The price is not quite double what I paid for the Fire TV Cube, but the quality and experience is 10 times better!!!

As soon as I signed into this thing with my Apple ID, it had everyone in my iCloud family listed as profiles, and it was so much easier to authenticate stuff using an iPhone alongside.

Everyone in the family immediately remarked how slick and quick the interface was.  Not just the Home Screen, but within the apps we use as well.  We're all pretty sure that Hulu buffers less when we're trying to watch live sports.  We have gigabit fiber and both the Apple TV and Fire TV were connected via ethernet, but the Fire TV Cube had to use a USB adapter.  That shouldn't be a factor though, I just think the Fire TV had too much overhead trying to snoop and figure out what ads to run.

Technically, I know that Amazon uses the Android OS and it used to be pretty fast but they bloated it with ads and tracking and Android just sucks if it's not been tuned to run on an expensive mobile device.  Apple TV uses their own tvOS.  All the apps have to be natively built for the platform and approved into the App Store, and it's just unarguably faster and better and less junky.

No sponsored tiles or grown-up stuff advertised to your kids, a zippy clean and fast interface, I can airplay to it from my phone, every app is natively slick and fast, it's just phenomenal.  I want this on my bedroom TV now.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

The Apple TV 128 GB has a gig Ethernet and I measured it and it will do 930+ Mb easy. It moves faster between streaming services, like going to Paramount+ and the Firestick just sat there. The Apple has no delay. The Apple TV does have fast WiFi but I have not tested it.

Harry,"8 months ago | Dec 24, 2023 10:13 AM","Best in class TV hub!  I have used the competitions products, and none have an interface that is nearly as responsive/ clean and not to mention as beautiful as apples TV’s.  This has as much to do with the quality (also beauty) of the remote as it does the hub itself.  Additionally, I recommend Apple TV be paired with 2 HomePod speakers (assuming a full home entertainment surround sound system is impractical), as this serves as the most convenient yet powerful 2 speaker “sound bar” type of setup, on the market (given the price point).  Some other noteworthy features include integration into Apple ID accounts and Apple ecosystem, in general.  The most obvious feature available to those integrated into the Apple ecosystem, is the remote function (and particularly its’ search box typing feature) available to users with an iPhone.  Bonus ecosystem features include: integration of “family” users in the form of separate account logins to the TV;  previous purchase Apps via App Store, which provide compatibility with Apple TV operating system; and even more features that I am forgetting or perhaps others of which I am not aware.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

XenoChron,"8 months ago | Dec 22, 2023 8:15 PM","The best iteration of the Apple TV and worth the extra money for the thread support and Ethernet port.  It’s unfortunate the Apple TV just didn’t make the only difference the memory as it would have been more competitive if cheaper with same features. 

My only complaint is there are some tvOS features that seem to be less refined than others. In particular, the photos app is lacking.  But for watching videos and streaming music it lacks very little. 

I’ve yet to see a good competitor and yes it is more money but when spending a lot of time watching movies or TV’s it seems like a small investment. If you’ve ever gone and seen a movie in the theater a few times that money evaporates whereas the money spent for the Apple TV will last a long time. 

If unsure, check out any YouTube reviews from respectable sources and then decide.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Morgan,"8 months ago | Dec 15, 2023 7:51 PM","I've used a firestick for years and years -- I used to think Apple TV was a dumb product for people who were obsessed with Apple and had more money than sense.  I was totally wrong -- this definitely has a premium price over a firestick or roku, but I haven't had a single moment of lag when clicking through the OS.  Everything just looks better on this as well, and it works well with my LG OLED G3 TV.  

The remote works fine, I don't know if I love the touch feature (where dragging your thumb kind of works like a mouse), but you can disable that.  It's got apps for all the services I use, and again, everything looks *great*.  Dolby Vision, HDR, plus Atmos for sound.  It's just a quality item, and super small.  I wall-mounted mine so I don't even see it behind the TV.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

There is no streaming hardware better than this one. At least until Apple releases a new iteration of it. But you already know that. That’s why you’re here. Now go ahead, consume product. Then get excited for next product.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Techirama,"8 months ago | Dec 15, 2023 3:34 PM","Full disclosure I have been on the “Fire” bandwagon for years.  For the longest time they have been a great bang for your buck.  But over the last couple of years they have weighed down their devices with bloat-ware and with their most recent updates, ads.  As a result it has made their devices buggy and almost unusable at points. So I finally decided to make the switch to the “Big Apple” and here is what I can say.  It just works.  Video quality is on point and so is the audio quality.  I launched an app and almost fell over how fast it loaded.  Honestly if you are looking for device recommendation order as of today it would go “Big Apple” then the simple yet efficient Roku and finally the “Fire” world.  Maybe if “Fire” can remove the junk it can be great again, but I am not holding my breath.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
