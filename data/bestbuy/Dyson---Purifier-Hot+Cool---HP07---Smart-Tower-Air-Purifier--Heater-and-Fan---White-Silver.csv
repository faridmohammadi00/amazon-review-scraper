After running the fan on the lowest cool setting for 4 hours, the temp in the room actually got hotter than it was outside!   The circulated air from the fan felt no different from a conventional fan, and it did absolutely nothing to change the overall temperature in the room.  After owning 3 different Dyson vacuums over the last 10-15 years, I am VERY disappointed with the performance of this product.  This will definitely have me considering other options the next time I need to replace one of the vacuums.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

I have gone through several, and they consistently break down immediately outside of the warranty period (and Dyson offers terrible customer support for them). If you're looking for air purifiers, there are better (cheaper and longer-lasting) options, and there are better options for heating as well. It would be a great device, and I would give it 5 stars, but for the fact that it fails so completely in relatively short order.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

My son is currelty sick so my wife sprayed lysol around the house this morning. When it picks up the lysol on the sensor, its registeres as VOC. Its been running on medium seed for about 3 hous and still has not been able to return the room to “good” air quality. My old purifier could handel the same task in about 30 minutes.

TexasTim,"6 months ago | Feb 11, 2024 8:28 AM","One room in my home struggles with keeping the temperature with the rest of my house. It's a large multi-purpose room attached to our family room, and the airflow could be better. In the winter, especially on those frigid days, my hands freeze as I use this space for office work. 

Enter the Dyson - Purifier Hot+Cool. I was amazed at how quickly it warmed this ample space the first time I plugged it in. Within an hour or so, the room temperature exceeded the rest of the house, although I had felt warmer almost immediately due to the stream of toasty air. 

The unit was easy to assemble and operate. It auto-senses and regulates temperature exceedingly well. It's relatively quiet, especially in low settings. While louder at high settings, it can move some air. The smart WiFi functions and the air quality monitoring are a treat. 

As for the air purifying function, I have a couple of dogs who generate copious amounts of fur and dander. We will see how the filtering function works over time, but nothing notable right away. The truth will be in the filters when it comes time to change them.

Appearance-wise, I chose the 7 versus the 10 because I wanted to avoid the funky gold color. I'm not a massive fan of white either; later, I learned that Dyson does offer it in black directly from Dyson. Best Buy does not provide alternative color options, but I wanted my Best Buy points. 

I wish it were controllable by HomeKit, but Dyson does not offer compatibility at this time. It also will not allow you to turn on the unit in heating mode from the app; this must be done on the unit or with the remote, citing some pesky safety language in the app.

It's a solid unit, and aside from a few quibbles with the smart features and the relatively high cost, I'd recommend it.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

This device was so easy to setup right out od the box, and sync with the app. It works exactly as expected, and heats the room fairly fast. I like that it has an app, you can have this device monitor your air quality at all times, even when its not in use.

They never acknowledged receipt or contacted me about when I’d receive a replacement.  After two weeks I emailed their customer service and they informed me that I would receive an email when they had processed my return.  Well it’s been four weeks and I’ve already had to pay my $500 credit card.

No issues and I love how quiet it can get.

The oscillation is top notch as well with many modes of differing degrees to choose from, I keep mine at 45° for a tight covered area. But it goes up to 350° 

Oscillation modes: 0, 45°, 90°, 180°, 350°

The unit also tilts back or forward if you need the air at a steeper angle up or down.


Wi-Fi control is awesome, I can control my Dyson from work if I want to, although due to safety laws now in place it will NOT allow you to adjust the heat up with Wi-Fi, you must use the included controller. But you can adjust cooling and everything else remotely.
Many things to love about this unit!

mtoomb,"1 year ago | Sep 9, 2023 3:38 AM",Love the Hot+Cool HPO7. I have the Hot+Cool HPO1 for the past 4 years and love that also. Live in a 750 sq. ft. Apartment with mostly carpet and it works just like advertise. I know it is costly but during the winter it saved us a lot on electric bill with central heat and air. Have not got to use the heater on the HPO7 but I know what it is capable of and I am sure it will be awesome like the HPO1. Do not know about the filter yet because after 7 days it is already down to 96%. HPO1 I would have to buy one every year. At $79 dollars for filter I only want to replace after 1 year. If you have allergies this is the machine for you. My wife and I do not even notice our allergies anymore and we live in TN.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars

In the summer months it’s used as a fan and purifier to keep the air moving. We have birds so the no blade design is a plus. Instead of cleaning the blades every couple weeks I think we cleaned the dust off the outside a few times all year.  In the winter time I’ll use the heat mode to warm the entire house. It lets me choose between burning propane or raising my electric bill a few bucks. I was quite impressed with it last winter and can’t wait to see how it does this winter.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars

GenjiOoka,"1 year ago | Jun 24, 2023 10:37 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool HP07 is a remarkable device that combines air purification, heating, and cooling functionalities into a sleek tower design. With its smart features and integration with Wi-Fi and Google Home Routines, this appliance has elevated my comfort and indoor air quality. While it falls short in terms of temperature control via the app or Google Home, due to UL 1278 compliance, the overall experience still earns it a solid four-star rating. Here's why I find it impressive:

Superior Air Purification: The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool HP07 is exceptional when it comes to purifying the air. Its advanced filtration system effectively captures allergens, pollutants, and odors, leaving the air noticeably cleaner and fresher. The HEPA and activated carbon filters ensure a high standard of air quality, which is particularly beneficial for those with allergies or sensitivities.

Versatile Heating and Cooling: The HP07 offers both heating and cooling capabilities, making it a versatile year-round appliance. Whether it's providing a gentle breeze during the summer or warming up a chilly room in the winter, this device delivers consistent performance. The Jet Focus technology enables targeted airflow, allowing me to personalize my comfort zone.

Smart Integration: The ability to connect the HP07 to Wi-Fi and integrate it with Google Home Routines is a significant advantage. It provides the convenience of controlling the device remotely and incorporating it into my smart home ecosystem. Being able to include the purifier in my routines, adjusting settings through voice commands, and automating its operation adds a layer of ease and efficiency to my daily life.

Sleek Design and User-Friendly Interface: Dyson's attention to design and usability is evident in the HP07. The tower form factor is sleek and modern, seamlessly blending into any space. The user interface is intuitive, with a clear display and straightforward controls that make it easy to customize settings and monitor air quality.

However, the limitation of not being able to control the temperature gauge via the app or Google Home due to UL 1278 compliance is a disappointment. It would have been convenient to have complete control over all aspects of the device remotely. Nevertheless, considering the device's overall performance and functionality, it doesn't significantly diminish its value.

In summary, the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool HP07 is a smart and versatile appliance that excels in air purification, heating, and cooling. Its integration with Wi-Fi and Google Home Routines enhances convenience and ease of use. While the temperature control limitation is unfortunate, the HP07's superior air quality, versatility, smart integration, and elegant design make it a reliable choice for improving both comfort and indoor air quality. It's a four-star device that stands out among its competitors in the market.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

JulianaG,"1 year ago | Jun 15, 2023 11:59 AM","I bought the Dyson - HP04 Pure Hot + Cool about two years to manage my allergies, and it worked great until I made it work to maximum capacity when the Canadian wildfire smoke hit NYC. I contacted the company and was told ridiculous suggestions like cleaning the machine, or they will give me 20% off for buying a new machine. 

Dyson made no attempts to try and fix the machine or provide me with a new machine. I understand that the machine would not last forever, but it should not have broken when I made it work to full capacity during the Canadian wildfire smoke. They should be more honest and tell the truth that their machines may break down with wildfire smoke, and they will not attempt to fix or replace your costly machine.

During the peak of the Canadian wildfires, while the old machine was still working and I was deluding myself that Dyson was a serious company, I bought the Dyson - Purifier Hot+Cool - HP07 to protect other household members. So far, the new machine is working, but who knows for how long since the Canadian wildfire smoke is supposed to come back again to NYC.

I haven’t had it for long and I was well aware that the cooling fan isn’t up to a standard as an AC. So no fans are in my opinion. It doesn’t go to extreme heat, 75 degrees is good enough for me. I have left it on for a whole day by accident and it still works fine. I don’t know much about the filtering but I do know I can’t light a candle or cook food near by with it on because it picks up the pollutants in the air, I prefer not to. And the app is easy to use. By the way I have a medium size room that gets extremely cold in the winter and have 2 windows.

Also has a super clean and modern look, it will look good in your home. Did I mention there’s an integrated heater? So you can keep this running in the cold months and huddle up next to the warmth. 

BUT my Dyson air purifier does WHISTLE if it is kept on for too long. Sometimes it’s only after an hour of usage and it creates a super high-pitched scream. Not only does it drive me crazy, but it scares my dog too.

Dale,"2 years ago | Mar 3, 2022 6:47 AM","I highly regret purchasing this Dyson. It suffers from the same terrible fan noise, similar to a high pitch whine, that previous Dyson models suffer from, such as my TP-04, which I had replaced and still made the noise. At low speeds, there is a constant whine coming from the fan that is extremely audible. This is not simply my unit, but a well-known fault in these types of Dyson air purifiers.

Second, these units will automatically perform a complete shutdown when heat has been running for approximately 8 hours. It will not just turn off the heat, but will automatically shut down the entire unit. This is of course in addition to being unable to use heating controls from the app in the US. That was at least well documented.

When we first got this fan/heater combo, it was a steep price, but we justified it with the amazing air filtering and monitoring tech along with the wifi set up for us to control with the Dyson app and voice control. Overall awesome tech with great cooling, heating, and air purifying.

So why the low rating? Because it has a HUGE flaw that you wouldn't notice until it happens to you...

One day, my wife and I came home and discovered our dog chewed through the remote, rendering it useless. Hey, no problem, right? I've got the app as well as voice control...EXCEPT it turns out you can't turn on the heating with either of those.  But no big deal, I can order a new remote, right? EXCEPT that remote has been out of stock since at least when I bought the fan. Customer service told me they would email me when it's back in stock. Yup...still waiting over 3 months later.

The little display on the fan is cool and when actively filter you get a nice read out of air quality. However, for $650 it should have a few more basic features and I should be 5 star satisfied. My biggest issue is that the only way to fully control the fan, and the only way to set/adjust the temperature in heat mode, is with the remote. The remote is extremely small and will end up lost in a week. There are no controls, other than a power button on the fan itself. The accompanying app allows you to control everything but the temperature. I wouldn’t be as rattled by this if the price were reflective of this lack of features.

I also like the features that show the air quality and how the dyson has an auto function to maintain optimal air quality. I haven’t used the heat function yet but it seemed to work fine when testing. The only negative I have is with the delivery. The box was ripped up and I was worried the fan would be damaged. It wasn’t but the lack of care given to the package that clearly displayed what was inside is unacceptable.

In terms of performance — not exactly worth the cost when there are more affordable alternatives that also perform a bit better. Don’t go off of how the fan blows on display in an air conditioned store as its common with these to assume that they are alternatives to AC units. It’s just a fan and functions no more than that.

Pros — you can switch the vents so that it blows out of the front or back; it also rotates up to a full 360°. Quieter at low settings but not quiet. Comes with a remote, displays toxin levels in the air; looks amazing!

Cons — more affordable alternatives outperforms Dyson so if considering, make sure it’s something you want and in addition, be aware of its performance and features. Or else, it’ll be underwhelming and unexpected.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars

Mistabritt,"3 years ago | Jul 16, 2021 9:44 PM","After having a couple Dyson products (the Ball Animal 2 vacuum and the Dyson Cyclone v10 Motorhead cordless vacuum), I have wanted a Dyson fan for the longest. After waiting and waiting, I recently decided to bite the bullet and get the Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool HP07 Smart Tower Air Purifier Heater/Fan.

Inside the box the HP07 comes with 2 filters and filter doors, the remote, and the user documentation. Following the user manual simply snap the filters and doors in place and you're ready to go. Setup process was fairly simple with connecting it to my home's WIFI. Just download the Dyson app from the Apple App Store or the Google Play store for Android.

Once everything is connected, just power on the fan and you're good to go. The fan can be controlled by the remote (which can easily be stored magnetically on top of the fan) or by the power button. 

The remote button features are:

Power: on/off button.
info: cycles through different screens on the display.
+/- fan: controls the speed of the fan up to 10.
+/- heat: changes heat output between 34° and 99°.
Auto: simply lets it run as it see's fit.
blue dot: switches over to the air mode.
<>: oscillates at 45°, 90°, 180°, and 350°.
Directional Airflow button: changes the direction of the air/heat.
Timer: set timer intervals for 30min, 1hr, 2hr, 4hr, or 8hr.
Moon: dims the display at night so it doesn't disturb your sleep.

One thing I would like to stress for those thinking this is an air conditioner, it's not. It's simply a fan that will aide in cooling the air around you down. I love mine and glad I purchased it. I use it in addition to my AC Unit especially when I come home from work and its 85° - 90° in my house. It helps with cooling the air down faster in my house and not having my AC Unit work double duty.

So far in my experience, after cooling my house down I'm able to turn my AC Unit off and just let my Dyson fan to continue to help circulate cooler air in my living room.

As far as the Purifier part of the Dyson, it helps cleans the air in your surrounding from different pollutants and contaminants. It will detect and let you know what the Air Quality is like inside your home, as well as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, VOC, Filter Life Information, WIFI information, and any Software Updates Available.

MikeT,"3 years ago | Jun 18, 2021 3:37 PM","I was really in the fence about purchasing this dyson, purely because of cost. Ive bought now 2 other space heaters for my home office, and a variety of fans. I wish I had just bought this item first.

Its super easy to setup and use, and works amazingly. I have not used this in the winter yet, but i did test the heat and i was shocked by how much warm air it put out. The cooling feature is great. It cools significantly better than a normal fan. I dont know how it does it, but it does. My office has a bunch of windows, and has always been uncomfortable, but now it's fine. 

I personally dont mind the little bit of noise it makes, but i can see how it couod bother some. A friend of mine was over recently and used her vape pen near it. The little air purity display turned red, and the fan got really loud until it cleared the air i guess. I thought it was neat, but if it was that loud all the time it would bother me.

All in all i really enjoy this unit. I would buy again, and would recommend to a friend.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

BinkyBarns,"3 years ago | Jun 11, 2021 10:11 PM","No an air purifier / fan / heater has no business in the world being this expensive. Nope, never, Except, well when it works. 

I have a few other Dyson products that use their cursed app. This is the first device that actually makes that app shine. 

The thing is dirt dog silent. On auto with the fan rotating, I can't even hear it run. Now when I cook and smoke up the room - that's another story, yeah it makes noise. 

Setup was easier than any of their other products - snap the filters in and plug it in. Adding it to the app was also easy. 

The remote is actually pretty darn cool and nice. It took me all of 5 minutes to figure everything out without reading the manual (yeah a stupid QR code to the Dyson website). 

The app isn't exactly intuitive to use - there are just too many icons with no help. Swipe up to show graphs of every parameter this thing tracks - temp, humidity, air quality, etc. The thing that is so wrong with the stupid app, touching the icons on the main screen for temp, humidity, or air quality - just shows help screens. Now that's just plain stupid - the graphs should display. Swipe up to get help and definitions, not swipe to get graphs. 

There is one sad feature lacking, you can't control the temperature with the app. For some reason US product safety requires they only do that with the remote or on the unit itself. Too bad - it would have been useful to warm up a room before going there. 

I have used more air purifiers than you can shake a stick at - LG, Fellowes, Winix, GermGuardian, Varnado, Holmes. None of them are this quiet. None of them look this nice. 

This is the short squat model - personally I'm glad I didn't buy one of those tall ones, I think they are ugly. This has the right balance of base and top, that looks good. 

Basically this is a darn expensive: fan, heater, and air purifier. And I love it thank you very much.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded.

PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

I'm so far pleased with this entry in the Dyson lineup!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly.

HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate.

RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

I'm so far pleased with this entry in the Dyson lineup!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Ivette0930,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 11:01 PM",The Dyson fan is amazing. I’ve honestly haven’t seen a machine like it. It definitely keeps the room nice and cool during these summer days and Warm during the winter. It come with a small controller which you can control from anywhere in the room. It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded.

The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded.

PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well.

Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded. 

Very nice unit but a pricey unit. If you can afford it – good purchase!",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded. 

Very nice unit but a pricey unit. If you can afford it – good purchase!",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running.

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you.

Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly.

HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option.

Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much.

OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded. 

Very nice unit but a pricey unit. If you can afford it – good purchase!",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

I'm so far pleased with this entry in the Dyson lineup!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded. 

Very nice unit but a pricey unit. If you can afford it – good purchase!",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

I'm so far pleased with this entry in the Dyson lineup!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Ivette0930,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 11:01 PM",The Dyson fan is amazing. I’ve honestly haven’t seen a machine like it. It definitely keeps the room nice and cool during these summer days and Warm during the winter. It come with a small controller which you can control from anywhere in the room. It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly.

HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much.

Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded. 

Very nice unit but a pricey unit. If you can afford it – good purchase!",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

I'm so far pleased with this entry in the Dyson lineup!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

It definitely keeps the room nice and cool during these summer days and Warm during the winter. It come with a small controller which you can control from anywhere in the room. It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate.

RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Ivette0930,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 11:01 PM",The Dyson fan is amazing. I’ve honestly haven’t seen a machine like it. It definitely keeps the room nice and cool during these summer days and Warm during the winter. It come with a small controller which you can control from anywhere in the room. It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded.

PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded.

PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room.

kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded. 

Very nice unit but a pricey unit. If you can afford it – good purchase!",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded. 

Very nice unit but a pricey unit. If you can afford it – good purchase!",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

I'm so far pleased with this entry in the Dyson lineup!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Ivette0930,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 11:01 PM",The Dyson fan is amazing. I’ve honestly haven’t seen a machine like it. It definitely keeps the room nice and cool during these summer days and Warm during the winter. It come with a small controller which you can control from anywhere in the room. It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed.

HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option.

1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much.

OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded. 

Very nice unit but a pricey unit. If you can afford it – good purchase!",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

I'm so far pleased with this entry in the Dyson lineup!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly.

Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature.

The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded.

PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

I'm so far pleased with this entry in the Dyson lineup!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate.

RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.

I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

I'm so far pleased with this entry in the Dyson lineup!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Ivette0930,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 11:01 PM",The Dyson fan is amazing. I’ve honestly haven’t seen a machine like it. It definitely keeps the room nice and cool during these summer days and Warm during the winter. It come with a small controller which you can control from anywhere in the room. It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded.

The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded.

PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome.

The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded. 

Very nice unit but a pricey unit. If you can afford it – good purchase!",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded. 

Very nice unit but a pricey unit. If you can afford it – good purchase!",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running.

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly.

HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option.

Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much.

OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded. 

Very nice unit but a pricey unit. If you can afford it – good purchase!",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

I'm so far pleased with this entry in the Dyson lineup!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.

Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded. 

Very nice unit but a pricey unit. If you can afford it – good purchase!",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

I'm so far pleased with this entry in the Dyson lineup!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly.

HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much.

Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded. 

Very nice unit but a pricey unit. If you can afford it – good purchase!",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

I'm so far pleased with this entry in the Dyson lineup!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

It definitely keeps the room nice and cool during these summer days and Warm during the winter. It come with a small controller which you can control from anywhere in the room. It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate.

RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Ivette0930,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 11:01 PM",The Dyson fan is amazing. I’ve honestly haven’t seen a machine like it. It definitely keeps the room nice and cool during these summer days and Warm during the winter. It come with a small controller which you can control from anywhere in the room. It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded.

PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded.

PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room.

kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded. 

Very nice unit but a pricey unit. If you can afford it – good purchase!",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded. 

Very nice unit but a pricey unit. If you can afford it – good purchase!",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

I'm so far pleased with this entry in the Dyson lineup!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Ivette0930,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 11:01 PM",The Dyson fan is amazing. I’ve honestly haven’t seen a machine like it. It definitely keeps the room nice and cool during these summer days and Warm during the winter. It come with a small controller which you can control from anywhere in the room. It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed.

HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option.

1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much.

OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded. 

Very nice unit but a pricey unit. If you can afford it – good purchase!",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

I'm so far pleased with this entry in the Dyson lineup!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly.

Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature.

The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded.

PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

I'm so far pleased with this entry in the Dyson lineup!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate.

RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.

I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

I'm so far pleased with this entry in the Dyson lineup!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MacUser,"3 years ago | May 14, 2021 12:28 AM","Dyson doesn't need any introduction and so does this fan. Aesthetically, there's no match for Dyson products and this fan is no different. We own several Dyson products and honestly, once you start using their products, there's no going back. They are that good. This Dyson HP07 has impressed us on all levels. From the symmetric cut-outs on the air intake to the chamfer-like edges on the bladeless fan assembly, this Dyson’s air purifier/fan stands out. It’s about 30 inches tall, which makes it hard to tuck away in the corner. The base is slim at 9.5 inches and it doesn’t occupy too much space in the room. The distinctive design certainly generates visual appeal; the Dyson air purifier would be a good fit in any home. It is rare that you see this level of thought put into a device as simple as a fan.

The package arrived slightly damaged but luckily, the fan inside was safe with no signs of damage. I opened it as soon as it arrived and have been using it for four days. It's been awesome. The fan's eye-catching looks work great for our living room. It came with 2 carbon filters and a remote that attaches to the top of the fan magnetically (shown in attached pictures). The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Ivette0930,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 11:01 PM",The Dyson fan is amazing. I’ve honestly haven’t seen a machine like it. It definitely keeps the room nice and cool during these summer days and Warm during the winter. It come with a small controller which you can control from anywhere in the room. It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded.

The filters came fully wrapped and packaged and not already fitted on the fan. The only drawback would be to consider the cost associated with a new filter as they are quite pricey, though they do last a while. The fan doesn’t collect dust like other fans do and is super stylish. Setup was breeze - just insert the 2 filters, download the Dyson Link app, add the device, and setup wifi access. The LCD display is very clear and bright. It tells you exactly how “dirty” or “clean” the air is in each room.

You get 10 speed settings on the fan for cooling or heating. The carbon filter absorbs odors and organic compounds while the HEPA filter takes care of anything else. Fan on 5 or below is silent, just sounds like a light breeze. It is also an air filtration system with a HEPA filter that does a great job. It is smart enough to detect particles and temperature in the room and adjust its fan speed automatically. As its hot most of the time in Arizona (where we live), I'm expecting to use the cool function more often than the hot one. Although, I did try both for review purpose. Combining the heater and fan is an excellent idea - reducing the number of appliances needed in a room. We don't own any portable heater as it doesn't get that cold here but it will be very useful in places where it gets very cold. The remote and app work seamlessly and without any glitch. You can control it from your smart phone and monitor the performance over any time duration you want. However, you will definitely need to be careful with the remote as it's very likely to get lost because of its size. The remote gives you 45, 90, 180 & 350 degree of rotation options. The app doesn’t include merely the essential functions, but takes it up a notch. The oscillation function can be set to a specific angle by tapping on the display. The heat can also be set to the exact temperature you want. The app also displays granular data on air pollution levels in the room. It can track PM2.5, PM10, NO2 values, as well as temperature and humidity levels over the course of the day. Additionally, you can set the Dyson air purifier to a timer in case you want it switched on before you get back home. If you prefer not to have a directed stream, it is a cinch to switch over to the rear ambient cooling mode. This is a particularly neat trick that gives you most of the cooling benefits, albeit with a diffused stream from the rear-facing vents. It is is not an air conditioner unit so do not expect such a function. It is not sold as an AC neither should you expect that from a fan. It does however help reduce the temperature of a room down considerably, is very quiet & does not hinder or disturb sleep. 

Cooling and heating aside, the primary function of the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool is to serve as an air purifier. Dyson’s air purifier employs a pair of filters to cleanse the air. This includes a HEPA glass filter and an activated carbon filter, which, combined, are rated to purify 99.7 percent of air pollutants. The HEPA filter is responsible for cleaning out particles as small as 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, the activated carbon filter scrubs gases, and any untoward odor from the room. The Dyson air purifier has a digital meter on the front of the unit that provides an up-to-date readout of pollution levels.

Priced at $649.99, there is no doubt the Dyson Pure Hot and Cool air purifier is expensive. It really comes down to what you want from your household gadgets. I would recommend it if your pocket allows and, definitely if you are a Dyson fan like me.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Ivette0930,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 11:01 PM",The Dyson fan is amazing. I’ve honestly haven’t seen a machine like it. It definitely keeps the room nice and cool during these summer days and Warm during the winter. It come with a small controller which you can control from anywhere in the room. It tilts and turns 45 to 350 degrees. On top of that it purifies the air. You can also download the Dyson Link App which let’s you control the fan as well. On a funny note this fan has been installed in my son which has helped a lot with odors. I definitely recommend this fan which it has 3 functions in 1.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Jonestc,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 3:46 PM","The Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool is not only a smart fan with a heat feature but also an excellent air purifier. 
The medium sized unit was packaged well with simple instructions for assembly. Basically I just had to remove the filter covers on the front and back, insert the HEPA filters that were included and then snap the covers back on. The only issue I had was learning how to snap the covers on until they click.
There is an included remote control that controls all features and there is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to control all features except heat. The app is great since you don't have to keep up with the physical remote and the air purifier feature shows the air quality, temperature and humidity inside and outside of your home. There is also some info included in the app to help you understand the type air particles that are removed.
The cool part of the fan is really ""cool"" because there are no blades and the air flow is really good for the low noise level. You can also reverse the air flow to come out of the front or the back of the fan just by selecting on the app or remote. The heat feature works well with an automatic selection that allows the heat to be turned on and off based on a preset temperature. 
The fan also has a night mode so the air flow is even quieter to use while sleeping.
I loved that the air purifier shows numbers as well as a graph on the app of how the air quality was being improved as it worked. This is also shown on small display on the fan itself. We had just finished cooking in the kitchen and the air purifier in the living room showed severe air quality on the app. The air purifier went to work and within a few minutes, the air quality had gone down to the good range with the smaller and larger particles being removed from the air. The cooking/grease smell was improved as well. 
The air purifier, fan and heated fan seem to change the air in the room more quickly than you would expect without much noise.
Overall this is an extremely useful machine that has already improved our lives. It really is true that you get what you pay for.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kaizen61,"3 years ago | May 12, 2021 1:33 PM","I am impressed with the Dyson HP07, which is saying something since I have wanted one for a while but was never sure if the hype was real or whether it justified the price. Dyson products do carry a premium price tag, but review organizations like Consumer Reports give them high marks for style and build quality. Now I know why.

The minute you open the box, the results of a lot of engineering and design stare you in the face. Even the box was well designed; my box got substantially crushed in shipment, but the contents were not affected at all. And it did that with minimal use of plastic in a form fitting box made of recyclable cardboard. (Shows not only a love of engineering but of the planet as well!) It was easily assembled and running before I even looked at the instructions or the app.

The app is also well designed and worked great on my tablet. This is a major plus as many of the smart tech devices I have been reviewing have really lacked in this area with some minimally functional on a tablet or not at all. I was able to pair my HP07 quickly and without a lot of drama. The app lets you control almost everything except the thermostatic controls. Dyson limits this to the physical remote for safety and regulatory reasons.

The fan/heater is a marvel of granular control. I have never had a fan OR a heater that allowed as much flexibility with the temperature and the amount of draft and I love that I can just take the chill off the room without having to run everything full force. The Air Multiplier is way more efficient than any standard fan and superior in every way as far as I am concerned. You can get a cool/warn breeze just where you are sitting or move air about the whole room, all silently. Seriously, it is quiet – which is something I can really appreciate in my living room area when I am watching TV. With the standard floor fan it replaced, I was constantly adjusting the volume to be heard over the fan or adjusting the fan to get more/less airflow. The HP07 does a perfect job and after using one, it would be hard to go back to anything less.

Of course, it is more than a fan/heater. It is a high quality, connected air purifier with sophisticated air quality sensors that allow it to automatically purify your environment. As I write this, it is tree pollen season which is a rough time for me. The pollen in my area is so bad you can see it on the cars left outside and even on surfaces in my home. But I have noticed a distinct decrease in both pollen and dust since I got the HP07 running. To be sure, I did a complete dusting of the room I was testing it in the day I received it so I could test it properly so I can tell you that it is doing a great job so far. 

Of personal import to me (and maybe other smart home enthusiasts) Dyson has an accessible API as well for their family of devices and that means I can eventually add its sensors and controls to my own home automation software that runs the rest of my smart home. This is a big deal in the industry, and I make purchase decisions based on whether a device has an available API or not, so I am grateful to Dyson for supporting this and making their data/services available.

Yes, it is a little more expensive, but the value is certainly there to justify it. Build quality is incredible and it feels like it is going to last me a long time not to mention looking BEAUTIFUL while it does it! (It really does look like some kind of expensive sculpture!) When you consider this is also doing three jobs in one – air purifier, space heater and high-volume fan – the value proposition of the HP07 increases yet again.

Since I have been testing it, I have gone from wondering if it was all hype to wondering when my budget will allow me to purchase another one. I love it so much I want to get a purifier with the cool fan only for my bedroom. Needless to say, I would highly recommend it (and have already, to a neighbor who saw it while visiting) and am planning on making a future purchase of another unit in the short term.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Another impressively engineered product by Dyson. This multipurpose purifier is a space saver for those who currently use separate devices to clean, heat, and cool/circulate the air within their home. In addition to saving space, this device is much safer to use than any stand-alone spacer heater and fan.

The heater outputs an excellent amount of heat, depending on the temperature setting difference from ambient. The cooling mode is a bit limited, as this is not a full-fledged air conditioning unit, but it does noticeably cool the air it is moving. The fan is extremely quiet in its lowest speed settings (1-4), and sufficiently moves air with low noise at its highest setting (10).

The features of this purifier are extensive! The user can either manually set and adjust the temperature and fan speed for their comfort, or the unit can be put in auto mode, which automatically adjusts the settings according to the air quality and temperature. The base of the purifier allows for it to be tilted at various angles, and the unit can be set to oscillate anywhere from 0 to 350 degrees (0, 45, 90, 180, 350). 

The purifier also has the option to set a sleep timer, to leave the purifier off for a set time, and a night mode, which dims the LCD screen and operates the purifier at the quietest setting necessary to maintain air quality and temperature. For me, the night mode still allowed for noisier settings than I preferred, as I woke up to the noise of the heater being activated with a higher fan speed in the morning. It obviously was not enough of a problem to disturb my night-time sleep though, as I never woke up to it in the middle of the night. (The manual suggests using the backflow option to keep the noise down with the heater, and I plan on testing that out tonight.) 

All settings of the purifier can be adjusted and set by the included remote control, which magnetically secures to the top of the amplifier loop. The purifier can also be controlled by Dyson app on your phone, with some minor limitations. (The Dyson app limits the heating and temperature control due to UL safety standards.)

The only downside to all of these features and settings options is that there is a bit of a learning curve for using this purifier and figuring out the right settings for you. I recommend downloading the Dyson app to help navigate through all of the features and settings and reading the manual.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
Ikigai,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 5:20 PM","There's no other brand that screams luxury home appliances like Dyson. However, with that said, it is EXPENSIVE. It is not for the faint of heart and is a huge investment. 

The HP07 is my second Dyson product, the first was a v8 vacuum for the last two years, and I can't imagine my life before it. I've been a ""fan"" and eyeing the bladeless fan since its first introduction years ago. Then when Dyson added a heat feature, it blew my mind, and I knew that I needed to invest in this 3-in-1. Living in NYC, the air pollution is pretty moderate compared to places like LA, and I usually keep my window closed. But I am susceptible to dust and would have a sneezing fit - air purifiers have been my savor. Also - NYC loves to experience EXTREME temperatures so I can't wait to test the HP07 when the time comes.

Right out the box impressions: design is sleek and modern. Setting up the HP07 took less than 2 minutes once I figured out how to snap the filter in properly.

HP07 PURE HOT + COOL
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths:
--------------
1)FAN - pretty decent fan strength, although it's still pretty cool at the time of this review, so I won't know the full capabilities until I start sweating bullets. 

2)HEAT - this came as a huge surprise how much heat the HP07 packed. Although winter has not arrived yet (at least not until a few more months), I can feel the heat intensity when I set the room temperature higher. Within 30 min - 1 hour, my entire room is heated.

3) PURIFIER - Does its job - could detect air changes quickly and switch fan levels accordingly to get the air purity level back to the target level. 

4)AUTO - It's great not to have to change the temperature manually and have Dyson take care of it. It's impressive to see how it changes from hot to cool when regulating the temperature. 


------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) NOISE - at level 1 or 2, it is whisper-quiet, not surprising to hear a lot more noise at 10. When I first used the fan, there was a ""popping"" noise no matter what temperature/fan speed I set it to. Then after a few uses... the popping noise stopped. Hopefully, it remains that way. 

2)REMOTE - Probably one of the biggest letdowns. The design overall is simple, which is great, but overall material feels cheap. I understand the plastic design since it magnetically attaches to the top of the fan, but I would have liked to have a more robust finish or backlight option. 


------------------------------------------------------------------
DYSON LINK
------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Strengths
--------------
1) TURN ON/OFF - once it's hooked up to WiFi, the app links up to the HP07 seamlessly. Turning the fan on/off from my bed with just my phone is a blessing.

2)OSCILLATION DIRECTION - this is AMAZING! I love that you can choose the degree of fan oscillation 0-45-90-180-350 and choose a point of focus. For example, setting oscillation at 45 degrees but mainly to the left.
 
3)AIR QUALITY STATS - I don't open the windows to my apartment, so I wasn't surprised to see that my air quality is usually in the green. However, I was impressed that when I dusted an old frame near the HP07, the air quality moved above the target line and showed yellow. 

------------------
Weaknesses
------------------
1) WIFI - the app does not support the initial setup with hidden WiFi. There is a way around it. Unfortunately, that involved me unhiding my WiFi which caused a minor disruption. After the initial connection, you can revert and hide your WiFi. 

2) TEMPERATURE - because of the UL 1278 compliance, you can't change the temperature on your phone. It's not a huge loss - what can you do? Set desired room temp on remote and set auto. Honestly - it doesn't bother me that much. 


------------------------------------------
OVERALL IMPRESSIONS
------------------------------------------

Overall, the HP07 and Dyson app is pretty user-friendly and provides a good user experience which I do appreciate. Again, it is expensive, but it is certainly worth the investment, and I can't wait to see what this bad boy can do in the summer and winter - when the temperatures are a little more extreme.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars
RacineTechie,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 2:50 PM","The set up was easy and quick, the hard part was choosing a location that would provide best coverage without looking out of place. Once that was settled, and the filters installed (5 minutes or so) we had it up and running.
The app is handy to check on status and turn it on or off if you are out of the house or room. The air quality information on the display is great as well - it even tracks filter condition. The heating and cold air selection was very fast and simple and the heater kicks in right away and there is only a short delay after shutting the heat off before you can resume cool air use.
As far as how it works, it is quiet and really takes cooking and household cleaner odors out of the air fast. The main floor used to smell like a restaurant for an hour or more after we finished making dinner (even with a different air filtration system running) now it is back to normal in no time with the Dyson.
It looks sort of 'modern' for our house, but we literally didn't notice it after the first day - it was just there.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
Kotor,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 11:30 AM","Dyson has a reputation for premium performance and this product completely lives up to that reputation. I would recommend this air purifier to anyone that is concerned about having the best indoor air quality, and is willing to pay a premium price to get it, or in my case maintain it. This product and replacement filters are expensive, but they are worth it for the improved air quality and advanced features it offers. Using it gives me peace of mind, and my peace of mind is well worth it.

The high build quality and visual appeal are immediately apparent. It features an attractive white and silver finish that makes it easy to place and blend. I am using it in my master bedroom and my significant other commented about how remarkable it looks.

Getting the product ready to use was simple and consisted of downloading the Dyson app, taking the product out of the box, inserting the air filter, and plugging it in. The air filter comes in 2 separate pieces that attach to 2 corresponding covers, which in turn snap on to the unit. it is a very simple process, and I posted a picture to show what it looks like.

Included is a compact remote control that is logically designed. The remote magnetically attaches to the top of the air purifier, which is a nice touch that helps it from getting lost. The remote control can nearly fully control the unit, with the exception of setting up a schedule. Linking the product to the app was fast and straightforward. The app offers detailed information, and as I previously stated, allows a schedule to be set, and can also remotely control the product from anywhere.

I would like to give a separate honorable mention to the outstanding LCD screen. It is the best I have ever seen on an air purifier, and clearly shows what mode the product is in. It also gives a usable readout of the various air quality levels this product measures. Use the app to get more specific information, or hit the info button on the remote to cycle through the readouts. If it shows green, then that particular measurement is good. See the Dyson HP07 product page for a more detailed explanation about what pollutant levels are being measured.

This Dyson can be operated in a few different modes. I am keeping it in Auto mode which monitors the temperature in the room as well as the air quality. Then as needed, it will operate at the appropriate fan speed. It can also be operated in a heat mode, which runs via a digital temperature setting.

The air flow direction can be adjusted a few different ways. If the fan mode is not desired for cooling, then the air flow can be set to flow upward so only air purification is used. Another nice feature is that the unit can be manually tilted up or down to target the air flow. The app or the remote can also set the automatic turn (oscillation) to 45, 90, 180, or 350 degrees.

This Dyson is about as loud as you would expect for a powerful fan. At the lower speeds, it is hardly noticeable. At the higher speeds, it is subjectively much louder. There is a night mode that will dim the screen and keep the fan noise low.

One filter is included. A specific filter life in hours is not provided. The Dyson app and LCD screen rates the remaining filter life as a percentage. I have been using it for a few days, and the filter life shows at 100 percent.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
kids2,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 10:53 AM","Dyson makes really nice products and this one doesn't disappoint. Out of the large box - which was packaged really well to protect the machine - it was super easy to set up. I did misplace the remote while unpacking because it was attached to a cardboard backing... The unit is pretty large and finding a home for it in my family room was a challenge.

The first few days of usage were great as it got cold out and we just used the unit in heat mode. I love the little remote that comes with it but I find I misplace it because it is fairly small. It was perfect for heating the family room area and not having to turn the whole house heat back on. It is really quiet but you can hear when the fan unit turns on to pump out the heated air - not very loud. I have it placed between the family room and kitchen so I can just rotate it to heat the dining area or just use the oscillation option - from 45 – 350-degree rotation. It is great for kitchen cooking odors as well. The air quality indicator is always working and recirculating cleaner air as it works – so far so good and always in the Green!

My first CON is that it is awkward to pick up because you are not supposed to pick it up by the Amplifier loop but pick it up by the spinning base. PRO is that it has a great spinning base! The filter placement was super simple - just unlatch the sides and snap in the 2 filters. CONS are that these filters are not washable nor recyclable. I like that it has and automatic cut-out that works if the unit accidentally tips over. You CAN control your Dyson if you download the Dyson Link app - I don't see a need to use it so will not keep it loaded.

PhilGA,"3 years ago | May 11, 2021 8:16 AM","Dyson continues to really disrupt and elevate pretty much any market they decide to get into, and the HP07 is no exception.

While the device does look like a piece of art (certainly unmistakably Dyson in terms of form factor and ability), it does an excellent job with immediately-surrounding air as well. The bottom compartment contains the minimalist filtration system, while all actions can be viewed via the device's diminutive LED screen on its front. Essentially, the remote control rather intuitively controls all functions of the system, and there is an app that can be downloaded.

Various options include the ability for the fan to turn, stay stationary, produce hot and cold air, as well as ramp up or wind down the fan, per se. Further, all of these functions can be set to automatic, so the fan will know how fast/slow to go, and setting a thermostat keeps the temp to a particular level.

So far, this has been kept in a bedroom, and it's working well for us thus far. If you're used to a noisemaker for sleeping, you'll definitely still need one of those, because this air purifier doesn't make much noise at all during normal operations!

I'm so far pleased with this entry in the Dyson lineup!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars
