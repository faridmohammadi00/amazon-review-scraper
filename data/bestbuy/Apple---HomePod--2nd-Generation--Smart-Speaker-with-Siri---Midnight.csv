DerekS,"6 days ago | Sep 1, 2024 12:54 PM","People attempt to compare this newest model to the original, saying it's not as good, but I totally disagree.  The bass from this speaker is unreal and you'd never expect it from a speaker of this size.  The speaker produces clean highs and mids, and is able to fill a room without issue, especially when set up as a pair.  After I purchased just one and was able to see what it could do, I had to immediately order another to make it a pair.  If you already live in the Apple Ecosystem, this is a great addition and I have no regrets.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

John,"2 weeks ago | Aug 22, 2024 9:45 PM","I love Apple products.  I think the quality is top of the line.  When my Echo showed signs of dying, I investigated the HomePod for an AI Assistant replacement.  The HomePod has the best sound when playing Apple Music.  It's amazing what comes out of this thing and I was impressed; however, I'm used to Alexa/Echo answering my questions.  Sometimes I ask cooking and recipe questions, or measurement conversions, etc.  I hold a conversation with Alexa.  Not with Siri.  I asked it for a cooking temperature for steak I was grilling and it told me to ask it again on my iPhone and it would send me to a website to show me.  I then began asking it typical questions I would ask Alexa.  It kept directing me to my iPhone to ask it there so it could send me to a website with the information.  Close to 300.00 to act as a mediator to direct me to my phone.  If you're looking for a speaker, it has superb sound, but as an extension to your AI uses, it's completely useless.  I purchased Amazon's Echo Studio and it's definitely the replacement I wanted with some great sound.",Rated 2 out of 5 stars

Arby,"3 weeks ago | Aug 10, 2024 5:10 PM","So not buy if you plan interact with Siri through the HomePod. Some genius engineer at Apple decided that Siri can only speak at a volume between 30-100, which means if you use the HomePod in any relatively small room (office, bathroom, etc.) that Siri literally screams at you. It took Apple support almost 2 months and 4 support tickets to figure out that Siri just can’t speak at a volume below 30 - it’s hard coded in the software. The Apple support person suggested I sell my HomePod and buy something that had Alex. That tells you everything you need to know about the current state of Apple and Siri. Spend your money son literally anything else.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

WilliamR,"1 month ago | Aug 2, 2024 3:14 PM","I was looking at the Apple HomePod for awhile as an alternative to spending big money on a sound system.  I don't have an iPhone, just an iPad, so I'm not immersed in the Apple environment.  I scooped up the HomePod and Apple TV on a nice sale for what I'd consider a very reasonable price to give this a try with my new LG OLED TV.

Price:
The cost of the HomePod is pretty steep if you don't get it on sale(which aren't ran often).  If you're like me and want a pair of HomePods to substitute for a sound system, then it will run you $600 purchasing at full price.  I do feel that's pretty costly.

Setup:
Very quick and easy to setup with my iPad.  Linking it with Apple TV was even quicker.

Sound quality:
Sound quality to this little speaker is fantastic!  Very clear and crisp audio.  Speakers pushing sound up and to the sides really help in bouncing sound off the walls to give a surround sound vibe to this.  And I only have one.  Bass can get strong, which caught me off guard.  It's great for music!  Good for movies(probably need 2 HomePods to really excel at movies).

Smart speaker:
Siri is just a few words away.  I don't use Siri often, but for quick and easy questions or commands, she gets the job done for me.  I'd say Alexa is a little better in the intelligence department, but Siri is still suitable.

Overall thoughts:
I'm very satisfied with the single HomePod I have.  I will grab a second one in the future on a sale.  Clear and high quality sound quality.  Atmos effects with the upward firing speakers.  Only negative I've come across is the price.

Bonus:
I love movie theater type sound.  Since I have Apple TV hooked up to my LG TV, I'm able to pair the TV audio with a soundbar and the HomePod at the same time.  I do have to manually set the temp audio output for the soundbar each time, but with the sound of the HomePod added to the TV speakers and a Samsung Q990d, the sound it ridiculously amazing in that room!  Low ceilings and not an overly large room helps contain the sound, but the rumble during action scenes is as good or better than at a theater.  Hard to believe as I always had the impression you need to spend big money on a receiver, sub, and speakers for that type of audio quality.  But I'm a very happy camper.  Now time to experiment how the sound is with 2 HomePods.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

The Good:
Listening to music from a phone is ok overall 
It has great bass and ok on the rest
The bad:
Tv audio and Apple home is absolutely disappointing experience 
Home pod needs updates in Apple home to start using pod 
It takes all day for this thing to setup
9 hours to update and the pod didn’t show up after update 
After a second try and 9 more hours updating it finally show up in devices. 
Tv speakers are as good on every thing but the bass 
it is very frustrating to use for tv audio 
If your on the fence about this then I would suggest checking out the new Samsung music frame 
Much better for around same price

RogerM,"3 months ago | May 27, 2024 9:26 AM",Apple HomePod Max and Mini speakers are problematic when you have them in a stereo pair — they constantly lose their synchronicity with their paired partner. The only resolution I have found to date is to factory reset and reconfigure. The HomePod max struggles to perform as Apple TV home theater pair in a large space.  I keep all my Apple products up to date on patches - and this unpairing has happened 5 times in a year of ownership.  I yanked them out - and replaced them with Onn Roku speakers until I figure out which product I will replace them with…. But Sonos is looking solidly as a contender.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

Siri is good enough for now, just don't expect to be able to ask it complicated questions. It's better for controlling Apple apps than searching the web, which it will frequently just tell you to ask again on your iPhone.

Overall though, we're very happy with our HomePods. I highly recommend these to anyone who enjoys the Apple ecosystem and is looking for a good sounding smart speaker. Pick up two if you want stereo sound, which sounds much fuller.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

The Homepod 2 definitely brings a nice rich sound with a nice base compared to the mini. The mini is great for small spaces but it lacks the presence of the Homepod 2.

Knowing her love for listening to her iTunes music, I thought it would be a perfect addition to our living room. The ability to seamlessly play her favorite tunes while still being able to use her phone is a game-changer, allowing her to multitask without missing a beat.

I highly recommend the HomePod Second Generation for its amazing sound quality and its seamless integration with Apple devices.

The setup was extremely simple and fast with great intergration into Apple’s ecosystem within the Home app. I really love the look/design of the units as well. The reason for 3 stars is due to a failure of Apple’s software capabilities. I really am disappointed that you cannot set up surround sound capability with more than one speaker set (you can group two HomePods OR two HomePod Mini’s). I had originally purchased two HomePods and two HomePod Mini’s to setup my home theater, and it was a horrible connection process and link to my tv. The unit is great when working with an Apple TV only, but if you want to connect to any external unit that is connected to your tv it loses quality and lack of surround sound makes it very dull. If Apple really wants to up their game in this space to create an audio experience, they need to expand connection capabilities to more than just the Apple TV units, and allow for spatial audio with surround sound support across multiple speaker units.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars

I had a HomePod mini for about a year before this new second generation HomePod was released and I really loved the mini as well, but I just wish it had a better, more powerful sound (though it’s great for its price and size) and I missed out on the full size version before it was discontinued so I was excited when the second generation was announced and immediately got it upon release. I was definitely not disappointed. It, of course, can be used as a home hub and bridge for your home which allows you to control and automate all of your smart home devices and has built in Siri and all of the capabilities that come with it, but it’s also a really good wireless speaker. It has tons of neat technology ti ensure a proper, great sound with deep, rich bass response. It’s great for listening to music or podcasts. You can also pair two together to use for stereo sound, and it can also be used for your tv to replace the speakers in it if paired with another HomePod in stereo mode (an excellent alternative to soundbar or similar setup, especially for those with limited space or those who have their tv wall mounted and don’t have a stand underneath their tv and want to maintain a clean look) compared to other WiFi speakers of the size or price, this is far better-and you also get all the features of Siri as well as the ability to control your smartphone with this, which makes this an absolute bargain tbh.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

If you are in the Apple ecosystem and want something that has incredible sound in a nice-looking package, these are for you. Yes, the price is not cheap, especially if you pair them for use with your Apple TV, which I did. However, you do get incredible sound that will make you wonder how they do it without a dedicated sub. If you like Apple products, you won't be disappointed with these, especially if you pair them. They truly fill the room. The only downsides I have found so far is that you can't change the EQ on them and they won't work with something you need to plug in, such as a turntable. I've found that the auto EQ works for almost everything I have used it for, including music and movies. For my money, they are as good or better than a Sonos or other soundbars, but maybe not as much as as more expensive systems dedicated for Atmos. But at that level, you're spending a lot more and getting something that doesn't look nearly as unobtrusive.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

If the first HomePods are 100%, then these are somewhere between 85-90% as good.  These speakers have two less tweeters (5 instead of 7), which affects the  sound quality a little bit.  The voices are very clear, but they sound as if they come out if the left speaker, as opposed to everywhere.  Sometimes the speakers just stop playing.  It only lasts for a few seconds, but it’s annoying because you have to start the song over at times.  Also, Siri doesn’t hear you as well.  Sometimes you have to speak loudly for Siri to hear you.

At first you want it to be a bit better for the price, but it seems to learn the space and adjust the sound quality and output based on the space overtime so it just keeps getting better. For voice commands it’s very good, as you would expect from Siri. Sometimes it doesn’t get things as correct as Amazon Alexa did. But overall 10 out of 10 would recommend. It does work with Apple, HomeKit, and all smart devices, which is great. I have hue lights everywhere, and I love being able to control them with my HomePod and just by asking Siri to adjust the lights by color Brightness , etc. I do hope Apple improves HomeKit capabilities, and Apple home as it is not terribly intuitive or useful. But that is not to do with the HomePod, which is great.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

If this speaker was between $150-$200 price range, this would easily be a 5 star. If you're looking for a loud speaker with deep bass, this isn't for you. If you like good clarity, and a more balanced sound, then this for you but definitely not worth the price.

I've settled on Apple TV and it's been great but I was still having problems with the soundbar. Enter the HomePod 2nd Gen. I've got two of these paired up with my Apple TV and it does Dolby Atmos and more. For an intelligent surround sound system, it's a home run. These play on the Apple TV with absolute 0 issues - the audio is amazing and fills even the largest room.

The only con I can think of is that you can't link up more than 2 and you can't really adjust the EQ for these on the TV. But I'll take super consistent, great sound, that works anywhere (and automatically readjusts if moved), and has a flawless integration into Apple TV ANYTIME!

I originally purchased just the one and was happy with it since it paired nicely with my Apple TV 4K, but after hearing how much better they would be if you purchased a pair I was easily let down. The only saving graces were that they can be used with ARC with my Apple TV so my PS5 gaming sound was also improved and since they are much smaller than a soundbar it fit nicely with the room I was working with. So if you are expecting Atmos quality speakers with movies these simply are gonna disappointing because the reviews I read said it was possible but it only seems to work with Apple Music.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars

It's a very clean clear sound & bass quality is good but I have heard speakers others brands with a deeper bass. I wish It would work with more than just Apple devices. That's makes no sense why Apple would limit the sells to this speaker to Apple devices only. If the bass was 10% deeper, 5.3 Bluetooth, & worked with other than apple only... this would be a home run. This is a great speaker; but I think a better pricing for it is like $250.

ergodicity,"1 year ago | May 29, 2023 12:20 PM","I’ve had 2 minis for a couple of years, and yes, the homepod 2nd gen is at least 3x better. Its got clearer midrange, and wow, the low end the mini lacks is full and expressive. I got so used to the minis that the lows of the homepod 2nd gen really surprised me — so glad I bought two of them. The high end is even more impressive as it completes the audio spectrum with detail, clarity, and crispness that is completely lacking in the mini. With the same music playing on the mini pair and the homepod pair in two different rooms the difference is blatantly obvious — the homepod pair is so much better. The surround audio is amazing as the 10 tweeters of the homepod pair do an excellent job of expanding the sound stage to a very pleasing degree. I really like that I can have siri, from the homepod, play music for long periods so I don’t have to stream from a device and run down its batteries, or worse, keep it charging and ruining the battery life. I had only two related issues in setting up. My original placement of one of the homepods was appx 4ft directly in front of the wifi router and appx 2ft from a philips hue hub. The home app kept showing that the homekit devices were disconnected a lot of the time. Suspecting wifi interference I moved that homepod to another location far away from the wifi and right next to a blinky light display. The homekit devices were okay then, but the homepod would randomly come on and the volume would go to max. I suspected interference from the blinky lights and moved the homepod at least 8ft away from any electronics. This did it and haven’t had an issue with homekit or audio since. If you’ve got Apple music, a pair of homepods or at least a pair of minis is a very rewarding way to play that music and preserve your devices' battery life — highly recommended.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

And i had trouble syncing my two HomePods because apple wanted me to upgrade to their Family Plan in Apple Music. I was told that you really need to buy TWO HomePods to hear something amazing. NO THANKS! Not spending $600+tax on mediocre speakers. I also have a pair of klipsch R15pm’s with a wireless klipsch subwoofer. This setup blows me away. If you’re an audiophile, then you would enjoy the crisp sound of this setup and it cost me less than $600.

Jared147,"1 year ago | May 26, 2023 11:19 AM","I recently purchased a pair of HomePods to complement my Apple ecosystem at home. I have to admit, the speakers themselves sounded fantastic... when they actually worked. However, the setup process for these speakers was incredibly frustrating.

Initially, the setup was a breeze. However, things took a turn when I decided to upgrade my Apple TV to support eArc for my TV. After performing a factory reset, the HomePods simply refused to set up like they did the first time. I'm not sure if this was due to a new update to the HomeKit, but I had to make around 20 attempts before they finally progressed past the ""Configuring"" stage, which took hours. To resolve the issue, I ended up deleting my HomeKit Home and re-pairing everything, and that seemed to solve the problem for a little while, although it felt like an extreme measure to get these speakers to work.

Another issue I encountered was sound cutting out while playing games or watching movies. This was incredibly frustrating, especially considering that the HomePods were positioned right next to the router and Apple TV. I really wished I could plug in an Ethernet cable or something to avoid using wireless.  Siri is not a great voice assistant sadly for these speakers and would recommend sticking with Alexa instead.

Overall, my initial impression of the HomePods was positive, but it quickly turned into disappointment over time. I ultimately decided to return the HomePods and stick with my Alexa system, which has worked for me for years as my smart speaker. Instead, I invested in a Sonos Arc soundbar, which has been fantastic. While the HomePods may work well for certain home setups, they come with their fair share of quirks and issues to deal with. My recommendation would be to explore alternatives before fully investing in these speakers.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars

Siri will struggle to hear the command once the volume goes above 76% to me this is a deal breaker. But apple HomePod gen 2 could be for you if you’re a human being that cares for your hearing health and only reproduce your content at reasonable levels of volume, making this, the best sounding home speaker that also supports Siri.

Cocooningweb,"1 year ago | May 23, 2023 10:55 PM","I bought a pair of HomePods 2 to connect to an Apple TV 4K after a friend was bragging about how incredible his were. I’m really dissapointed. I have a 7.1 Atmos Soundbar in another room and this is not a replacement for a surround sound system or even a soundbar. Apple has a spatial audio setting that is supposed to enable Dolby Atmos. This is nothing like Dolby Atmos. The sound distinctively comes from either sides and you are lacking a center when watching a movie.  On the positive side, the bass is pretty good, sometime a little too much bass actually. Apple being Apple, there are no settings to adjust the audio frequencies, other than “reduce bass”. I really don’t understand people who rave about these; they must have never had a sound system connected to their TV, in which case, I could understand: the sound is louder, with more bass, but it remains a two-speaker system.",Rated 2 out of 5 stars
PeterC,"1 year ago | May 23, 2023 7:59 PM","As I read through all the glowing reviews, I felt guilty about writing a review leaving only two stars for the Apple Home Pods 2nd Generation.  I generally love Apple Products.  I bought an iMac this year and previously owned another Apple iMac for 10 years.  I really wanted to love these.  And my review is coming after a month or so of trying to correct the issues that I'm having. 

The Home Pods, first of all, and according to my understanding, only work with Apple related products.  But unfortunately, for my setup, they don't even work well with Apple products.  I have an iMac running Ventura.  They connect maybe about 40% of the time and during that 40% of time playing, there is constant loud interference, cutting out, and playing out of sync (I bought two).   I have chatted with customer support and tried to make my way through chat rooms of other people having the same problems.  As of yet, I'm still severely disappointed with these.  

The sound is great when they work.  How I wish they would run smoothly.  I bought two speakers on Amazon (non-Apple related) as a stereo pair.  They never cut out, make weird noises, or play out of sync.  And for two of them, they were less money that one of these.  The sound isn't quite as good as on these HomePod speakers, but the sound is not bad at all.",Rated 2 out of 5 stars

Some of the “smart speaker” features do not work that great. Siri is surely not as useful as Amazon’s Alexa in this way. We replaced our Echo which had a blown out speaker. My kids miss some novelty skills and jokes that Alexa could do. I somewhat miss the verbal shopping lists. This is supposed to work on the HomePod too with having it learn and identify family members by their voice. I simply can’t get it to work right.

One of the standout features of the Homepod is its ability to automatically adjust its sound output to suit the acoustics of the room it's in. This means that no matter where you place it, you can be confident that you'll be getting the best possible sound quality.

In addition to its impressive audio capabilities, the Homepod also boasts a number of convenient features that make it a joy to use. For example, you can control it using your voice through Siri, Apple's intelligent personal assistant. This means that you can play music, set reminders, and even control your smart home devices without ever having to touch your phone.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Homepod to anyone who is looking for a high-quality speaker that delivers amazing sound and offers a range of convenient features. Whether you're a music lover or just looking to enhance your home entertainment system, the Homepod is definitely worth considering.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

So you have to restart them every day multiple times. When it does work it works well but I would not recommend these for that reason. Also the hdmi arc will work but sometimes it doesn’t. The only way I can get it to reconnect is by going into Apple TV setttings and switching from HomePods to tv speakers and back again. Then you have to connect it back to arc. It’s been a problem and I have yet to have a day where they just work. So far this is the only apple product that’s given me this much trouble ever. Also sometimes it will tell me it’s not connected to the internet but still plays. If an update changes this then I will change my review but until then this item is a dud.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars

Sagemaker,"1 year ago | Apr 7, 2023 7:52 PM","My goal with the HomePod2 was to fill a small studio apartment with room filling ambient sound. Unfortunately, the HomePod2 failed in a number of ways. First, the sound of the speaker is too bright for me. Yes, the base is strong and present, but it is too tight and precise for me, also the mids and vocals seem too bright and artificially present. Second, with one HomePod2 the sound has a wide sound stage, but it still feels like a point source. With two HomePods in mono the sound was just too overwhelmingly bright even at low volumes. Something about the way the audio is being processed made listening uncomfortable. Third, when used as a stereo pair, the sound is very impressive and immersive when listening in the sweet spot, but not so great for general walking around. For all that I had heard about the HomePod having immersive room filling sound, I was not impressed. So I returned one and kept the other. I now use the single HomePod2 to augment my existing setup of three other competitive WiFi Airplay speakers. The auto audio adjustment feature of the HomePod2 works well to ""fill in"" for the lack of mid range vocal brightness of my other 3 speakers and enhances the room filling ambient effect I'm trying to create. AirPlay enables all my speakers to play in synchrony, two operating as a stereo pair, and two working in mono. However AirPlay can be frustrating at times because it is still slow to initiate and glitchy at times. With all the money Apple can apply to product and software development, both AirPlay and the HomePod2 should be better.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars

Of course this isn’t multichannel with in-ceiling speakers, but the dynamic range in this little package is mighty impressive.

Just as a note, I bought two of these, to use in stereo mode, for my deck and my bedroom. They are extremely simple to move about.

Treble notes are almost always good on these types of speakers. But, The lows are deep and heart thumping. The mid-range is rich and warm. 

The overall package is a clean, powerful, well-engineered package.

I was honestly quite blown away by the power of this pair.

My day starts a rocking when I kick up the music and work out, get a shower and dance my way into my attire for the day.

These things are simply perfect for their size. 

I love having the smart speaker capability that doesn’t get in the way of beautiful, rich, clean sound!

I’m not just “into the tech.” It is my job. 

I’m an IT Engineer and studied these things, up and down, before committing over, say the Sonos competitive offers.

Yes, to many, other (perhaps cheaper) speakers. Will fit the bill.

I have numerous upper and  high end sound equipment in many rooms. I have been extremely pleased and amzed with original HomePods since first hearing a friends single play in a remote room.  That lead me to do some research and I got a pair... when they just made stereo possible with an IOS update. As good as a single on its own sounds, I found a Stereo Pair is easily 10x+ better. And since these are a true omnidirectional point source, they project a very Full and open sound stage in stereo with all the music properly placed. My first pair quickly became 6 pair through the house.  They coexist with the assorted  high end stuff all over. The hig end gear now tends to collect dust vs play. HomePod's full sound plus voice or phone control with Apple Music is oh so easy.  Now I play music so much more as I have renewed passion for music thanks  the easy of use. No need to power on multiple devices and search for proper material on shelves or drawers to hear.  Everything can be streamed and via WiFi vs compressed Blue Tooth. That makes a huge deference in sound quality.  Especially with Apples lossless music. All in one higher end sound w/o all the addition gear, cords, software, and real-estate/furniture to place it all required. I just bought 1'st pair of Gen 2's, so now have 7 pair. I've been comparing OE vs Gen 2 as I break them in.  Impressions so far are the differences are not huge. Gen 2 seems a bit more open and clean with a slightly tighter bass (IMHO). I'd say the OE's go just a tad lower, but the bass is not as tight. I was able to get low but measurable output with 20 Frequency generator on OE's ( gen 1). That was amazing for their size and drivers. Gen 2s' did same  at about 30 Hz  which is still very amazing and impressive. Gen ones are still grand & I Iove them. What I found to date with some varied source material -so far is- 60 % of the time I preferred the new Gen 2's, 30% the OE/Gen 1's, and 10% itr was a draw. DO NOT view HomePods as a pricey speaker. Pricey speakers require a lot of pricey gear to make them work. View HomePods as Complete upper end ALL IN ONE sound system package. Nothing but your iPhone and a music script required (which you already have)... preferably Apple Music as it's Lossless and can be voce controlled to the pod vs need an phone.  You only need to plug it into an outlet & your done.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Much stronger than the smaller ones that have been out.  (I have a few of those) I put this in every room that I can and the sound fills the room.

MichaelD,"1 year ago | Mar 17, 2023 7:32 PM","First time with a HomePod (two as stereo pair), but been a Mac guy for 30 years. Wanted to replace my bit cumbersome stereo system with a speaker system that both had auto adjustment for room ambient conditions and also a speaker with good response from low to high frequencies that didn't require a separate sub-woofer. 
   Setting up the two HomePods as a stereo pair was a bit pricey (as to the 4 stars instead of 5), but audio-wise they perform well and have surprisingly good bass response, at least to my older ears. Bass, in music and movies sounds quite solid. As to the high end around 16khz, tough to hear after 60+ years...maybe somebody younger can give an opinion:-).

Scottonamission,"1 year ago | Mar 17, 2023 4:14 PM","I had two of the original HomePods. They were used independently and sounded amazing by themselves and still do to this day.

When I purchased the Gen 2, I was quite disappointed as they didn't sound as good to me. While the engineers addressed peoples' complaints that the high end of the spectrum...they did it at the cost of the middle-end tones in Gen 2.

I took a gamble and decided to buy a second Gen 2 HomePod and it changed EVERYTHING. Honestly, when I paired them both as a stereo pair...OMG...They sound AMAZING!

Like gamechanger amazing. Well worth the money for a high-end desk setup or a bedroom TV when connected to an AppleTV 4K. 

That said, I don't think they sound good enough to replace a full soundbar setup for the main TV.

Overall, as an Apple ecosystem person, these speakers do what Apple does best...they just work and they create an amazing Apple experience.

Now, if Apple can improve Siri, we're all good.

I know most wireless speaker systems add signal processing to help the audio “fit” their speaker better.  This was horrible.  Low end was way over powering.  Top end was thin and distorted even at low volumes.  I’ll put it this way.  You will get better sound quality out of a Wonderboom 3.  Which I returned it for.

Akson,"1 year ago | Feb 14, 2023 5:39 PM","I purchased two HomePods to use them as a pair stereo speakers for my Apple tv and PS5. The sound is really really good. The level of quality and detail when watching movies and playing games is a great experience..When they work!!..I got them on release day and I’ve been using them everyday as my main audio speakers for my tv.  After the first week of no issues now they are causing problems. There are times where one speaker stops working with the Siri Remote, so when you use the volume controls only one will work making the sound unbalanced. I tried working through it with Apple and their customer service are completely incompetent and have no idea how the HomePod the even works. One of the supposed “geniuses” even asked me where did I purchased the Apple Tv as if where I buy their devices has anything to do with the HomePods not working. In conclusion they never figured out the fix and I had to figure it out on my own, but the audio problem has happened twice already since I’ve had them. Im still on the return period and Im very much considering returning them. This problem has been mentioned by people on the past with the Gen 1 HomePods and Apple still hasn’t cared to fix it but still charge a premium for this half baked speakers.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars

justmeeeeeee,"1 year ago | Feb 13, 2023 11:47 AM","I know there's been many glowing reviews of the new HomePod and some not as glowing. 

Here are my thoughts, the sound is great, there' a solid bass sound out of it. The form factor is nice, it's smaller than a device like the Echo Studio. The built in Tenmp/Humidity sensors are a nice addition. It has that solid Apple build look and quality to it.

Now, would I add a second for stereo sound, probably not. For the price of two I'd go for something like the Sonos Arc which I think has better overall quality and sound. The ability to have two HomePods connected to an Apple TV is a great option, but again at that price I think Sonos would be better for a few dollars more. Plus, if you use them for TV sound you're stuck always being in the Apple universe for all your TV watching. The other issue at least for me, Apple doesn't integrate with SiriusXM or Spotify, to start either of those services you'll need to go to your device and can't simply say ""Hey Siri play Spotify/Play Yacht Rock on SiriusXM""

If you're in love with Apple, you'll of course love this, if you're familiar with many of the other smart speaker options, I am not sure you'll see that big of a difference for the cost. (now if it dropped by $50 I think it'd be the ideal price point) I would recommend it for those deeply into the Apple Ecosystem/Apple Home setup. If you're not and more in the Nest/Echo ecosystem then you may be disappointed.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars

I recently purchased the Apple HomePod (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker with Siri in Midnight and I am very impressed with it. The sound quality is excellent and it is very easy to use. The setup was a breeze and the voice recognition is spot on. I love that I can ask Siri to play music, set reminders, and answer questions. The sound is clear and the bass is deep and powerful. I also appreciate the fact that it is compatible with Apple Music and AirPlay 2, so I can stream my music from my iPhone or Mac. The design is sleek and modern and the midnight color is beautiful.

HonestRating,"1 year ago | Feb 5, 2023 7:48 AM","This speaker is superb. I bought two, one alone is great sound, Apple did a great job on filling the room with sound, the bass, its deep and rich, and it doesnt sound muddy, it sounds full and immersive. Now if you pair it with another speaker, wow, its just even better. It really does fill the room with sound, it sounds like you have speakers right behind you and to the left and right of you, but these speakers are best if you are with Apple’s ecosystem, of course. That is an Appple iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, or Mac. Unfortunately it’s not bluetooth compatible, but you can play it via airplay which works like a charm. Watching movies and shows with this is amazing, I own two mini homepods and connect the two pairs together with my new HomePod pair to get a full “surrounding sound”—though its but there in terms of surround sound system, because Apple has not officially built the concept yet with the HomePods and Mini HomePods but Apple does a fine job of having all the HomePod sync together without a lag.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

JoeXG,"1 year ago | Feb 4, 2023 8:41 AM","I’ve got a pair of these, four feet apart (per apple’s recommendation), about five inches from a wall, mounted on shelves that are barely bigger than the HomePod’s base. In that position, they’re able to project a dome of surround sound through my bedroom, which sounds incredibly immersive when you’re in the center of the room. Even outside of the sweet spot, it still sounds delightful. It’s very impressive to hear no noticeable volume dropoff on sounds that move frok the center channel to around the back — something that more expensive setups with rear surround speakers struggle with in between speakers. Plus, audio is beautifully balanced and detailed. Ive always been one to use headphones, because the details you can hear with them is much greater than speakers are usually capable of producing. But the advanced computational audio Apple has is second to none, and manages to draw headphone-level detail out of speakers that effortlessly rivals my $400 set. I’d heard the original HomePod, but never got one because of the price. I’m so glad I could afford them this time, because they’re going to be with me for many years.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Realist,"1 year ago | Feb 3, 2023 11:17 PM","I bought these as a preorder and well…

Getting them setup in the home app was easy once my phone was updated.  Setting them up as a pair was fairly smooth too.  That’s where the issues begin.

Even though the speakers were setup as a stereo pair, my Apple TV 4K refused to set them as a default audio for the device.  After rebooting the device I was notified that they needed to be updated to 16.3, so why is apple shipping these things with an incompatible OS? 

Even after updating though, I still had to fight with them to be able to use them with my Apple TV.  I even tried resetting the Apple TV, but that didn’t even fix the issue.  

Anyway, after about 2 hours with fighting with them, they finally decided to cooperate and they’re now the default speakers.  

So, how do they sound?  Honestly, they sound fairly similar to the Sonos Arc, but you can at least add a sub to the Sonos.  They’re not as clean as the Bose 900 though.  So, I can’t honestly say who these make sense for.  

At $600 a pair, there’s only $100 that separates this from the Bose 900, and that can be expanded to a much more complete system.  It also sounds better under most situations.  

The speakers do sound nice though and if you were thinking about grabbing an Arc and nothing else, then this is definitely a better value for the money and the sound profile is very similar. 

I have the Bose, so these are likely going back, but I would certainly have kept these if Apple made a wireless sub for them.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

Highly recommend them!,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
