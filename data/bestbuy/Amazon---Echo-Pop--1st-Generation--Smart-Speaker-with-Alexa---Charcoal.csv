**Review:**

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - I recently purchased the Amazon Echo Pop (1st Generation) in the stunning Midnight Teal color from Best Buy, and I must say, it's been an absolute game-changer for my home setup. Here's why it deserves every bit of its five-star rating:

**Design and Aesthetics:** The Midnight Teal finish is not just a color; it's a statement. It blends seamlessly with my modern decor, adding a touch of elegance that you wouldn't expect from a smart speaker. The design is sleek, compact, and unobtrusive, making it perfect for any room without dominating the space.

**Sound Quality:** For its size, the Echo Pop delivers surprisingly robust sound. The bass is deep enough for music, and the clarity during calls or podcasts is impressive. It's not just about volume; it's about the quality of sound that fills the room evenly, making every listening experience enjoyable.

**Alexa's Capabilities:** Alexa has never been more responsive. With the Echo Pop, voice commands are recognized with high accuracy, even from across the room. The integration with other smart home devices is flawless. I've linked it with my lights, thermostat, and even my coffee machine, creating a morning routine that feels like magic.

**Customization and Features:** The ability to customize Alexa's wake word, set up routines, and even change the color of the light ring adds a personal touch. The built-in Zigbee hub is a hidden gem, simplifying the setup of smart home devices without needing additional hubs. This feature alone saves space and reduces clutter.

**Value for Money:** Priced competitively, especially with Best Buy's deals, the Echo Pop offers incredible value. It's not just a speaker; it's a hub for entertainment, information, and home automation. The cost-effectiveness, combined with its performance, makes it a must-have for anyone looking to dip their toes into smart home technology or expand their existing setup.

**Customer Service and Warranty:** Best Buy's service was top-notch, with quick delivery and easy setup assistance over the phone. Knowing Amazon's reputation for customer support, any potential issues would be handled swiftly, adding peace of mind to my purchase.

In conclusion, the Amazon Echo Pop in Midnight Teal is not just a smart speaker; it's a stylish, efficient, and delightful addition to any home. It seamlessly integrates into your life, making everyday tasks simpler and more enjoyable. If you're on the fence about smart home devices, this Echo Pop will not only push you over but make you wonder how you managed without it. Highly recommended!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Caliph,"1 week ago | Aug 29, 2024 3:01 PM","I love my Alexa but there are some features that Amazon should improve. For example, there should be capabilities to optimize your alarms and you should be able to delete alarm songs you no longer want in the list. This is kind of an archaic feature that’s simple and we should be able to do. Otherwise works great and helps with daily tasks and organization.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

averageguy,"2 months ago | Jun 26, 2024 4:55 PM","I have purchased  10 recently in all of the colors ( 2 green 2 purple, 4 white, 2 grey of these units for use around my house. I got most of them when they were on an incredible sale around the holidays, and 2 later after deciding the guest bathroom and basment bathrooms needed one. I already had one device for about a year and liked it a lot, and have 2 other echo product in my house (one in every room). They work really well together and the app is easy to use to create listening groups.  The sound on these is very respectable with good crisp sound and music sounds good. I have several streaming services linked and all works well with my amazon account.  I also have a eero mesh system and these work to blend in and expand the 5ghz side of the network.  That is what tilted my decision to get more of these. I have an excellent wifi network, but this gets the 5ghz band better coverage outside of my house now also since I have more of these on the edges of my house.  I can get better coverage in my garage and on the back porch and in my shed also.  Compared to other speakers of this size with the same features (smart or not smart, amazon or not amazon) value and function wise, these are on par with competators.  I reccomend these.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MckenzieJ,"3 months ago | Jun 9, 2024 12:05 PM","I’ve had this echo pop for a few months now and it has just gotten increasingly worse. I thought at first it was because she was new and my old echo dot was 4 years old before she wore out. This Echo Pop has continuously gone downhill to now where she doesn’t even listen. I can say her name multiple times directly to her with no background noise and she never lights up, or if she does—it’s a few minutes later after I’ve given up and her blue light just stays on, semi-pulsing with not even an “I’m sorry I didn’t get that.” The only time she lets me know she didn’t hear me is when I wasn’t even talking to her and said nothing remotely close to Alexa. I thought she was too close to the tv when we first moved but it wasn’t any different, now she’s further away from the tv and closer to the wall between her and the wifi modem and she’ll says she’s having trouble connecting to the internet—but only every now and then when she never moves. I wish I could have enough examples of her answering questions for me to even comment on her search capabilities. I’ve always used my Alexa’s excessively for timers and I’ll ask her how much longer is left on any given timer and 8/10 times there’s not a timer going even after she confirmed it nearly 10 minutes prior. She will light up sometimes when you talk to her then the light just goes off with no answer, nothing. If she says “ I didn’t get that, tell me again” her light goes OFF so you can’t even continue you have to restart. This is the worst Alexa I’ve ever had and I paid double what I have before for a “new” one and I’m truly disappointed.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

JavierBM,"7 months ago | Feb 7, 2024 12:58 AM","Hey everyone,

I recently got my hands on the Amazon Echo Pop 2023 Gen 1, and I’ve been putting it through its paces over the past few weeks. Given its position as a budget-friendly entry in the Echo lineup, I wasn’t sure what to expect. However, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by what this little device can do. Here’s my take on it, breaking down the pros and cons for anyone considering adding it to their smart home setup.

The Good Stuff

 • Price Point: First off, the affordability of the Echo Pop is a huge plus. It’s great to see Amazon offering an option that makes smart home tech more accessible to everyone.
 • Design: It’s small and unobtrusive, fitting perfectly on my nightstand and kitchen counter. Plus, the eco-friendly approach to materials is a nice touch.
 • Sound Quality: Considering its size, the sound is pretty good! It’s been my go-to for background music and daily news briefings.
 • Alexa at Your Service: The seamless integration with Alexa means I can manage my smart home, get updates, and do a lot more, all hands-free.
 • Eco-friendly: The use of recycled materials in its design is something I really appreciate, aligning with my efforts to make more sustainable choices.

Not So Great

 • Sound Limitations: While it’s decent for casual listening, the sound quality doesn’t blow me away. It lacks the depth you’d get from a higher-end speaker.
 • Features: Understandably, to keep the cost down, it misses out on some of the fancier features of its pricier siblings.
 • Connectivity Issues: I’ve had a few hiccups getting it to stay connected to my Wi-Fi, which can be a bit frustrating.
 • Voice Recognition: It doesn’t always catch what I say on the first try, especially if I’m not right next to it or if there’s background noise.

Final Thoughts

The Amazon Echo Pop 2023 Gen 1 is a solid choice for anyone looking to dip their toes into the smart home world without spending a lot of money. It’s a competent device that covers the basics well, offering a lot of value for its price. While it won’t satisfy audiophiles or those looking for high-end features, it’s a fantastic option for everyday use.

I’m really enjoying having it as part of my home, and I think it’s a great way for anyone to get started with smart speakers. Just keep in mind its limitations, and you won’t be disappointed.

Would I recommend it? Absolutely, especially if you’re new to smart speakers or if you’re looking for an affordable way to expand your existing setup.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

The sound quality is very good.  I prefer the design of the older model (flat circular) but perhaps the directional sounds works better with the new design.  The algorithym behind the system is a bit spooky - you are indeed being listened to at all times, and it has a tendency to turn itself on somewhat haphazardly.  Probably not a good choice for people who talk in their sleep.

DaleKentucky,"11 months ago | Oct 2, 2023 6:18 AM","In fairness I have to say that I received this 1st gen Echo Dot as part of a Best Buy TV purchase - I did NOT purchase the Dot outright - basically it was a free thing to me.  Having said that I thought I might use it via Bluetooth as an external speaker for the TV.  I really don't have a use for the Alexa voice control function thats offered with the Dot.  Plan on having to download and install the Alexa app to ""install"" this Dot to your TV.  That seems to be necessary even if all you want is the Bluetooth speaker function.  The sound quality is OK - not super but certainly better than the stock speaker setup on the small flatscreen FireTV I just purchased.  The small downward facing speakers in the TV function but the sound quality isn't the best (especially if you are older like me and are having some hearing issues).  This Dot improved the sound some.....    Are there better Bluetooth speaker solutions -- ABSOLUTELY!!!    But, as noted in the first part of this review the Dot was basically FREE to me and who doesn't like free.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars
