XenoCain,"3 weeks ago | Aug 13, 2024 4:57 PM","I love all my other Nest products, but this thing is absolutely useless! I bought this months ago and finally set it up. Unfortunately, I'm past the return window or I would return it. It can't do anything effectively. 

The interface is awful, the search search system crashes all the time, the screen times out and doesn't save where you left off, you can't jump between apps or 'background' anything and come back to it, hardly any apps are available for it. I don't understand what Google's goal for this product is if it can't at least do what a phone or tablet can.

I can't think of a single good reason to buy this product. I would have been way better off just buying a tablet and a stand for it.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

Villageanne,"1 month ago | Aug 5, 2024 3:09 PM",Last Christmas I replaced both our daughters Google Home Hub with the Google Max. Last week I replaced my husbands and I also purchased myself one.  The Google MAX does so much more than the smaller Google Hub. It has a camera and microphone making it easy to chat live with the Grandkids. I am still learning what all it do but I’ve learned that I can have Google find just about anything quicker than I can open an APP. Google even opens YouTube to my specified music or video.  I love it. My husband uses his in bedroom for an alarm clock.  I use mine mostly in living room studying.  It is more expensive than the home hub but goes on sale making it affordable. It is larger and more attractive in both rooms.,Rated 4 out of 5 stars

Simba,"1 month ago | Jul 30, 2024 12:31 PM","The Nest Hub Max is like having a helpful assistant in your home. This charcoal-colored smart display fits nicely in most rooms and does a lot more than you might expect. The 10-inch screen is crisp and clear, great for watching recipes while cooking or checking your calendar. Video calls are a breeze - just say ""Hey Google, call Mom"" and you're connected. The camera quality is good, making it easy for friends and family to see you clearly. Sound-wise, it's impressive for its size. The built-in speakers and subwoofer pump out decent audio, whether you're listening to music or watching videos. Google Assistant is the star here. It responds quickly to voice commands, helping you set timers, control smart home devices, or get quick answers to questions. On the downside, privacy might be a concern for some. There's a camera and microphone involved, though you can turn these off. Also, while it's not cheap, it offers good value for what it does.
Keep in mind, you'll get the most out of this if you're already using Google services or have other smart home devices.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

MattA,"3 months ago | Jun 1, 2024 8:39 PM","I got this item after purchasing several google home cameras, a google nest thermostat and a google nest doorbell. It is customizable with pictures and the google voice assitant. It is great for hands free voice commands and even has the option for video calls. The only option for videocalls is through google duos though and my only critique is that it doesnt offer any other option for videocalls, like facebook messenger, because barely anyone uses google duos. It also has much better sound quality than I expected and at max volume can be heard anywhere in my 1500 sqft home. The coolest feature, in my opinion, is that it was say who is at your door based on the saved faces in the google app. It will also show you the doorbell video when someone rings it so you dont have to pull it up on your phone and can use the microphone feature from the hub. Its also touch screen so you dont need to use voice commands all the time. I use it mainly for pulling up YouTube videos or playing music on Spotify while I cook or clean because i have it placed on the counter of my kitchen. I think the price is about $50 higher than it should be but if you have spare cash and lots of google home devices(or devices that work with google assistant) it is worth getting as a way of bring you google devices together with a hands free control hub.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

I've had the 2nd gen (smaller) hub for a few years now, and knew I wanted a larger version for our kitchen as we have the perfect island for it now. This tech - although I admit is not NECESSARY for every day life, definitely adds convenience to the kitchen. I cook all of our meals, so it's a great place to have my recipe's up instead of on my phone. I also play music and podcasts on it for the home and the speaker is excellent. If I had to nitpick, I wish it had the ability to run multiple tasks - for example, I wish I could run youtube in the corner as I have a recipe taking up most of the real estate. Sadly, it's one function at a time. But, I knew that coming into the purchase.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

I have to say that it has exceeded my expectations on every level.  It responds quickly to commands, sounds great and it doesn't show me any advertising like Amazon products.  I just have a couple of suggestions for improving on it.

1. Put a physical camera cover on it like the ones on the newer Amazon Show devices.  I ended up buying a physical camera cover and sticking it to the product.  It works well enough but it would have been nice if I didn't have to buy anything to shutter the camera.
2. The Google Home app isn't very straightforward.  I am still trying to work out how to connect all of my lights and plugs to it and get it to work for both this Hub and my smaller Google Hub that I use as my bedroom clock.

It's main focus is to control all devices in the nest home and does it very well over wifi and Bluetooth connection. 

For entertainment purposes, apps my mom and I like to use such as YouTube to watch when we're doing stuff in the kitchen or in the living room to keep us occupied are very nice. The overall look is very nice with the charcoal stand being a nice undertone to the white screen. 

Also, it operates as a mini camera as well when you want to monitor things in the house, which if you have a disabled family member or something to that effect, will help a lot. 

It's an all-you-can-do hub and I think it's a must-buy. The 7"" I believe would have been too small so go for the hub while on sale now!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

TechUser,"10 months ago | Nov 4, 2023 9:37 AM","Just average for the price.  I purchased it for $60 off retail only to have it go on sale 5 weeks later for $100 discount.  It is a bit slow.  The photo frame often malfunctions and I must reset the device to get it to work.  It displayed the temperature when I first set it up and within a week the temperature disappeared from the display.  I have tried every online tip without success.   I have reset it multiple times, updated it and factory reset it.  My smaller Nest Hub has worked well.  The MAXhas been frustrating.

DonaldM,"10 months ago | Oct 22, 2023 2:05 PM","I have three of these things in my house. They make an ok clock radio and run through my favorite photos ok. Once in a while it will be helpful in the kitchen. I live in a large house and am slightly disabled.  I bought them in anticipation of having some surgeries. Combined with a Google Doorbell thing, I figured that would work for when I couldnt get around too well. (By the way... How about letting us choose a name for the thing first of all?  ""Hey Google"" is just dumb. Make it personal)  I still haven't gotten the video cameras to work. They never worked with my doorbells nor my video cameras. They were installed by your people.  Also stop forcing people to go online to find instruction manuals.  Hard copy is so much better.  Use recycled paper if that's your concern.  I think it cost more electricity to look up something online than referencing a page that's dog-eared (for young people, dog-earing means folding a corner of a page in a real book to mark something you want to find again without having to re-read the whole book). Let people customize the name and the voice of the robot talking back to us.  I would love Samual L Jackson's voice or Morgan Freeman's voice.  That would at least make it fun (you're welcome for the free idea).  Please stop making stuff too cute to function. Some people don't appreciate spending hours programing everything.  How about an ""ON/OFF BUTTON"" that gives you everything and let the customer remove or turn off what we don't use? Not everyone is a programmer or has a 9 year old around to set up programs, even though most kids are more savvy than the Geek people I've met (no offense) .  Make NESTS more useful for the disabled.  You're eliminating a lot of potential customers by assuming we are all 16 and strapped to a video game.  For all the money this company is making, one would think far reliable value would be attainable.  Do Better!  You'll make more money that way.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars

When not in use I love how aesthetically pleasing it is and the fact that it is a digital picture frame for My favorite family photos and video clips. Also I'm one of those people that ""forget"" to take my clothes out of the dryer at night so when my alarm goes off on my hub in the morning I can tell it to start my dryer to get the wrinkles out and then tell it to start my Keurig so I can have the motivation to get out of the bed.

SteveK,"11 months ago | Sep 29, 2023 7:05 PM","The Nest Hub Max Smart Display with Google Assistant is like having a personal comedian and butler rolled into one! This device has brought the future to my living room, and it's packed with more sass than a stand-up comedy show.

First of all, let's talk about its size. It's like a mini flatscreen TV, and it stares at me with its all-knowing eye (the camera). I sometimes feel like I'm in a sci-fi movie, talking to my very own robot overlord. But it's a benevolent overlord, as long as you don't ask it to sing ""Daisy Bell.""

The Google Assistant is a real joker. I asked it to tell me a joke, and it replied with, ""Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"" I couldn't help but chuckle, even though I'm pretty sure it's plotting world domination behind that screen.

And the Nest Hub Max is a multitasking wizard. It can show me recipes, play my favorite songs, and even display my security camera footage. It's like a Swiss Army knife for my home, except it doesn't have a corkscrew (yet).

The camera raises some interesting questions. It's like having a nosy neighbor who always knows what's going on. But it's also great for video calls. I told it to call my friend, and it said, ""Which one? The one who never answers or the one who talks too much?"" It knows me too well!

But be warned, it's a bit of a tattletale. I asked it to remind me to exercise, and it said, ""Shouldn't you be doing that already?"" Ouch, Google, that hurts.

In all seriousness, the Nest Hub Max is a fantastic addition to any smart home. It's smart, funny, and sometimes a little cheeky. Just don't ask it to tell you any more ""dad jokes"" unless you're ready to laugh and groan at the same time.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

However, Google Assistant has been the best voice assistant on the market so far.this is greatly due to the natural voice understanding that Google has. There is no need to say things, monotonous or robotically to a voice assistant like Siri or Alexa, because Google is able to understand natural language, and what you are asking of it. It’s many great functions and compatibility with Google Calendar and other task are an awesome addition to the house and a great help when you’re living a busy life",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Rymmkay,"1 year ago | Jun 2, 2023 9:09 PM","Every Google device I've ever bought has one if not multiple problems with basic functionality. The Nest Hub Max drops connection all the time when every other device in the house runs smoothly. Half the Meet calls have black screens. The Zoom calling they just rolled out doesn't even start and never has. When you go to the trouble shooting forums, Google is ""Aware of the problem and are working on it."" for years on end. They are coasting on their name. As soon as they have your money they don't care if your product actually works.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

LaurelK,"1 year ago | May 15, 2023 5:28 PM","Everything we have in our home is Google. Including four Chromecast TV, 6 mini speakers and a small Google nest for our kitchen. This new nest hub Max frustrates me because we bought it in December and no one ever mentioned that they would be sunsetting duo so we tried to set them up to video call family out of state, and it keeps asking for duo. Well, the replacement for Duo is Google meet. Which requires a big long meeting number that then shows up on your screen. And how are you supposed to copy and paste that by voice? If you're trying to talk to someone? These were supposed to be so you could just say hey Google video call Grandma and it would be a video call. But it just tells you to make sure they have duo. And duo is obsolete. So it then tells you to look at your screen and you get a big giant two line text and number reservation for a meet call. One. I've done meat calls on my phone, I have to copy paste and put it in a text or an email to send it to the recipient. They have to open their email and click on it to join a meeting. A tiny bit complicated for younger children or older seniors. This was supposed to be a way to have a video call as they advertise in all of their media. It is absolutely and yet I paid $349 for it and we have two in our home. One on each floor. Absolutely ludicrous. We have pixel phones. If we wanted to call somebody and hold it in our hand we just call them on the phone. But you cannot call by talking to your Google Max hub because duo is no longer available and meet requires a big, complicated step that has to be sent. It can't just be vocalized. So angry and so frustrated that I spent all this money on these when doesn't even work!",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

Spiritwind,"1 year ago | May 5, 2023 1:56 PM","After nearly 3 years of ownership, I can say that I would not recommend this product to anyone.  We spent nearly $280 after tax on this electronic that is one step away from being garbage.  Its responsive when it does not need to be, and not responsive when you need it.  This problem was worsened with the latest big update where they redid the entire OS from scratch.  The home app is also riddled with bugs, especially if you are removing or adding new items over time.

One of the big selling points to us was the built in security camera.  Sadly, this camera has been plagued with blank spots where it recorded nothing for 30+ minute stretches since ownership.  It has progressively gotten worse, and now will go days without recording if we don't keep an eye on it.  We have the Nest Hub premium subscription, and its just nice to know that even though we pay monthly, this isn't recording anything half the time.  

For the price you are paying, something should be expected to last, and not have issues with constant problems.  Google, you really blotched this one.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

It drops my Nest cam livestream constantly, and even says it is not available for 10 minutes at a time when it clearly is on the Google Home phone app, or the Nest app. It doesn't understand reasonable commands related to operation when asking to open things that are titled exactly that on the device. The initial interface is.....dumb. Weird, not clearly marked pull down / out menus from all directions and clunky navigation make it more annoying. I also find it strange the the device camera won't work if viewing another camera. Not a deal breaker there, but it won't record to the cloud service for as long as viewing.",Rated 2 out of 5 stars

I saved a year to buy the Max due to it's larger size (and much larger cost) than the regular Google nest hub, to use as master control/communication center from my kitchen. I  I am close to having a Google mini speaker, hub, lights in each room to help me and my senior parents with added accessibility, safety and information and for the most part it's great. But it really needs more direct app features such as ways to open Google photos directly, actually search and use YouTube easier, be able to access Google apps and use Netflix and other included apps directly instead of having to stream from phone. It's also more difficult to save and access recipes than expected which was one of the main reasons to pay more for the Max vs the much cheaper Google Nest hub.  Hopefully Google will get it together soon!",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

Navynuke93,"1 year ago | Dec 25, 2022 6:40 AM","This smart display has been nothing but amazing. I currently have it set up to be my main listening google product and I've had no issues. I setup quick phrases so that I dont need to say ""hey Google"" for things like turning on the lights and asking about the weather. It also can recognize my face so that when i look at it, I can ask it anything without saying ""hey Google"" first. The last major thing I setup was its capability to be an indoor security Cam. Currently Its set so thar when Im home, that feature is disabled, but when I'm away, it turns on. Overall, very happy with this product.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Only problem was, they would often climb up along their play pen, just to get a better view of the videos playing. But with the Max, that changed instantly — now they watch from anywhere in the play pen, thanks to the three extra inches. Not to mention this doubles as a camera, so now we can step away and check on them with the Nest or Home apps. Overall, I recommend it!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Once I set it up realized it didn’t so the next day I returned it, but before I did that I had it overnight and it tracked my sleep which I loved! I didn’t have to do anything it just did it. So I returned it and got the Nest Hub Max because I thought, being more expensive, it would have everything including the sleep tracker. To my surprise, again, it doesn’t! Now I’m just annoyed at those facts. I want the sleep tracker and the camera! But I don’t need two, I’m renting a room so there’s no point for me of having both. Neat Hub Max should be able to do what the cheaper one does, I think. Anyways that’s my rant.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars

Gopackchris,"1 year ago | Nov 5, 2022 2:39 PM","Unit was very easy to setup.  This is my second Google Home.  This one I'm using as a Hub for many different items.  I have 2 Nest cameras, a Nest Thermostat, 3 Nest Smoke Detectors, a water sensor and smart plug.  This is all installed in a second vacation home.  We really wanted a hub unit that would Bluetooth to the items instead of using the minimal bandwidth we have at the house.  Everything works really well through the unit and connects to the Home app well.  I was even able to have a second account in the app just for the vacation home.  I don't really use the unit for anything else.  Just as a Hub.  Way better than the Smartthings Hub.  Just give up and get into bed with Google or Amazon because both of them have made things work.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

It can also understand more conversational phrases and accept multiple similar commands at once, such as turning off backyard and garage lights. Was a little slow initially in response, but seems to have improved. My only complaint is that it is difficult to use. For example, I use it in the kitchen. I intended for my family of four - two adults and two children to be able to add things to the shopping list, but I am not able to get it to recognize everyone's voices and be able to add groceries needed to one shopping list.

Mach1,"2 years ago | Aug 10, 2022 3:47 PM","The Nest Cam Battery is an indoor and outdoor camera that can be used completely without any wires. One could use the Nest Cam with the provided power cable if desired. Everything needed to install including screws and screw anchors needed to mount the camera are included.

Before any of the physical installation is performed, you will need to download the Google Home app onto your phone and scan the QR code that comes with the NestCam to set it up with your existing Wi-Fi connection and your smartphone. It is a good idea to physically place the Nest Cam in the location you will install it and confirm that you have a good Wi-Fi signal, and that video quality is going to be good.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Overall probably the best home assistant out there. The Alexa app is easier to use than the Google Home app. And having to say ""Hey/OK Google"" to wake it is annoying; Alexa gives the user a few options (Alexa, Amazon, Computer, Ziggy). It is pricier than the Echo Show 8, but the sound is better, build quality is better, and voice commands work better.

But how you store your recipes are clunky, you can't easily get to them outside of the hub, and you can't categorize or search inside the google cookbook. So if you have hundreds of saved recipes you have to scroll through to find the one you want. Lastly, you can't save your own recipes. I tried Google Keep which will open the recipe, but it will not read you the recipe. I hope they work on making this feature better because in concept it is great, but poorly executed.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

Facial recognition is a double edged sword and trades off privacy for greater functionality. Since we already had facial recognition enabled on several nest cams, we opted in. You’ll need to decide whether you want an always on camera present in your house.
