Gladys,"1 month ago | Aug 5, 2024 6:02 PM","I used to own the Google Home Mini 1st Gen for a few years until recently. Compared to those, I can confidently say that the audio from the Google Nest Hub 2nd Gen sounds significantly better. Since it's still the same google assistant, it didn't get any smarter or anything. I faced the same issues that I did previously, but at least the screen would provide some information rather than it annoyingly sending a link it found to my phone. Speaking of the screen, it's really nice despite it being small. It being small is advantageous since I like having my smart device sitting by the window next to my bed. I feel the 10"" one wouldn't have fit as well. If you haven't touched the sceen in a while, it's laggy but once it gets going, it moves at a sufficient speed. I talk to it more than I touch the interface so it's not an issue I run into too often. I wish I could download apps onto the device, or remove some of them since I don't use Sling. It's a bit hard to use youtube on it as well. It's nice that it's easy to cast to it. I often cast twitch steams or audiobooks to it and it works out really well. It makes calls easily, and it can be helpful for routines or controlling your smart home. It's sleep sensing is surprisingly really good. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and if you use the sleep sensing, I recommend that you download google fit so that you can view your sleep data easier. The sleep sensing on the google nest was able to provide pretty much the same data as my galaxy watch 7 when it came to detecting sleep. It might not be that interesting, but I thought it was cool since the google nest uses motion sensing rather than making direct contact with my body while I sleep. 
You can also search websites on the nest hub, but I wouldn't recommend it since it would be slower than on your phone, and it doesn't really have much of a practical use, at least to me anyway. All in all, I really like this device. It's nice being able to control the dim of my light from my bed, but without having to pick up my phone. Sometimes I don't feel like speaking to start some routines, so the touch interface and gestures are appreciated. I thought google was getting rid of the sleep sensing, but somehow it still isn't gone yet. (Hopefully I haven't jinxed it) 
I'd happily recommend this device to anybody, even if they aren't crazy invested into a smart home. I just wouldn't say that it's worth it at full price. Definitely wait for a sale.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Monika,"1 month ago | Jul 14, 2024 7:54 AM","I recently purchased the Google Nest Hub from Best Buy, and I am thoroughly impressed with its performance and features. The setup process was straightforward, and within minutes, I had it up and running. The integration with my other smart home devices was seamless, making it a central hub for controlling everything from lights to security cameras.

The display quality is outstanding, providing clear visuals for photo slideshows, recipe instructions, and video calls. The voice recognition is highly accurate, and Google Assistant responds quickly to commands. I especially appreciate the ambient EQ feature, which adjusts the screen brightness according to the room's lighting, making it easy on the eyes.

The sound quality is better than expected for a device of its size, making it suitable for casual music listening or podcasts. I also love the ability to watch YouTube videos and use it as a digital photo frame with Google Photos integration.

Overall, the Google Nest Hub has exceeded my expectations, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their smart home experience. Best Buy's customer service was excellent, and the purchase process was smooth and hassle-free.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

So far it doesn’t do much with the security system and it has a male voice that I haven’t found out how to change. I do like the way it connects to my tv, but you have to be Very Specific in your instructions. I only found this out when I was “hey googling” it, and the tv started responding. Very frustrating in the beginning. As I played around with it, I found the response time was very slow. That’s why I gave it a 4.

Rachel,"6 months ago | Mar 7, 2024 11:40 AM","I use this primarily as an alarm clock/picture frame on my nightstand. I notice that the voice recognition works much better than Siri, and it just understands what I am saying much better. Plus it is a lot harder to accidentally say something that sounds like “hey google” than “hey siri”. Important thing to know, this does not have any cameras on it, only light sensors for the automatic brightness, The things that this thing is SUPPOSED to do seem pretty limitless. I say it like that because one of the things I really wanted it to do was shuffle through pictures of my partner. And I for the life of me could not get it to do that. I connected it to google photos, downloaded google home, made a photo album with her photos, and I was pressing all of the right buttons to the point where it was saying it was shuffling through her album, but it kept only showing art. I messed with this thing for hours, rebooted it multiple times, googled it, went through reddit posts regarding the same issues but could not get it to do what I wanted. Seems to be a glitch or bug or something because the settings to do this were all there and easy to access, it just wouldnt work. Finally though, I got it to work by shuffling through the “recent highlights” album which I curated to be her photos. I don’t dare touch the photo settings ever again though because it took so much trial and error. It also isn’t without its fair share of lag. It does not swipe through apps or open anything seamlessly. Overall, I do really like it now that it does what I bought it for, especially because I got it significantly on sale. But if you aren’t the most patient person or have specific tasks you want this to accomplish, I reccomend doing some research before you buy.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

My only complaint would be that it disconnects from internet from time to time, but all three do that and it could very well just be my internet provider which is why im not taking off a star. The only other thing to be aware of is the motion sensing is very sensitive on default- one is behind the couch and if music is playing and someone tosses something onto the couch it will pause the music- took a bit to figure out what was happening lol so just something to keep in mind if you sort your laundry in your living room etc",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

JustinS,"8 months ago | Jan 6, 2024 6:19 PM","I got this to replace Alexa which I had been using for years because Alexa does not have a good list app that you can  use with an iphone. you have to use the Alexa app itself which is frustrating to use. Google tasks IOS app is quite pleasant to use and so I got this device to sync to that app. You have to use voice recognition so my wife can't use it until she sets it up which is distopian in the first place whereas alexa doesn't discriminate who it spies on (jk). It is frustrating though to have voice recognition though as I was sick last week and I couldn't get it to listen to me to save my life. Even after getting better when you go to turn off an alarm when you are groggy in the morning it doesn't recognize your voice until you  say to turn it off like a fully alert and awake person the way you code your voice, which is done with three total sentences by the way. I would return this device if I still could, unfortunately that is not an option. If Big Brother is going to be watching me I want it to pay attention because I need to get some stuff done. Instead it feels like it only wants to record what it recognizes as you so that it can directly identify your words with your identity. I am being overly paranoid I know, but if you really consider just how much Google Relies on data for its business model, its not wrong to be concerned. Even in the data economy they are as far as I am aware by far the worst offender possibly on planet earth but certainly in the United States from what I have read. The ways in which it has been caught utilizing that data to manipulate people in elections for instance (I have no interest in party politics so I won't mention what influence they intended to have, but there is pretty good evidence of this if you look into the organization that figured out how to track the way google is using ephemeral data). Anyways, its not worth the rub. I may just throw this thing in the trash and go back to using my four alexas and let them be my overlords because at least the lady listens and responds accordingly.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

The media interaction leaves a lot to be desired as you can't see your playlists to choose from only the recommendations list (speaking for Spotify, I don't use any other music apps)

Improved sound and mic means better interactive experience. I greatly enjoy the dim screen and nighttime schedule options. 
As with most of Google products, sometimes the foundation of Google itself is what let's down the items that depends on Google network improvement and software updates.

apalmo,"8 months ago | Dec 19, 2023 11:38 AM","I have been using mostly amazon devices to control my home and ask questions.  I also have the first version of the google 7inch home hub.  I have found that google just works better.  Every time I ask Alexa a question or turn on lights it does the task then keeps talking about random things.  For example Alexa turn on the lights, okay lights turned on and did you know that XYZ is now on sale at amazon.  This is frustrating as I don't need the extra BS just do the task and be done.

With using Google it does the task and that's it.  I don't get extra BS or sales tactics.  With google I can also set my default music streaming service so it will play music from that streaming service that I already pay for.  With Amazon I ask it to play music and it goes directly to amazon music, but if the song is not a free one it will set you up for their music unlimited service for a monthly fee.  I have noticed this fee a few times on my bill and figured its time to get rid of amazon Alexa.

I really like the size of the display and that I can watch hulu, youtube, youtube tv, etc.  I have this in my kitchen to use those services or to ask it recipe questions.  I really like having the display and having google show information when I ask questions.  When the display is not in use you can have it display a clock or a photo slide show.  

Another nice setting for the google hub, you can select your music streaming service and which speaker should play the music.  I have a JBL speaker with google built in, so when I ask this HUB to play music it will route the music to that speaker instead of the built in home hub speakers.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

bryttani,"9 months ago | Dec 10, 2023 11:49 AM","I recently snagged the Nest Hub (2nd Gen) on a great deal, and it’s been a mixed bag of experiences. As an Apple user, I noticed the integrations aren’t as seamless as I’d hoped. However, there’s a lot to like, especially the display which doubles as a smart clock by my bedside.

The design is sleek, fitting perfectly into the bedroom aesthetics. I love how it serves as a hub for controlling smart devices, although the full potential seems limited within the Apple ecosystem. The best part? Waking up to a screen that not only tells time but also eases me into my day with gentle alarms and a quick overview of my schedule.

In short, if you’re deeply tied to Apple products, you might find some limitations, but as a standalone smart display and clock, it does bring a touch of modern convenience to the bedside.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars

But, I do use it when I take a nap.  I sleep better listening to pink sounds.  My fav is Thunderstorm tracks.  Go figure.

If you teach YOURSELF the right syntax to speak unto your Nest Hub, you can ask it very specific questions about weather, spelling, miscellaneous look-ups, cooking timers, etc.  It's just a matter of saying it so the AI 'gets' the question.  

Oh, and P.S. I get to listen to The Economist in London, free podcasts as part of my morning ritual.  That's a hint.  If you are 'off' fake and false news dished up to you in AMERICA, try The Economist...almost impartial, still perfectly edited, the only news worth your time.

RodolfoC,"9 months ago | Nov 24, 2023 10:51 PM","In the tumultuous landscape of modern life, where time and technology often seem to pull us apart, a beacon of hope emerged in the form of the Nest Hub 7” Smart Display with Google Assistant (2nd Gen) in Charcoal. Little did I know that this unassuming device would become the unexpected savior of my struggling marriage.

From the moment it took its place in our home, the Nest Hub transformed not only our living space but also our relationship. The sleek Charcoal finish seamlessly blended with our decor, exuding a calming presence that set the tone for a new chapter in our lives.

The magic began with the Google Assistant, an unintrusive yet ever-helpful presence that gradually became an integral part of our daily routine. From setting shared reminders to managing shopping lists, the Nest Hub effortlessly became the silent mediator, easing the burden of mundane tasks that once led to tension.

Our evenings, once marred by the distractions of individual screens and the ceaseless buzz of notifications, found a harmonious rhythm thanks to the Nest Hub's smart display. It became the central hub for our shared interests, displaying our favorite photos, streaming relaxing music, and even suggesting recipes for our newfound joint cooking adventures.

The Nest Hub's ability to control smart home devices added an unexpected layer of convenience and connection. With a simple voice command, we could adjust the lighting, control the thermostat, or even play our favorite shows, fostering an environment where compromise and collaboration became second nature.

The morning routine, once a hurried and chaotic affair, transformed into a shared experience of planning and positivity. The Nest Hub's visual aids, from displaying the day's weather to providing a personalized agenda, helped us start our days on a coordinated and uplifting note.

The device's unobtrusive nature became a metaphor for the newfound balance in our relationship. The Nest Hub brought forth a sense of unity, reminding us that technology, when harnessed thoughtfully, has the power to facilitate connection rather than create distance.

In essence, the Nest Hub 7” Smart Display in Charcoal became the unexpected hero of our love story, mending the rifts and fostering an environment of understanding and togetherness. Its unassuming presence, backed by the power of Google Assistant, transformed our home into a sanctuary of love and shared moments. To say it saved our struggling marriage is an understatement—it redefined and revitalized our connection. In the soft glow of its display, our love found a new, harmonious rhythm, and for that, we are forever grateful.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

ThatWiseGuy,"9 months ago | Nov 20, 2023 12:08 PM","Not exactly my first rodeo with a nest hub. This would be my 5th fourth one though. I know you might be thinking that's a lot. But to be fair the first didn't fail due to poor quality of software. It was an external component that did that. 

So here I am, I shopped around to find one on a ""deal"" and landed on Best Buys website. Now I have one at my computer station for various reasons. I can now do many things from my ""hub"" without the need to pick up my phone and sign in. Changing the thermostat, watching a football game or streaming something else, to viewing my security system, plus much, much more. 

The deal made this clearcut for me. Yeah the screen isn't gigantic but it does what it needs to do and then some. It's also not like I'm viewing the screen from 10+ feet away. The options for background wallpapers are nice. Time is large to be seen along with weather. Can be very helpful for those who don't mind having a device monitor your conversation for queue words. Richard Nixon would be mad about wire taping becoming so ""cool"" and ""ok"", with what happened to him. 

Anywho, that's another topic these these newer generations could research, however, if ya don't mind having a device eavesdrop on you, ""hello Google"" you'll land in another home and someone else may find you useful too...",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

I swear am not a conspiracies but it does freak me out and maybe its just a glitch in its system. I dont know. So now, when we do need it; we have to unmute it with the manual mute button on its back.

It works great, the speakers are not bad at all. They are not as good as its big brother but definitely not bad. I use it mainly to stream radio stations and play videos and it handles that perfectly.

The worst is when I ask it to turn off an outlet I have labeled ""Microwave"" to child proof a microwave my 2 yo son can reach.  

I'll say ""Turn on Microwave"" and it responds with ""turning on 7 lights"" and proceeds to turn on every smart bulb in the house while most people are trying to sleep.  

Seriously, you have to annunciate to a ridiculous level, it takes too long to understand, and sometimes just does random stuff that is nothing close to the request.

I got this Google device because it doesn’t have a camera and you can turn the microphone off.
It was very hard to set it up at my mom’s care facility which ended up requiring a call to Spectrum tech support and finding the MAC address etc.  it was so bad gay my mom was scared of it by the time it was setup.  
So I brought it home where it was a tad easier to setup.

However, there are other options available, such as the Lenovo Smart Display powered by Google Assistant or the more expensive Nest Hub Max with a built-in camera. For many smart home consumers, the smaller Nest Hub, priced at $130 and frequently on sale, is the preferred choice.

But now, there's a new model to take its place. The second-generation Nest Hub is not only smarter but also cheaper at $100. With its impressive features, it's definitely worth considering. However, Google has introduced a new feature called Sleep Sensing, which may be unsettling for some users, similar to Amazon's Echo Show 10.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

I had hoped that with the presence sensing in the hub that it would open up new triggers. It does not. However, this is not the issue that brings the greatest regret.

The device will not stay connected to WIFI. Period. I have reset it, moved it directly beside the router, etc. and it still will not stay connected. This makes the device an absolute waste of money, electricity, bandwidth and time.

If you ask it to turn on the lights - ""I'm having trouble connecting to the network""
If you ask it to play YouTube - ""I'm having trouble connecting to the network""
Even just using it as an expensive photo frame is a letdown as it just continually has the connection error on the screen or a message to please try and set up the device again.

JustinM,"1 year ago | Aug 16, 2023 7:51 AM","This thing has a mind of it's own and doesn't do anything you ask it to. You can tell it to play something and watch the screen as it registers what you are saying. It will type out everything word for word, like when I say ""play artist Haken"" and then start playing some random song that has absolutely nothing to do with what I asked for and could not possibly mistaken for having a similar name. Also, it likes to give a 30 second lecture after every error message. If I speak above a whisper and ask it to add something to my shopping list, instead of just saying try again it says ""can only share person information if I recognize your voice, try going to assistant settings and changing your voice match settings"". It didn't matter that I've checked the settings or that I've heard the stupid message a thousand times, it still says it every time. I tried speaking to it in terms that it uses, but that didn't help either. For example, I named my TV ""Sony"" so it would have a unique identifier for Google. I said ""play music on Sony"" and it said  ""I don't recognize Sony, try saying your device name instead"". But if I say ""play music on TV"" it says ""okay, playing music from YouTube on Sony"". There are no settings to limit how much it talks, or even to make the speaking volume softer than the media volume. If you listen to music at a high volume, it is going to scream in your ear if you ask it a question later. In general I would also say that the user interface is not very intuitive. The sound quality should isn't great, the mini speakers sound way better for half the price.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

It is great for setting timers and checking the weather. It’s just ok at playing Pandora radio. there is no way to search through our type in a station you just have to keep asking Google until you get closer to what you want. With Spotify you can control what is playing on the hub through your Spotifyapp on your phone. The only real downside is that I wish it was a little more intuitive or user friendly, but overall and having never had another to compare it to, it’s a greatly useful product and works well.

Caleb,"1 year ago | Aug 4, 2023 8:26 PM","We love the smart displays. They have a good sound output and quality and the screen is very useful. It can be a photo frame, clock or other use when not being interacted with and the voice control and other touch utilities are a game changer.

CharlesInCharge,"1 year ago | Aug 4, 2023 7:43 PM","Is a Google Hub overkill for a bedroom clock? Maybe, but it's great!  

And if you are worried about privacy, you can disable to mic by flipping a switch at the top.  It will then only respond by the touchscreen. 

You can also turn on a large clock display.  Best yet, it will set automatically by the Internet so no more resetting for power failures or time changes.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

LBasson,"1 year ago | Jul 28, 2023 11:26 AM","ntroduction:

As an avid tech enthusiast, I recently had the pleasure of exploring the Nest Hub 7” Smart Display with Google Assistant (2nd Gen). This versatile smart device has quickly become an integral part of my daily routine. From its vibrant display and responsive performance to the seamless integration of Google Assistant, the Nest Hub offers a delightful smart home experience. In this user review, I'll share my thoughts on its key features and overall usability.

Design and Display:

The Nest Hub's design is a masterpiece of simplicity and elegance. The 7-inch display is encased in a sleek fabric finish that seamlessly blends into any home decor. The compact form factor ensures it doesn't occupy much space, making it ideal for bedside tables, kitchen counters, or even as a digital photo frame.

The touch-sensitive display is bright and vibrant, rendering colors beautifully. Whether watching videos, checking the weather, or displaying family photos, the Nest Hub provides crisp visuals with wide viewing angles, making it a joy to interact with.

Google Assistant Integration:

The highlight of the Nest Hub is, undoubtedly, the seamless integration of Google Assistant. The far-field microphones are impressively accurate, even from a distance, allowing for hands-free voice commands. Setting timers, asking for recipes, or controlling smart home devices has never been more convenient. The responsiveness and accuracy of Google Assistant are top-notch, making it an invaluable personal assistant for day-to-day tasks.

Media and Entertainment:

The Nest Hub excels as a media hub as well. Watching YouTube videos, streaming Netflix, or even listening to music is a delight with its crisp display and surprisingly impressive speaker quality. While it might not replace a high-end speaker system, the Nest Hub's audio output is clear, balanced, and loud enough for casual entertainment.

Smart Home Control:

As a central hub for my smart home devices, the Nest Hub easily controls lights, thermostats, smart plugs, and more. The Home View dashboard provides an intuitive interface to manage all connected devices efficiently. I particularly appreciate the ""Ambient EQ"" feature, which automatically adjusts the display's brightness and color temperature based on the room's lighting conditions, creating a pleasant and comfortable viewing experience.

Privacy and Security:

Google has made strides in improving user privacy, and the Nest Hub reflects this commitment. The physical mute switch for the microphone offers a sense of control over when the device listens to you, and the integrated camera shutter allows for covering the camera when it's not in use.

Minor Considerations:

While the Nest Hub is an excellent smart display, there are a couple of areas for potential improvement. The absence of a built-in camera might disappoint users who wish to make video calls or use it for video conferencing. Additionally, a larger display option for those who prefer a more immersive media experience would be a welcome addition.

Conclusion:

The Nest Hub 7” Smart Display with Google Assistant (2nd Gen) is a brilliant smart home device that brings convenience and elegance to any living space. Its sleek design, vibrant display, and seamless integration of Google Assistant make it a must-have for anyone invested in a smart home ecosystem. Although a built-in camera and a larger display option could enhance its versatility, the Nest Hub excels in its primary functions and delivers an outstanding user experience. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a smart display that truly enriches their daily life.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

Ymir,"1 year ago | Jul 26, 2023 9:55 AM","Im very disappointed. Coming from Alexa I found the Google Display to be vastly superior in every aspect. However, over the past week, it has stopped being able to listen to any voice commands. Saying there was either ""a glitch"" and to try again later or that an error occured. I have tried everything I could think of to fix it to no avail. From leaving it unplugged all night to factory resetting the device. Overall, I cant seem to find a home assistant that works for me and the Google Display is no exception.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars
