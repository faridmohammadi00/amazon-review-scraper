Marc,"1 month ago | Jul 12, 2024 1:40 PM","Excellent picture on this Bravia TV. Very bright, I actually turn down brightness to 35 (max of 50) in a room that gets sunlight. Nice colors. Feet can raise TV if you have a thin soundbar, but it isn't enough for a real center channel speaker as part of a full surround system. The built-in speakers are better than expected (of course can't compare to a real surround system).

I have to knock off a star for two reasons: the home screen has ads you CANNOT remove. Inexcusable on a $1,500 TV. And the HDMI control misbehaves badly: for several minutes after the TV is TURNED OFF, it randomly turns my Onkyo receiver on and off, and mutes it. When I turn the TV off, it will also turn off the receiver and my blu-ray player. These cannot be disabled in the TV settings! I have to disable HDMI control in my AVR itself to block it.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

And probably my most favorite thing is that the Sony is appreciably brighter ( my  living room has 6 windows, so a lot of natural sunlight ) and I have no problem watching anything on it.

Absalom,"2 months ago | Jul 4, 2024 5:22 AM","Yes this, Sony Bravia 65"" XR-X90L is Every bit as good as the expert reviews say and by the ones that have Professionally tested this Heavyweight midrange 4K TV but not heavy in price. I won't get into no more than what has already been stated in the comments that other owners who have already stated. This wasn't a compromised purchase for me, I was originally going to purchase the Sony 65"" A80L or their 65"" X93L. After 3 + months of diligent research comparing all the tradeoffs between the three models I came to the conclusion, anything more is just diminishing returns. I used, (Gene DellaSala's) article (Audioholics) of Professional recommended settings to dial in my Sony Bravia XR-X90L. 
Yes I do recommend this Sony model it punches above its  class. BestBuy's service made my Purchase even easier with their holiday sales they're running.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Sometimes there is very little detail. Just a lot of dark. I've had some issues with streaming apps so I would have to use my Roku. Within the last couple of months it lost the Internet connection and I would have to go to settings and reconnect.

(YES IT’S ALL CONFIGURED CORRECTLY as per SONY AND HAS CURRENT, UPDATED SOFTWARE)  —1-- CONTANTLY REBOOTS: Over and over the system reboots, have no idea why … SCOURED SONY SUPPORT =  NOTHING.  —2-- TOTAL GREEN SCREEN: Will switch randomly to a totally green screen when changing from one episode or movie to another, random actions, or switching ports.  So bad, even switching to any other source or even my antenna the toally green screen screen will not go away, but the audio continues. SCOURED SONY SUPPORT =  MUST UNPLUG TV CONSTANTLY.  —3-- NO PICTURE ZOOM: No resizing of picture out of letterbox under any circumstances.  The only way to zoom is to switch your player (Roku stick, Fire, Ultra) to 1080p. SCOURED SONY SUPPORT =  GET OVER IT, NOT SUPPORTED. So your 65” screen = 20” tall video, unreal. —4— FAILS TO RECOGNIZE AV UNIT(s): Even though most times it works, will not turn on AV unit (tried my late model Yamaha, Marantz, Onkyo, even Sony). It’s not found & switchs to internal speakers. It wont work ever if an external (Say Roku Ultra) is turned on first.  Yes, the systems are set up through the “setup” part of the system.  it’s totally random. SCOURED SONY SUPPORT =  NO ANSWER.  —5— POOR VIEWING ANGLE: I sort of understood this factor, but didn’t know it was sooo poor.  Unless you are dead on straight in front of the screen, the picture degrades quickly. —6— NEVER THOUGHT A BRAVIA WAS SO MUCH DAILY TROUBLE!!!!  Turn on, restart often, turns off/on AV unit several times, switches speakers, screen goes green …. I’d return it if I could.  WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND. Just so disappointing from Sony.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars
RoyB,"3 months ago | May 27, 2024 11:52 AM","The Sony BRAVIA XR X90L LED 4K UHD Smart Google TV offers an immersive viewing experience. The 65"" screen delivers stunning clarity, vibrant colors, and deep blacks, enhancing every movie night or gaming session.

What sets this TV apart is its intuitive interface powered by Google TV. Navigating through apps, streaming services, and settings is seamless, thanks to the user-friendly design and voice command capabilities.

The XR Cognitive Processor ensures smooth performance, reducing motion blur and enhancing picture quality. Plus, with HDMI 2.1 compatibility, gamers can enjoy responsive gameplay and high frame rates.

One drawback is the lack of local dimming zones compared to higher-end models, resulting in slightly less precise contrast control in dark scenes. However, this is a minor flaw considering the overall exceptional picture quality.

In conclusion, the Sony X90L is a top-tier choice for anyone seeking a premium 4K Smart TV experience. Its combination of stunning visuals, user-friendly interface, and advanced processing technology make it a standout option in the market.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

CosmicChicken,"3 months ago | May 17, 2024 3:01 PM","I managed to snag this beauty as on open box item for a very significant $400 discount; no damage whatsoever and runs like its brand new out of the box.  The picture quality despite it being a full-array LED is stunning, and a night and day upgrade from a non-HDR Vizio LCD that was almost 10 years old.  This TV is located in a moderately sunny location, so there is ample ambient and natural light, and this thing gets plenty bright without even having to max out the brightness.  Which really aides in minimizing light reflection.

Once I had it calibrated to my liking from a variety of tech sites, I went right into testing all sorts of content to put it through its paces.  Dolby Vision and HDR 4K content look absolutely stunning.  I haven't encountered much of anything that this TV struggles to make look amazing; including video games.  

While this may not be the best TV money can buy, it is the best all around picture quality you can purchase at this price point compared to Hisense U8K or TCL QM8.  Much of this due to Sony's image processing engine, which stands second to none.

I can't speak to the sound quality as I use a soundbar.  The Google OS is suitable and responsive, but I use an Apple TV 4K steaming box which in my opinion compliments the TV's picture quality even more.

The only regret I have is that I didn't get a 75"" size, but for the discount I got on this open-box item, I can't complain.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

AndrewR,"3 months ago | May 13, 2024 6:51 PM","For what I paid, I should have chosen the cheaper TV. This Full Array screen has so much clouding, uneven greys, like weirdness in skies and panning shots. I've seen people call it a dirty screen, I don't know what it's called, but panning shots and video games are non playable on this. It's a mess. Technically the TV is operating, but it is NOT a clean picture when it comes to clear skies and a moving shot. Any video game you rotate, it pans the video and you see the smudgey uneven splotchy brightness in the background. I've tried every setting, everything I could feasably do and it's not better. Everything else about the tv is okay, the software is not laggy.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

SkyCross,"4 months ago | May 7, 2024 12:28 PM","One of those purchases you want to love so much. It is a great panel and really shows all sources better than any TV I have ever owned. Truly capable of handling all sources, including 120hz over HDMI from a PC with great handling of HDR. 

I like the menus and control it gives you over the way the TV handles inputs. For example, my prior Hiscense 4k TV would always set the PC input to game mode, when it's primary use is a HTPC which truly hurt the experience. This TV really allows the configuration I want for video. It has to be one of the best TVs on the market because it really helps the picture by the way it processes. For example, it really does an excellent job with YouTube which is highly compressed. 

The picture looks great. And while it is not Mini-LCD, it really looks like it is. The picture is amazing. 

CONS: I really want to give this 5 stars, but to be honest, I am sitting here on day 3 with the TV debating returning it. The problem is the audio handling. 

I got the Sony SRS-NS7 neckband speaker and was excited for the enhanced capabilities the Bravio provides. I am also using the Sony MX1000M3 Bluetooth headphones because I live in an apartment with a neighbor who complains if I drop a pen. LOL I have a Polk soundbar as well. 

The Bravio will be playing through the headphones or neck speaker audio device and then go crazy when the soundbar shuts down from inactivity changing the HTPC display setup and leaving me without sound. I have to reselect the audio source on the TV settings. Then, after a few minutes it turns on the soundbar and freaks out again. I have the config to prioritize Sony audio sources but still the audio output changes randomly. On occasion I am sitting there with headphones on with music playing and a moment later my soundbar is screaming at high volumes. I try to handle my rude neighbors complaints and Sony wants me evicted. In addition, the 3d sound on the neckband will not work if the soundbar is at all connected.. even when the soundbar is not powered on. To get the full capability of the SRS-NS7 the HDMI *CANNOT* be connected to the soundbar.

I guess I will have to buy an expensive Sony soundbar to try to solve the problem. For now, I just have to disconnect my soundbar and everything is fine. It is just painful as no TV speakers sound good to me. Sony should not force you to have all Sony devices use the TV but that seems to be the case.

I am sure some of this has to do with the fact I do not use the TV in smart mode, but I have never had a TV that 6 times an hour loses its mind and changes everything while you are trying to watch a movie or listen to music. I guess I have to invest more in Sony or return the TV. That is very frustrating. I really wanted to love this TV.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars

The abundance of festures and settings allowed me to set the picture just right. The quality of movies and TV shows is outstanding, escpecially at this pricepoint.

I reinstalled the Power Strip to the wall mounting bracket using Zip ties
The team that installed the Apple TV to the TV did not attach the Apple TV mounting bracket to the TV. I used Zip-ties again to attach the mounting bracket to the TV.

CreativeShopper,"5 months ago | Mar 29, 2024 2:03 PM","This is my 2nd Sony. My first is a 55"" Android tv, that's about 5 years old. My 14 year old Samsung plasma finally died and originally, I planned to replace it with another Samsung; however, I'm not confident in the longevity or stability of their Tizen platform for smart tv. In addition, there are numerous reviews of people's tvs tipping over, because there is one support stand, placed in the middle of the tv, which is not strong enough to bare the tv's weight. So to Sony I went. Thank goodness I kept the box, because on exactly Day 14 of the 15 day return window, the picture failed. The screen has a big black bar in the middle, with the picture duplicated on each side of the bar. I was unable to complete an exchange with delivery online, as the only option was to lug this huge box and tv to the store. Fortunately, their call center was able to assist and process and exchange and pickup with delivery. I'm highly disappointed to see the quality is so poor that the unit fails within less than a month. Do better Sony.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars

RogerB,"6 months ago | Mar 11, 2024 12:09 PM","We've owned Sony TVs for a number of years, so this is a brand of choice for us. We also purchased this TV for a short-term rental condo in Myrtle Beach.

Specifically, what I really like about this TV is its integration with various apps, such as YouTubeTV, YouTube, AcornTV, and BritBox. In particular, the ability to fast-forward through commercials within YouTubeTV is far superior to the same operation on an AppleTV box.

As you might expect, each app handles the individual operations slightly different, but in general, the operation is very intuitive.

Going back to one remote is also very convenient and provides more options than the AppleTV remote did.

Size is great. My son commented on how much clearer the box displays were during the SuperBowl.

The screen saver collection is much better than what we had on our AppleTV, though I must admit that it is a bit annoying that it keeps displaying the temperature in Myrtle Beach instead of our local temperature. The time is correct, but the temperature is wrong. This is a bug in ChromeCast, though I haven't been able to correct it. I suspect that it is related to using the same account and it is possible that most users will not experience the same problem.

Finally, appreciated the simple integration with the Sony SoundBar. Plug in two cables and your done.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

The factory cinema settings appear flat and dull and vivid blows out all the colors and contrast .  I have found if you can go in and tweak all the picture settings yourself, then you can get a fairly respectable clear crisp picture.  However considering the price and all the praise that this set gets, I found that it isn't all that much better than my 7 year Samsung LED.

If you are on Comcast or similar signal try to get a 4k signal box. I previously had the 55” version of this tv. The sound on this tv is much improved over last years version. It may be due to the 10” difference allowing for better speakers. If you watch a lot of movies on Netflix etc. then you might want to purchase a soundbar but if you watch mostly regular tv shows then you won’t be disappointed in the tv speakers.

The only minor drawback that I have with this TV is that without a sound bar or home theater the voices get mixed in too much with the other background sound.

Something that gets lost in the numbers for the cheaper brands (like Vizio, etc.) is that the processing power is much lower and the software is often sub-par, which means general TV navigation can be slow/laggy and the TV sometimes develops weird glitches.

Daniel,"7 months ago | Jan 22, 2024 11:40 AM",Came from a Vizio M55-E0 and was surprised with the brightness and clarity of this tv.  It’s a solid performer for a midrange tv from Sony.  There is some blooming and vertical banding but I don’t think it’s a deal breaker or that bad at all.  It’s a balancing act for tv manufacturers. If they try to cut down on the blooming then you get black crush and loss of detail.  If you prioritize detail you get blooming.  The tv looks great on my stand and I really like the low profile look of the feet.  The tv has a premium look as well. I cannot comment on how helpful Best Buy staff was to my purchase since I already knew what I wanted when I walked in.  I have been researching tvs for the better part of a year.

For the price the picture and colors on this TV cannot be beat. Could have went with an OLED but after reading about possible burn in issues leaving the TV on I went with this model because of all the great reviews. We stream everything especially Youtube TV and with my past TV's the image was grainy looking on many channels. The Sony brand is known for its color and processing lowbit rate programs right out of the box. I went to old programs like Friends and Seinfeld to see if the picture was any better and it blew me away with the clarity and beautiful colors.

 Yeah, I am sure the OLED tv's have a better picture but looking at this TV it can't be thousands better. Went on Youtube and looked at some 4k videos and again was absolutely blown away by the picture and the fact there was no judder or delays while panning. I did Google the rtings calibration settings for this tv and they were spot on.

Now for sports...We watch a lot of football and this thing is absolutely amazing watching the games. The colors and motion handling blew my Hisense tv's and TCL tv's out of the water. I know I am hyping this TV quite a bit but I have learned from reading and watching reviews and on hand experience that a brand like Sony...Samsung or LG is the way to go when purchasing a tv for quality and reliability.

Don't be put off by this TV being LCD full array backlighting because in my opinion its equal to the mini led tv's that are priced higher and the picture is no better. Last thing I will say is get an extended warranty. I didn't get an extended warranty on my TCL and when it went black screen a little after a year TCL told me since it was out of warranty I was out of luck. Really stand behind their tv's!!! Watch the review on Digital Trends about this tv on Youtube and many others and you will easily make the choice for this one!",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Ians,"7 months ago | Jan 19, 2024 10:19 PM","I purchased a 55” Samsung QLED from Sam’s Club over Black Friday for around $650 and the picture quality wasn’t great and it was extremely slow/unresponsive to the commands of the remote. I returned it and looked elsewhere and I’m very glad I did because this SONY is 100x better than the Samsung. The picture is awesome. The 65” screen size is also much better than the 55”. I really love the Google home in contrast to the Samsung home. My only slight complaint is occasional lagginess of the TV in response to a command given on the remote. It’s not the internet connection, and the TV is up to date, so not sure what it is. It’s rare. Overall, 10/10. The sound is surprisingly really loud and clear for TV speakers and the brightness of the picture is almost too good on the “Vivid” setting.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Paul,"8 months ago | Jan 5, 2024 7:01 PM","Pretty display but otherwise disappointing. For some reaoson the TV has SENT 6GB of data somewhere over three days. I’d say it’s a Sony branded Google TV. Compulsory terms agreements. Perks that only work on Bravia equipment… no PiP (picture in picture) support over any input from any input. Their setup process shows it’s possible, they’ve just chosen to cripple that feature or laze out and not implement it. 

The screen is pretty but it does have vignetting and splotchy coverage for single color bright images. Color depth and accuracy seem pretty good but I’m not a professional so I don’t have the tools to test it. 

I’d say the TV is worth 700 or 800, not 1000 to 1200. If you can catch it on a sale or through a discount you’re likely to be happy with it if you’re not too picky. 

If you’re adding a soundbar though, the only two that fit in the HT-A series are the HT-A9 and the HT-A3000. It seems like a gross oversight but maybe they assume everyone is hanging it on a wall. The issue is the feet so if you’re wall mounting the TV the feet are no longer an issue. The in TV sound isn’t the worst I’ve heard but it’s boomy and sounds like it’s in a box. Something also buzzes at listening levels over 35.

Support has been less than impressive from Sony as well. 

I really wanted to be impressed and delighted with this TV but it falls short on so many levels because of sloppy interfaces and features that could be there that simply aren’t.",Rated 3 out of 5 stars

carltonsle,"8 months ago | Dec 16, 2023 4:05 PM","I just purchased 3 65-inch X90L TVs on Black Friday, 2023. The image of this LED/LCD panel is impressive. I am coming off the Sony X900H 65-inch panel I purchased from BestBuy back in 2021. The image of the X90L is head and shoulders above the X900. The X90L has a slimmer body than the 900H and it is thinner. It has a maximum of *85 dimming zones compared to the 900H which has 30 zones according to the RTings.com review (It might be thinner than the 900H but it is definitely heavier,) The image does not require a lot of adjustment either in my opinion. It is so life-like, you could almost sunbathe in most sunlight scenes. The only two things I dislike about it is the Sony Logo, it's off to the left. It should be centered. My other complaint is the small remote with the hotkeys and numeral keypad removed. You have to fish through sub-menus to get through basic functions which is unnecessary. I upgraded remotes, I bought the metal remotes with backlit numeral keys with the convenience of the hotkeys. The clicky haptics on the metal remote is satisfying to use.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

KEVINM,"8 months ago | Dec 15, 2023 3:12 PM","In early December 2023, two Geek Squad agents installed my new 65 inch Sony X90L TV. I've had the TV for a little more than a week and, so far, it is fantastic. It is situated in a fairly large very bright room yet still produces a great picture even on the brightest days. The picture quality is even more impressive during night time viewing. From my perspective, the picture is perfect right out of the box. TV programs, movies and sports, whether from cable or streamed, are all flawlessly processed and displayed by this TV. 

(As a side note: I have Xfinity cable. Mainly for esthetic reasons, I wanted to avoid having any cable or streaming set-top box, hoping to use a native app on Sony to stream Xfinity. I searched both Sony and Xfinity websites as well as various online articles and conversations. These presented contradictory claims regarding the availability of the Xfinity app for download on this Google TV. For anyone who may have this same question, I can say that it is NOT  available.  I had to retain the set-top box.) 

The Geek Squad techs were knowledgeable and courteous, and they did a very professional job mounting and setting up the TV,  connecting it to the HT devices, and hauling away the old TV for recycling. 
Unfortunately, I failed to have them demonstrate fully how to use the interconnected devices and their remotes. 
After they left, I encountered the consequences of this failure, when I couldn't access the AVR setup menu, and some other AVR functions. 

Since this appeared to be a connection or setup issue, I contacted BB the next day and after a very long trip through the chat options, I was able to speak to a living  person. The agent offered various unworkable suggestions, before finally agreeing to send the Geek Squad to the house the following week to resolve the issue. 

Over the following few days, I continued trying to access the AVR settings. I  ultimately found a partial solution from a Google search. I was able to reach and use the AVR setup menues, while other functions that I used to access from the AVR remote before the new TV was installed were no longer available.  After attempting various methods to correct this issue, I concluded that these options were probably no longer available because the devices were now connected directly to the TV (as I wanted) and not through the 13 year old HD AVR, as they had been previously. 

I decided that nothing more could or needed to be done, and made several failed attempts to cancel the scheduled service call. Therefore, on the morning of the scheduled appointment, the service tech telephoned to say that he would arrive in 30 minutes or so.  I told him that I thought I had resolved the main issues, and that I didn't want to waste his time by having him come to the house. I apologized for any inconvenience that I may have caused, and canceled the appointment.  He was very understanding, saying that if I needed help in the future, I could always make a new appointment. 

That same day I realized that I could not operate the radio from the AVR remote. I rescheduled a trouble shooting in-home service, which took place today. All issues, mostly due to my ignorance of how to work through some new settings, were resolved. 

I highly recommend the Sony X90L, and the excellent work done by Best Buy's Geek Squad.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

First and foremost, the 65-inch display boasts 4K UHD resolution, delivering crystal-clear images with vibrant colors and exceptional clarity.

Design-wise, the slim and minimalist profile of the BRAVIA XR X90L adds a touch of elegance to any living space. The narrow bezels and premium build quality further enhance the overall aesthetic appeal of this television.

BryonC,"9 months ago | Dec 12, 2023 9:42 AM","Sony 65"" BRAVIA XR X90L Great TV! I went with Full Array and not with the OLED because as an international photographer I know the brighter something is the more contrast will be lost. That being say the Sony 90L is bright without loss of contrast.  Sound is good for a TV but awesome with by Marshall Stanmore ii speaker. I do not use sound bars because they do not last as long as speaker(s) and for me speaker(s) sounds better than sound bar.  Best Buy in Aberdeen, NC is great. Great helpers. I went to Best Buy in Fayetteville, NC three times. About 30 mins to 40 mins each time. Could not get no help so I went to door greeter and told him I need help.

James818,"10 months ago | Nov 5, 2023 7:47 PM","This TV blew me away even after  the research I did the last 2 days.  I watched a lot of YouTube video reviews, checked ratings and it was down to this or the A80L. 
I came from a 2017 55 in TCL. It began to dim and washed out, we had a good run. Since it is now Black Friday, time to check the sales.  

I went into the store and narrowed it between this  and the A80L Mini Led. The A80L is gorgeous but even on sale would break my budget adding a protection plan. 
The XR90L Led hit all the marks for me. Gaming, good black with minimal blooming, 65 inch, looks amazing and most of all affordable with the protection plan.   
1500 out the door with a 5 year protection plan. The box is huge so  you need a truck or van, a 55 boxed would fit in my accord. This thing is heavy, so you best 2 man this.  

It took a while to tinker with the tv settings for color and brightness, hitting the right marks for TV watching vs gaming.  I use a sound system but the audio is ok shouild you need it.  The remote feels sleek and operating system is great, no issues, got my updates and it works smooth. 
I highly recommend this tv, even if you go 55 inch but I went 65 to view further from my couch, no need to bring up a chair on a 55 inch, plus its less eye strain for me laying down watching football. Gaming is BEAUTIFUL, and this is an LED! 


I didn’t break the bank and got 24-month financing on my BB card. I will eventually get an Mini LED or OLED down the road, maybe one for the bedroom next year, but for now this thing was a no brainer Don’t hesitate, if you are in the market, don’t think about it, run don’t walk and grab this thing. Pictures do not to this TV any justice, so I would not doubt this will be out of stock as the word gets out.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

Pikelet,"10 months ago | Oct 28, 2023 4:02 PM","As an engineer I spent many many hours of background reading and in-person viewing to make sure I was making the right choice before purchasing for my situation.  I chose the 65"" size considering wall stud location and width, weight, room brightness,  reliability, low bit-rate picture quality(I love classic TV), Dolby Vision and ATSC 3.0 tuner availability and last, but not least, value for money.  This TV literally dazzles with Dolby Vision content without giving up much to OLED in terms of contrast for real world content viewing beyond demos of honey dripping off a stick.

Any negatives?  Yes.   While the sound is fine for voice, you'll need to buy a soundbar and sub if you're looking for a cinema-like experience.  Secondly, as a full array LED rather than mini-LED or OLED TV, you're going to see some blooming with titles.  I chose to trade off some blooming in exchange for better shadow detail and higher brightness peaks in my bright room.  

Should I spend more?   If you have money to burn, buy the largest Sony A95L QD-OLED you can fit in the room for many thousands more.  I will be picking one up for a much darker basement in future.   Otherwise, no.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

JoshL,"10 months ago | Oct 20, 2023 4:11 PM","Just moved into my first home purchase and upgraded to 4k! This tv has been amazing so far. The only hiccup ive found that it has frozen up completely on me twice ever. This mostly seems to happen if i switch from an input other than the tv itself, such as a ps5 connected via hdmi, to bravia core app that comes with the tv. It may be user error, but still seemed a little odd to me as nothing would unfreeze the screen and id have to unplug the tv in order to reset everything. EARC is a must and i never dont want it again after experiencing it. Audio delay is almost non existent once hou get things working together properly. The tv includes 5 free movies of your choice to own on the bravia core app, and they look great on this display. Ive had no issues getting components to work together. Ps5 to the tv, and earc port to the A/V receiver. The display looks amazing and gets incredibly bright. The built in speakers are some of the best ive heard in a tv and will work with the ps5 3d sound settings. I did opt to use the surround sound home theater though. If youve used a chromecast then youll be right at home with the user interface and its one of the better UI's that ive used on a smart TV. Also plays well with the smart home things with google home. I would highly reccomend this TV if you use your tv for multiple things such as a pc monitor, if you own a ps5 or even other consoles as well (the switch looks great with the tv's upscaling), and also movies obviously are great with all the features of hdr10 and dolby vision, imax experience etc. I would give it 4.5 stars if that was an option and 5 if i didnt experience that freezing issue a couple times.",Rated 4 out of 5 stars

If you're like me and have researched like crazy which TV to get you have seen that this TV edges out TCL/Hisense options which all seem pretty great as well. Don't let the the lack of mini led sway you away this tv is plenty bright and the colors are very accurate due to it's better processor. Yes, you pay a bit more but you get a great viewing experience and the Sony build reputation which is worth the small bump in price. Sony color science is amazing and is Sony itself is deeply rooted in the motion picture industry so if you want the closest to industry standard at this price range ..this one is for you.",Rated 5 out of 5 stars

CodyS,"11 months ago | Sep 24, 2023 2:46 PM","The picture quality is pretty great. However the Google TV OS, frankly, sucks balls. It's sluggish, buggy, and filled with bloatware and spammy recommendations. It regularly takes like 10 seconds after loading the home screen to actually register anything you've done on the remote, and when it does, it performs all of the delayed tasks in rapid fire succession. You have to navigate to the app menu instead of the home screen simply showing you all your apps, like literally every other smart TV in the world. Additionally, you have to sign in to your google account to even use it. Personally I want to keep my personal google account separate from a living room TV used by multiple people. I tried making an email specifically for the TV but then it wouldn't let me use my YouTube TV account since it's associated with my primary google account.  I'm going to get an Apple TV unit eventually just to avoid using the insultingly bad built-in UI. Not worth buying, In my experience the menu and UI of LG televisions are the best, but probably any TV that doesn't use the Google TV OS would be a better choice than this.",Rated 2 out of 5 stars

This is my first Sony tv and am very happy with the customization it offers as well as not being hit with adds in the Home Screen as soon as I’m trying to watch something. Performs well for gaming on Xbox series x. Sound is good but would think about getting a sound bar if there’s a lot of open space where you plan on having it. Picture quality is really great in my eyes and design is sleek. Set up is pretty straightforward. Only con I have is if you plan on watching shows or movies with subtitles often there is noticeable light from that bleeding into darker areas of the screen but otherwise very happy with my purchase.,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
