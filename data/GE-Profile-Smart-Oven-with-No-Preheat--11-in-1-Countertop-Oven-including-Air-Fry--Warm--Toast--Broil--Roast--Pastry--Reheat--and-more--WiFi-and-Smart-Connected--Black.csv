Wayne,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2023","I have had plenty of toaster ovens that fail even at making toast. The GE no preheat makes toast and bagels perfect every time. The air fryer is a little loud but it works very well and heats fast.
It chimes and lights letting you know when it is almost and finally finished.
The control panel is glossy glass and does show fingerprints but that's a minor issue because it wipes off clean. It is a large oven able to fit 2-6 slices of bread, but when you pop open the door the shelf extends out for easy reach and the door lifts, so there is no chance of getting burnt.
The quality of the build is second to none, even better than some of the other $$$ high-end toaster-oven/air fryers.
Overall my wife and I love this unit, a little pricey but well worth it for the quality and the way the food is nicely cooked.
It's now part of the family.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JBertz,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023","I use a countertop oven because my regular oven is too large for what I cook and a pain to clean. I have been using one for about 5 years and my first one finally died. When I went out to look at them in person I was shocked on how flimsy the doors were and how light weight and cheap all the racks were. I decided I was going to have to pay a little more for a higher quality countertop oven. I found myself stuck with the Wolf, the top of the line Breville or this little gem I ran into at Crate and Barrel. If you are looking for a large countertop oven where you can cook turkeys then this is probably not a smart buy. If you are looking for something that cook within the size of 9 by 13 with no handles or 12 inch pizza with no handles then I highly recommend this. Some of my first day pros are that the oven made no noise. I had to check it a couple times to make sure it was still cooking. It is so much better to put your food in before you start the oven than after it is hot from preheating. The light is very bright to see your food. The food cooked much better than my old countertop oven and did not splatter grease all over the place. It did this without radiating heat through my small kitchen. The oven door is the best on the market. The baking rack pulls out when the door opens and is locked in position until you want to manually move it. This keeps the rack from sliding out when you are taking hot things out of it. Some cons I have found on this oven is the manufacturer at this point does not sell replacement racks, air fryer basket or sheet pan. They do not sell a pizza pan for the oven either. At the same time when I talked to them they seem pretty cool on the fact that I could use my own baking products. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to cook meals for one or two individuals using it's multiple methods of cooking as it is not the biggest one out there, but I feel it's quality is much better.

Update: So very easy to clean and all the grease came off very easy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
AT,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2024","They first oven we received had a broken seal on the glass panel, so it trapped moisture between the glass upon first use. The replacement was even worse, now that I know what to look for, this time the seal on the glass door was applied so poorly that it looks smeared, and something keeps rattling inside the machine as we handled it. The oven looks slick and I wanted to like it, but unfortunately the quality control is lacking, and I can't keep trying my luck until I get a normal one.

James,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2023","The GE Profile Smart Oven has truly revolutionized my cooking experience. The standout feature for me is undoubtedly the ""No Preheat"" function. Gone are the days of waiting for the oven to reach the desired temperature. With zero preheat technology, I can dive straight into cooking, saving precious time and energy.

But it's not just about the no preheat feature. The 11 preset functions, ranging from Air Fry to Bake and Bagel, offer unmatched versatility. Whether whipping up a quick snack or preparing a feast for the family, this oven has got me covered.

The one-touch, high-rise door is another thoughtful addition. It provides extra clearance on the countertop and ensures safety by eliminating the need to reach over a hot door. And speaking of smart features, the voice control is a delightful touch. Setting and adjusting time and temperature using voice commands feels futuristic and makes the cooking process even more seamless.

The GE Profile Smart Oven is a blend of innovation, functionality, and convenience. If you're looking to elevate your kitchen game, this is the appliance to invest in. It's not just an oven; it's a culinary companion that makes every cooking endeavor a joy.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Because it cooks quicker and I don't have to worry about heating up the kitchen, I've found I'm using it much more than I did my regular oven.

Jael,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2023","8/31/2023 Updated Review
This is the first time I've ever had to go back and edit a review of a product, but this issue warrants that. All in all, I do still like this smart oven, but over the last few weeks, it's started making a very loud rattling noise whenever it is air frying or using the convection fan. It is really obnoxious. If I give it a good thump, sometimes it will stop for awhile, but it'll just start up again. Once I turn it off, as it's spooling down, you hear some extra whack, whack, whacks as the fan comes to a stop. I can tell that the fan has come loose whether from incorrect manufacturing or from shipping, I'm not sure.
We decided to try seeing if we could tighten the fan ourselves - what a mess that was! It is almost impossible to access the set screw that we need to tighten. After taking out at least 40 screws and all the covers, we still weren't able to access the back panel to tighten that screw!! Ugh!! Extremely frustrating. We also discovered that many of the screws that we removed were already stripped out from over-tightening at the factory, so it's just a matter of time before those all start backing out on their own and making new rattles. :(
We finally gave up and accepted defeat and put everything back together, not having accomplished anything helpful. I have gotten the rattling noise to stop for now by propping the front feet of the oven up slightly to keep the fan from hitting the front cover, but who knows how long that will help? It's just a matter of time before the set screw comes completely out and the whole fan falls off. At that point, I'll no longer be able to use the air fry or convection features. :(
I hate to leave a poor review, but this oven is not holding up well to regular usage. I'm hoping that this is a fluke with this particular machine maybe from shipping or something and that others who have purchased it don't have similar issues, but I needed to let folks know my experience.

Original Review:
I love toaster ovens. I've always thought that they are the most underrated appliance a kitchen can have, especially for households with only 1-2 people in them. Not having to heat up an entire full sized oven every meal saves on utility bills and from heating your house up more in the summertime. So when I saw this little gem that can also do things like airfry, it was a no-brainer to get.
This unit sits a little deeper than my traditional toaster oven, but is slightly narrower width wise which is nice. The user interface is really easy to work with and feels so futuristic and high tech! 😅 It even greets you with a cheerful little jingle when you turn it on and it alerts you when it has one minute of cook time left and of course, when it's done. I wish there was a way to turn off or change the tune as it drives my husband crazy, but oh well. 😜
The no preheat feature is awesome. I was skeptical at first, but this thing heats up so fast it's incredible! So, I love that feature as it saves so much time!
The self presenting rack is a cool feature that helps prevent me from burning myself by reaching into the hot oven to pull things out or test for doneness, so that was another neat extra feature. I do wish that the door design was a little different, maybe no push button and just manual lift? The button is cool and all, but I just have a feeling that is going to be the first thing to break, and then what will you do? I'm old school and a little leery of things like that, what can I say?
The airfry works really well and it's so nice to not have to have a separate appliance just for that!
I did go ahead and add a Teflon liner to the very bottom of mine (being careful to make sure it's not touching any of the heating elements) to make for easier cleanup especially after airfrying.
I think this is an awesome little unit and am so excited to discover the plethora of other features that it has!",3.0 out of 5 stars
Left Blank,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2023","Nice unit, when it works. Less than 60 days after getting the unit (from a well known retailer), the fan in the air fryer section now makes a metal on metal grinding noise that is getting worse. I do not feel it is safe to use and have explained this to multiple GE ""customer service reps"". I have tried working with GE for a replacement and they keep wanting to repair the unit rather than replace the unit. The first service company said they basically don't repair toaster ovens, it should be replaced. GE insisted on contacting another service company and am now waiting for another attempt at service. All this right before Thanksgiving. I personally will NEVER purchase another GE product and be aware if the unit fails outside of the return window. Good Luck! I think this very shiny, basically new oven is going to the dump.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Wendi McDaniel,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2023","I really like this oven for so many reasons. I love that it does not require pre-heating; this is especially great in the Summer months when you want to limit the extra heat generated from cooking. It also helps you to get food cooked and ready to eat more quickly, which is really nice when I don’t have much time for meals. I love the versatility of the oven, especially that it can air-fry food too! The oven is not too large, and it has a modern look. Operating this oven is fairly intuitive and I have not had any food failures yet. It cooks evenly, even toast! I very rarely heat up my regular oven because of how useful and functional this oven is. My one star deduction is due to the oven’s fan making a noise when the air-fry or pizza settings are used. The very first time the noise was quite loud and of a screeching/metal on metal sort. It has improved, but there is still a slight noise when these settings are first engaged.",4.0 out of 5 stars
I buy too much from Amazon,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2023","I got this countertop oven for use in an RV, and yes it is 120V. I've only cooked with this a couple of times but will give some initial impressions.

Within the realm of 21st century appliances, this seems to be built decently, and I suspect it will be durable.

The front to back depth of the outer footprint of the oven did surprise me. The measurements they give to one of the product questions does seem to have accurate measurements. If you have a special pan, I encourage you to measure it before you order. This will indeed take a 13 x 9"" pan, but of your pan has handles from the lips on the end, it will likely not fit. My 2.2 Qt Pyrex baking pan fit fine. Note the interior depth is just shy of 12"", and there is a slight slope to the front door, so depth decreases with height. If you 12"" pan really measures 12"", it will not fit.

A note about installation. The manual says to have 4"" of clarence on each side, and not to use under wall cabinets. So good luck with that. I'm sure this is partly CYA, and the exterior sides don't seem to get dangerously hot. The oven has a 170-500*F range.

I have not tried the air fry setting, I'm curious how that will perform. So far, I did a bake and a broil, and both work satisfactorily. I don't know what to make of this no preheat claim. Being a small oven, it does warm up quickly. Here is a description from the manual: 'This oven utilizes a Zero Preheat Technology which is an Innovative Technology that directly targets food. Everything cooked in this oven reaches its optimal temperature fast. The oven cavity temperature alone is not a representative measure for this oven's cooking performance.' OK. And in the troubleshooting section it says: 'When cooking in batches, such as cookies, muffins, etc., the total cooking time may be significantly reduced for the later batches.' Doesn't that fly in the face of the no preheating needed claim? Whatever. It works fine.",5.0 out of 5 stars
lulum,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2023","I am really liking the countertop oven. It comes with a roasting pan and an air fryer basket and a rack that fits in it, in addition to the shelf rack, which can double as a cooling rack because of the v shaped feet on the bottom. When you open the oven, you just press down a button and it opens the door to the top and plays a little tune. The shelf rack slides out making it easier to access with less chance of burning yourself. My 13 x 9 pan fits but doesn’t have handles. If yours does, and it makes it wider, it likely won’t fit.
So far I have made toast, which it did very nicely with even browning, it roasted asparagus and pork loin chops beautifully and cream scones came out a light golden brown. The scones, which I cooked on a 1/4 sheet pan, did require a minute longer but the add 2 minutes button made adding extra time super easy. You can also manually adjust time and temp during your cook if necessary.
There is a chime that rings 1 minute before the timer expires which is convenient. If you install the app you can set/adjust time and temp from it, but you do need to hit the start button on the oven itself when starting the cook. The app does also give you the 1 minute warning notification. It was a breeze to connect to Wi-Fi. Uses a regular electrical plug.
There is no preheat required and it does not heat up the kitchen like my oven does. Also uses a lot less electricity than a my full oven. Take note of measurements and ensure you have enough clearance for your top cupboards, mine are 17.5” and it is more than enough.
So, although it does take some counter real estate, it is not much more than the toaster and air fryer did, both of which will be donated. It also looks a lot nicer. Very happy with this.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Boymom,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2023","I got this oven to go on my counter to replace my toaster and old air fryer. I cook most meals at home and from scratch, and my kitchen is very small. Counter top ovens are great to use in the summer so the house doesn't get heated up by the big oven, and also as an extra oven during the holidays, like for baking pies and such.

This oven worked well as an air fryer. There are about 4-5 russet potatoes sliced on the rack in my pictures. They came out great. The instructions didntecommemd using the cookie sheet as a drip tray which I did, but found the bottoms didn't get a crispy as the tops. Toasting was a breeze. It holds 6-8 slices of bread depending on load size. Toasting was even and it was handy to be able to do everyone's toast at once.

The oven does have a crumb tray that pulls out of the very bottom under the open button.

The center rack self ejects a few inches when the door is opened. The oven comes with a cookie sheet, an air fryer rack, and a wire rack. It has three positions inside.

The front of the oven opens with a push button and pops up on its own. The door rotates up an over the top of the oven, which is a really nice feature, but does require a little extra clearance at the top. 3-4 inches probably.

The top and sides of this oven do get hot. So it will need some clearance on the counter.

The controls are touch controls. They're clearly labeled and easy to use. The timer and number settings are all digital display, bright and large, easy to read. The oven has a light strip on the control panel that fades as it works. It also has musical tunes instead of beeping, it plays when you start, stop, or has any other notification.

This oven works great, fits great on my small counter, and really provides an extra cooking unit that helps cut down on my total prep time. It really is like having a second oven.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JimmyJo,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2023","I noticed that this oven weighs more than my older non-GE oven. Not only is it heavier but also has a larger foot print although a slightly smaller cooking area inside. My old one could accept a 13 inch pizza pan and this one will not. It’s close but not close enough to be able to shut the door. That’s not a big deal for me but worth mentioning.

When I tried to scan the QR code to get the app loaded on my phone I discovered it doesn’t work on IOS IPhone or MacBooks. It’s only for android’s. However if you go to the App Store you can download the app from there.

This has super smart features and may seem a little overwhelming to set up at first but it really wasn’t. Connecting to WiFi was seamless and I love that it gives me alerts on my iPhone and smartwatch. I haven’t had time to use the app much yet but the alerts are very helpful. I was out working in my yard and my watch alerted me that my dinner was near completion and then a few minutes later another alert to let me know it was done.

The basket doesn’t sit perfectly level in the oven but I can see this could just be a one off due to a slightly off center weld causing the rack to sit in place slightly crooked. It slides in and out just fine and works as it should.

I love the fact that there is not pre-heating needed. That alone should save a ton of money in electricity.

My only two issues so far are that the air fryer basket doesn’t sit level although perfectly functional and that the door opens up then folds back over the top. I would prefer the door to go straight and not back. I find that if I store the accessories on top (manual says that is okay to do) that the door bangs into them and makes a lot of noise. Again no big deal, I’ll figure out another location to store the accessories.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Denver Dad Mike,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2023","We're blessed to have a double oven on the wall in our kitchen, but it takes a solid 15-20 minutes to pre-heat to 450 or higher. With 4 hungry kids, sometimes that's just too darn long...

Enter the GE Profile Smart Oven...with NO PREHEATING required. WHAT?!? Yes, instant baking as high as 500 degrees F. That's amazing! Suddenly, those tater tots are done in 12 minutes instead of 45 - no joke. This is an absolute game changer.

So if you have the counter space, this will suddenly become the most used appliance in your kitchen. In the 48 hours we've had it, it has cranked out a flatbread, two batches of tator tots (airfried to perfection), sugar cookies (perfectly crisp, yet soft in the middle), six pieces of toast (at the same time), and 20 pizza bites (better than the oven can produce because of the air frying capability).

And the unexpected perk? It's easy for the kids to use. It's counter height, has a door that gets out of the way to avoid accidental burns, and the settings are simple to use. So, not only is it saving time, it's completely eliminating the need for the adults to run the oven when the kids want a snack.

The only thing that concerns me is the two exposed heating elements on the bottom. I wonder how they're going to hold up when drips such as melted cheese land on them. I also noticed a few dings in the metal housing that appear to have been touched up post assembly with a black paint pen. Seems out of sync with such an expensive appliance.

But...as long as this thing keeps baking, airfrying, reheating, etc. I couldn't care less about a few dings.

I installed the App, and it's fun to get notifications when it's done, but since the kids are the biggest users at the moment, I might turn them off, as I don't need to know every time there's ""1 minute remaining"" or ""cooking complete.""

I absolutely love this guy and look forward to many years of quick and efficient food prep to feed my small army of eaters! Well done, GE.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Francis Tapon,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2023","I love that there is no preheating, that you can control it with your phone, and it opens elegantly!

Here is a summary of the questions and answers:

Q: What are the internal measurements of the oven?

Q: Are recipes included in a book or an app?
A: The owner’s manual offers information on the proper use of each of the 11 cooking modes. This will allow you to follow package directions or your favorite recipes easily. This oven also offers you the ability to connect to your WiFi to take advantage of guided recipes using the SmartHQ app

Q: Will this fit under my wall cabinet?
A: While the oven measures 11 1/2""H, the total height with the door open is 15 1/2"". GE recommends providing 4"" air clearance on all sides of the oven when in operation and do not recommend using the oven while placed under a wall cabinet.

Q: Does this work with Google and Alexa?
A: Yes! This oven will work with Alexa and Google.

Q: Please confirm it fits a 12"" pizza. Does it also fit a 9 x 13"" pan?
A: Yes! This large-capacity countertop oven has enough room for a 12"" pizza or a 13"" x 9"" pan.

CONCLUSION: Although $450 is expensive, this is a high-quality portable, 21st-century oven.",5.0 out of 5 stars
laurelmailcall,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2023","UPDATE: I’m not changing my rating, I just want to say how indispensable this oven has become in the past few months (especially since it has been so hot). In the past week, I’ve used it to make toast, meatballs, and baked salmon. I also tried baking a loaf of bread in it, which honestly worked well apart from the fact that it rose so high that the heating element burned two stripes into the crust and then made it difficult to get the bread out. Not recommended for sandwich loaves, I suppose, but highly recommended for everything else.

I was looking to replace my toaster, and after seeing a surprisingly positive rundown of countertop smart ovens on America’s Test Kitchen, I decided to give this GE model a try. Most of the time I use it as a very expensive toaster, but it does so much more! It reheats frozen baked goods, cooks frozen pizzas, and roasts veggies. I haven’t baked cookies in it yet, but I am looking forward to giving that a try, especially now that the weather is warm and I don’t want to heat up the house with my full oven. The sides and bottom of this oven don’t get very hot, so I feel safe using it on my quartz countertop. I did try to leave at least the 4’’ of recommended clearance on each side. The only downside is that I did not receive a manual or quick start guide in the box. Maybe that’s standard now to save paper, but then I wish it were easier to access online or in the app. I had to dig around quite a bit to find it online, and I’m glad I did, or I would have missed the suggestion to run the oven on air fry for 30 minutes before the first use to burn off any protective coatings on the heating element.",5.0 out of 5 stars

UnderdogMom,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2023","With two kids at home, we feel like short-order cooks sometimes - they want to eat ALL THE TIME. It's so convenient to have a countertop oven PLUS air fryer that lets us quickly make them snacks, frozen food like little pizzas and tacos, etc. Even better that this one heats up so fast, there is no preheating phase required! Super duper convenient. We have tried all the functions and everything works like it should. Love that it has so many different options and pre-sets that make it so easy to use. It's pretty foolproof. It toasts things like bagels so much more evenly than our toaster.

The air fryer makes a big difference in ""crisping"" foods like fish sticks and nuggets. You'd think it would get really messy in there from frying, but it doesn't really - and it's super easy to wipe down and clean. I do recommend you clean it out every time you use it, for us that's pretty much daily.

For nights when our kids aren't here, we can do a dinner for two in this quickly. I even used it to make cookies recently and they turned out great. We are finding lots of ways to use it, and it will be nice this summer to not have to preheat the big oven as much. It's getting a lot of use here. Love it!",5.0 out of 5 stars

DMNSR,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2023",I am getting rid of my other air fryers! I have three and don't really use them. Why? Because they are either too small or too hard to use and take up way more counter space. This is a great size. Love all the options that make it more than just an air fryer. My son can cook his own biscuits and rolls without using the big scary oven. He can even cook cookies! You can't use a power strip. I kind of knew that but didn't really have another location with a plug. I found another place for it. Over all I really really like it. I have a learning curve to using it because it cook different. It comes with instructions and I will have to keep that handy. Most of my appliances are GE and I am happy with them! I am sure I will be just as happy with this! Did mention it looks really nice!

SMK,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2023","Yes, its big, but it works really well. The heat time is almost instantaneous and is why they do not have a preheat option on it. The inside is more than big enough for a standard frozen pizza. I know some people are complaining about not being able to fit certain size pans in there, but pay close attention to the size. This isnt a full size oven, but still big enough for most purposes. And I love the fact that it goes to 500F. Almost no countertop oven goes to 500, so this is a big plus. Its really well built and heavy so you will need some muscle to move it around and some major counterspace for it. Its pretty expensive, but it does work very well. This is by the best countertop oven I ever owned.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Invisible Woman,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2023","The new oven is really nice. The crumb tray is quite convenient to remove for cleaning. The wire rack is easy to pull out or leave hooked in. The glass door moves nicely out of the way, but the glass window fogs up whenever I’m toasting something. Also, its doesn't have nasty sounding alarm like so many other cooking appliances.

Its got lots of features that I haven't tried yet. I wanted a bigger toaster oven/air fryer that was simple enough for my son to use for toasting and large enough for me to air fry a reasonable quantity and this works.

Also, I was really worried it would be to complicated and it really isn't. I don't like appliances where you have to memorize a bunch of stuff to use it. This one has a very simple manual and that is all it needs.",5.0 out of 5 stars

MS Globetrotter,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2023","I took my time getting to this review because I wanted to try a variety of cooking modes. Spoiler: every cooking even I've tried so far has been a success.

For the past few years I've been using a highly rated Panasonic toaster oven with the Flash Xpress feature. It does a terrific job at rapidly heating. It sells for considerably less than this. But the capacity of that toaster oven is pretty typically limited. So when I saw this ""smart oven"" I wondered right away whether this could perform similar heating tricks. Then when I read that I could even bake a pizza and do air frying, I started to get way more interested. If it can do all of the things that GE claims, it would be worth the price.

We took our conventional toaster oven off the kitchen counter and hefted this up in its place. It's somewhat wider higher and deeper but not overwhelmingly so; it does not dominate the counter space.

First up: we prepared our favorite thin crust frozen pizza with Italian sausage. As promised, no preheating was necessary. I followed the package's time and temperature instructions as we have always done in our larger standalone oven with convection. The result was superior to our conventional oven. The edges were lightly browned and the crust was just slightly crisp-- exactly how we wanted it-- and never quite achieved with our conventional oven. My only observation is that I might reduce baking time by a minute or two next time. That evening I reheated a leftover slice and somehow the oven warmed it through without burning or toughening the crust. (Another reviewer says their pizza won't fit. I can't imagine what colossal product they tried. We used a standard size pizza without the slightest cramping of space.)

For breakfast the next morning I made frozen waffles. The results were excellent: the interior of the waffles were somewhat cakey and the exterior lightly browned and slightly crisp. (Tip after 3 months of experience: if you want crisp outside and cakey inside, bake in convection mode first at 200 degrees to thaw for 2-3 minutes. Then finish at 400 degrees for another 3 minutes or so. I never thought store brand frozen waffles could be so distinctively good.)

This morning I toasted a bagel for myself and an English muffin for my spouse. Great results again.

For lunch today I made frozen Korean style chicken nuggets from Costco in the air fryer basket. I followed the oven instructions and placed the included tray on the level beneath the air fryer basket. This is a precaution to catch any oil or other drippings. Again I used the packaging time and temperature instructions. The results again bested our conventional oven. The battered exterior had almost a tempura-like airy delicate quality but maintained a crispy crunch.

If there's a downside to this, I'm not finding it. The status panel is very well layed out and it's clear what buttons to press. I did peruse the user manual but I think most people could start using this oven straight out of the box. It chimes a 60-second pre-warning before cooking completes.

If you do connect this to your home wifi, the app will send a notification to your smartphone when cooking is done. Alexa immediately discovered this addition to the household. And I was also able to add this appliance in my Google Home app. I hasten to add that as of this review, the app doesn't provide fancy customization features but I wouldn't be surprised if they get added later. This is a new product.

This is not an impulse purchase at this price. But I'm already convinced that this provides reasonable value. It can do anything a toaster oven can do-- and better. It can substitute for an air fryer. It swallows a whole pizza and delivers it faster because preheating is not required. It reduces our reliance on our conventional oven which probably means lower electricity bills.

I was a little worried that this product was going to disappoint me by just mimicking toaster ovens with a prettier outer shell. I was wrong. My apprehension was dissolved a little bit more each time I have used it-- right up to lunch today.

My old toaster oven is going to be pretty lonely sitting on a garage shelf.

UPDATE Three months later:
My enthusiasm for this oven has not decreased over time. Quite the opposite. It just quietly does it's job. I did discover when I baked a frozen apple pie that it's wise to slightly lower the temperature and time from the package instructions. I kinda like a slightly burned upper crust edge so I wasn't upset. But next time I will make that adjustment. What won my approval was that the bottom crust wasn't soggy at all. I don't know about you but if you don't care about crust you can just eat pie filling right out of the can.

I put the pie in this oven and set the timer for the recommended one hour and went to visit a neighbor. The aroma on returning was a great welcome home. Love, love, love this oven.

I am careful with money but this thing really earns it's keep around our kitchen. We hardly use the big stove anymore.

One more tip:

This is the first time I've ever had to go back and edit a review of a product, but this issue warrants that. All in all, I do still like this smart oven, but over the last few weeks, it's started making a very loud rattling noise whenever it is air frying or using the convection fan. It is really obnoxious. If I give it a good thump, sometimes it will stop for awhile, but it'll just start up again. Once I turn it off, as it's spooling down, you hear some extra whack, whack, whacks as the fan comes to a stop. I can tell that the fan has come loose whether from incorrect manufacturing or from shipping, I'm not sure.
We decided to try seeing if we could tighten the fan ourselves - what a mess that was! It is almost impossible to access the set screw that we need to tighten. After taking out at least 40 screws and all the covers, we still weren't able to access the back panel to tighten that screw!! Ugh!! Extremely frustrating. We also discovered that many of the screws that we removed were already stripped out from over-tightening at the factory, so it's just a matter of time before those all start backing out on their own and making new rattles. :(
We finally gave up and accepted defeat and put everything back together, not having accomplished anything helpful. I have gotten the rattling noise to stop for now by propping the front feet of the oven up slightly to keep the fan from hitting the front cover, but who knows how long that will help? It's just a matter of time before the set screw comes completely out and the whole fan falls off. At that point, I'll no longer be able to use the air fry or convection features. :(
I hate to leave a poor review, but this oven is not holding up well to regular usage. I'm hoping that this is a fluke with this particular machine maybe from shipping or something and that others who have purchased it don't have similar issues, but I needed to let folks know my experience.

Original Review:
I love toaster ovens. I've always thought that they are the most underrated appliance a kitchen can have, especially for households with only 1-2 people in them. Not having to heat up an entire full sized oven every meal saves on utility bills and from heating your house up more in the summertime. So when I saw this little gem that can also do things like airfry, it was a no-brainer to get.
This unit sits a little deeper than my traditional toaster oven, but is slightly narrower width wise which is nice. The user interface is really easy to work with and feels so futuristic and high tech! 😅 It even greets you with a cheerful little jingle when you turn it on and it alerts you when it has one minute of cook time left and of course, when it's done. I wish there was a way to turn off or change the tune as it drives my husband crazy, but oh well. 😜
The no preheat feature is awesome. I was skeptical at first, but this thing heats up so fast it's incredible! So, I love that feature as it saves so much time!
The self presenting rack is a cool feature that helps prevent me from burning myself by reaching into the hot oven to pull things out or test for doneness, so that was another neat extra feature. I do wish that the door design was a little different, maybe no push button and just manual lift? The button is cool and all, but I just have a feeling that is going to be the first thing to break, and then what will you do? I'm old school and a little leery of things like that, what can I say?
The airfry works really well and it's so nice to not have to have a separate appliance just for that!
I did go ahead and add a Teflon liner to the very bottom of mine (being careful to make sure it's not touching any of the heating elements) to make for easier cleanup especially after airfrying.
I think this is an awesome little unit and am so excited to discover the plethora of other features that it has!",3.0 out of 5 stars
Left Blank,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2023","Nice unit, when it works. Less than 60 days after getting the unit (from a well known retailer), the fan in the air fryer section now makes a metal on metal grinding noise that is getting worse. I do not feel it is safe to use and have explained this to multiple GE ""customer service reps"". I have tried working with GE for a replacement and they keep wanting to repair the unit rather than replace the unit. The first service company said they basically don't repair toaster ovens, it should be replaced. GE insisted on contacting another service company and am now waiting for another attempt at service. All this right before Thanksgiving. I personally will NEVER purchase another GE product and be aware if the unit fails outside of the return window. Good Luck!

I love that it does not require pre-heating; this is especially great in the Summer months when you want to limit the extra heat generated from cooking. It also helps you to get food cooked and ready to eat more quickly, which is really nice when I don’t have much time for meals. I love the versatility of the oven, especially that it can air-fry food too! The oven is not too large, and it has a modern look. Operating this oven is fairly intuitive and I have not had any food failures yet. It cooks evenly, even toast! I very rarely heat up my regular oven because of how useful and functional this oven is. My one star deduction is due to the oven’s fan making a noise when the air-fry or pizza settings are used. The very first time the noise was quite loud and of a screeching/metal on metal sort. It has improved, but there is still a slight noise when these settings are first engaged.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The control panel is glossy glass and does show fingerprints but that's a minor issue because it wipes off clean. It is a large oven able to fit 2-6 slices of bread, but when you pop open the door the shelf extends out for easy reach and the door lifts, so there is no chance of getting burnt.
The quality of the build is second to none, even better than some of the other $$$ high-end toaster-oven/air fryers.

JBertz,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023","I use a countertop oven because my regular oven is too large for what I cook and a pain to clean. I have been using one for about 5 years and my first one finally died. When I went out to look at them in person I was shocked on how flimsy the doors were and how light weight and cheap all the racks were. I decided I was going to have to pay a little more for a higher quality countertop oven. I found myself stuck with the Wolf, the top of the line Breville or this little gem I ran into at Crate and Barrel. If you are looking for a large countertop oven where you can cook turkeys then this is probably not a smart buy. If you are looking for something that cook within the size of 9 by 13 with no handles or 12 inch pizza with no handles then I highly recommend this. Some of my first day pros are that the oven made no noise. I had to check it a couple times to make sure it was still cooking. It is so much better to put your food in before you start the oven than after it is hot from preheating. The light is very bright to see your food. The food cooked much better than my old countertop oven and did not splatter grease all over the place. It did this without radiating heat through my small kitchen. The oven door is the best on the market. The baking rack pulls out when the door opens and is locked in position until you want to manually move it. This keeps the rack from sliding out when you are taking hot things out of it. Some cons I have found on this oven is the manufacturer at this point does not sell replacement racks, air fryer basket or sheet pan. They do not sell a pizza pan for the oven either. At the same time when I talked to them they seem pretty cool on the fact that I could use my own baking products. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to cook meals for one or two individuals using it's multiple methods of cooking as it is not the biggest one out there, but I feel it's quality is much better.

Update: So very easy to clean and all the grease came off very easy.",5.0 out of 5 stars

But it's not just about the no preheat feature. The 11 preset functions, ranging from Air Fry to Bake and Bagel, offer unmatched versatility. Whether whipping up a quick snack or preparing a feast for the family, this oven has got me covered.

The one-touch, high-rise door is another thoughtful addition. It provides extra clearance on the countertop and ensures safety by eliminating the need to reach over a hot door.

Setting and adjusting time and temperature using voice commands feels futuristic and makes the cooking process even more seamless.

I buy too much from Amazon,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2023","I got this countertop oven for use in an RV, and yes it is 120V. I've only cooked with this a couple of times but will give some initial impressions.

Within the realm of 21st century appliances, this seems to be built decently, and I suspect it will be durable.

The front to back depth of the outer footprint of the oven did surprise me. The measurements they give to one of the product questions does seem to have accurate measurements. If you have a special pan, I encourage you to measure it before you order. This will indeed take a 13 x 9"" pan, but of your pan has handles from the lips on the end, it will likely not fit. My 2.2 Qt Pyrex baking pan fit fine. Note the interior depth is just shy of 12"", and there is a slight slope to the front door, so depth decreases with height. If you 12"" pan really measures 12"", it will not fit.

A note about installation. The manual says to have 4"" of clarence on each side, and not to use under wall cabinets. So good luck with that. I'm sure this is partly CYA, and the exterior sides don't seem to get dangerously hot. The oven has a 170-500*F range.

I have not tried the air fry setting, I'm curious how that will perform. So far, I did a bake and a broil, and both work satisfactorily. I don't know what to make of this no preheat claim. Being a small oven, it does warm up quickly. Here is a description from the manual: 'This oven utilizes a Zero Preheat Technology which is an Innovative Technology that directly targets food. Everything cooked in this oven reaches its optimal temperature fast. The oven cavity temperature alone is not a representative measure for this oven's cooking performance.' OK. And in the troubleshooting section it says: 'When cooking in batches, such as cookies, muffins, etc., the total cooking time may be significantly reduced for the later batches.' Doesn't that fly in the face of the no preheating needed claim? Whatever. It works fine.",5.0 out of 5 stars
lulum,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2023","I am really liking the countertop oven. It comes with a roasting pan and an air fryer basket and a rack that fits in it, in addition to the shelf rack, which can double as a cooling rack because of the v shaped feet on the bottom. When you open the oven, you just press down a button and it opens the door to the top and plays a little tune. The shelf rack slides out making it easier to access with less chance of burning yourself. My 13 x 9 pan fits but doesn’t have handles. If yours does, and it makes it wider, it likely won’t fit.
So far I have made toast, which it did very nicely with even browning, it roasted asparagus and pork loin chops beautifully and cream scones came out a light golden brown. The scones, which I cooked on a 1/4 sheet pan, did require a minute longer but the add 2 minutes button made adding extra time super easy. You can also manually adjust time and temp during your cook if necessary.
There is a chime that rings 1 minute before the timer expires which is convenient. If you install the app you can set/adjust time and temp from it, but you do need to hit the start button on the oven itself when starting the cook. The app does also give you the 1 minute warning notification. It was a breeze to connect to Wi-Fi. Uses a regular electrical plug.
There is no preheat required and it does not heat up the kitchen like my oven does. Also uses a lot less electricity than a my full oven. Take note of measurements and ensure you have enough clearance for your top cupboards, mine are 17.5” and it is more than enough.
So, although it does take some counter real estate, it is not much more than the toaster and air fryer did, both of which will be donated. It also looks a lot nicer. Very happy with this.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Boymom,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2023","I got this oven to go on my counter to replace my toaster and old air fryer. I cook most meals at home and from scratch, and my kitchen is very small. Counter top ovens are great to use in the summer so the house doesn't get heated up by the big oven, and also as an extra oven during the holidays, like for baking pies and such.

This oven worked well as an air fryer. There are about 4-5 russet potatoes sliced on the rack in my pictures. They came out great. The instructions didntecommemd using the cookie sheet as a drip tray which I did, but found the bottoms didn't get a crispy as the tops. Toasting was a breeze. It holds 6-8 slices of bread depending on load size. Toasting was even and it was handy to be able to do everyone's toast at once.

The oven does have a crumb tray that pulls out of the very bottom under the open button.

The center rack self ejects a few inches when the door is opened. The oven comes with a cookie sheet, an air fryer rack, and a wire rack. It has three positions inside.

The front of the oven opens with a push button and pops up on its own. The door rotates up an over the top of the oven, which is a really nice feature, but does require a little extra clearance at the top. 3-4 inches probably.

The top and sides of this oven do get hot. So it will need some clearance on the counter.

The controls are touch controls. They're clearly labeled and easy to use. The timer and number settings are all digital display, bright and large, easy to read. The oven has a light strip on the control panel that fades as it works. It also has musical tunes instead of beeping, it plays when you start, stop, or has any other notification.

This oven works great, fits great on my small counter, and really provides an extra cooking unit that helps cut down on my total prep time. It really is like having a second oven.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JimmyJo,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2023","I noticed that this oven weighs more than my older non-GE oven. Not only is it heavier but also has a larger foot print although a slightly smaller cooking area inside. My old one could accept a 13 inch pizza pan and this one will not. It’s close but not close enough to be able to shut the door. That’s not a big deal for me but worth mentioning.

When I tried to scan the QR code to get the app loaded on my phone I discovered it doesn’t work on IOS IPhone or MacBooks. It’s only for android’s. However if you go to the App Store you can download the app from there.

This has super smart features and may seem a little overwhelming to set up at first but it really wasn’t. Connecting to WiFi was seamless and I love that it gives me alerts on my iPhone and smartwatch. I haven’t had time to use the app much yet but the alerts are very helpful. I was out working in my yard and my watch alerted me that my dinner was near completion and then a few minutes later another alert to let me know it was done.

The basket doesn’t sit perfectly level in the oven but I can see this could just be a one off due to a slightly off center weld causing the rack to sit in place slightly crooked. It slides in and out just fine and works as it should.

I love the fact that there is not pre-heating needed. That alone should save a ton of money in electricity.

My only two issues so far are that the air fryer basket doesn’t sit level although perfectly functional and that the door opens up then folds back over the top. I would prefer the door to go straight and not back. I find that if I store the accessories on top (manual says that is okay to do) that the door bangs into them and makes a lot of noise. Again no big deal, I’ll figure out another location to store the accessories.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Denver Dad Mike,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2023","We're blessed to have a double oven on the wall in our kitchen, but it takes a solid 15-20 minutes to pre-heat to 450 or higher. With 4 hungry kids, sometimes that's just too darn long...

Enter the GE Profile Smart Oven...with NO PREHEATING required. WHAT?!? Yes, instant baking as high as 500 degrees F. That's amazing! Suddenly, those tater tots are done in 12 minutes instead of 45 - no joke. This is an absolute game changer.

So if you have the counter space, this will suddenly become the most used appliance in your kitchen. In the 48 hours we've had it, it has cranked out a flatbread, two batches of tator tots (airfried to perfection), sugar cookies (perfectly crisp, yet soft in the middle), six pieces of toast (at the same time), and 20 pizza bites (better than the oven can produce because of the air frying capability).

And the unexpected perk? It's easy for the kids to use. It's counter height, has a door that gets out of the way to avoid accidental burns, and the settings are simple to use. So, not only is it saving time, it's completely eliminating the need for the adults to run the oven when the kids want a snack.

The only thing that concerns me is the two exposed heating elements on the bottom. I wonder how they're going to hold up when drips such as melted cheese land on them. I also noticed a few dings in the metal housing that appear to have been touched up post assembly with a black paint pen. Seems out of sync with such an expensive appliance.

But...as long as this thing keeps baking, airfrying, reheating, etc. I couldn't care less about a few dings.

I installed the App, and it's fun to get notifications when it's done, but since the kids are the biggest users at the moment, I might turn them off, as I don't need to know every time there's ""1 minute remaining"" or ""cooking complete.""

I absolutely love this guy and look forward to many years of quick and efficient food prep to feed my small army of eaters! Well done, GE.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Francis Tapon,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2023","I love that there is no preheating, that you can control it with your phone, and it opens elegantly!

Here is a summary of the questions and answers:

Q: What are the internal measurements of the oven?
A: The usable interior space is 13 5/8” W x 11 ¾” D x 5 ½” H. This large-capacity countertop oven has enough room for a 12"" pizza, a 13"" x 9"" sheet cake or up to 7 lbs. of chicken.

Q: How do you clean the inside of the door?
A: Wait until the oven has cooled down completely, then hold the door by the handle with one hand while wiping the inner side of the glass with a soft, damp cloth. If the door is severely stained or dirty, use a towel saturated with a diluted solution of a mild dishwashing liquid. Be sure to remove all detergent residue with a dampened clean cloth.

Q: Are recipes included in a book or an app?
A: The owner’s manual offers information on the proper use of each of the 11 cooking modes. This will allow you to follow package directions or your favorite recipes easily. This oven also offers you the ability to connect to your WiFi to take advantage of guided recipes using the SmartHQ app

Q: Will this fit under my wall cabinet?
A: While the oven measures 11 1/2""H, the total height with the door open is 15 1/2"". GE recommends providing 4"" air clearance on all sides of the oven when in operation and do not recommend using the oven while placed under a wall cabinet.

Q: Does this work with Google and Alexa?
A: Yes! This oven will work with Alexa and Google.

Q: Please confirm it fits a 12"" pizza. Does it also fit a 9 x 13"" pan?
A: Yes! This large-capacity countertop oven has enough room for a 12"" pizza or a 13"" x 9"" pan.

CONCLUSION: Although $450 is expensive, this is a high-quality portable, 21st-century oven.",5.0 out of 5 stars
laurelmailcall,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2023","UPDATE: I’m not changing my rating, I just want to say how indispensable this oven has become in the past few months (especially since it has been so hot). In the past week, I’ve used it to make toast, meatballs, and baked salmon. I also tried baking a loaf of bread in it, which honestly worked well apart from the fact that it rose so high that the heating element burned two stripes into the crust and then made it difficult to get the bread out. Not recommended for sandwich loaves, I suppose, but highly recommended for everything else.

I was looking to replace my toaster, and after seeing a surprisingly positive rundown of countertop smart ovens on America’s Test Kitchen, I decided to give this GE model a try. Most of the time I use it as a very expensive toaster, but it does so much more! It reheats frozen baked goods, cooks frozen pizzas, and roasts veggies. I haven’t baked cookies in it yet, but I am looking forward to giving that a try, especially now that the weather is warm and I don’t want to heat up the house with my full oven. The sides and bottom of this oven don’t get very hot, so I feel safe using it on my quartz countertop. I did try to leave at least the 4’’ of recommended clearance on each side. The only downside is that I did not receive a manual or quick start guide in the box. Maybe that’s standard now to save paper, but then I wish it were easier to access online or in the app. I had to dig around quite a bit to find it online, and I’m glad I did, or I would have missed the suggestion to run the oven on air fry for 30 minutes before the first use to burn off any protective coatings on the heating element.",5.0 out of 5 stars
UnderdogMom,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2023","With two kids at home, we feel like short-order cooks sometimes - they want to eat ALL THE TIME. It's so convenient to have a countertop oven PLUS air fryer that lets us quickly make them snacks, frozen food like little pizzas and tacos, etc. Even better that this one heats up so fast, there is no preheating phase required! Super duper convenient. We have tried all the functions and everything works like it should. Love that it has so many different options and pre-sets that make it so easy to use. It's pretty foolproof. It toasts things like bagels so much more evenly than our toaster.

The air fryer makes a big difference in ""crisping"" foods like fish sticks and nuggets. You'd think it would get really messy in there from frying, but it doesn't really - and it's super easy to wipe down and clean. I do recommend you clean it out every time you use it, for us that's pretty much daily.

For nights when our kids aren't here, we can do a dinner for two in this quickly. I even used it to make cookies recently and they turned out great. We are finding lots of ways to use it, and it will be nice this summer to not have to preheat the big oven as much. It's getting a lot of use here. Love it!",5.0 out of 5 stars

DMNSR,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2023",I am getting rid of my other air fryers! I have three and don't really use them. Why? Because they are either too small or too hard to use and take up way more counter space. This is a great size. Love all the options that make it more than just an air fryer. My son can cook his own biscuits and rolls without using the big scary oven. He can even cook cookies! You can't use a power strip. I kind of knew that but didn't really have another location with a plug. I found another place for it. Over all I really really like it. I have a learning curve to using it because it cook different. It comes with instructions and I will have to keep that handy. Most of my appliances are GE and I am happy with them! I am sure I will be just as happy with this! Did mention it looks really nice!

SMK,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2023","Yes, its big, but it works really well. The heat time is almost instantaneous and is why they do not have a preheat option on it. The inside is more than big enough for a standard frozen pizza. I know some people are complaining about not being able to fit certain size pans in there, but pay close attention to the size. This isnt a full size oven, but still big enough for most purposes. And I love the fact that it goes to 500F. Almost no countertop oven goes to 500, so this is a big plus. Its really well built and heavy so you will need some muscle to move it around and some major counterspace for it. Its pretty expensive, but it does work very well. This is by the best countertop oven I ever owned.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Invisible Woman,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2023","The new oven is really nice. The crumb tray is quite convenient to remove for cleaning. The wire rack is easy to pull out or leave hooked in. The glass door moves nicely out of the way, but the glass window fogs up whenever I’m toasting something. Also, its doesn't have nasty sounding alarm like so many other cooking appliances.

Its got lots of features that I haven't tried yet. I wanted a bigger toaster oven/air fryer that was simple enough for my son to use for toasting and large enough for me to air fry a reasonable quantity and this works.

Also, I was really worried it would be to complicated and it really isn't. I don't like appliances where you have to memorize a bunch of stuff to use it. This one has a very simple manual and that is all it needs.",5.0 out of 5 stars
MS Globetrotter,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2023","I took my time getting to this review because I wanted to try a variety of cooking modes. Spoiler: every cooking even I've tried so far has been a success.

For the past few years I've been using a highly rated Panasonic toaster oven with the Flash Xpress feature. It does a terrific job at rapidly heating. It sells for considerably less than this. But the capacity of that toaster oven is pretty typically limited. So when I saw this ""smart oven"" I wondered right away whether this could perform similar heating tricks. Then when I read that I could even bake a pizza and do air frying, I started to get way more interested. If it can do all of the things that GE claims, it would be worth the price.

We took our conventional toaster oven off the kitchen counter and hefted this up in its place. It's somewhat wider higher and deeper but not overwhelmingly so; it does not dominate the counter space.

First up: we prepared our favorite thin crust frozen pizza with Italian sausage. As promised, no preheating was necessary. I followed the package's time and temperature instructions as we have always done in our larger standalone oven with convection. The result was superior to our conventional oven. The edges were lightly browned and the crust was just slightly crisp-- exactly how we wanted it-- and never quite achieved with our conventional oven. My only observation is that I might reduce baking time by a minute or two next time. That evening I reheated a leftover slice and somehow the oven warmed it through without burning or toughening the crust. (Another reviewer says their pizza won't fit. I can't imagine what colossal product they tried. We used a standard size pizza without the slightest cramping of space.)

For breakfast the next morning I made frozen waffles. The results were excellent: the interior of the waffles were somewhat cakey and the exterior lightly browned and slightly crisp. (Tip after 3 months of experience: if you want crisp outside and cakey inside, bake in convection mode first at 200 degrees to thaw for 2-3 minutes. Then finish at 400 degrees for another 3 minutes or so. I never thought store brand frozen waffles could be so distinctively good.)

This morning I toasted a bagel for myself and an English muffin for my spouse. Great results again.

For lunch today I made frozen Korean style chicken nuggets from Costco in the air fryer basket. I followed the oven instructions and placed the included tray on the level beneath the air fryer basket. This is a precaution to catch any oil or other drippings. Again I used the packaging time and temperature instructions. The results again bested our conventional oven. The battered exterior had almost a tempura-like airy delicate quality but maintained a crispy crunch.

If there's a downside to this, I'm not finding it. The status panel is very well layed out and it's clear what buttons to press. I did peruse the user manual but I think most people could start using this oven straight out of the box. It chimes a 60-second pre-warning before cooking completes.

If you do connect this to your home wifi, the app will send a notification to your smartphone when cooking is done. Alexa immediately discovered this addition to the household. And I was also able to add this appliance in my Google Home app. I hasten to add that as of this review, the app doesn't provide fancy customization features but I wouldn't be surprised if they get added later. This is a new product.

This is not an impulse purchase at this price. But I'm already convinced that this provides reasonable value. It can do anything a toaster oven can do-- and better. It can substitute for an air fryer. It swallows a whole pizza and delivers it faster because preheating is not required. It reduces our reliance on our conventional oven which probably means lower electricity bills.

I was a little worried that this product was going to disappoint me by just mimicking toaster ovens with a prettier outer shell. I was wrong. My apprehension was dissolved a little bit more each time I have used it-- right up to lunch today.

My old toaster oven is going to be pretty lonely sitting on a garage shelf.

UPDATE Three months later:
My enthusiasm for this oven has not decreased over time. Quite the opposite. It just quietly does it's job. I did discover when I baked a frozen apple pie that it's wise to slightly lower the temperature and time from the package instructions. I kinda like a slightly burned upper crust edge so I wasn't upset. But next time I will make that adjustment. What won my approval was that the bottom crust wasn't soggy at all. I don't know about you but if you don't care about crust you can just eat pie filling right out of the can.

I put the pie in this oven and set the timer for the recommended one hour and went to visit a neighbor. The aroma on returning was a great welcome home. Love, love, love this oven.

I am careful with money but this thing really earns it's keep around our kitchen. We hardly use the big stove anymore.

One more tip:
The frozen pot pies I buy warn you not to use a toaster oven. I figured they were talking about my old conventional one. But I am here to tell you-- this is one thing you should NOT cook in this smart oven. (I was the stupid one.)",5.0 out of 5 stars

The control panel is glossy glass and does show fingerprints but that's a minor issue because it wipes off clean. It is a large oven able to fit 2-6 slices of bread, but when you pop open the door the shelf extends out for easy reach and the door lifts, so there is no chance of getting burnt.
The quality of the build is second to none, even better than some of the other $$$ high-end toaster-oven/air fryers.

The standout feature for me is undoubtedly the ""No Preheat"" function. Gone are the days of waiting for the oven to reach the desired temperature. With zero preheat technology, I can dive straight into cooking, saving precious time and energy.

But it's not just about the no preheat feature. The 11 preset functions, ranging from Air Fry to Bake and Bagel, offer unmatched versatility. Whether whipping up a quick snack or preparing a feast for the family, this oven has got me covered.

The one-touch, high-rise door is another thoughtful addition. It provides extra clearance on the countertop and ensures safety by eliminating the need to reach over a hot door. And speaking of smart features, the voice control is a delightful touch. Setting and adjusting time and temperature using voice commands feels futuristic and makes the cooking process even more seamless.

It also helps you to get food cooked and ready to eat more quickly, which is really nice when I don’t have much time for meals. I love the versatility of the oven, especially that it can air-fry food too! The oven is not too large, and it has a modern look. Operating this oven is fairly intuitive and I have not had any food failures yet. It cooks evenly, even toast! I very rarely heat up my regular oven because of how useful and functional this oven is. My one star deduction is due to the oven’s fan making a noise when the air-fry or pizza settings are used. The very first time the noise was quite loud and of a screeching/metal on metal sort. It has improved, but there is still a slight noise when these settings are first engaged.",4.0 out of 5 stars

JBertz,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023","I use a countertop oven because my regular oven is too large for what I cook and a pain to clean. I have been using one for about 5 years and my first one finally died. When I went out to look at them in person I was shocked on how flimsy the doors were and how light weight and cheap all the racks were. I decided I was going to have to pay a little more for a higher quality countertop oven. I found myself stuck with the Wolf, the top of the line Breville or this little gem I ran into at Crate and Barrel. If you are looking for a large countertop oven where you can cook turkeys then this is probably not a smart buy. If you are looking for something that cook within the size of 9 by 13 with no handles or 12 inch pizza with no handles then I highly recommend this. Some of my first day pros are that the oven made no noise. I had to check it a couple times to make sure it was still cooking. It is so much better to put your food in before you start the oven than after it is hot from preheating. The light is very bright to see your food. The food cooked much better than my old countertop oven and did not splatter grease all over the place. It did this without radiating heat through my small kitchen. The oven door is the best on the market. The baking rack pulls out when the door opens and is locked in position until you want to manually move it. This keeps the rack from sliding out when you are taking hot things out of it. Some cons I have found on this oven is the manufacturer at this point does not sell replacement racks, air fryer basket or sheet pan. They do not sell a pizza pan for the oven either. At the same time when I talked to them they seem pretty cool on the fact that I could use my own baking products. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to cook meals for one or two individuals using it's multiple methods of cooking as it is not the biggest one out there, but I feel it's quality is much better.

Update: So very easy to clean and all the grease came off very easy.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Boymom,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2023","I got this oven to go on my counter to replace my toaster and old air fryer. I cook most meals at home and from scratch, and my kitchen is very small. Counter top ovens are great to use in the summer so the house doesn't get heated up by the big oven, and also as an extra oven during the holidays, like for baking pies and such.

This oven worked well as an air fryer. There are about 4-5 russet potatoes sliced on the rack in my pictures. They came out great. The instructions didntecommemd using the cookie sheet as a drip tray which I did, but found the bottoms didn't get a crispy as the tops. Toasting was a breeze. It holds 6-8 slices of bread depending on load size. Toasting was even and it was handy to be able to do everyone's toast at once.

The oven does have a crumb tray that pulls out of the very bottom under the open button.

The center rack self ejects a few inches when the door is opened. The oven comes with a cookie sheet, an air fryer rack, and a wire rack. It has three positions inside.

The front of the oven opens with a push button and pops up on its own. The door rotates up an over the top of the oven, which is a really nice feature, but does require a little extra clearance at the top. 3-4 inches probably.

The top and sides of this oven do get hot. So it will need some clearance on the counter.

The controls are touch controls. They're clearly labeled and easy to use. The timer and number settings are all digital display, bright and large, easy to read. The oven has a light strip on the control panel that fades as it works. It also has musical tunes instead of beeping, it plays when you start, stop, or has any other notification.

This oven works great, fits great on my small counter, and really provides an extra cooking unit that helps cut down on my total prep time. It really is like having a second oven.",5.0 out of 5 stars
MS Globetrotter,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2023","I took my time getting to this review because I wanted to try a variety of cooking modes. Spoiler: every cooking even I've tried so far has been a success.

For the past few years I've been using a highly rated Panasonic toaster oven with the Flash Xpress feature. It does a terrific job at rapidly heating. It sells for considerably less than this. But the capacity of that toaster oven is pretty typically limited. So when I saw this ""smart oven"" I wondered right away whether this could perform similar heating tricks. Then when I read that I could even bake a pizza and do air frying, I started to get way more interested. If it can do all of the things that GE claims, it would be worth the price.

We took our conventional toaster oven off the kitchen counter and hefted this up in its place. It's somewhat wider higher and deeper but not overwhelmingly so; it does not dominate the counter space.

First up: we prepared our favorite thin crust frozen pizza with Italian sausage. As promised, no preheating was necessary. I followed the package's time and temperature instructions as we have always done in our larger standalone oven with convection. The result was superior to our conventional oven. The edges were lightly browned and the crust was just slightly crisp-- exactly how we wanted it-- and never quite achieved with our conventional oven. My only observation is that I might reduce baking time by a minute or two next time. That evening I reheated a leftover slice and somehow the oven warmed it through without burning or toughening the crust. (Another reviewer says their pizza won't fit. I can't imagine what colossal product they tried. We used a standard size pizza without the slightest cramping of space.)

For breakfast the next morning I made frozen waffles. The results were excellent: the interior of the waffles were somewhat cakey and the exterior lightly browned and slightly crisp. (Tip after 3 months of experience: if you want crisp outside and cakey inside, bake in convection mode first at 200 degrees to thaw for 2-3 minutes. Then finish at 400 degrees for another 3 minutes or so. I never thought store brand frozen waffles could be so distinctively good.)

This morning I toasted a bagel for myself and an English muffin for my spouse. Great results again.

For lunch today I made frozen Korean style chicken nuggets from Costco in the air fryer basket. I followed the oven instructions and placed the included tray on the level beneath the air fryer basket. This is a precaution to catch any oil or other drippings. Again I used the packaging time and temperature instructions. The results again bested our conventional oven. The battered exterior had almost a tempura-like airy delicate quality but maintained a crispy crunch.

If there's a downside to this, I'm not finding it. The status panel is very well layed out and it's clear what buttons to press. I did peruse the user manual but I think most people could start using this oven straight out of the box. It chimes a 60-second pre-warning before cooking completes.

If you do connect this to your home wifi, the app will send a notification to your smartphone when cooking is done. Alexa immediately discovered this addition to the household. And I was also able to add this appliance in my Google Home app. I hasten to add that as of this review, the app doesn't provide fancy customization features but I wouldn't be surprised if they get added later. This is a new product.

This is not an impulse purchase at this price. But I'm already convinced that this provides reasonable value. It can do anything a toaster oven can do-- and better. It can substitute for an air fryer. It swallows a whole pizza and delivers it faster because preheating is not required. It reduces our reliance on our conventional oven which probably means lower electricity bills.

I was a little worried that this product was going to disappoint me by just mimicking toaster ovens with a prettier outer shell. I was wrong. My apprehension was dissolved a little bit more each time I have used it-- right up to lunch today.

My old toaster oven is going to be pretty lonely sitting on a garage shelf.

UPDATE Three months later:
My enthusiasm for this oven has not decreased over time. Quite the opposite. It just quietly does it's job. I did discover when I baked a frozen apple pie that it's wise to slightly lower the temperature and time from the package instructions. I kinda like a slightly burned upper crust edge so I wasn't upset. But next time I will make that adjustment. What won my approval was that the bottom crust wasn't soggy at all. I don't know about you but if you don't care about crust you can just eat pie filling right out of the can.

I put the pie in this oven and set the timer for the recommended one hour and went to visit a neighbor. The aroma on returning was a great welcome home. Love, love, love this oven.

I am careful with money but this thing really earns it's keep around our kitchen. We hardly use the big stove anymore.

One more tip:
The frozen pot pies I buy warn you not to use a toaster oven. I figured they were talking about my old conventional one. But I am here to tell you-- this is one thing you should NOT cook in this smart oven. (I was the stupid one.)",5.0 out of 5 stars

This is the first time I've ever had to go back and edit a review of a product, but this issue warrants that. All in all, I do still like this smart oven, but over the last few weeks, it's started making a very loud rattling noise whenever it is air frying or using the convection fan. It is really obnoxious. If I give it a good thump, sometimes it will stop for awhile, but it'll just start up again. Once I turn it off, as it's spooling down, you hear some extra whack, whack, whacks as the fan comes to a stop. I can tell that the fan has come loose whether from incorrect manufacturing or from shipping, I'm not sure.
We decided to try seeing if we could tighten the fan ourselves - what a mess that was! It is almost impossible to access the set screw that we need to tighten. After taking out at least 40 screws and all the covers, we still weren't able to access the back panel to tighten that screw!! Ugh!! Extremely frustrating. We also discovered that many of the screws that we removed were already stripped out from over-tightening at the factory, so it's just a matter of time before those all start backing out on their own and making new rattles. :(
We finally gave up and accepted defeat and put everything back together, not having accomplished anything helpful. I have gotten the rattling noise to stop for now by propping the front feet of the oven up slightly to keep the fan from hitting the front cover, but who knows how long that will help? It's just a matter of time before the set screw comes completely out and the whole fan falls off. At that point, I'll no longer be able to use the air fry or convection features. :(
I hate to leave a poor review, but this oven is not holding up well to regular usage. I'm hoping that this is a fluke with this particular machine maybe from shipping or something and that others who have purchased it don't have similar issues, but I needed to let folks know my experience.

Original Review:
I love toaster ovens. I've always thought that they are the most underrated appliance a kitchen can have, especially for households with only 1-2 people in them. Not having to heat up an entire full sized oven every meal saves on utility bills and from heating your house up more in the summertime. So when I saw this little gem that can also do things like airfry, it was a no-brainer to get.
This unit sits a little deeper than my traditional toaster oven, but is slightly narrower width wise which is nice. The user interface is really easy to work with and feels so futuristic and high tech! 😅 It even greets you with a cheerful little jingle when you turn it on and it alerts you when it has one minute of cook time left and of course, when it's done. I wish there was a way to turn off or change the tune as it drives my husband crazy, but oh well. 😜
The no preheat feature is awesome. I was skeptical at first, but this thing heats up so fast it's incredible! So, I love that feature as it saves so much time!
The self presenting rack is a cool feature that helps prevent me from burning myself by reaching into the hot oven to pull things out or test for doneness, so that was another neat extra feature. I do wish that the door design was a little different, maybe no push button and just manual lift? The button is cool and all, but I just have a feeling that is going to be the first thing to break, and then what will you do? I'm old school and a little leery of things like that, what can I say?
The airfry works really well and it's so nice to not have to have a separate appliance just for that!
I did go ahead and add a Teflon liner to the very bottom of mine (being careful to make sure it's not touching any of the heating elements) to make for easier cleanup especially after airfrying.
I think this is an awesome little unit and am so excited to discover the plethora of other features that it has!",3.0 out of 5 stars
UnderdogMom,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2023","With two kids at home, we feel like short-order cooks sometimes - they want to eat ALL THE TIME. It's so convenient to have a countertop oven PLUS air fryer that lets us quickly make them snacks, frozen food like little pizzas and tacos, etc. Even better that this one heats up so fast, there is no preheating phase required! Super duper convenient. We have tried all the functions and everything works like it should. Love that it has so many different options and pre-sets that make it so easy to use. It's pretty foolproof. It toasts things like bagels so much more evenly than our toaster.

The air fryer makes a big difference in ""crisping"" foods like fish sticks and nuggets. You'd think it would get really messy in there from frying, but it doesn't really - and it's super easy to wipe down and clean. I do recommend you clean it out every time you use it, for us that's pretty much daily.

For nights when our kids aren't here, we can do a dinner for two in this quickly. I even used it to make cookies recently and they turned out great. We are finding lots of ways to use it, and it will be nice this summer to not have to preheat the big oven as much. It's getting a lot of use here. Love it!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Francis Tapon,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2023","I love that there is no preheating, that you can control it with your phone, and it opens elegantly!

Here is a summary of the questions and answers:

Q: What are the internal measurements of the oven?
A: The usable interior space is 13 5/8” W x 11 ¾” D x 5 ½” H. This large-capacity countertop oven has enough room for a 12"" pizza, a 13"" x 9"" sheet cake or up to 7 lbs. of chicken.

Q: How do you clean the inside of the door?
A: Wait until the oven has cooled down completely, then hold the door by the handle with one hand while wiping the inner side of the glass with a soft, damp cloth. If the door is severely stained or dirty, use a towel saturated with a diluted solution of a mild dishwashing liquid. Be sure to remove all detergent residue with a dampened clean cloth.

Q: Are recipes included in a book or an app?
A: The owner’s manual offers information on the proper use of each of the 11 cooking modes. This will allow you to follow package directions or your favorite recipes easily. This oven also offers you the ability to connect to your WiFi to take advantage of guided recipes using the SmartHQ app

Q: Will this fit under my wall cabinet?
A: While the oven measures 11 1/2""H, the total height with the door open is 15 1/2"". GE recommends providing 4"" air clearance on all sides of the oven when in operation and do not recommend using the oven while placed under a wall cabinet.

Q: Does this work with Google and Alexa?
A: Yes! This oven will work with Alexa and Google.

Q: Please confirm it fits a 12"" pizza. Does it also fit a 9 x 13"" pan?
A: Yes! This large-capacity countertop oven has enough room for a 12"" pizza or a 13"" x 9"" pan.

CONCLUSION: Although $450 is expensive, this is a high-quality portable, 21st-century oven.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JimmyJo,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2023","I noticed that this oven weighs more than my older non-GE oven. Not only is it heavier but also has a larger foot print although a slightly smaller cooking area inside. My old one could accept a 13 inch pizza pan and this one will not. It’s close but not close enough to be able to shut the door. That’s not a big deal for me but worth mentioning.

When I tried to scan the QR code to get the app loaded on my phone I discovered it doesn’t work on IOS IPhone or MacBooks. It’s only for android’s. However if you go to the App Store you can download the app from there.

This has super smart features and may seem a little overwhelming to set up at first but it really wasn’t. Connecting to WiFi was seamless and I love that it gives me alerts on my iPhone and smartwatch. I haven’t had time to use the app much yet but the alerts are very helpful. I was out working in my yard and my watch alerted me that my dinner was near completion and then a few minutes later another alert to let me know it was done.

The basket doesn’t sit perfectly level in the oven but I can see this could just be a one off due to a slightly off center weld causing the rack to sit in place slightly crooked. It slides in and out just fine and works as it should.

I love the fact that there is not pre-heating needed. That alone should save a ton of money in electricity.

My only two issues so far are that the air fryer basket doesn’t sit level although perfectly functional and that the door opens up then folds back over the top. I would prefer the door to go straight and not back. I find that if I store the accessories on top (manual says that is okay to do) that the door bangs into them and makes a lot of noise. Again no big deal, I’ll figure out another location to store the accessories.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Denver Dad Mike,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2023","We're blessed to have a double oven on the wall in our kitchen, but it takes a solid 15-20 minutes to pre-heat to 450 or higher. With 4 hungry kids, sometimes that's just too darn long...

Enter the GE Profile Smart Oven...with NO PREHEATING required. WHAT?!? Yes, instant baking as high as 500 degrees F. That's amazing! Suddenly, those tater tots are done in 12 minutes instead of 45 - no joke. This is an absolute game changer.

So if you have the counter space, this will suddenly become the most used appliance in your kitchen. In the 48 hours we've had it, it has cranked out a flatbread, two batches of tator tots (airfried to perfection), sugar cookies (perfectly crisp, yet soft in the middle), six pieces of toast (at the same time), and 20 pizza bites (better than the oven can produce because of the air frying capability).

And the unexpected perk? It's easy for the kids to use. It's counter height, has a door that gets out of the way to avoid accidental burns, and the settings are simple to use. So, not only is it saving time, it's completely eliminating the need for the adults to run the oven when the kids want a snack.

The only thing that concerns me is the two exposed heating elements on the bottom. I wonder how they're going to hold up when drips such as melted cheese land on them. I also noticed a few dings in the metal housing that appear to have been touched up post assembly with a black paint pen. Seems out of sync with such an expensive appliance.

But...as long as this thing keeps baking, airfrying, reheating, etc. I couldn't care less about a few dings.

I installed the App, and it's fun to get notifications when it's done, but since the kids are the biggest users at the moment, I might turn them off, as I don't need to know every time there's ""1 minute remaining"" or ""cooking complete.""

I absolutely love this guy and look forward to many years of quick and efficient food prep to feed my small army of eaters! Well done, GE.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Invisible Woman,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2023","The new oven is really nice. The crumb tray is quite convenient to remove for cleaning. The wire rack is easy to pull out or leave hooked in. The glass door moves nicely out of the way, but the glass window fogs up whenever I’m toasting something. Also, its doesn't have nasty sounding alarm like so many other cooking appliances.

Its got lots of features that I haven't tried yet. I wanted a bigger toaster oven/air fryer that was simple enough for my son to use for toasting and large enough for me to air fry a reasonable quantity and this works.

laurelmailcall,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2023","UPDATE: I’m not changing my rating, I just want to say how indispensable this oven has become in the past few months (especially since it has been so hot). In the past week, I’ve used it to make toast, meatballs, and baked salmon. I also tried baking a loaf of bread in it, which honestly worked well apart from the fact that it rose so high that the heating element burned two stripes into the crust and then made it difficult to get the bread out. Not recommended for sandwich loaves, I suppose, but highly recommended for everything else.

I was looking to replace my toaster, and after seeing a surprisingly positive rundown of countertop smart ovens on America’s Test Kitchen, I decided to give this GE model a try. Most of the time I use it as a very expensive toaster, but it does so much more! It reheats frozen baked goods, cooks frozen pizzas, and roasts veggies. I haven’t baked cookies in it yet, but I am looking forward to giving that a try, especially now that the weather is warm and I don’t want to heat up the house with my full oven. The sides and bottom of this oven don’t get very hot, so I feel safe using it on my quartz countertop. I did try to leave at least the 4’’ of recommended clearance on each side. The only downside is that I did not receive a manual or quick start guide in the box. Maybe that’s standard now to save paper, but then I wish it were easier to access online or in the app. I had to dig around quite a bit to find it online, and I’m glad I did, or I would have missed the suggestion to run the oven on air fry for 30 minutes before the first use to burn off any protective coatings on the heating element.",5.0 out of 5 stars

This isnt a full size oven, but still big enough for most purposes. And I love the fact that it goes to 500F. Almost no countertop oven goes to 500, so this is a big plus.

lulum,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2023","I am really liking the countertop oven. It comes with a roasting pan and an air fryer basket and a rack that fits in it, in addition to the shelf rack, which can double as a cooling rack because of the v shaped feet on the bottom. When you open the oven, you just press down a button and it opens the door to the top and plays a little tune. The shelf rack slides out making it easier to access with less chance of burning yourself. My 13 x 9 pan fits but doesn’t have handles. If yours does, and it makes it wider, it likely won’t fit.
So far I have made toast, which it did very nicely with even browning, it roasted asparagus and pork loin chops beautifully and cream scones came out a light golden brown. The scones, which I cooked on a 1/4 sheet pan, did require a minute longer but the add 2 minutes button made adding extra time super easy. You can also manually adjust time and temp during your cook if necessary.
There is a chime that rings 1 minute before the timer expires which is convenient. If you install the app you can set/adjust time and temp from it, but you do need to hit the start button on the oven itself when starting the cook. The app does also give you the 1 minute warning notification. It was a breeze to connect to Wi-Fi. Uses a regular electrical plug.
There is no preheat required and it does not heat up the kitchen like my oven does. Also uses a lot less electricity than a my full oven. Take note of measurements and ensure you have enough clearance for your top cupboards, mine are 17.5” and it is more than enough.
So, although it does take some counter real estate, it is not much more than the toaster and air fryer did, both of which will be donated. It also looks a lot nicer. Very happy with this.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I buy too much from Amazon,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2023","I got this countertop oven for use in an RV, and yes it is 120V. I've only cooked with this a couple of times but will give some initial impressions.

Within the realm of 21st century appliances, this seems to be built decently, and I suspect it will be durable.

The front to back depth of the outer footprint of the oven did surprise me. The measurements they give to one of the product questions does seem to have accurate measurements. If you have a special pan, I encourage you to measure it before you order. This will indeed take a 13 x 9"" pan, but of your pan has handles from the lips on the end, it will likely not fit. My 2.2 Qt Pyrex baking pan fit fine. Note the interior depth is just shy of 12"", and there is a slight slope to the front door, so depth decreases with height. If you 12"" pan really measures 12"", it will not fit.

A note about installation. The manual says to have 4"" of clarence on each side, and not to use under wall cabinets. So good luck with that. I'm sure this is partly CYA, and the exterior sides don't seem to get dangerously hot. The oven has a 170-500*F range.

I have not tried the air fry setting, I'm curious how that will perform. So far, I did a bake and a broil, and both work satisfactorily. I don't know what to make of this no preheat claim. Being a small oven, it does warm up quickly. Here is a description from the manual: 'This oven utilizes a Zero Preheat Technology which is an Innovative Technology that directly targets food. Everything cooked in this oven reaches its optimal temperature fast. The oven cavity temperature alone is not a representative measure for this oven's cooking performance.' OK. And in the troubleshooting section it says: 'When cooking in batches, such as cookies, muffins, etc., the total cooking time may be significantly reduced for the later batches.' Doesn't that fly in the face of the no preheating needed claim? Whatever. It works fine.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The control panel is glossy glass and does show fingerprints but that's a minor issue because it wipes off clean. It is a large oven able to fit 2-6 slices of bread, but when you pop open the door the shelf extends out for easy reach and the door lifts, so there is no chance of getting burnt.
The quality of the build is second to none, even better than some of the other $$$ high-end toaster-oven/air fryers.

I decided I was going to have to pay a little more for a higher quality countertop oven. I found myself stuck with the Wolf, the top of the line Breville or this little gem I ran into at Crate and Barrel. If you are looking for a large countertop oven where you can cook turkeys then this is probably not a smart buy. If you are looking for something that cook within the size of 9 by 13 with no handles or 12 inch pizza with no handles then I highly recommend this. Some of my first day pros are that the oven made no noise. I had to check it a couple times to make sure it was still cooking. It is so much better to put your food in before you start the oven than after it is hot from preheating. The light is very bright to see your food. The food cooked much better than my old countertop oven and did not splatter grease all over the place. It did this without radiating heat through my small kitchen. The oven door is the best on the market. The baking rack pulls out when the door opens and is locked in position until you want to manually move it. This keeps the rack from sliding out when you are taking hot things out of it. Some cons I have found on this oven is the manufacturer at this point does not sell replacement racks, air fryer basket or sheet pan. They do not sell a pizza pan for the oven either. At the same time when I talked to them they seem pretty cool on the fact that I could use my own baking products. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to cook meals for one or two individuals using it's multiple methods of cooking as it is not the biggest one out there, but I feel it's quality is much better.

Update: So very easy to clean and all the grease came off very easy.",5.0 out of 5 stars

James,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2023","The GE Profile Smart Oven has truly revolutionized my cooking experience. The standout feature for me is undoubtedly the ""No Preheat"" function. Gone are the days of waiting for the oven to reach the desired temperature. With zero preheat technology, I can dive straight into cooking, saving precious time and energy.

But it's not just about the no preheat feature. The 11 preset functions, ranging from Air Fry to Bake and Bagel, offer unmatched versatility. Whether whipping up a quick snack or preparing a feast for the family, this oven has got me covered.

The one-touch, high-rise door is another thoughtful addition. It provides extra clearance on the countertop and ensures safety by eliminating the need to reach over a hot door. And speaking of smart features, the voice control is a delightful touch. Setting and adjusting time and temperature using voice commands feels futuristic and makes the cooking process even more seamless.

This is the first time I've ever had to go back and edit a review of a product, but this issue warrants that. All in all, I do still like this smart oven, but over the last few weeks, it's started making a very loud rattling noise whenever it is air frying or using the convection fan. It is really obnoxious. If I give it a good thump, sometimes it will stop for awhile, but it'll just start up again. Once I turn it off, as it's spooling down, you hear some extra whack, whack, whacks as the fan comes to a stop. I can tell that the fan has come loose whether from incorrect manufacturing or from shipping, I'm not sure.
We decided to try seeing if we could tighten the fan ourselves - what a mess that was! It is almost impossible to access the set screw that we need to tighten. After taking out at least 40 screws and all the covers, we still weren't able to access the back panel to tighten that screw!! Ugh!! Extremely frustrating. We also discovered that many of the screws that we removed were already stripped out from over-tightening at the factory, so it's just a matter of time before those all start backing out on their own and making new rattles. :(
We finally gave up and accepted defeat and put everything back together, not having accomplished anything helpful. I have gotten the rattling noise to stop for now by propping the front feet of the oven up slightly to keep the fan from hitting the front cover, but who knows how long that will help? It's just a matter of time before the set screw comes completely out and the whole fan falls off. At that point, I'll no longer be able to use the air fry or convection features. :(
I hate to leave a poor review, but this oven is not holding up well to regular usage. I'm hoping that this is a fluke with this particular machine maybe from shipping or something and that others who have purchased it don't have similar issues, but I needed to let folks know my experience.

Original Review:
I love toaster ovens. I've always thought that they are the most underrated appliance a kitchen can have, especially for households with only 1-2 people in them. Not having to heat up an entire full sized oven every meal saves on utility bills and from heating your house up more in the summertime. So when I saw this little gem that can also do things like airfry, it was a no-brainer to get.
This unit sits a little deeper than my traditional toaster oven, but is slightly narrower width wise which is nice. The user interface is really easy to work with and feels so futuristic and high tech! 😅 It even greets you with a cheerful little jingle when you turn it on and it alerts you when it has one minute of cook time left and of course, when it's done. I wish there was a way to turn off or change the tune as it drives my husband crazy, but oh well. 😜
The no preheat feature is awesome. I was skeptical at first, but this thing heats up so fast it's incredible! So, I love that feature as it saves so much time!
The self presenting rack is a cool feature that helps prevent me from burning myself by reaching into the hot oven to pull things out or test for doneness, so that was another neat extra feature. I do wish that the door design was a little different, maybe no push button and just manual lift? The button is cool and all, but I just have a feeling that is going to be the first thing to break, and then what will you do? I'm old school and a little leery of things like that, what can I say?
The airfry works really well and it's so nice to not have to have a separate appliance just for that!
I did go ahead and add a Teflon liner to the very bottom of mine (being careful to make sure it's not touching any of the heating elements) to make for easier cleanup especially after airfrying.
I think this is an awesome little unit and am so excited to discover the plethora of other features that it has!",3.0 out of 5 stars
Left Blank,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2023","Nice unit, when it works. Less than 60 days after getting the unit (from a well known retailer), the fan in the air fryer section now makes a metal on metal grinding noise that is getting worse. I do not feel it is safe to use and have explained this to multiple GE ""customer service reps"". I have tried working with GE for a replacement and they keep wanting to repair the unit rather than replace the unit. The first service company said they basically don't repair toaster ovens, it should be replaced. GE insisted on contacting another service company and am now waiting for another attempt at service. All this right before Thanksgiving. I personally will NEVER purchase another GE product and be aware if the unit fails outside of the return window. Good Luck! I think this very shiny, basically new oven is going to the dump.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Wendi McDaniel,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2023","I really like this oven for so many reasons. I love that it does not require pre-heating; this is especially great in the Summer months when you want to limit the extra heat generated from cooking. It also helps you to get food cooked and ready to eat more quickly, which is really nice when I don’t have much time for meals. I love the versatility of the oven, especially that it can air-fry food too! The oven is not too large, and it has a modern look. Operating this oven is fairly intuitive and I have not had any food failures yet. It cooks evenly, even toast! I very rarely heat up my regular oven because of how useful and functional this oven is. My one star deduction is due to the oven’s fan making a noise when the air-fry or pizza settings are used. The very first time the noise was quite loud and of a screeching/metal on metal sort. It has improved, but there is still a slight noise when these settings are first engaged.",4.0 out of 5 stars
I buy too much from Amazon,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2023","I got this countertop oven for use in an RV, and yes it is 120V. I've only cooked with this a couple of times but will give some initial impressions.

Within the realm of 21st century appliances, this seems to be built decently, and I suspect it will be durable.

The front to back depth of the outer footprint of the oven did surprise me. The measurements they give to one of the product questions does seem to have accurate measurements. If you have a special pan, I encourage you to measure it before you order. This will indeed take a 13 x 9"" pan, but of your pan has handles from the lips on the end, it will likely not fit. My 2.2 Qt Pyrex baking pan fit fine. Note the interior depth is just shy of 12"", and there is a slight slope to the front door, so depth decreases with height. If you 12"" pan really measures 12"", it will not fit.

A note about installation. The manual says to have 4"" of clarence on each side, and not to use under wall cabinets. So good luck with that. I'm sure this is partly CYA, and the exterior sides don't seem to get dangerously hot. The oven has a 170-500*F range.

I have not tried the air fry setting, I'm curious how that will perform. So far, I did a bake and a broil, and both work satisfactorily. I don't know what to make of this no preheat claim. Being a small oven, it does warm up quickly. Here is a description from the manual: 'This oven utilizes a Zero Preheat Technology which is an Innovative Technology that directly targets food. Everything cooked in this oven reaches its optimal temperature fast. The oven cavity temperature alone is not a representative measure for this oven's cooking performance.' OK. And in the troubleshooting section it says: 'When cooking in batches, such as cookies, muffins, etc., the total cooking time may be significantly reduced for the later batches.' Doesn't that fly in the face of the no preheating needed claim? Whatever. It works fine.",5.0 out of 5 stars
lulum,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2023","I am really liking the countertop oven. It comes with a roasting pan and an air fryer basket and a rack that fits in it, in addition to the shelf rack, which can double as a cooling rack because of the v shaped feet on the bottom. When you open the oven, you just press down a button and it opens the door to the top and plays a little tune. The shelf rack slides out making it easier to access with less chance of burning yourself. My 13 x 9 pan fits but doesn’t have handles. If yours does, and it makes it wider, it likely won’t fit.
So far I have made toast, which it did very nicely with even browning, it roasted asparagus and pork loin chops beautifully and cream scones came out a light golden brown. The scones, which I cooked on a 1/4 sheet pan, did require a minute longer but the add 2 minutes button made adding extra time super easy. You can also manually adjust time and temp during your cook if necessary.
There is a chime that rings 1 minute before the timer expires which is convenient. If you install the app you can set/adjust time and temp from it, but you do need to hit the start button on the oven itself when starting the cook. The app does also give you the 1 minute warning notification. It was a breeze to connect to Wi-Fi. Uses a regular electrical plug.
There is no preheat required and it does not heat up the kitchen like my oven does. Also uses a lot less electricity than a my full oven. Take note of measurements and ensure you have enough clearance for your top cupboards, mine are 17.5” and it is more than enough.
So, although it does take some counter real estate, it is not much more than the toaster and air fryer did, both of which will be donated. It also looks a lot nicer. Very happy with this.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Boymom,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2023","I got this oven to go on my counter to replace my toaster and old air fryer. I cook most meals at home and from scratch, and my kitchen is very small. Counter top ovens are great to use in the summer so the house doesn't get heated up by the big oven, and also as an extra oven during the holidays, like for baking pies and such.

This oven worked well as an air fryer. There are about 4-5 russet potatoes sliced on the rack in my pictures. They came out great. The instructions didntecommemd using the cookie sheet as a drip tray which I did, but found the bottoms didn't get a crispy as the tops. Toasting was a breeze. It holds 6-8 slices of bread depending on load size. Toasting was even and it was handy to be able to do everyone's toast at once.

The oven does have a crumb tray that pulls out of the very bottom under the open button.

The center rack self ejects a few inches when the door is opened. The oven comes with a cookie sheet, an air fryer rack, and a wire rack. It has three positions inside.

The front of the oven opens with a push button and pops up on its own. The door rotates up an over the top of the oven, which is a really nice feature, but does require a little extra clearance at the top. 3-4 inches probably.

The top and sides of this oven do get hot. So it will need some clearance on the counter.

The controls are touch controls. They're clearly labeled and easy to use. The timer and number settings are all digital display, bright and large, easy to read. The oven has a light strip on the control panel that fades as it works. It also has musical tunes instead of beeping, it plays when you start, stop, or has any other notification.

This oven works great, fits great on my small counter, and really provides an extra cooking unit that helps cut down on my total prep time. It really is like having a second oven.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JimmyJo,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2023","I noticed that this oven weighs more than my older non-GE oven. Not only is it heavier but also has a larger foot print although a slightly smaller cooking area inside. My old one could accept a 13 inch pizza pan and this one will not. It’s close but not close enough to be able to shut the door. That’s not a big deal for me but worth mentioning.

When I tried to scan the QR code to get the app loaded on my phone I discovered it doesn’t work on IOS IPhone or MacBooks. It’s only for android’s. However if you go to the App Store you can download the app from there.

This has super smart features and may seem a little overwhelming to set up at first but it really wasn’t. Connecting to WiFi was seamless and I love that it gives me alerts on my iPhone and smartwatch. I haven’t had time to use the app much yet but the alerts are very helpful. I was out working in my yard and my watch alerted me that my dinner was near completion and then a few minutes later another alert to let me know it was done.

The basket doesn’t sit perfectly level in the oven but I can see this could just be a one off due to a slightly off center weld causing the rack to sit in place slightly crooked. It slides in and out just fine and works as it should.

I love the fact that there is not pre-heating needed. That alone should save a ton of money in electricity.

My only two issues so far are that the air fryer basket doesn’t sit level although perfectly functional and that the door opens up then folds back over the top. I would prefer the door to go straight and not back. I find that if I store the accessories on top (manual says that is okay to do) that the door bangs into them and makes a lot of noise. Again no big deal, I’ll figure out another location to store the accessories.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Denver Dad Mike,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2023","We're blessed to have a double oven on the wall in our kitchen, but it takes a solid 15-20 minutes to pre-heat to 450 or higher. With 4 hungry kids, sometimes that's just too darn long...

Enter the GE Profile Smart Oven...with NO PREHEATING required. WHAT?!? Yes, instant baking as high as 500 degrees F. That's amazing! Suddenly, those tater tots are done in 12 minutes instead of 45 - no joke. This is an absolute game changer.

So if you have the counter space, this will suddenly become the most used appliance in your kitchen. In the 48 hours we've had it, it has cranked out a flatbread, two batches of tator tots (airfried to perfection), sugar cookies (perfectly crisp, yet soft in the middle), six pieces of toast (at the same time), and 20 pizza bites (better than the oven can produce because of the air frying capability).

And the unexpected perk? It's easy for the kids to use. It's counter height, has a door that gets out of the way to avoid accidental burns, and the settings are simple to use. So, not only is it saving time, it's completely eliminating the need for the adults to run the oven when the kids want a snack.

The only thing that concerns me is the two exposed heating elements on the bottom. I wonder how they're going to hold up when drips such as melted cheese land on them. I also noticed a few dings in the metal housing that appear to have been touched up post assembly with a black paint pen. Seems out of sync with such an expensive appliance.

But...as long as this thing keeps baking, airfrying, reheating, etc. I couldn't care less about a few dings.

I installed the App, and it's fun to get notifications when it's done, but since the kids are the biggest users at the moment, I might turn them off, as I don't need to know every time there's ""1 minute remaining"" or ""cooking complete.""

I absolutely love this guy and look forward to many years of quick and efficient food prep to feed my small army of eaters! Well done, GE.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Francis Tapon,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2023","I love that there is no preheating, that you can control it with your phone, and it opens elegantly!

Here is a summary of the questions and answers:

Q: What are the internal measurements of the oven?
A: The usable interior space is 13 5/8” W x 11 ¾” D x 5 ½” H. This large-capacity countertop oven has enough room for a 12"" pizza, a 13"" x 9"" sheet cake or up to 7 lbs. of chicken.

Q: How do you clean the inside of the door?
A: Wait until the oven has cooled down completely, then hold the door by the handle with one hand while wiping the inner side of the glass with a soft, damp cloth. If the door is severely stained or dirty, use a towel saturated with a diluted solution of a mild dishwashing liquid. Be sure to remove all detergent residue with a dampened clean cloth.

Q: Are recipes included in a book or an app?
A: The owner’s manual offers information on the proper use of each of the 11 cooking modes. This will allow you to follow package directions or your favorite recipes easily. This oven also offers you the ability to connect to your WiFi to take advantage of guided recipes using the SmartHQ app

Q: Will this fit under my wall cabinet?
A: While the oven measures 11 1/2""H, the total height with the door open is 15 1/2"". GE recommends providing 4"" air clearance on all sides of the oven when in operation and do not recommend using the oven while placed under a wall cabinet.

Q: Does this work with Google and Alexa?
A: Yes! This oven will work with Alexa and Google.

Q: Please confirm it fits a 12"" pizza. Does it also fit a 9 x 13"" pan?
A: Yes! This large-capacity countertop oven has enough room for a 12"" pizza or a 13"" x 9"" pan.

CONCLUSION: Although $450 is expensive, this is a high-quality portable, 21st-century oven.",5.0 out of 5 stars
laurelmailcall,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2023","UPDATE: I’m not changing my rating, I just want to say how indispensable this oven has become in the past few months (especially since it has been so hot). In the past week, I’ve used it to make toast, meatballs, and baked salmon. I also tried baking a loaf of bread in it, which honestly worked well apart from the fact that it rose so high that the heating element burned two stripes into the crust and then made it difficult to get the bread out. Not recommended for sandwich loaves, I suppose, but highly recommended for everything else.

I was looking to replace my toaster, and after seeing a surprisingly positive rundown of countertop smart ovens on America’s Test Kitchen, I decided to give this GE model a try. Most of the time I use it as a very expensive toaster, but it does so much more! It reheats frozen baked goods, cooks frozen pizzas, and roasts veggies. I haven’t baked cookies in it yet, but I am looking forward to giving that a try, especially now that the weather is warm and I don’t want to heat up the house with my full oven. The sides and bottom of this oven don’t get very hot, so I feel safe using it on my quartz countertop. I did try to leave at least the 4’’ of recommended clearance on each side. The only downside is that I did not receive a manual or quick start guide in the box. Maybe that’s standard now to save paper, but then I wish it were easier to access online or in the app. I had to dig around quite a bit to find it online, and I’m glad I did, or I would have missed the suggestion to run the oven on air fry for 30 minutes before the first use to burn off any protective coatings on the heating element.",5.0 out of 5 stars

UnderdogMom,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2023","With two kids at home, we feel like short-order cooks sometimes - they want to eat ALL THE TIME. It's so convenient to have a countertop oven PLUS air fryer that lets us quickly make them snacks, frozen food like little pizzas and tacos, etc. Even better that this one heats up so fast, there is no preheating phase required! Super duper convenient. We have tried all the functions and everything works like it should. Love that it has so many different options and pre-sets that make it so easy to use. It's pretty foolproof. It toasts things like bagels so much more evenly than our toaster.

The air fryer makes a big difference in ""crisping"" foods like fish sticks and nuggets. You'd think it would get really messy in there from frying, but it doesn't really - and it's super easy to wipe down and clean. I do recommend you clean it out every time you use it, for us that's pretty much daily.

For nights when our kids aren't here, we can do a dinner for two in this quickly. I even used it to make cookies recently and they turned out great.

My son can cook his own biscuits and rolls without using the big scary oven. He can even cook cookies! You can't use a power strip. I kind of knew that but didn't really have another location with a plug. I found another place for it. Over all I really really like it. I have a learning curve to using it because it cook different.

Invisible Woman,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2023","The new oven is really nice. The crumb tray is quite convenient to remove for cleaning. The wire rack is easy to pull out or leave hooked in. The glass door moves nicely out of the way, but the glass window fogs up whenever I’m toasting something. Also, its doesn't have nasty sounding alarm like so many other cooking appliances.

Its got lots of features that I haven't tried yet. I wanted a bigger toaster oven/air fryer that was simple enough for my son to use for toasting and large enough for me to air fry a reasonable quantity and this works.

Also, I was really worried it would be to complicated and it really isn't. I don't like appliances where you have to memorize a bunch of stuff to use it. This one has a very simple manual and that is all it needs.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Lee,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2023","This is a really great counter top oven. It has so many features!
Update: we finally got a chance to Hooke it up and it doesn’t work. It won’t power on. We have called and are waiting on a technician. Hopefully it will get resolved. Will update the review.",2.0 out of 5 stars
MS Globetrotter,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2023","I took my time getting to this review because I wanted to try a variety of cooking modes. Spoiler: every cooking even I've tried so far has been a success.

For the past few years I've been using a highly rated Panasonic toaster oven with the Flash Xpress feature. It does a terrific job at rapidly heating. It sells for considerably less than this. But the capacity of that toaster oven is pretty typically limited. So when I saw this ""smart oven"" I wondered right away whether this could perform similar heating tricks. Then when I read that I could even bake a pizza and do air frying, I started to get way more interested. If it can do all of the things that GE claims, it would be worth the price.

We took our conventional toaster oven off the kitchen counter and hefted this up in its place. It's somewhat wider higher and deeper but not overwhelmingly so; it does not dominate the counter space.

First up: we prepared our favorite thin crust frozen pizza with Italian sausage. As promised, no preheating was necessary. I followed the package's time and temperature instructions as we have always done in our larger standalone oven with convection. The result was superior to our conventional oven. The edges were lightly browned and the crust was just slightly crisp-- exactly how we wanted it-- and never quite achieved with our conventional oven. My only observation is that I might reduce baking time by a minute or two next time. That evening I reheated a leftover slice and somehow the oven warmed it through without burning or toughening the crust. (Another reviewer says their pizza won't fit. I can't imagine what colossal product they tried. We used a standard size pizza without the slightest cramping of space.)

For breakfast the next morning I made frozen waffles. The results were excellent: the interior of the waffles were somewhat cakey and the exterior lightly browned and slightly crisp. (Tip after 3 months of experience: if you want crisp outside and cakey inside, bake in convection mode first at 200 degrees to thaw for 2-3 minutes. Then finish at 400 degrees for another 3 minutes or so. I never thought store brand frozen waffles could be so distinctively good.)

This morning I toasted a bagel for myself and an English muffin for my spouse. Great results again.

For lunch today I made frozen Korean style chicken nuggets from Costco in the air fryer basket. I followed the oven instructions and placed the included tray on the level beneath the air fryer basket. This is a precaution to catch any oil or other drippings. Again I used the packaging time and temperature instructions. The results again bested our conventional oven. The battered exterior had almost a tempura-like airy delicate quality but maintained a crispy crunch.

If there's a downside to this, I'm not finding it. The status panel is very well layed out and it's clear what buttons to press. I did peruse the user manual but I think most people could start using this oven straight out of the box. It chimes a 60-second pre-warning before cooking completes.

If you do connect this to your home wifi, the app will send a notification to your smartphone when cooking is done. Alexa immediately discovered this addition to the household. And I was also able to add this appliance in my Google Home app. I hasten to add that as of this review, the app doesn't provide fancy customization features but I wouldn't be surprised if they get added later. This is a new product.

This is not an impulse purchase at this price. But I'm already convinced that this provides reasonable value. It can do anything a toaster oven can do-- and better. It can substitute for an air fryer. It swallows a whole pizza and delivers it faster because preheating is not required. It reduces our reliance on our conventional oven which probably means lower electricity bills.

I was a little worried that this product was going to disappoint me by just mimicking toaster ovens with a prettier outer shell. I was wrong. My apprehension was dissolved a little bit more each time I have used it-- right up to lunch today.

My old toaster oven is going to be pretty lonely sitting on a garage shelf.

UPDATE Three months later:
My enthusiasm for this oven has not decreased over time. Quite the opposite. It just quietly does it's job. I did discover when I baked a frozen apple pie that it's wise to slightly lower the temperature and time from the package instructions. I kinda like a slightly burned upper crust edge so I wasn't upset. But next time I will make that adjustment. What won my approval was that the bottom crust wasn't soggy at all. I don't know about you but if you don't care about crust you can just eat pie filling right out of the can.

I put the pie in this oven and set the timer for the recommended one hour and went to visit a neighbor. The aroma on returning was a great welcome home. Love, love, love this oven.

I am careful with money but this thing really earns it's keep around our kitchen. We hardly use the big stove anymore.

One more tip:
The frozen pot pies I buy warn you not to use a toaster oven. I figured they were talking about my old conventional one. But I am here to tell you-- this is one thing you should NOT cook in this smart oven. (I was the stupid one.)",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2023","First - this thing was packed to the 'nth degree. Nothing was going to mar this surface while it was in the box. Took me a bit to get it out of the box, but once out - it was easy to set up. The quick start instructions are easy to follow. Wipe it out. Set it on 450 Air Fry for 20 minutes and then it's ready to use. Super thrilled. Finally an air fryer/toaster oven that can fit more than a squab! The door easily swings free and the no preheating is awesome. The minute you press go on the timer - it's cooking! Zero regrets for the countertop real estate this takes. The app is easy to connect to and works like a dream. Very pleased with this multi-function toaster oven! Thinking it'd make a nice house warming gift.",5.0 out of 5 stars

This is a great compact countertop oven that cooks and toast quickly! It is on the small side but it’s not taking over my countertops. I measured 17” of head clearance to the upper cabinets. So plenty of room. I was concerned about heat on my granite, and while baking with it I moved it to see how hot it got. It was just warm, so all good. The instructions don’t mention the remote option so I looked into that, turns out you can connect it your WiFi and program it with what you want to cook! That’s great. Expect I get notified every time my son cooks his nuggets in it, so I’ll have to adjust my settings. Picture shows a standard 22oz frozen pizza that fits. And cooked in 11 minutes!",5.0 out of 5 stars
