Howie and/or Cyndy,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2023","I recently purchased the this dehumidifier, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. This incredible appliance has been a game-changer for maintaining a comfortable environment in my home, particularly on the upstairs level. It does kick out some heat and I learned quickly to run it only on the low fan speed.

One of the standout features of this dehumidifier is its exceptional ability to reduce humidity levels effectively. Prior to using this device, my upstairs level was plagued with excessive moisture, even though the space was air-conditioned. No matter what I tried, I could never get the humidity level below 60. However, since incorporating this dehumidifier into my home, I have witnessed a remarkable transformation. For the first time ever, the humidity level on my upstairs level has dropped to an impressive 40. It is truly amazing!

One of the reasons I opted for this particular dehumidifier was its convenience and ease of use. While it does come with a pump, I personally have not utilized it. Instead, I have been emptying the tank twice a day. The tank is user-friendly and straightforward to remove and empty. It's a minor inconvenience in exchange for the fantastic results I have experienced.

In terms of performance, this dehumidifier has been flawless. It operates quietly, allowing me to enjoy a peaceful and undisturbed living environment. Additionally, the energy efficiency of this device is worth mentioning. It runs smoothly without consuming excessive energy, which is not only beneficial for the environment but also helps keep my electricity bills in check.

Considering the outstanding performance and the significant improvement in humidity levels, I can't help but regret not purchasing this dehumidifier sooner. It has undoubtedly made a positive impact on the overall comfort and quality of life in my home. The difference in air quality is noticeable, and I no longer have to worry about the negative effects of excess moisture, such as mold and musty odors.

In conclusion, I highly recommend this dehumidifier to anyone struggling with high humidity levels in their home. It is an incredibly effective and reliable appliance that has tackled the excess moisture in my home like a champ. With its outstanding performance, ease of use, and energy efficiency, this dehumidifier has become an invaluable addition to my household. Don't make the same mistake I did by waiting—invest in this dehumidifier and experience the comfort and peace of mind it brings.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Randall W. Rasner,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2023","Honest review of Frigidaire FFAD5033W1 Dehumidifier, High Humidity 50 Pint Capacity with a Easy-to-Clean Washable Filter and Custom Humidity Control for maximized comfort, in White

I ordered this to replace one of another brand that failed to consistently drain via the hose into a sump well. This one had great reviews and a dependable name brand. I am using it in a damp basement that I do not frequent, so the continuous drainage option was a must for me.

Likes:
Very easy to set up and get to dehumidifying; it was basically plug and play, if you will.
Easy to learn controls; very self-intuitive.
Easy-to-Clean washable filter
Automatic shut off when the bucket is full if you use the bucket drain option. Plus, it shuts off when reaching the targeted humidity level
Front loading bucket with carrying handle and splash guard. I have not used the bucket, but it is easily removed and replaced. Plus, it has a red float to show the tank’s water level and can easily be seen on the front of the unit
The casters roll easily and in any direction
It has a pull-up carrying handle, which functions well and is not difficult to raise or lower
The cord is sufficiently long
Humidity control (but only in increments of 5%)
3-speed fan
I did not think that it was overly loud (my video has my phone very close to the unit)
Continuous drainage option (hose NOT included) that uses a standard garden hose or washing machine hose to easily screw onto the port in back of the unit
The continuous drainage has worked very well. I have the unit sitting on concrete blocks to ensure it is elevated above the required level to properly drain
It has a 50-pint air flow capacity, which is higher than many at this price range
Frigidaire is a brand I know and trust
1 year manufacturer’s warranty (I brought the additional 4 year warranty because I don’t have good luck with electronics and just over $10 per year is not too bad)

Dislikes:
There was not a drainage hose included (I bought a cheap and short garden hose to use)

Meh:
If it allowed 1% incremental humidity settings, that would be great, but it’s not a deal breaker to me
It is heavy (44 LBS) so it’s good that it’s on casters, but moving it up and down stairs is a chore

Hopefully this honest review helps someone decide about this product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Dane,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2023","This dehumidifer seemed so promising, it looked so promising, it sounded so promising. It seemed like the perfect dehumidifer from what I thought was a good brand. I've had a full kitchen of appliances at 2 different locations from Frigidaire and so I thought what better company to purchase a dehumidifer from than them right? Wrong.
The stats were great. It looks better than most. It's energy efficient. It just all seemed so promising. I ordered it and when it was delivered I unpackaged it and in the basement it went. The basement never drops below 64F even in the winter.
It was quiet. It hummed along. It pushed a good amount of air even on low. The bucket had a window so you could easily see the level of water. The bucket was super easy to pull out and put back in, trust me on this. Becuase the replacement one I purchased from another brand works 100x better, but it doesn't look as good, doesn't feel as good, and the bucket is a bit more clumsy.
But then everything started to fail.
I noticed a stain in the bucket, but I didn't think much of it. I thought it was just something with the water. However, after doing some research it's the refrigerant leak that caused the stain...
After about 6-8 months of use set to 45% humidity and it was never running straight out, it would cycle on and off pretty healthily., it sprung a leak. The unit started icing up. I tried everything, but unfortunately they are not user servicable. It was still under the 1 year factory warranty so I called Frigidaire. And boy, this has been a horror show.
When I called them and explained to them the situation and gave them all of the information they needed, they deemed it needing a replacement and thank goodness I was still under warranty.
They email this site that isn't even related to them to to fill an online form to get a replacment. I did all that. Weeks pass by and I finally get an email that says my replacement has been approved I'll get another email in 3-5 business days when the warranty replacement ships.
Fast forward a month, and still nothing! So I call them back and spend 2 hours on the phone being transferred multiple times. Being told to call this company and that company. Having to call them back. Being pushed around again. No one knows anything! No status update, no replacement unit on the way yet. I try again a few days later using online messaging and nothing. Spent another few hours on that as they ""researched my concern"" to no avail.. It's been 2 months, I still don't have my warranty replacement. I filed a Better Business Bureau complaint against Frigidaire (Electrolux) and we shall see what happens. Totally disgusted...",1.0 out of 5 stars
DECEMBER,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2023","I live near Portland, OR, and the humidity is always around 75-85% in my apartment. I also have an indoor vegetable garden, which adds to the already high humidity of the area. I was getting mildew on the windows and window sills.
I have 3 guitars and 3 basses, 4 amps, and lots of other electronics, recording gear, and a computer. My guitars kept developing fret buzz. I'd level the frets and adjust them, get rid of the buzz, then it would come back in a few months. It took me too long to learn that constant exposure to humidity levels like this were destroying the instruments. Gave up on these ruined cheapish guitars and bought one nice expensive guitar.
But I got this dehumidifier first. Not gonna let this one get ruined by humidity. It works well, keeps the humidity down to 45%, in the living room of a 1,050 sq ft 2 bedroom apartment. The bucket fills up within 36 hours, usually (about 2 gallons). I use it to water the garden.
It turns off when it hits the target humidity, and back on as needed. I had a different dehumidifier first which kept the fan running constantly, even when the dehumidifier was disengaged. And it kept freezing up, grill covered in ice, so I returned it. This one has been running for 3 months now, no ice, no problems, and no noticeable impact to the electric bill.
It is a tad loud, but not an irritating abrasive sound. The sound doesn't bother me at all, but when I watch TV I like to keep the volume as low as possible, so I have to turn the dehumidifier off. To hear the TV with the dehumidifier on, I have to put it louder than I like, but not any louder than most people I know have their TVs set normally.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sunny Schubert,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2024","We bought the 50-pint dehumidifier. It's worked really well pretty much filling up daily for the last 3-years. It is getting a bit noisier so we've moved it out of the bedroom and into the bathroom. My only complaint is that the air that comes out of it is about 78-80 degrees F. It was starting to warm the bedroom in an uncomfortable way. However, the bathroom being a little warmer is very nice on cool spring mornings. I would say it'll work great for us for another 2 years. I think in a basement or attic it would work great for a long time. We have a small apartment and you can hear this thing in any room. It's a dull roaring white noise sound. Similar to a bathroom fan. I usually shut it off at night because it did keepe up on occasion. I do think it started getting louder after 2 years. These are a necessity in central Texas in the summer.

If you're looking for something for the bedroom I'd suggest a smaller quieter unit you keep closer to your person to reduce humidity in a room.

I'm removing 1 star because of the noise and the what produced. Otherwise it's a great product that still works as intended 3-years later.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Julez,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2024","This is a 50 pint Frigidedaire (Electrolux) dehumidifier. It does what it's supposed to do. It's new so I can't say much about its longevity, but overall, nearly any brand dehumidifier I've had in the last 15-20 years has been about the same and seems to die after a number of years. One feature that isn't promoted much on the website is that it does have a built-in air ionizer. So you have a little added bonus there.

The second part of this review has to do with something that I'm generally not thrilled with in most appliances and that's the available wifi and associated application for the device. Usually, these apps are trash and the wifi barely works. I thought, well maybe at a minimum it can at least part time tell me if the bucket is full, the cost wasn't much more, so might as well.

I'm so glad I went with the wifi option. Frigidaire created a clean and well built app. I'm actually impressed. I've added screenshots of the app.
It will direct you to the site you need to register the appliance with for warranty/recall purposes.
Shows you current humidity and humidity over time via graph.
You can toggle it on/off.
You can set a child lock so no one can play with the buttons.
There's a task scheduler for it and other appliances that are registered with it.
Nearly all control can be done from the app.
Push notifications.
And has all the associated personal assistant options.
I'm impressed with this, and I generally don't impress easily when it comes to IoT or appliance apps and their implementations.

However, this is still an IoT device and absolutely should NOT go on your internal network. It belongs on a guest or isolated network like every other IoT device you own. Nest, Ecobee, Kidde, Echo, Ring, Eufy, Phillips, any appliance manufacturer, etc... should always be isolated away from your computers, laptops, phones, printers, network storage, etc... devices.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Hunter Holmes,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2023","Energy efficiency , similar to wattage, can be misleading. This Frigidaire tested at full and continuous mode, used a little more energy than most of it's competitors. However it was found when used at a more typical setting, maybe 45%, rather than continuous. This machine now used less energy then it's competitors. As far as removing water, it's the best, I researched a lot. I have a Black and decker, same price range, it's lousy compared to this. These machines change almost every year, appearance, or cheapness or improvements. Ex: about 6 years ago, I had the same model Frigidaire and it was best back then, except one thing the water tank was just too small, Well guess what, now this Frigidaire has the biggest water tank of all of them. Also the hot air is less hot then they used to be, it's quieter than it used to be, by a considerable amount, more of a wind sound than a compressor motor sound. I think they actually found a better method, to quiet the compressor ( I'm not positive?) Anyway, it's a great unit. I would even go as far as to call it the industry standard. It removes a lot more water and at a quicker rate. It was the best 6 years ago,( at removing water) and it's a lot better now, all around. Except one drawback, the side slits that can be used for handles are not there, so it's a little harder to pick up, but the wheels are made well. You need not waste time looking further this is the best unit in it's price range, and like I said in the beginning, the energy used on all these products is only measured from one perspective, and perhaps it's not the best perspective. At typical settings this machine is more efficient than its competitors, except when it's measured at full throttle CONTINUOUS mode. And even then, it didn't score a lot less. I did get a lot of this information from, ( I can't remember,) but I also own this unit and have compared for myself.) I believe the competitors will be trying to copy, what Frigidaire has done here. At this price, I would call this product the industry standard! Look no further! Hunter Holmes -- Addendum -- I missed this at first. This unit has a handle that is sort of hidden. A recessed black plastic carrying handle that pulls out from the top of the unit with a 2 inch clearance and it's about 8 inches long. In this price range THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE INDUSTRY STANDARD! HUNTER HOLMES - ADDENDUM #2 - It's been about 3 months, and I still can't believe how quiet this machine is compared to, what was the same unit by FRIGIDAIRE 6 years ago, this current 2023 unit, I mostly hear fan and very little compressor refridgerator noise, the attenuated sound puzzles me in a great way.

RSH,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2023","For as long as I've owned a home I've bought Frigidaire dehumidifiers.

The units are NOT built to last. The codes are always the same. Fatal. F0 (Freeze Out) or EC (Evaporator Coil / Sealed System).

It appears to be a two-year ritual to search my mail for emails to electrolux.com and to re-familiarize myself and start a warranty claim... which I am once again in the process of doing. This time however I am writing this review.

When you receive a new unit it works exactly as expected. Hail the power of condensing water from air! Positive reviewers rejoice! It works its magic and all summer long you reap the rewards of a drier, less humid environment.

Then comes winter. The unit is stored, either powered on but sitting idle or fully powered off, eager for the next summer/fall blast of humidity and a call to action.

... except - next summer it no longer works. It's starting to get humid here in the Northeast and that is when I need this unit to work. It doesn't. It powers on. It runs the blower. You can even perhaps hear the compressor churn. Condensation. Nope. Pull the bucket. Bone dry. Eventually the unit cries foul and throws the F0 / EC code.

FAD704DWD (2014) - F0
FAD704DWD (2016) via RMA spring 2016 - F0 -- lasted that summer
FFAD7033R1 (2017) - EC
FFAD7033R1 (2019) via RMA summer 2019 (5 year sealed system warrant on 2017 purchase) - EC
FFAD5033W1 (2022) via RMA summer 2022 (a month short of 5 year sealed system warranty on 2017 purchase) - EC
FFAD5033W1 (2022) - separate purchase May 2022 - still running for now, now outside the 1 YR standard warranty

A part of me wonders if these units are simply designed with planned obsolescence in mind. Why build a unit that lasts one to two seasons? in the Northeast you generally would purchase one of these when humidity rises (late spring/summer) and you get a few months use then pack it up for winter with the expectation when you need it next it works.

So aside from the possibility of seeing if Frigidaire / Electrolux will replace the FFAD7033W1 (2022) that was newly manufactured December 2021 and only lasted the 2022 summer season... I do not believe my dollars are best spent on this brand any longer.

To Frigidaire's credit, the 5 year sealed system warranty is good and the RMA replacement process is usually painless. Fill a form. Get approved. Unit shows up at your doorstep. The problem is, the replacement process shouldn't be so painless in a way. It's like they've gotten really good at shipping replacements. REALLY good.

... I'd rather have the unit last 5 years and get a sense I got my money's worth than the hassle of a humid basement for a couple of weeks during the replacement process.

EDIT: So today I contacted Frigidaire by phone. It was not a good experience. I explained to them I had a FFAD5033W1 manufactured December 2021, bought May 2022 and put into service last summer for only a few months. It has been off all winter; no need. It of course is now June 2023. The first time I needed it was this month. It is returning EC code after repeated power cycles. Warranty Claim DENIED. They no longer have a 5 year sealed system warranty. The unit now has a single 1 year warranty from the date of purchase. I wonder why that is ... </sarcasm>

The unit is 18 months old from its date of manufacture... bought and ran for at most 3 months last year and is now dead.

EDIT: September 2023. The FFAD5033W1 purchased May 2022 is now returning EC code constantly. The unit is in pristine condition in a clean area and ran daily during the summer. In a room with ~60% RH and 70 degree room temperatures it has reached its end. This unit lasted essentially two summers and that's it.

I see Amazon touts ""sold 1K units last month"". I'm sure they did and Frigidaire loves you for it. While their reputation precedes here, folks are soon going to find out their money is well spent elsewhere.

NEVER will I buy anything Frigidaire again.",1.0 out of 5 stars

trish,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","I'm having the opposite problem than many other reviews... this unit won't stop running!
I purchased this unit in July 2023. Ran great and lowered humidity as promised. Put it away for the winter in a closet. Brought it back out a few weeks ago and again seemed to be working well. Matched my Hygrometer reading within a couple degrees. However, I have noticed over the last several days that it just keeps running. The compressor turns on , it runs for awhile, then turns off, but then turns right back on again. So this evening I'm trying to sleep and it keeps doing this (I have it set at 45%). I have two Hygrometers in my room that both say the humidity is at 40%. The unit keeps running... so I set it to 50%, and it still just keeps running even though the humidity level is still down at 41%. I finally changed the setting to 60% and it finally has stayed shut down. And guess what?, both Hygrometers still say it's only at 41% in the room 30 minutes later. And thankfully the temperature has dropped 2 degrees to 73°. Guess I'll be calling to see if I can get a replacement. Fingers crossed! 🤞😬
Also wanted to mention the fact that for 3 mornings I kept waking up completely dehydrated. Mouth so dry that I could barely swallow. Wish I had clued in sooner that the problem was the dehumidifier, not that I wasn't drinking enough water. (Derp!)

Seez52,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2024","This is my 4th Frigidaire unit. This one lasted almost two years. I run it 24/7 all year long. It does a good job. This particular model is really quiet and it seems to work as it should. I use a direct drain and I like the setup Frigidaire uses for this. Occasionally the hose will become obstructed and the bucket fills. I purchased the model with wifi hoping it would tell me when the bucket is full but apparently that is not a push option on the app. Really that's the only useful thing the app could do.

I've had several brands of these: Maytag, LG etc. they all last about the same amount of time. Usually they fail just outside the warranty period typically 18-24 months. I do have another Frigidaire just like this one that's going on three years, wow! I learned about three units ago that you always purchase the extended warranty that Amazon offers during checkout. I get the 4 year one it's usually $50.

This one is a replacement for the same model purchased in June of 2022. I submitted a claim through Amazon on my phone and within 5 minutes had a credit on my account for what I originally paid. Ordered this one, it was a little more expensive, and it was here in two days. It was an easy and quick way to get up and running again. Never buy one of these portable dehumidifiers, regardless of the brand, without a 3 or 4 year extended warranty. They are all made in China and simply are not intended to be long term use appliances. Once you understand that, and get the extra warranty, your satisfaction with the product is a lot better, LOL.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Judy L.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2022","We have a large basement with 3 rooms that I grow a number of vegetables and herbs in. Prior to getting this dehumidifier, the humidity in our basement was continuously in excess of 70% caused by evaporation of water in the pots. Unfortunately, we were told this caused humidity in our attic that wasn't noticed until we found mold growing. This was a very expensive lesson for us as we had to have the roof and all of the wood below it replaced at a cost of over $15K.

I am not going to get into any technical stuff like the efficiency of the condenser, but will say this dehumidifier has helped to solve our humidity problem. In searching for a dehumidifier to meet our needs, I had to learn the capacity of humidity remove was different than the size of the tank to be emptied. The 50 pint ( or 6.25 gallons) capacity of this dehumidifier is the amount of moisture that will be removed from the air in a 24 hour period. I would guess the water tank holds about 2 gallons of water as we need to empty it 3 times in a 24 hour period.

Since the humidity in our basement is high because of the plants, we have this unit set to continuous, but you can also set it to run until a desired humidity is reached. When the water container is full, it automatically stops until the container is emptied. You can also set the fan to high or low. When the filter gets dirty, a light shows on the top of the unit. Cleaning the filter is a matter of spraying it clean with a faucet spray and drying it with a towel.

This unit is in a room 30' x 15', and the humidity has been reduced from over 70% to 40%. We have had this dehumidifier for over a month, and are very happy with it. It consistently keeps the humidity down and is very easy to maintain.

UPDATE 5/27/22:
Since our basement is very large with 3 rooms, two of which contain plants, we decided to buy another one of these dehumidifiers so we could one in each of the plant rooms. The humidity in both rooms is staying around 40% and out attic is now staying dry. This has also helped to reduce the humidity in the house which make it much more comfortable during the summer.

UPDATE 09/24/23:
We bought 2 of the dehumidifiers, and they worked well for about 15 months. After the 15 months, both units started leaking which was, of course after the warranty had expired. We finally replaced both of them. Considering the cost, these dehumidifiers should last longer then 15 months, in my opinion. We replaced them with a different brand, and also bought the extended insurance just to be safe.

Altmanmom,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2024",I researched many dehumidifiers before buying this one. Works well. We empty it about every 2-3 days. Having a lid on the bucket is helpful as water doesn’t spill as much when carrying up the stairs from basement.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Simone S,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2024","After 3yrs of almost constant use my Frigidaire dehumidifier started acting up (seemed like compressor was stuck on and humming even when turned unit off) on Christmas Day. I decided to purchase the newer model (looks EXACTLY the same) as a used like new Amazon Warehouse return. It arrived on its side (not good) inside a larger Amazon box with zero packaging material in the Amazon box. The actual Fridigaire box was very slightly damaged but the product inside was strapped and taped with plenty of styrofoam (still brushing it off the machine lol) and seems brand new.

Unfortunately, when I plugged it in, it's much louder than the previous model and often makes an annoying clunking when the compressor turns off and on (old model didn't clunk). The compressor sounds like it's straining and similar to the old dying one I continued to use after the initial issues, to see if it was really done for (unplugged it when leaving house or sleeping). These noises are disturbing while I'm working from home. Unsure sure if I'm going to keep this, but may reach out to Fridgidaire to check warranty support first. I really don't want to pack this heavy thing back up and return it. I also wonder if it being shipped on its side (says not to tip the unit) somehow damaged it.

As far as pulling water out of the air, it works great. It's almost filled the bucket on low speed (off and on) since this morning. (FL EL Nino winter, 86% humidity outside at 1145pm.

Cory S. Estes,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024","We've had another dehumidifier for many years. It seemed to work fine and did what it was supposed to do in our basement but wasn't quiet and we noticed increases in electric consumption during the seasons ti was in use. One day a service technician was in inspecting a water control system in our basement. He looked at the old dehumidifier, said, ""Hmmm..."", pulled out his phone and looked up a recall article for that particular model. It seems it had been recalled by the company as a potential fire hazard. He sent me a link for the article and recommended we stop using it; he had the same model in his home. After reading through the recall I contacted the company as directed and was instructed to ""get on a list until it was determined how the recall was going to be handled."" At that point we decided it was time to buy a replacement!

We did lots of research and felt this was the brand and model to get. Low and behold there was even one available via Amazon Warehouse that was new-in-box but the top of the box was slightly damaged. Sold! It arrived in good time, was in the original box, and works perfectly.

We're very happy with it. It is much quieter, efficient, and though we haven't noticed the effect on the electric bill yet, it seems like it'll have to be an improvement because it's running for shorter time. We're happy with it and have recommended it to friends and family.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Ann,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2023","Just recieved the new model. I had the old one for just over a year and it broke. I decided to replace it with the same thing because I think the problem was user error rather than quality. I can't comment on longevity of the new model since I only just got it, but I would note that it is different from the old one. I think it is a bit noisier. It is also more compact- specifically in height. The only major difference is the vent. Unlike the older model that is pictured in the item description, this one does not have a vent and handle on top. The handle is gone and the vent is now on the side, which is both a good and a bad thing. It needs more space around the machine to make sure it can vent properly which means I can't put it back in the same place as the old one. But, it also means that dust isn't falling into the vent when the machine is off or in sleep mode, which is a huge plus for me since the reason I have it in the first place is due to a major dust allergy.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Unplugged unit and after plugging back in error code disappeared but within an hour or two same error code was displayed and unit stopped running. Repeated process several more times with same result. Electrolux was contacted and told by them that the unit could not be repaired and a new unit would be shipped at no cost. Email from Electrolux on May 20, 2024 said that arrangements were being made to ship a new unit. However, a month later a new unit had not been delivered so Electrolux was contacted again. Told it would be shipped within 5 business days, however a new unit was not delivered until July 23, 2024, two months after originally contacting Electrolux. Also told that warranty would only be for the original one year that ended in June 2024. As of August 5, 2024 new unit has been functioning appropriately after approximately two weeks of use. Given the short amount of time the original unit lasted and the two months it took for Electrolux to replace it with a new dehumidifier I can not recommend purchasing this model dehumidifier.",2.0 out of 5 stars

florida1,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2020","I bought these mainly for the wifi, since they had much less expensive models with similar features available. I bought 3 of these units to start, with hopes to perhaps buy at least 1 more. My first recommendation is to watch the connect to wifi video since you have to connect to the humidifier as if it was a wifi network, in order to connect. This is not intuitive, but even after doing this, it took multiple times before my unit would connect anyhow. Once connected, the app tells you that you have to register the unit, so I entered all my data and it kept giving me the same error message. (ECP0108, please check your information for accuracy). I tried many different ways to enter my information, but ALL gave me the same error message. (if you look on iTunes, it seems many people get the same error message), and I do wish I had read the app ratings before purchasing, since it has a 1.4 out of 5 star rating. I called their support Friday and after long holds and 20 minutes of discussion, was told I needed a different department. I was transferred and left a voice mail (and today, I was told by many, that they don’t even have a voicemail system). In any event, after wasting many more hours today and one email response with some suggestions which did not work.....I still have an app that is nonfunctional, since it says my unit it not registered. I was told they have sent a ticket to the IT department, who does not take calls, and someone will hopefully get back to me in a few more days. Dehumidifier so far, gets 4 stars, wifi gets 0 stars, customer service 1 star

Addendum: After much persistence on my part, I finally got to speak with IT, and they did release an app update that fixed some of the bugs. It took over a month, and they still need to optimize and fix further, but I do now have all 3 units hooked up and can control via iPhone or iPad app.

Just another comment, like any web based control, after a power outage or reboot of my router, only 2 of the 3 dehumidifiers connected back automatically back to the apps, so had I not been home, had been away on a trip, or whatever, I would NOT have been able to get it working. Turning the unit off and on, or trying to reconnect via the apps did nothing and the only thing that worked was unplugging the unit and plugging it back in. I will have to see over time how often this happens and if so, whether it is always the same unit that has trouble reestablishing a connection.",4.0 out of 5 stars

jewno,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2022","After reading many reviews ranging from 1 to 5 stars, I was scared to purchase this product, but I have to say, I'm not disappointed.

Let's start with why I purchased it - I needed to bring down the humidity in my west Texas home (~1,730 sqft). The humidity in my house with refrigerated air was between 55 (downstairs) and 65% (upstairs). After receiving the dehumidifier, I placed it upstairs in my loft, which overlooks most of my downstairs.

PERFORMANCE (5 STARS): I ran the dehumidifier on its continuous setting for about 3-4 days, and I didn't see any immediate results. The humidity in my house was the same, but it was removing moisture from the air - about 12 gallons a day. I was on the verge of returning the product, but on day 4 or 5, the humidity levels began to drop dramatically. After about a week of running, they are down to about 30% (downstairs) and 43% (upstairs), ±2%.

TEMPERATURE: I read some reviews about the air from the exhaust being hotter than the current air temperature - this is true on occasion. I felt that the air leaving the machine was a little warmer than the surrounding temperature; however, it wasn't anything significant. Other times, there was hardly any noticeable difference in the air temperature from the exhaust and the surrounding air temperature.

PLACEMENT: I read in the instructions that this unit should be placed at least 12 inches from the wall on any side. After looking at the unit, the air intake is on the rear (which looks like a design flaw). I feel this could have been better placed on the sides or front (but hey, I'm not an engineer). I wasn't going to put this in the middle of the room, so I simply turned the unit around and put the front of it against the wall, so the rear (where the air intake is) was facing outward. The only inconvenient part of this was that the water reservoir was only accessible from the front. This means you cannot see the water level or empty it without turning it around. This minor inconvenience takes seconds to do and needs to be done once a day (twice max). Even though you can't see the water level, the unit will automatically turn off once it is full.

NOISE (4 STARS): While quieter than others (from what I've read), this unit is still a bit noisy. I didn't conduct a decibel test, but it sounds like a large floor fan when on high.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Paul,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","Updated 7/1/2023 - a couple weeks after the first review. Updated the app and it reconnects after returning home now . And the Alexa app is not powering the dehumidifier off. The skill is still strange, but it's no longer causing problems. Adding another star.

First review:
If you just consider this unconnected (no app, no Alexa) the dehumidifier works great. Quitter than older model. But the connected features are terrible.

The Alexa skill is strange - there is one slider labeled Humidity and one labeled Percentage. I assume onw of these the preferred humidity which I can set using the panel on the device. Why are there 2 sliders in Alexa skill? What do they do? Not explained. And after enabling this skill, the dehumidifier turns off. I disabled the skill.

The iPhone app works but needs hand-holding. Whenever I leave he house, I loose WiFi access and the app disconnects. This is expected. When I reconnect to Wifi, the app tells me there's a WiFi problem and I should check the router. This is a bug. The app should reconnect first. If I force the app the stop (using the iPhone App Switcher). Then start the app, all works fine. I have dozens of ""smart"" devices are all others handle leaving and returning to WiFi range fine.

Without the connected features, I'd give this 5 stars. But since I paid $100 extra for model with WiFi, I give this 3 stars. I hope the software is fixed and I can change my rating.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Steve Cramer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2021","I was a bit concerned because it looked like a mix of reviews, but I found the unit worked incredibly well (in fact, I ended up turning it to 55% because at 45% I felt the moisture pulling out of my body when I walked in the garage. TOO dry!

The unit seems quiet to me, certainly not loud, but I do keep the fan on medium, not high. It's in my garage. I can't imagine being bothered by the sounds. It is more like a very small window A/C unit, not even that noisy.

(I had been using 'Dampits' and the bag took a month to fill, so I figured I really didn't have a humidity problem. But I noticed some mildew smells from some old cases I put in the garage, and when I saw some white mold on a sheet of plywood, I knew something was wrong. I turned on this unit, sprayed the plywood and cases with a mold disinfectant, wiped with paper towels, and the next day everything was bone dry, no trace of mold or mildew, and the plywood even turn lighter and flattened out. The tank had over a gallon of water in it. ONE night! So much for the Dampits.

I kept things at 45% for a few days, went over everything in the garage with mold remover spray, etc., and I could tell that everything was getting dried out nicely. I had a bunch of cardboard boxes stored in there and you could feel that mushy-sogginess that was then light and crisp and felt new.

Yes, this works extremely well. As I said, I found that 55% was a better setting for ongoing use, and the medium fan setting.

I still haven't set up the hose for automatic emptying, but now I only have to empty every other day, sometimes every 3rd day, depending on the outside humidity. At some point I will establish a permanent place for the unit and run the hose through the wall. I expect that the unit probably won't turn on much in the fall and winter months, mainly need this for late spring and summer, early fall.

(Btw, it is gravity feed for the hose, but the connection is in the middle of the back of the unit, so there is some height that allows me to put the hole through the wall above the 8"" concrete block height on top of my slab that my walls rise from.)

There is a filter that you will be reminded to clean, but I really haven't noticed it getting dirty. But my garage is quite new, so maybe it will get dirtier in other situation. Regardless, it washes out quite easily.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Dong W.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2022","In Feb 2021, I purchased this model after some careful research on the internet, knowing that our basement usually gets very humid in the three months of summer, and there is a range of performances among the models on the market. This model was great when it worked at the beginning, just as many positive reviews described. It then went to hibernation as fall came and the air became dry. After I turned it on the second summer, in 2022, I soon realized that something was wrong. A block of ice was accumulating on the condensing unit, which then grew onto the filter and the outer cover in the back. It eventually glued all of them together so that I couldn’t open the back cover without fearing to break it. This ice, when melted, does not collect in the tank. It accumulates elsewhere in the unit and then leaks onto the floor to form a puddle.
While waiting for the ice to melt after turning off the power, I went on the internet to look for the cause, and ruled out the simple factors: low ambient temperature, clogged filter, broken fan, etc. Outwardly the unit looks fine, making all the right noises when turned on. It has also been well maintained: if I told you it was brand new (see the first two photos), you wouldn’t be able to tell that it is 2 years old. Yet every time, 5 minutes after I turn it on, ices start to form. The last photo shows ice accumulation at the lower half after one hour of operation. It seems one of the sensors has failed, not something a non-professional can easily diagnose or replace.

When I called Fridigiare, I was told that I would have to buy a new one. They wouldn’t replace it because it was out of the one year warranty, even though I pointed out it was really in use for about three months. The company put dehumidifiers in their “major appliance” category, but it is not like a fridge that runs constantly, or a range that you turn on every day. It is more like an air conditioning unit that one uses only when it is really hot.

I understand that the 12-month warranty is just company policy and that as a company, it will try its best to avoid cost, but it feels rather shabby for a company to pretend that it is perfectly beyond reproach when one piece of their major appliance fails after one single season of use.

I am sure that most units of this model work superbly, and that many thousands of customers are luckier than I am. However, if you are about to shell out close to $300 on a dehumidifier, would you not worry that after you put it away after the first season, there is a chance it may not come back next time? Now that I am again on the market for a decent dehumidifier, at least it should have a meaningful warranty, and that rules out Frigidaire.

P.S. I indeed purchased an equivalent model from a different manufacturer, costing half as much as the Frigidaire one, with a warranty twice as long. Fingers crossed!",2.0 out of 5 stars

T.R.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2024","I cannot recommend this product. The unit seemed to function correctly upon delivery. However, exactly one month to the date, the dehumidifier began severely leaking. Specifically, the unit would not automatically turn off when the bucket became full--this is a serious issue in humid climates as 50 pints can fill up in a few hours. On more than one occasion, I awoke to find water pooling on my hardwood floors and baseboards.

Making matters worse, customer service has been virtually nonexistent. It took several weeks to file a warranty claim as same seems to be handled through a third party affiliated with Electrolux. After finally submitting my claim, it was approved and I was notified I would receive a replacement unit. Several weeks have passed and I have had no follow up. Contacting Frigidaire is unhelpful as the representatives provide different answers; one advises the unit is backordered and I will receive a comparable model. another that they cannot locate my warranty claim. The number provided for warranties leads immediately to a full mailbox of a random individual.

In conclusion, Frigidaire sold a faulty product and has yet to honor its contractual warranty. For these reasons, I strongly suggest you look elsewhere for a dehumidifier and consider Honeywell, Hisense, or any of the other options on the market.",2.0 out of 5 stars
AJ,"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2023","Arrived on time and positioned upright as product box says (to keep oil in sealed compressor upright). After unboxing, it looked even better than pictures. Nice white glossy look and was easy to setup. Instructions inside, including App instructions if you plan to use Wifi feature

Nice smooth sounding fan with multiple speeds. Buyer beware: I bought and immediately returned different dehumififier named Domdre (sold by Domdre Star on Amazon) because I paid for 50 pint and they sent 22 pint (both look same but 50 is slightly larger. It looked like picture but seemed small for a 50 pint unit.

Model number on amazon listing didn't match either their 22 or 50 pint. So beware of that likely scam or just incompetence. I could see many getting scammed because they don't check to confirm they got what they ordered. So go with ""sold by Amazon"" to get Fridgidaire that unsures well designed and supported product.

A Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2020","UPDATE: The cutoff switch failed so it spent several hours dumping water on the floor. As I pulled the overflowing bucket out (it normally shuts off with about 3/4 inch to spare) it started beeping to complain that there was no bucket. Thanks! Definitely a 0-star product. Original review below, which already wasn't great.

I've had 3 different dehumidifiers now. This one isn't great either, for a few reasons.

This is the kind with the optional hose output sticking out the back, and with a knob-style cap screwed onto it for normal bucket-collection use. I've seen a lot of reviews complaining about leaks from the cap, so I looked at it and oh boy is it not a quality device. Bear with me, it's hard to describe. First, the edge of the output tube the cap screws against is slightly rough, which is the wrong way to make something which has to fit against a watertight gasket (which is in the cap). Second, the gasket is a thick ring shape, with a hole in the middle. If it were a solid disc, just the contact between it and the thin edge of the output pipe would have to fit tight into the rubber to form a seal. But with the hole in the middle, it also has to be tight enough to seal the flat gasket against the inside of the cap. THIRD, the front side of the gasket isn't even flat! It has some kind of raised part number characters sticking out, so again you have to put it on extra tight to make sure the non-flat rubber seals against the pipe.

If you run it on ""continuous"" mode, the 2-digit number display turns into a ""CO"" and NO LONGER FUNCTIONS AS A HUMIDITY METER. The panel has no mode button and therefore no light to indicate the mode (continuous mode is accessed by clicking the auto level all the way down until it shows CO), so they hijack the humidity level display to show it. So if you want this thing to run continuously, you will have to buy a separate humidity meter in order to monitor the humidity level.

The fan is noisy, even on the lowest setting, in a slightly pulsing way, not just a loud woosh but an annoying up and down volume. I looked into the vent, and the fan cylinder (it's the type made up of dozens of long straight thin parallel blades arranged in a cylinder shape) wobbles as it spins. Junk. The compressor part itself doesn't seem much louder than a much weaker model I recently had, it's all the crummy fan. And in addition to being annoying, I have to wonder if this poor balance will shorten the life of the parts.

The collection bucket was poorly assembled from the factory. It consists mainly of 2 parts, the large white bucket and a clear lid which prevents re-evaporation. The lid is not supposed to be removable (the handle assembly makes this impossible), but it wasn't fully snapped in place. Easily fixed, but a sad statement.

There are so many of these things under different brand names. There are more brands of dehumidifiers here than there are flavors of ice cream or soda at a grocery store. It's ridiculous, and they are all junk for various reasons not directly related to the most expensive core technological component. There is no particular reason to get this one. I tried this one because it's a ""real"" brand, but it turns out it's just another piece of trash.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Michael,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2021","Well, it is definitively an impressive dehumidifier. It reduced humidity from 71 to 35 in just one hour (in Continuous Mode). I adjusted it to 40, and the dehumidifier kept the humidity level to 40 all the time, even after taking a shower. Incredible!

BUT...

The Frigidaire's customer service is mediocre. I mean, if your dehumidifier gets broken, and you think Frigidaire will resolve your problem in a timely manner, all I can say is, good luck.

My dehumidifier stopped working two weeks after its first use. It was showing the error code: EC, which I don't know what it means but Frigidaire cannot repair it. The problem is, I spent all morning with the fabricant, after providing them with all the information they requested.

After the first hour of conversation, Frigidaire (the fabricant) told me I can still use the Amazon 30-day return policy. However, Amazon didn't has this in stock, and I wanted the same model. My hero was the Amazon's customer service who discussed the issue with Frigidaire to see if they can replace the unit (since Amazon didn't has it in stock). But the fabricant took another hour to figure out that the issue should be transferred to another Frigidaire's department. And that other department never answered us the call because they were too busy. At the end, Frigidaire was completely incompetent and unable to resolve the issue in a timely manner.

The fabricant made me waste my day for nothing. So after that, the Amazon's customer service representative suggested me to just use the 30-day money back guarantee, and I see if I can get it in another website (since I didn't want another model, and Amazon don't know when it will be back in stock). Amazon handled the issue very well. My concern is Frigidaire's customer service.

So, the end of the story: I used the Amazon's guarantee, and I purchased the same model in another website, and I'm waiting for the new one because I saw how powerful is this thing. This dehumidifier is definitively impressive. That's the reason why I give it 3 stars. I cannot give it 5 stars because of the mediocre Frigidaire's customer service.

Now, if I'm unlucky again with the next unit, I will let you know, and I will come back here to give it one star and move on to another dehumidifier brand. But so far, I'm impressed, let's see how it goes. I'll let you know.",3.0 out of 5 stars

We finally got around and called Frigidaire since it was less than a year from delivery and the Amazon listing noted that there was a warranty period. Frigidaire refused to help us because they told us the seller was not an authorized seller and the warranty was voided. We then contacted Amazon, who took down our story and said they would contact the seller for us, and would stand behind their (Amazon's) listing. The seller, Reverse Logistics Center, contacted us and wanted to know about the issue. We asked for a refund of our money since it was under the warranty period stated on Amazon. They countered with offering a refurbished unit, not a new unit. Beggars can't be choosers, so we accepted. The unit arrived within a couple of days (this time, upright in the manufacturer's box), and so far it is working fine.

Bruce,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2024","I loved this unit for the two summers I used it, but it failed afterwards. Being it was used in my main living space in my non-air conditioned home, I used the unit only in the evening and overnight hours as it generated a fair amount of heat when the compressor was active. So, its use was not constant. I kept it clean and cared for it and it did a wonderful job. It worked wonderfully up until I stored it this past winter. When I pulled it out to use for this summer, the compressor would not come on in spite of the high humidity readings in the room and a properly set machine. Sadly, there appears to be many such stories such as mine. One should probably take with a grain of salt the reviews that are glowingly written after only a few weeks of use. I do believe that a unit that I paid a lot of money for should have a life more than a limited two year span (really, only about 8 months of use and only at nighttime).

David B.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2021","I purchased this on behalf of my father but had it shipped to my address first. When I received it, I noticed that the box was kind of banged up, there were dings in a couple of the sides and it was clear that it had been dropped on one of the bottom corners. This was confirmed when I opened the box and noted that the bottom piece of styrofoam was cracked. I did a visual review of the exterior of the dehumidifier and found no damage. When I pulled the bucket, I noted that the float appeared to have been dislodged and was in the bottom of the bucket. I presume it was dislodged, because I felt if it was deliberately unattached, it would have been packaged and situated to prevent it from rattling around. I had to remove the plastic top of the bucket to retrieve and reattach the float. I plugged the unit in, turned it on, and set the humidity level low and let it run though the afternoon and overnight. It filled the bucket and shut off shortly before morning. I emptied the bucket and noted that it was not designed efficiently for pouring. After pouring out most of the water, I had to turn the bucket in order to get the rest of the water into position to get emptied out. Being satisfied that the unit was still in working order, I took it to my father and we installed it in his basement. We attached a hose to the Continuous Drain connection and turned the unit on again. Within minutes, water began dripping out of the hose. It worked quietly and efficiently. The only other thing that puzzled me about the design of the unit was the base. Either it was not designed to be operated without the wheels or if the wheels could be removed, then it was not well designed to sit on a flat surface, there was only a small triangular base that would touch the floor and it did not appear to be well suited for stability without the wheels.

Nicole,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2023","Does this do its job? Yes, definitely, but please take note of my complaints...

1. This thing LOVES to beep. It will beep when it's full. It will beep when you take the bucket out to dump it. And I don't just mean a single beep. It probably beeps 10 times each. And it's loud! I have this in the basement and can hear it on the ground level. If you are using this in a room you actually use, I imagine it would be even more annoying. It would definitely be impossible to sleep through the beeping.

2. The rated size seems incorrect. I got the 22 pint, rated for covering 2400 square feet. It's in a 700 square foot basement, so less than 1/3 the maximum area. It fills up twice a day. If it were in a 2400 square foot room, I can't even imagine how often it would need to be emptied.

3. Even besides the beeping, it is not quiet. I have never owned a dehumidifier so maybe it's normal for it to sound like a loud fan, but the image on the product description saying it's as quiet as a library is completely misleading. Again, I have this placed in a basement, but if everything is quiet on the main level, I can hear this thing running downstairs.

Overall, it does what it's supposed to, but I honestly regret thinking that a familiar brand name was worth the price increase compared to the random foreign Amazon brands.",3.0 out of 5 stars
AverageJoe,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2023","This dehumidifier did an amazing job at clearing moisture from spaces. Its noise level wasn't too bothersome. Ease of setup and operation made it enjoyable to work with. However, it ultimately had to go back for one reason and that is something that plagues any product like this. The amount of heat it puts out to do its job offsets the value it provides. Keep this away from where you regularly sit and relax.

Better yet talk to your HVAC repairman about putting a permanent setup into your primary duct work. They make units that will install directly above your coils and condition the air moisture as its leaving the main duct. That setup just requires you to do a season knob adjustment between winter and summer to change desired humidity levels.

Bottom line: If you're going to buy this and use it, keep it installed in your basement near the intake for your HVAC cold-air returns. At least that way it will condition the air your HVAC is cycling back out into the house. If you put this in a regular living space it will heat up that space.",4.0 out of 5 stars

kat,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2022","We purchased this unit because of good reviews from testing sites. We run a dehumidifier non stop in our RV in a coastal area with a lot of rain. Our first was a Keystone which worked great for 6 years, then started leaving water on the floor. Since it was not ranked as high we chose the Frigidaire.
First the Frigidaire doesn't have carry handles on the sides. We move it in and out of the RV or people moving it downstairs will find it slick to hold on. These are fairly big and heavy.
It has a hose attachment at the back. It warns to make sure it is tightly closed when not using a hose but we didn't. Water on the floor, but once tightly closed it is fine.
This unit does not pump warm air into the room as our other one did. Having warm air was nice in the RV but not needed in our house. This frigidaire fan pumps a lot of air but it is cool.
The air must be able to reach the back in order to take out the moisture. We always left our old one next to the cabinet to save on space, but noticed this one was not taking out the same amount of water overnight. It had to come out 12 inches into the room to work better.

Vicky,"Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2023","I purchased mine in March 2022 and I don’t run it continuously but I use it in my Florida home which has high humidity. I typically run it twice a day. I will put it in a back hallway and run it and as the humidity drops it pulls it from the rest of the house and buy osmosis, lowers it across my house! If I have it in a room, like a bedroom and run it yes, it does increase the temperature but once I turn it off then the temperature levels out and I have less humidity so I’m more comfortable. I’ve had zero problems with it. I love that you can set a timer or a percentage of humidity that you want it to run out. Sometimes if I go to bed, I feel that’s a little humid. I will run it on a timer for an hour and a half And I then I’m comfortably sleeping. The noise is like a high fan noise which is why I have it in the back hallway. I’ve never had a problem with error codes or leaking etc. I came to buy a second one that I want to leave in my bedroom and I’m reading all these horrible reviews for 2023.

no body,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2023","purchased direct from Frigidaire.

The controls for this unit are somewhat restrictive. It starts on the Continuous function, during which you can't see the relative humidity display. The humidity control has a range of 35-60. You cannot go higher, and below 35 is Continuous mode. I set the speed to low. The fan is quite powerful.

The unit draws air through the back and blows it through its right, or your left. Can kind of be rotated if you don't like that. Being a refrigerant dehmidifier, it does generate quite a bit of heat.

I really liked the water storage tank. The handle makes it easy to carry, and it didn't feel heavy. There are a number of openings through which you can pour the water, but this also means that the tank can release water back into the atmosphere when the unit isn't in operation. The unit will flash the ""full"" light whenever the limit switch is open, including when you remove the tank, which is nice and annoying at the same time.

The tank holding compartment design is where it fails. There is a tank retaining clip and it is FRAGILE. I've only removed the tank about 4 times, and on that 4th time, I couldn't get the tank to ""snap"" in. The left side would pop out slightly, and it was ""loose"". Upon inspection, there was a shiny clip below the tank limit switch that seemed to have bent when I pushed the tank into it. I am not sure what its original form is, but it seemed like it was attached to the top of the cube part, and it had broken off when the tank was lifted(during removal). This caused the shiny piece to drop down, where before it was in a semi-horizontal triangle.

Fortunately, I was able to ""fix"" it. This involves manually bending the clip around until the top JUST rests on top of the cube, and the middle has to have enough bend to allow the bottom to clear the limit switch, shown in picture. If it does not clear the switch, the unit will not stop if it overflows. If you're unable to do this, I hypothesize that it'd be possible to put tape on the top of the cube and attach it to the end of the clip so that it normally rests in a horizontal position.",2.0 out of 5 stars

KTM,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2023","I have two of the predecessor models of this unit. The older one has been running like a champ for years with no problems!

This is a newer version of that same unit and so far so good but we haven't had it too long yet, so fingers crossed.

What I like about both the older and newer model is that the drier air blows out the top of the unit, giving better air circulation and keeping the moisture off the mirror, window and walls. Another nice feature is the timer function. You can simply press the timer to have it go off in 30 , 60 etc. min after you're done showering.

JKD,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","Purchased this 50pt dehumidifier June 2023 after our previous Frigidaire from 2017 stopped working. This unit worked fine through the summer through early December when it got cool and dry in the fall time and i turned it off for the season. I always assure that the unit is free from obstructions, the filter is cleaned routinely and when not in use, it is unplugged and covered (so no dust or bugs get into the vents. I recently turned it back on at the beginning of May 2024 and it will run for a bit then display an EC code. I've troubleshot what is indicated in the owners manual such as assuring the outlet voltage is proper and the basement temp is between 41 - 89F. When it does run it was pulling a little water from the air but now it does not seem to be at all. Thankfully there is just about a month left of the manufacturers warranty and hoping they send a new one. But ultimately if I'm spending $250 or more, i expect to get more than 5-6 months use out of a product. Frigidaire has provided us with many hard working appliances in the past, and many we still have in the house, but sadly this has really put a bad taste in my mouth about purchasing another Frigidaire dehumidifier in the future.

It is nonsense. Currently on hold with them for over an hour now. NEVER AGAIN will i buy another Frigidaire and I will make sure everyone i know hears of this as well.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2021","While after a few hours, I managed to get the float device attached in the water collection bin, the biggest barrier was the plastic cover on the bin itself. It looks like it can be removed but I was afraid to force it out of fear of breaking or cracking it. If the float comes loose again I'm afraid of the hoops I have to jump through to reconnect it. If anyone has been able to remove this seemingly useless plastic covering please let me know. I will revise this review after I have had the opportunity to test its efficiency and the pump function. I have found customer service to be horrible and unresponsive.

Update July 22: I discovered from reading all customer questions that the plastic splash cover does come off and the procedure for doing so, although I haven’t tried to remove it yet. I was also able to figure out which hose opening to use with the pump, again by reading customer responses to questions, so thank you Amazon customers! As far as customer service goes, to clarify, I rate the helpfulness from the manufacturer a zero. One Amazon customer service rep did her best to help me but we kept missing connections. When I attempted to call again, a second rep was willing to help but while she was trying to contact the manufacturer while I waited on the line, a different rep picked the phone up which meant I would have to go through my whole spiel again.

The pump has given up. It's out of warranty so the only recouse is an afer market pump which I will try. I'm downgrading this to two stars. My guess is the dehumdifier will go in another year or so. It seems all these units come from the same factory in China and all have limited life expectancies. I tried one of the commerical units and suspect it would hold up longer (3 to 5 year warranties) but it was way too noisy.

Original review 7/2022
Seems like a solid product and does the trick. I've had it running in our very damp basement (relative humidity was 76% before we started) for the past several days and we are now down to relative humidity of 40% according to our humidistat.

What I like:

1. the pump kicks in automatically when the bucket fills and sends it via a small hose where you want it. I don't know yet how much lift this pump can support but will be finding out as we direct this water outside via a basement window which will need a lift of about 8'.
2. the compressor stops when it reaches the set point. The fan stops shortly thereafter.
3. it is quiet enough but clearly it generates white noise which might be an issue in a bedroom.

Why not five stars:

1. the packaging is way too excessive. what a total waste. Too much styrofoam, plastic, and cardboard. Yes, I understand this comes from China but why wrap the power cord in a bunch of plastic, the instruction manual in plastic, and the whole thing in plastic and then surround it all by styrofoam and double thickenss cardboard. All of this held together with industrial tape!
2. There are two water outlets on the rear; one is for continuous draining and the other via the pump. I'd have preferred a single output and a garden hose attachement for both rather than the rather unimpressive 1/4"" plastic hose with a push fitting to the rear. time will tell how this stands up.

This is our second unit and we like the larger size and pump. It's worth the extra cost and has done a better job of drying out the room. We've exiled the smaller unit to the unfinished basement where I can drain it using a regular hose to a drain as it has no pump.

If I run into issues I will update this review. I have had a number of bad experiences with all the China manufactured dehumidifiers but this one does seem to have a better overall build quality. We shall see.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Jason,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2023","I have an old small house in Florida that I've lived in for about 30 years. It gets humid inside the ~1400 sf of air conditioned space.

I decided to ""upgrade"" to a whole house dehumidifier that is connected to my A/C system so I got rid of the old portable dehumidifier. The whole house system cost me about $5000 by the time it was installed and it sucks!

I ended up getting one of these newer portable dehumidifiers and it works just as well as my old one but has the exact same problems that one did. Things I don't like about it: 1. It is loud. Louder than a refrigerator. Put it at least two rooms away from where you plan to sleep. 2. It takes up space (not tucked in a closet or attic like a dedicated unit would be). 3. It is messy to empty. I don't know why they don't make a better pouring spout for these things. Just dump it out quickly in a bathtub or outside to avoid a mess.",3.0 out of 5 stars
S. Colley,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2023","I LOVE this dehumidifier. Everything about it exudes good design and quality.

It has straight forward, easy to use and understand controls. It has a convenient, hide-away handle for moving it up/down stairs. The front even has a nice red line that moves up and down with the level of the water in the reservoir, which also has a convenient carrying handle. And best of all - for me - is that it has a pump that can push the water through a small hose (which is supplied) to a higher draining location. I use mine in a cellar, and the drain is much higher than the floor, so and drain water has to go ""up hill"", as it were, and this unit does it easily. From the manual it's clear that one use case the maker envisioned was using the unit in a cellar or basement, and pumping water up to and out a ground level window.

While I can't provide an objective measure of such, it appears to rip humidity out of the air very quickly. If there is any downside at all, is that it is not silent. It's not loud per se, but it is audible. From five feet away, with the fan at the highest speed, it's just below 58 decibels, or a bit more quiet than a normal conversation. With the fan on the lowest speed that drops down to 52 decibels, or the level of a quiet refrigerator. And it's heavy, but I assume that's and outcome of being solidly built.

This new product worked for 4.5 months and it was put away for the winter in my basement (no possibility of freeze). When I tried to use it in May 2024, it would not reduce the humidity. The fan ran but nothing else was working. I contacted Electrolux (the Frigidaire parent company) and was sent an electronic form which I filled out. On May 24, 2024, I received an email from Electrolux informing me I was eligible for a free replacement, and it further advised that if I hadn’t received a confirmation within 5 working days of the email, I should again call customer service.

The representative then put me on hold for about 10 minutes and came back and said that the shipping was pending but the replacement for my unit had been approved and that I should hear something when it was scheduled to ship.

25 Jun 2024 – Call #3 - After another 21 days had passed and I still had not been contacted I called again.

The ""setup"" if you can call it that was incredibly easy. I took it out of the box and plugged it in. That was it. I ran a hose from the back of the unit to my sump and I was done. With that said, i read the instructions thoroughly to ensure I was doing as i should.

I will say this is pretty loud. We cannot hear it in the basement but you do hear it when you are down there. It doesn't drown out conversation but it is noticeable. The functions at the top are a breeze. You will need to ""reset"" it once in a while so that it can cycle through a clean out but really thats it.

In the beginning of April 2024, my dehumidifier started to develop frost on the coils, and then it started to produce an error code ""EC."" The manual instructed me that this error code meant my dehumidifier needed to be repaired. I called customer service and they also told me that it needed to be repaired, and helped me schedule a repair appointment. The repair appointment cost me $100 since my dehumidifier was a few weeks outside of its covered warranty. When the repairman came, he said that he could not repair the device and then left within 5 minutes. I called Frigidaire customer service twice to get a refund for my appointment and they said they could not issue it since the repairman came already.

WK,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2023","I previously bought another dehumidifier because I didn't want to spend the money for a Frigidaire even though we had two Frigidaire dehumidifiers and they lasted 20 years (one recently stopped working). I made a huge mistake! The other model took a day and a half to fill the tank. I ended up returning the other one and broke down and spent the money for the Frigidaire. It's just as amazing as our 20-year-old dehumidifier with keeping our basement dry only better. Now they come with a pump option to have it drain into your wash basin (the hose is super long!) or wherever you what it to or you can use the garden hose option or empty the tank manually (for an average basement you would need to empty it twice). I have been using the pump option and it is unbelievable! You get what you pay for! In this case, it is well worth spending the money for peace of mind!!
The only con I have is that it doesn't have the added handle in the front of the tank to lift the bucket if you go with manually emptying it. Our old one has that. Not that we use it now, but it would be good for people who need to empty it manually. Makes it easier to pull out the bucket. The other issue some might find troublesome, it is not quiet.

Dave Shepherd,"Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2022","I play the double bass. I keep my two basses in a basement-level bedroom with the door closed. It's important to me that the temperature and humidity stay pretty steady. I aim for around 50% relative humidity.

This dehumidifier does an excellent job of controlling the relative humidity level in my bass room right around 50%. No matter what the humidity is in the rest of the house, with the door closed, my bass room stays between about 49% and 54% all the time.

The unit is quiet on the lowest setting. However, I do turn it off when I am actually practicing the bass. (The white noise level is just loud enough that I have a bit of trouble hearing fine details of the sound when it's running.)

One thing to be aware of is this: the unit does produce some heat. I have had to get used to practicing with the room temperature between about 79 and 81 degrees Fahrenheit (26-27 Celsius). It's not a problem for my basses, since the temperature is very steady. I hope that during the winter months that room temperature settles in closer to about 21-23 Celsius. It's not a problem as long as the temperature does not shift suddenly; and it doesn't with this unit.

[EDIT, October 14, 2022: Now that the outdoor temperatures are generally below 70F / 21C, I do not notice the unit heating up the room at all. It is still pulling moisture out of the air; I have to empty the bucket every couple of days or so.]

William H.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2023","So far I've experimented between running it on the ""continuous"" setting & running it to maintain a 50% RH level using all 3 fan settings. In all cases it uses approx. 280W. The power consumption is so close with every trial I'm probably just going to set it to 50% & leave it (even changing the fan speed has almost no effect on power consumption). At 50%, it hasn't shut down yet but I'm hoping as the seasons change the outdoor humidity will decrease & it will not need to run full time. It will reach 50% or about (the display increments in 5% intervals), just not low enough to quit running.

I live in the southeast where its very humid much of the year & should have gotten this long ago. It seems well built & isn't so noisy that it bothers me. The ""full tank"" alarm isn't overly loud & if you don't hear it go off it doesn't sound again but you can tell since the unit stops running so there's no fan noise. The tank is very easy to remove, empty & reinstall.

I'm getting to be quite the Frigidaire ""fan-boy"" as I've purchased a cooktop & refrigerator of theirs within the past year & each have proven to be good purchases.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Sidney L. Johnson,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2023","I bought this product from the Figidaire store on Amazon but upon requesting a replacement, Frigidaire would not consider Woot (an Amazon subsidiary) as an ""authorized reseller"" and refused to offer me a replacement when my Frigidaire FGAC5044W1 Dehumidifier, High Humidity 50 Pint Capacity with Wi-Fi Connected reported an ""EC"" error and no longer was operational after just one ""wet"" season. When I called Frigidaire, they said they had processed the replacement request and I would receive another unit in 10 business days and to call them if I didn't hear from them. I called and the rep said that he knew the issue was the fact that Frigidaire doesn't honor ""Woot"" as an authorized reseller and he would fix the problem and call me back after it was sent out but never did. When I spoke with multiple reps afterword including a supervisor they all refused to acknowledge that Woot is Amazon (they bought it in 2010) and refused to complete the replacement that they had processed earlier. One rep even pasted a script that I hadn't waited the 7-10 business days after I had already waited 18 business days since the initial ""processing"". Customer Service was among the worst I have ever experienced. Don't be fooled by this ""Frigidaire Store"". If Amazon decided to assign this product to their wholly owned subsidiary and you have a problem with your Frigidaire product you are toast in your invoice. You are toast. Its game over. Might as well just throw your Frigidaire product in the trash and save yourself six weeks of pure hell trying to get support. They will tease you with positive responses no doubt to ensure that they won't be dinged on a survey but at the end of the day you are left with an expensive paperweight. Last Frigidaire product (or any other Electrolux subsidiary) I will ever buy. The only way I would advise buying the product is if you add the maximum warranty choice to it. Given my experience in Frigidaire rejecting support from an unauthorized reseller, this warranty needs to be able to cover you no matter what Frigidaire does/says. I have no idea how these work so Caveat Emptor but it seems likely that your 3rd party warranty would likely work out despite Frigidaire giving you the cold shoulder if your invoice says ""Woot"". Considering how many EC error reports are out there within a relatively short period of time, the extra warranty would seem more worth it. Not that I would suggest throwing good money after bad but the 4+ year warranty offerings could solve a few problems (at least for the duration of your extended warranty). When it was working, I thought it was really nice so buy yourself a way to paint yourself out of the corner with a warranty if you really want this unit for a few years...",1.0 out of 5 stars
Steven,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2021","I'm surprised how well this unit removes humidity from the air. Happy with the dehumidification performance. The unit is OK loud, it's about 47db on low but it's just fan noise mostly. The compressor is not overly loud. I wouldn't want to sleep next to it, but it does well in a large basement or room.

Some of the setting can only be access via the app, so make sure you setup the Wi-Fi and use the app. You can't control the ionizer, the blue indicator light, and the child lock without the app. That's dumb and I wish they put buttons on the unit for all the functions. The app works well once you get it setup, it can even turn on and off the dehumidifier besides changing all settings.

One issue I did have was being able to connect to my Wi-Fi. I'm not sure why but the unit did not like my Wi-Fi router, it took so many tries to connect. I had to try over 20 times before it finally worked. For some reason this only happens with some Wi-Fi Routers, it would hang up with the error message no IP assigned. When I tried a different router it worked so I just keep trying over and over again with my original router till it worked.

Also the handle to move the unit around is nice, this thing is heavy at 50lbs, you don't want a crappy handle with a 50lb dehumidifier.

Also don't forget to check for Energy Efficiency Credits or Rebates from your state or power company or etc. I was able to get a rebate on this unit.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I have a floor drain (my washing machine drain already had another hose from my furnace so this hose wouldn't fit, huh, now as I'm writing this I could move the dehumidifier back to the floor!) I used a gutter leaf guard to hold the hose in place. The dehumidifier is on auto some 3 weeks now. It's doing a great job, not only the humidity but also somewhat as an air purifier. The wheels did work well on my cement floor. It's a little noisy, being in the basement I do hear it upstairs, now, the sump pump, it's really noisy! Not a deal breaker.

Meghan McD,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2022","Updated Review (August 2022): The dehumidifier has not leaked since that first day and works well. This newer Frigidaire is not as effective and not as hardy as my old Frigidaire... but it's more quiet. I live in a one bedroom apartment, so not having to listen to how loud my old one was is making it ok that this fills up twice as slow, despite it being same cost and same size as my old one. So, I'm happy with it and am keeping it. :) I ended up giving it 3 stars but it really deserves almost 4... it's honestly probably still be4tter than a lot of dehumidifiers out there, just the decline in quality, how the bucket swings to and fro and feels like I would smash it if I accidentally tripped, compared to my hardy old Frigidare one, but it still costing over $200 is why I'm just giving it the 3.

Original Review (July 2022): I had my last Frigidaire dehumidifier for 4 years before giving it to my parents and buying myself a new one. I’ve had it plugged in about 8 hours and it’s left just as much water on the floor as it has collected in the bucket. The bucket doesn’t seem to be leaking, and neither is the drain outlet.

I would give this company 0 stars if I could. Doesn't deserve 1 star.
My dehumidifier broke after less than 3 months.
I have spent hours on hold waiting for support. Last April 26th I finally received an email stating that they will replace it.

Lilithe,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2022","My husband and I recently bought a new house that happened to be built in the 1940's. Lots of things were done differently back then and some things were not invented or commonly used yet, such as a vapor barrier for the foundation. As a result the partially finished basement felt gross. Despite being the coldest place in the house, the way your skin would almost feel wet just walking down there made it uninhabitable. I had never had a dehumidifier, but I thought this must be what they are for and did a ton of research to land on this model. The rooms in nearly the whole basement felt completely different after even a day and after a few days it was completely comfortable to hang out in. I was planning on using the basement for my office and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to use it, but this Dehumidifier not only fixed the office itself but even the larger den area outside the room.

Pros:
- Pulls an unimaginable amount of moisture out of the air, it honestly astonishes me how much water ends up in the bucket.
- Works for a surprisingly large amount of space (Nearly the entire basement for me)
- Design looks pleasing to the eye
- Easy UI and setup

Cons:
- Relatively loud
- Creates a lot of heat, my basement is no longer the coolest part of the house(worth it to me)
- While being able to hook up a hose is convenient, it will not drain into a utility sink. I am fairly sure it just isn't able to force it up the hose and just uses gravity. If you have a floor drain for it to go into this would not be a problem though.

All in all, I am very happy with my purchase and glad it solved my problem so quickly!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Abraxas,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2023","Ordered about 5 months ago and so far everything is going well, granted over winter it's not been running too often. When I first got it set up there was a *huge* improvement in the humidity level vs the old, cheap dehumidifier. It's run in a basement that now has a lot of aqauriums in it, so especially in the summer there's a lot of humidity to deal with.

It would be nice if the noise level was a bit lower, but it's not terrible and more often runs at a quieter volume. Only had a minor issue with rattling/excessive noise compared to it's normal max volume, but just repositioning it a tiny bit fixed the issue.

Only major disappointment is the wifi app, it's really not worth the extra money compared to the equivalent of this brand without. So if that's something you're debating like I initially had, just go eith the other one.
Would appreciate it far more if it clearly said what the *current* humidity level is at, not just the goal humidity. As well, I would really appreciate a history chart logging the actual humidity.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Muttley,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2021","I bought this unit for my basement which gets over 65% humid in summers. I first started using it with its bucket but soon enough I realized it is impossible to keep up with emptying it. So I bought a hose. Here is my first suggestion: do not buy frigidaire hose. It is horrible and leaks l. Buy a heavy duty garden hose 3/4 inch size. Then you won't have leak issues. After attaching hose you need some elevation. If you do not have any then, hose efficiency may drop. So bucket starts filling at a slower rate. Some water goes to bucket and some to hose. After a week you may get an alert that bucket is full. A small elevation prevents this issue.

It is not quiet. Especially in the hi fan setting. So put it in somewhere it would not matter much. At low and medium settings it is better.

If your aim is to dehumidify a multistorey house it will disappoint you. I think it is mostly for large but closed spaces. It can decrease my basement humidity from 67% to 52% but the effect is much less pronounced on upper floors. However when I put this unit to my really humid garage (pretty large) then it has no issues getting it down to 45% even at low setting.

What I like most about it is the app and wifi connection. It has not let me down. I could even adjust settings and turn it on/off from out of state locations which is handy. I wish it was Alexa compatible ( I guess it is not) but otherwise it is pretty reliable.

One last minor thing is that you may get false alerts about filter. Often time filter is fine so don't even bother taking it out and checking it. Just press reset button and see if it will fix the issue. If the alarm comes back, then take a look.
In summary, I am happy with the purchase. It has limitations but if you set expectations rights, you will like it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I'm Just a Dude who Buys,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2023","This dehumidifier does one thing really well, and that’s dehumidify. It has no bells and whistles to bloat the cost and complicate the interface. Just some simple controls for auto-on/off and fan speed.

I haven’t tried the built-in pump, but when I do I will update this review.

It’s smart home compatible! What does that mean? Does it have a wifi chip and a built in computer? No, it’s simpler than that, when it loses power at the cord and the power comes back, the unit turns on to its last state. I plugged it into an Eve Smart Plug (but this will work with any smart plug) so when the humidity gets high (via my sensors around the house) the unit gets power, and when the humidity gets low, the smart plug cuts power.

One Realizer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2023","This was a replacement for an older model of pretty much the same unit. The new one has 3 fan settings, two of which are quieter than the old one, which had only one speed. We love that! The new control panel is an improvement as well. The only drawback is that the water reservoir has lower sides, which makes it more difficult to empty without splashing water on the floor. If carried by the handle alone, it is manageable, if not a little heavy.

Olde Fogey,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2024","I've previously purchased Frigidaire, 90 pint, dehumidifiers for over 30 years. On average, they lasted about 5 years which I felt was a fair trade off. In 2020 the DOE changed the rules about capacity. Google it. Now, the 90 pint equivalent is 50 pints, which is the largest you can buy.

I moved in 2020, and have a 1900sf very humid basement. I had to buy 2 of these dehumidifiers from an appliance store, which were then, the top rated model for portable de-humidification. Both failed after one season and beyond the warranty period. I bought 2 more from a BB store the following year. They both failed.

In 2023 I ordered two from Amazon. One failed within the Amazon return period and Amazon sent a new one. The other failed beyond the return period and, after supplying documentation, Frigidaire sent me a new one. I used them for one summer season.

This summer, when I started them up, they both failed. Both were still within the Frigidaire 1 year warranty period. I contacted Frigidaire, supplied the required information and received an e-mail saying that my replacements had been approved. That was in May. I never received them despite repeated calls.

They work great if, and when, they work. But they don't last. You'll be lucky to get a full season of use from these.

When reviewers rate dehumidifiers they test them in the same environment. They don't test how long they last. Since 2020, I've gone through 8 of these dehumidifiers having spent well in excess of $1500.

I'm having an Aprilaire E080, whole house dehumidifer professionally installed. These are sold here on Amazon but Aprilaire will only honor the 5 year warranty if it's professionally installed.

Leslie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2023","To be completely transparent I was hesitant to spend this much on a dehumidifier but I am so glad I did!

Our house is two stories with very high ceilings, and approximately 3000 square feet. It works for our entire house! I purchased humidity gauges for our downstairs master bath, kitchen, powder room, and for various rooms upstairs such as bedrooms, office, bathrooms, and our son's playroom. All the the gauges are within 1% of each other. We have the dehumidifier upstairs. Our master bathroom, which is located downstairs, the furthest away from the dehumidifier, is exactly what it says upstairs most of the time and the few times it is not, the humidity gauge is within .1-.9% range.

The dehumidifier has wheels on the bottom and is extremely easy to move to another room as we moved it several times when we first purchased to determine where we wanted to keep it permanently.

When the dehumidifier turns on and off it is very quiet. It will alert you when the tank is full by beeping a couple times and the light indicator on the top will let you know as well after the beep notification. Also, it has a water level which can be viewed quickly as you walk by the dehumidifier.

They usually last two or three years in my walkout finished basement, even though I check and clean filters regularly. The environment is quite clean, but the humidity can reach 55% or more during certain times of the year. I usually like to set the dehumidifier to 45 or 50% and let it run, either pumping or draining the moisture to a floor drain. So far, this unit lives up to the good reviews. Even on high, the fan isn't too noisy for me. The compressor adds an almost unnoticeably low hum. I'll add that the open area I need it to cover is 800-1000 square feet and the unit is located where it wouldn't disturb anyone. If it were used in a bedroom, the medium or low fan would probably be appropriate, along with a smaller unit. I set it up on constant run for a day as directions suggested. I now have it set to 45% and am listening to it cycle on and off as it senses rises in humidity. It appears to be reasonably accurate according to the inexpensive hygrometer I have. I have a meter connected at present that indicates about 520 watts with the fan and compressor running. This is a pleasant surprise since I expected greater power consumption.

Coils would freeze up starting from the bottom and going upwards over a period of 30 minutes. Filter was clean as well as all the evaporation and radiator coils. The unit was not placed less than 12 inches from the wall. All indications point to a refrigerant leak. The blower fan is pumping cool moist air. Use to blow warm dry air that came from the radiator. Now the radiator is cool to the touch. The evaporator coils are cold at the bottom but at the top they feel like the ambient air. I had another unit bought in 2021. Can't recall the brand however it lasted exactly one year. It stopped cooling altogether even though the compressor was running. This current unit comes with a ONE year warranty. Shows how much confidence the manufacture has it their product. Not surprising if you examine the guts of the dehumidifier. I watched several YOUTUBE videos on ""HOW TO FIX YOUR HUMIDIFIER"". Different brands having same problem as my unit. Guess what? The inside look exactly the same as mine. Several manufactures use the same supplier for the inner workings.

It seemed like the perfect dehumidifer from what I thought was a good brand. I've had a full kitchen of appliances at 2 different locations from Frigidaire and so I thought what better company to purchase a dehumidifer from than them right? Wrong.
The stats were great. It looks better than most. It's energy efficient. It just all seemed so promising. I ordered it and when it was delivered I unpackaged it and in the basement it went. The basement never drops below 64F even in the winter.
It was quiet. It hummed along. It pushed a good amount of air even on low. The bucket had a window so you could easily see the level of water. The bucket was super easy to pull out and put back in, trust me on this. Becuase the replacement one I purchased from another brand works 100x better, but it doesn't look as good, doesn't feel as good, and the bucket is a bit more clumsy.
But then everything started to fail.
I noticed a stain in the bucket, but I didn't think much of it. I thought it was just something with the water. However, after doing some research it's the refrigerant leak that caused the stain...
After about 6-8 months of use set to 45% humidity and it was never running straight out, it would cycle on and off pretty healthily., it sprung a leak. The unit started icing up. I tried everything, but unfortunately they are not user servicable. It was still under the 1 year factory warranty so I called Frigidaire. And boy, this has been a horror show.
When I called them and explained to them the situation and gave them all of the information they needed, they deemed it needing a replacement and thank goodness I was still under warranty.
They email this site that isn't even related to them to to fill an online form to get a replacment. I did all that. Weeks pass by and I finally get an email that says my replacement has been approved I'll get another email in 3-5 business days when the warranty replacement ships.

When you receive a new unit it works exactly as expected. Hail the power of condensing water from air! Positive reviewers rejoice! It works its magic and all summer long you reap the rewards of a drier, less humid environment.

Then comes winter. The unit is stored, either powered on but sitting idle or fully powered off, eager for the next summer/fall blast of humidity and a call to action.

... except - next summer it no longer works. It's starting to get humid here in the Northeast and that is when I need this unit to work. It doesn't. It powers on. It runs the blower. You can even perhaps hear the compressor churn. Condensation. Nope. Pull the bucket. Bone dry. Eventually the unit cries foul and throws the F0 / EC code.

FAD704DWD (2014) - F0
FAD704DWD (2016) via RMA spring 2016 - F0 -- lasted that summer
FFAD7033R1 (2017) - EC
FFAD7033R1 (2019) via RMA summer 2019 (5 year sealed system warrant on 2017 purchase) - EC
FFAD5033W1 (2022) via RMA summer 2022 (a month short of 5 year sealed system warranty on 2017 purchase) - EC
FFAD5033W1 (2022) - separate purchase May 2022 - still running for now, now outside the 1 YR standard warranty

A part of me wonders if these units are simply designed with planned obsolescence in mind. Why build a unit that lasts one to two seasons? in the Northeast you generally would purchase one of these when humidity rises (late spring/summer) and you get a few months use then pack it up for winter with the expectation when you need it next it works.

So aside from the possibility of seeing if Frigidaire / Electrolux will replace the FFAD7033W1 (2022) that was newly manufactured December 2021 and only lasted the 2022 summer season... I do not believe my dollars are best spent on this brand any longer.

To Frigidaire's credit, the 5 year sealed system warranty is good and the RMA replacement process is usually painless. Fill a form. Get approved. Unit shows up at your doorstep. The problem is, the replacement process shouldn't be so painless in a way. It's like they've gotten really good at shipping replacements. REALLY good.

... I'd rather have the unit last 5 years and get a sense I got my money's worth than the hassle of a humid basement for a couple of weeks during the replacement process.

EDIT: So today I contacted Frigidaire by phone. It was not a good experience. I explained to them I had a FFAD5033W1 manufactured December 2021, bought May 2022 and put into service last summer for only a few months. It has been off all winter; no need. It of course is now June 2023. The first time I needed it was this month. It is returning EC code after repeated power cycles. Warranty Claim DENIED. They no longer have a 5 year sealed system warranty. The unit now has a single 1 year warranty from the date of purchase. I wonder why that is ... </sarcasm>

The unit is 18 months old from its date of manufacture... bought and ran for at most 3 months last year and is now dead.

EDIT: September 2023. The FFAD5033W1 purchased May 2022 is now returning EC code constantly. The unit is in pristine condition in a clean area and ran daily during the summer. In a room with ~60% RH and 70 degree room temperatures it has reached its end. This unit lasted essentially two summers and that's it.

I see Amazon touts ""sold 1K units last month"". I'm sure they did and Frigidaire loves you for it. While their reputation precedes here, folks are soon going to find out their money is well spent elsewhere.

NEVER will I buy anything Frigidaire again.",1.0 out of 5 stars
A Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2020","UPDATE: The cutoff switch failed so it spent several hours dumping water on the floor. As I pulled the overflowing bucket out (it normally shuts off with about 3/4 inch to spare) it started beeping to complain that there was no bucket. Thanks! Definitely a 0-star product. Original review below, which already wasn't great.

I've had 3 different dehumidifiers now. This one isn't great either, for a few reasons.

This is the kind with the optional hose output sticking out the back, and with a knob-style cap screwed onto it for normal bucket-collection use. I've seen a lot of reviews complaining about leaks from the cap, so I looked at it and oh boy is it not a quality device. Bear with me, it's hard to describe. First, the edge of the output tube the cap screws against is slightly rough, which is the wrong way to make something which has to fit against a watertight gasket (which is in the cap). Second, the gasket is a thick ring shape, with a hole in the middle. If it were a solid disc, just the contact between it and the thin edge of the output pipe would have to fit tight into the rubber to form a seal. But with the hole in the middle, it also has to be tight enough to seal the flat gasket against the inside of the cap. THIRD, the front side of the gasket isn't even flat! It has some kind of raised part number characters sticking out, so again you have to put it on extra tight to make sure the non-flat rubber seals against the pipe.

If you run it on ""continuous"" mode, the 2-digit number display turns into a ""CO"" and NO LONGER FUNCTIONS AS A HUMIDITY METER. The panel has no mode button and therefore no light to indicate the mode (continuous mode is accessed by clicking the auto level all the way down until it shows CO), so they hijack the humidity level display to show it. So if you want this thing to run continuously, you will have to buy a separate humidity meter in order to monitor the humidity level.

The fan is noisy, even on the lowest setting, in a slightly pulsing way, not just a loud woosh but an annoying up and down volume. I looked into the vent, and the fan cylinder (it's the type made up of dozens of long straight thin parallel blades arranged in a cylinder shape) wobbles as it spins. Junk. The compressor part itself doesn't seem much louder than a much weaker model I recently had, it's all the crummy fan. And in addition to being annoying, I have to wonder if this poor balance will shorten the life of the parts.

The collection bucket was poorly assembled from the factory. It consists mainly of 2 parts, the large white bucket and a clear lid which prevents re-evaporation. The lid is not supposed to be removable (the handle assembly makes this impossible), but it wasn't fully snapped in place. Easily fixed, but a sad statement.

There are so many of these things under different brand names. There are more brands of dehumidifiers here than there are flavors of ice cream or soda at a grocery store. It's ridiculous, and they are all junk for various reasons not directly related to the most expensive core technological component. There is no particular reason to get this one. I tried this one because it's a ""real"" brand, but it turns out it's just another piece of trash.",1.0 out of 5 stars
JKD,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","Purchased this 50pt dehumidifier June 2023 after our previous Frigidaire from 2017 stopped working. This unit worked fine through the summer through early December when it got cool and dry in the fall time and i turned it off for the season. I always assure that the unit is free from obstructions, the filter is cleaned routinely and when not in use, it is unplugged and covered (so no dust or bugs get into the vents. I recently turned it back on at the beginning of May 2024 and it will run for a bit then display an EC code. I've troubleshot what is indicated in the owners manual such as assuring the outlet voltage is proper and the basement temp is between 41 - 89F. When it does run it was pulling a little water from the air but now it does not seem to be at all. Thankfully there is just about a month left of the manufacturers warranty and hoping they send a new one. But ultimately if I'm spending $250 or more, i expect to get more than 5-6 months use out of a product. Frigidaire has provided us with many hard working appliances in the past, and many we still have in the house, but sadly this has really put a bad taste in my mouth about purchasing another Frigidaire dehumidifier in the future.

Edit: Now on a month of back and forth with them regarding my warranty replacement that was submitted May 22nd and approved May 29th. Told to watch for email stating that it was shipping and to contact them in 5 days if i saw nothing. Of course i got no contact from them in the week following. I've had to call and be on hold with them for hours on June 10th, June 17th and June 24th and its the same generic run around ""oh, yes, i see there isn't any updates on your account, let me put in a contact for you and get that going and yes, please give it another 7-10 days to receive an update on your account/replacement/shipping"". It is nonsense. Currently on hold with them for over an hour now. NEVER AGAIN will i buy another Frigidaire and I will make sure everyone i know hears of this as well. The breaking of the unit in less than a year is nonsense, but the unwillingness to actually follow through with their warranties is disgraceful. I will be putting in a complaint to the BBB or whoever else i can find to flag this companies practices.",1.0 out of 5 stars
UmpStu,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2024","I bought this Frigidaire product in May 2023 as I had purchased a larger one of the same brand several years ago. That one worked perfectly for 4 seasons (these are only used for 4-5 months during the summer), then it failed.

This new product worked for 4.5 months and it was put away for the winter in my basement (no possibility of freeze). When I tried to use it in May 2024, it would not reduce the humidity. The fan ran but nothing else was working. I contacted Electrolux (the Frigidaire parent company) and was sent an electronic form which I filled out. On May 24, 2024, I received an email from Electrolux informing me I was eligible for a free replacement, and it further advised that if I hadn’t received a confirmation within 5 working days of the email, I should again call customer service.

4 Jun 2024 – Call #2 - I waited 10 days and then called. I was informed that my request was pending. I asked how it could be pending when I got an email response telling me it had been approved. The representative then put me on hold for about 10 minutes and came back and said that the shipping was pending but the replacement for my unit had been approved and that I should hear something when it was scheduled to ship.

25 Jun 2024 – Call #3 - After another 21 days had passed and I still had not been contacted I called again. I spoke with a different agent (foreign), who advised me she couldn’t find anything in the records regarding my claim other than a note from the prior agent I spoke with advising that he was requesting a shipping date of 3 June 2024. Only the “back office” had the information and initiated contact with customers so this agent was not able to email me with what the response to her request would be.

Stay away from this company and do a little research before you buy one to ensure it's not from the Electrolux parent company. The front-line customer service folks are great, but all the decision making is done higher up, and those folks are not reachable.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Sidney L. Johnson,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2023","I bought this product from the Figidaire store on Amazon but upon requesting a replacement, Frigidaire would not consider Woot (an Amazon subsidiary) as an ""authorized reseller"" and refused to offer me a replacement when my Frigidaire FGAC5044W1 Dehumidifier, High Humidity 50 Pint Capacity with Wi-Fi Connected reported an ""EC"" error and no longer was operational after just one ""wet"" season. When I called Frigidaire, they said they had processed the replacement request and I would receive another unit in 10 business days and to call them if I didn't hear from them. I called and the rep said that he knew the issue was the fact that Frigidaire doesn't honor ""Woot"" as an authorized reseller and he would fix the problem and call me back after it was sent out but never did. When I spoke with multiple reps afterword including a supervisor they all refused to acknowledge that Woot is Amazon (they bought it in 2010) and refused to complete the replacement that they had processed earlier. One rep even pasted a script that I hadn't waited the 7-10 business days after I had already waited 18 business days since the initial ""processing"". Customer Service was among the worst I have ever experienced. Don't be fooled by this ""Frigidaire Store"". If Amazon decided to assign this product to their wholly owned subsidiary and you have a problem with your Frigidaire product you are toast in your invoice. You are toast. Its game over. Might as well just throw your Frigidaire product in the trash and save yourself six weeks of pure hell trying to get support. They will tease you with positive responses no doubt to ensure that they won't be dinged on a survey but at the end of the day you are left with an expensive paperweight. Last Frigidaire product (or any other Electrolux subsidiary) I will ever buy. The only way I would advise buying the product is if you add the maximum warranty choice to it. Given my experience in Frigidaire rejecting support from an unauthorized reseller, this warranty needs to be able to cover you no matter what Frigidaire does/says. I have no idea how these work so Caveat Emptor but it seems likely that your 3rd party warranty would likely work out despite Frigidaire giving you the cold shoulder if your invoice says ""Woot"". Considering how many EC error reports are out there within a relatively short period of time, the extra warranty would seem more worth it. Not that I would suggest throwing good money after bad but the 4+ year warranty offerings could solve a few problems (at least for the duration of your extended warranty). When it was working, I thought it was really nice so buy yourself a way to paint yourself out of the corner with a warranty if you really want this unit for a few years...",1.0 out of 5 stars
Olde Fogey,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2024","I've previously purchased Frigidaire, 90 pint, dehumidifiers for over 30 years. On average, they lasted about 5 years which I felt was a fair trade off. In 2020 the DOE changed the rules about capacity. Google it. Now, the 90 pint equivalent is 50 pints, which is the largest you can buy.

I moved in 2020, and have a 1900sf very humid basement. I had to buy 2 of these dehumidifiers from an appliance store, which were then, the top rated model for portable de-humidification. Both failed after one season and beyond the warranty period. I bought 2 more from a BB store the following year. They both failed.

In 2023 I ordered two from Amazon. One failed within the Amazon return period and Amazon sent a new one. The other failed beyond the return period and, after supplying documentation, Frigidaire sent me a new one. I used them for one summer season.

This summer, when I started them up, they both failed. Both were still within the Frigidaire 1 year warranty period. I contacted Frigidaire, supplied the required information and received an e-mail saying that my replacements had been approved. That was in May. I never received them despite repeated calls.

They work great if, and when, they work. But they don't last. You'll be lucky to get a full season of use from these.

When reviewers rate dehumidifiers they test them in the same environment. They don't test how long they last. Since 2020, I've gone through 8 of these dehumidifiers having spent well in excess of $1500.

I'm having an Aprilaire E080, whole house dehumidifer professionally installed. These are sold here on Amazon but Aprilaire will only honor the 5 year warranty if it's professionally installed.

DCDudlak,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2024","Same complaint as many of the other ONE STAR reviews. Bought this item on Amazon in June of 2022. It lasted exactly two years. It was used in my basement. Only ran between the months of June to mid September. It stopped working June of 2024. Coils would freeze up starting from the bottom and going upwards over a period of 30 minutes. Filter was clean as well as all the evaporation and radiator coils. The unit was not placed less than 12 inches from the wall. All indications point to a refrigerant leak. The blower fan is pumping cool moist air. Use to blow warm dry air that came from the radiator. Now the radiator is cool to the touch. The evaporator coils are cold at the bottom but at the top they feel like the ambient air. I had another unit bought in 2021. Can't recall the brand however it lasted exactly one year. It stopped cooling altogether even though the compressor was running. This current unit comes with a ONE year warranty. Shows how much confidence the manufacture has it their product. Not surprising if you examine the guts of the dehumidifier. I watched several YOUTUBE videos on ""HOW TO FIX YOUR HUMIDIFIER"". Different brands having same problem as my unit. Guess what? The inside look exactly the same as mine. Several manufactures use the same supplier for the inner workings. Only difference is the outer shell and the logo. Can you find a real QUALITY dehumidifier that doesn't crap out in two years? Maybe I should be grateful. Most of the other complaints had units lasting much shorter than mine.",1.0 out of 5 stars
wanda g,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2024","I purchased this unit June 2023. It replaced a FFAD7033R1 70 pint unit which was great & lasted over 5 years. I was planning on replacing it with another exact unit but the 70 pint unit had been discontinued. At first the 50 pint unit seemed to work well until about 9 months in then the amount of water collected dropped drastically. The unit still seemed to be running well so my thoughts were the moisture level had dropped in the unit area. Now July 2024 the unit started freezing up, making cracking & popping noises & now has quit working completely. I did some research to see if there was a solution to the problem but found out this is recurrent with this unit & one month past warranty expiring seems to be the life of the units. I've talked to customer service twice. The first rep said he would send me a form to fill out to see if the company would still honor the warranty since it really stared having problems well within my warranty period. Never received the e-mail/form. Today I called customer service again. Finally got a rep after a 35 min. wait. My choices were either buy another unit or have it checked out by a service tech at my expense. So I will be buying another unit but definitely not another Frigidare!

Katie J. Mehall,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2024","I purchased this dehumidifier in April 2023 and ran it in a finished (somewhat damp) basement. By August, the coils would freeze anytime it ran. I filed a warranty claim with Electrolux and they sent me a new (or perhaps refurbished) unit in 10-14 business days. The unit stayed plugged in during the winter months but never kicks on from December through April. The replacement unit has been running from April through present (July) and now is a solid block of ice on the coils. For $300, this unit should not be having this many issues. Reviewing other complaints on here, frozen coils is obviously a flaw with this unit. I have contacted Electrolux for an additional replacement but was told it was outside the 1 year warranty. Keep in mind, I didn't get the replacement unit until September of last year. They informed me the 1 year warranty began the purchase date of the first unit. I have submitted a warranty claim anyway, and their ""back office"" is reviewing it. Will update if they replace the unit again. AVOID this dehumidifier!

EDIT: After ignoring my emails for 6 weeks, they finally contacted me and informed me the request was being denied. Just to rub salt in the wound, they offered me 20% off of a new dehumidifier with them! No thanks, absolute garbage! If you own this unit, I would file a claim at 9-10 months (if you even get that long out of it) to make sure you get a replacement unit before the 1 year from purchase date. You will need the second unit, and likely still be buying a brand new dehumidifier within the next 6 months. This company is atrocious.",1.0 out of 5 stars
J. Hales,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2024","TLDR: I had two of these units fail after 11 months.

Full Story: I bought this dehumidifier in June 2022. That unit failed in less than 1 year. I contacted Frigidaire (Electrolux) and they replaced it under warranty. The warranty process was a little annoying, it involved taking a PDF file they sent, printing it, and attaching the back sticker from the unit. Then this modified document needs to be scanned and emailed back. After that you just have to wait to see if a unit is shipped out to determine if you did it right.

Anyway, the warranty was accepted and replacement unit was sent. It didn't arrive until June 2023, and was immediately put into service. Now, after another 11 months, I once again have a dehumidifier that has failed in less than 1 year.

The reliability of these units is AWFUL. During the summer, my basement tends to be quite humid (60-70% humidity). The unit was in my basement and running often. But it was not in continuous use mode and certainly is something I would expect this unit to handle without an issue. This unit is a 50 pt unit and rated for ""4,500 Square Foot Coverage"" (that's more square footage than the entire house, this was just dehumidying my basement).

I tried to get Electrolux to replace it under warranty, but they refused. The warranty is for 1 year from original date of purchase. So they will replace it once under warranty and then won't help you. So DO NOT BUY this unless you're content with getting total of 22 months of service from it and don't mind jumping through the hoops for the warranty process at least 1 time.",1.0 out of 5 stars
TR,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","Update: My update: is ""no update."" Frigidaire has done nothing over the last month and a half other than send meaningless messages that ultimately say nothing. My recommendation? Spend your $ elsewhere or go in understanding that if your product fails under warranty, you will almost certainly get no support or replacement. Read other reviews here and on their X page. Original: I have learned a lesson as the first two Frigidaire dehumidifiers that I have purchased in the past both failed in warranty and now my third has failed under an extended warranty. Each time getting Frigidaire to honor its warranty is an excruciating process and one time instead of shipping it to my home, they asked me to drive 50+ miles to pick it up at a dealer location where it had been shipped. My current extended warranty claim has gone into the abyss and I am long past the 10 business days to get a replacement after submitting the appropriate paperwork, which I did get an email confirmation that it was received and that I should get replacement withing 10 business days. Each time I call, the care agent can provide no information as to status, only that they will open a ticket with the mysterious ""back office"" team, but they have no way to talk live with the ""back office."" I believe Frigidaire's process is to drag it out long enough that the customer gives up, especially since they already have my money for the original purchase and payment for an extended warranty. The only positive thing I can think of is that Frigidaire's dehumidifiers tend to be quieter than most and work well (when they actually work).",1.0 out of 5 stars
ShadowRavenAMP,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2022","Imagine, you're in a rental home and your landlord says that Florida is always humid so you'll just gotta deal with it. NOT ANYMORE! I got this dehumidifier and it feels wonderful in my home everyday! No more moist musty smell either. A feature that I like the most is the spill free bucket, with handle, because water can be heavy! I only change it once a day; I like it kept at 35%. It is mildly loud, at least to me, but it's more like a white noise so it's perfect for sleeping. I think the only con I'd noticed is that the air it blows out, while dry, is warm after a few seconds of running. This may be normal though and just nit-picking. I noticed it even takes the humidity from upstairs some how. I appreciate the design that goes into making a thoughtful and quality system as this one!

Update: April 8 2023/removed one star, but it's still a solid purchase in my book.

The dehumidifier is leaking on the floor from where the built in bin is. I'm pretty handy given I'm a lady specialist who works on aircraft so I researched and looked for solutions on YouTube and it seems that maybe a drain hole is plugged. I opened the case (though broke a few retaining clips as it wasn't clear which way to pull) and noted only one tube to one drain and in the middle is a electromagnetic pump. This being the case and fittings being tight, I believe it's leaking bc the drain pump that pumps it into the bin isn't working and so the water isn't draining fast enough and dribbling both into the bin and floor. The part number is 11001010001698 but I can't find a replacement anywhere. I plan to see if fridgidair might help or if they'll tell me no since I opened the unit case. If anyone has this issue and finds the pump, please note you'll need to know basic crimping and wire repair skills for the terminals. I just really didn't wanna buy an entire new expensive unit for a little issue.

Update jun 26 2023
Repair people let me know that this part is on an automatic replacement list and he can't order parts for it. I'm very disappointed to throw away a whole unit over a little leaking that could easily be fixed if the parts were replaceable.

Long story short, Do not buy from Frigidaire until they fix thier non replaceable parts issue if you want to invest in a good purchase. You will eat the price in the end as they will not help you after the warranty nor will they fix the product to not be wasteful. The least they could do is offer a recycling for it, but that doesn't exist either.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Chyanba,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2022","I had high hopes for this dehumidifier for my basement which generally hovers around 50 - 60 RH. It looked very promising on paper for its range, features like WiFi (mobile app) and drainage... I was sold! Although they are slightly pricier $354+ taxes, I decided to buy one.

Item was shipped half way across the country and perhaps that played a role as to why it didn't function as expected. I unboxed and proceeded setup the mobile app. I was able to get it setup and was pretty excited about being able to control humidity for my basement remotely. App looked slick enough with basic functionality. The annoying part is they would like you register the product first before you can use the app. The unit also looked slick. I liked the design and the overall look and feel. So that's why I gave it a one star.

All the good stuff ends there. I turned on the unit after letting it sit on my basement for a day. I started with a low mode, Noise level was pretty tolerable so I proceeded to change setting to dry mode and set RH to 40 while my basement RH was 55. I turned off the unit to check the bucket.... not a single drip. Humidity level in my separate hygrometer still the same.

I set it to a max mode with high fan what came next is a screeching sound which I've never heard from a dehumidifier ever. After 20 minutes I've had enough. I checked the bucket again and no water. I checked the rear water drain plug on the unit when I undid the cap what came out was a gel or think watery substance with a bad smell (chemical?)

I inspected the top part of the unit and it felt like this was a refurbished unit as saw black stuff (mold?) on the fan vent.

I'm pretty disappointed with Frigidaire. I was looking at this and comparable Honeywell unit and regret going with this one. Thought I was buying a premium unit that would last me at least few years but oh well.

I also got another basic Hisense 50-Pint Dehumidifier from Costco for $129 for upstairs which isn't all that smart/fancy but it's actually does what it's supposed to do which is suck the excess moisture out of the air and it's auto feature keeps it at the level I want and turns on/off automatically.

The filter and coils are clean, no blockage. I called Frigidaire knowing that it was already past its one year warranty. They advised I shut down the unit, let the ice melt and then start at a high level and step the setting down. If that didn't resolve it then call in a technician to look at it. That didn't work, as you can see from the attached picture. It's not worth repairing so I ordered another brand unit.

Then I called Frigidaire using the phone number provided by Amazon on the same day.

The compressor rattled on for about 45 seconds and then quit. I have it emptying into a sink. When I checked earlier, the sink was bone dry even though the humidity level is high. I plugged the sink to capture any water being emitted by the machine. Four hours later, not a drop..

This machine replaced a Whirlpool unit that lasted me through seven summers or more before giving up the ghost. This one couldn't even last five weeks. More than disappointing!

EDIT: I applied online for warranty service on the non-working unit. Earlier this month I received an email notice indicating that replacement has been approved. I was told I'd receive an email confirming shipment along with a tracking number ""within five business days."" If I don't receive it by then, call them. Nine ""business days"" later, no message. I call back. Customer service says my claim has been given priority status. If I don't received a confirmation email within 48 hours, call back. I wait 96 hours. No message. I call back (fortunately only having to wait 3 minutes vs. the usual 60). The mysterious ""back office"" staff informs the agent the replacement unit was shipped but ""must have gotten lost."" She mentions their tracking info, but doesn't have an answer why I didn't receive said info, etc. She's nice as can be but it sounds like they are victims of the process as am I. You guessed: call back in ""48 business hours,"" now meaning five days due to the weekend and Memorial Day holiday. After the call, I filed a complaint with my county consumer affairs office, which has a great reputation for getting things done...",1.0 out of 5 stars
T. R.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2022","I opted to purchase this dehumidifier because it is Wi-Fi capable and has excellent reviews. I believe it’s also one of the machines recommended by Wirecutter, and I ordinarily trust their recommendations.

The dehumidifier was delivered on May 20, 2022 and I set it up in the basement within a day or two. I typically run it on the “dry” setting with the fan set to either medium or high. I set the humidity to 35.

At first, everything seemed fine. The dehumidifier was removing quite a bit of moisture from the air and I was emptying the bucket twice a day. To be fair, that part has not changed. If I keep the settings I described above the machine continues to remove the same amount of water. However, by the time mid-July 2022 rolled around the machine started to sound like it was struggling. Specifically, the noise it emitted became louder and it began to make a grinding sound of sorts.

I tried to troubleshoot by changing the settings, and I switched from “dry” mode to “auto” mode. That seemingly fixed the sound issue but it killed the dehumidifier’s efficacy in the sense that it no longer removed anywhere near the amount of water it removed in “dry” mode. To be clear, in “auto” mode the machine barely removed any moisture at all. Instead of going downstairs to find a full bucket of water every 12 hours I discovered a bucket that contained not even a half inch worth of water at the bottom.

Please see the attached video which was recorded on July 20th. That video demonstrates the loud noise emitted by the machine. Please note that the noise doesn’t start immediately when I turn on the machine. Instead, the grinding noise kicks in after a few minutes.

I’ve attempted to upload a video demonstrating how it normally sounds when first turned on, however, Amazon will not allow me to attach more than one video. I would recommend searching the internet (maybe YouTube) for a video that demonstrates how it’s supposed to sound.

The bottom line: BUYER BEWARE. This $300+ machine started malfunctioning within TWO months of purchase. I haven’t yet reached out to Frigidaire as I’m all too familiar with how terrible their customer service is (my mother previously bought a Frigidaire washing machine that failed miserably and the company did not honor the extended warranty she purchased), and I simply haven’t been up to the task of fighting with them; but I intend do so soon. That said, do yourself a favor and find another manufacturer.",1.0 out of 5 stars
T. Carr,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2024","This was my third Frigidaire. The last one lasted about 7 years. This one, while a nice machine that was relatively quiet and had good features, lasted less than 2 years. Bought in May 2022, my basement hangs around 67 degrees. The unit kept the humidity very comfortable. I liked the machine but for the $289 I paid then (currently at $340, sheesh) it should last more than 2 years.

I noticed it started freezing up. The bottom half of the coils had ice building up through the filter and filter cover. I let it melt, cleaned the filter (wasn't dirty at all) cleaned the fins and coils with a vacuum and compressed air, turned it on, ice within a half hour. Searching online indicates some kind of ""sealed system issues."" Whatever. I shouldn't have to deal with that on a machine this new and that still looks brand new. Luckily I bought the Asurion warranty (because I started to become distrustful of the longevity of these machines) and they gave me a gift card for my original purchase price.

I just ordered a different brand (with the Asurion warranty too) for less than the amount of the gift card and way less than the current price of the Frigidaire. We'll see if that one lasts longer.

When I was younger, my parents had an old beast of a dehumidifier. It was old when I was little and they had it until I was about 16. I'd guess that thing was at least 20-25 years old or more, ugly and loud but it just ran with no problems. Our house flooded from a storm and that's what didn't in. Otherwise I'd imagine it would still be running. Why could something like that last for 20+ years but now you're lucky if you get a few out of them. I need a dehumidifier but they seem like the biggest racket going.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Louie,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2023","I bought this recently for my home because the humidity this summer has been crazy and I wanted to make sure my basement didn’t stay too humid to prevent mold and other issues. I’ve had a smaller dehumidifier in the past that didn’t bring down the humidity enough for a large space, so this time around I decided to splurge on a larger model from a brand I know is reputable. Plus this product has a bunch of rave reviews about how this dehumidifier does an amazing job at sucking moisture out of the air - people saying they had to empty it multiple times DAILY.

I got the dehumidifier and I’m left wondering: are we all talking about the same product?

I’ve had this dehumidifier running for three-ish days now on high (the manual says to run it on continuous mode for about 4 days) but the machine keeps giving me an error code and shutting off. I thought it was an outlet issue, but it’s done this at three different locations in my home and barely runs for a full 24 hours without issue. When I do get it to run for a good several hours, there’s not even a DROP of water in the bucket, which makes me question its efficacy. In fact, the humidity meter will barely show a difference than when I started the machine hours later. The smaller and cheaper dehumidifier I had before at least used to fill up with water. I saw a few reviews mentioning that there is heat output as well, but I just get cold air. This thing is somehow effectively a better fan than it is a dehumidifier. I’m not sure if I somehow got a dud (it didn’t even come with a manual I had to look it up online - and I bought this new, not used) but I’m returning the product and would suggest you pass on it and save yourself $200+ dollars on a faulty piece of junk. It’s a glorified giant and loud fan at best.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Chrisitan Newhan,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2024","I purchased the Frigidaire FFAD3533W1 dehumidifier expecting reliable performance from a reputable brand. Unfortunately, the unit developed an EC error code and a refrigerant leak just 18 months after purchase, rendering it unusable and posing potential health risks due to the release of refrigerant into my home.

Attempts to resolve the issue with Frigidaire customer service have been frustrating. I was disconnected from their chat five times and received minimal support, as the unit was slightly outside the warranty period. Despite numerous reports of similar issues from other customers, Frigidaire offered only a small discount on a new unit, which I found inadequate given the circumstances.

The lack of accountability and support from Frigidaire has been disappointing. I expected better product quality and customer service, especially for a product that failed so soon after purchase. I plan to report this issue to consumer protection agencies and hope that Frigidaire will address these common defects to prevent further inconvenience to their customers.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Cool Steve,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024","I have purchased four of these 50 pint dehumidifiers. Two with pumps and two without. Three of them failed with the EC error code right after the ""1 year warranty"" was over. One of them failed a week before the warranty was up and Frigidaire would do absolutely nothing about it. Had to waste several hours of my day just for them to jerk me around and do nothing. These units were only used for the summer months in extremely clean houses. Filters were always clean and the units were never moved around. Just unplugged at the end of the season. They worked well while using them, but when we plugged them in 8 months later, all of them had the EC error code. Tons of other people have had the same experience with these as I did. Take a look at the reviews on here and on Frigidaire's website as well. There is no way that these aren't designed to fail immediately after the warranty expires. I am so disgusted with paying lots of money for absolute garbage appliances. It is very telling that an appliance that costs this much only has a 1 year warranty. My guess is that one year of use is all that most people will get with this junk. The dehumidifiers that I had previous to these lasted 6-8 years. I guess the technology of making these last more than a year is too difficult now. (not as profitable)",1.0 out of 5 stars
DENISE BARREIRA,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","This is the second (exact same) Frigidaire Dehumidifer I have purchased in 2.5 years. The first one worked well for 1.5 years but then my unit stopped working/i got the dreaded ""EC"" code...which required reseting/restarting the dehumidifier. (this had to be done every few hours when the dehumidifier would stop working/the EC code would re-appear). That is obviously untenable, so, given that the 1st dehumidifier did do a good job removing the moisture from my basement, i took a chance and purchased another one. Well, 1 year and two weeks after that purchase (yes, two weeks out of warranty, you can't make this stuff up), my 2nd Frigidaire Dehumidifier stopped working and i got the same ""EC"" code. I tried several times to reach out to Frigidaire regarding my experiences and was told, ""the item is out of warranty, there is nothing we can do"". I asked to speak with a Supervisor with the hope that they would at least consider the situation since i had purchased two units in 2.5 years. The rep on the phone (Neal) refused to even connect me with a Supervisor to discuss the issue! (I also contacted Frigidaire via email explaining the situation and received no reply at all).

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2022","The unit does a satisfactory job dehumidifying but, as other reviews have noted, has a high probability of failure. I purchased the unit in June of 2021 and it failed with code ""EC"" in September of 2021. The replacement process was fairly straightforward but was not as easy as it should have been. A new unit was shipped directly to me in October of 2021. The unit ran fine throughout the winter (Michigan winter where humidity is relatively low already). In late spring and early summer of 2022, I began to notice that the replacement unit had some icing on the coils but it was still performing adequately.

In July of 2022, the replacement unit again had the ""EC"" error code. I have contacted customer support but the 1-year limited warranty applies to the purchased unit and does not reset for the replacement unit. At this time, I am waiting to see what, if anything, Frigidaire will do beyond offering an Extended Service Agreement (not that I would trust them to actually honor any such agreement).

I would NOT recommend this product to anyone at this time.

Update: Electrolux/Frigidaire declined to provide any further assistance since the warranty for the original unit had expired. The unit is faulty and will likely fail within 1-2 years. The quality of the product and their customer service is underwhelming considering the price of the dehumidifier. I would recommend nearly any other dehumidifier before this unit.

To summarize the timeline:

6/7/21 - Original unit was purchased from Amazon
10/5/21 - Original warranty claim was filed with Electrolux due to the failure of the unit with code ""EC""
10/16/21 - Replacement Dehumidifier arrived from Electrolux
Mid-July 2022 - Replacement unit begins having ""EC"" error codes
8/2/2022 - Contacted Electrolux support who indicated that I should submit a warranty claim again since the replacement unit was within its warranty range since it had been delivered in October of 2021. Submitted the warranty paperwork accordingly.
8/9/2022 - Electrolux indicated that the unit is out of warranty and thanked me with no further recommendation or explanation (See email below).

Jason Turgeon,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2024","This dehumidifier only made it about 9 months before it began throwing an ""EC"" code that indicates you need to call the support line. The warranty process was tedious but I got an approval for a replacement unit. After 2 weeks with no shipping notification I called back to find out where my replacement was and after almost an hour on the phone was told that I might be able to get one in 6 weeks. So now I am without a dehumidifier for an entire summer and my basement is getting stale and mildewed. I either have to buy another unit at my own expense to get me through the summer or deal with potential damage to the basement.

I bought the extended warranty on this unit, but they won't help because this falls under the original manufacturer's warranty.

Summary: don't waste your time or money with Frigidaire. Might as well go buy some cheap Chinese knockoff brand you've never heard of, you'll get the same quality and experience at 1/4 the price.

Despite reaching out to their team multiple times regarding my claims, I have received no updates or resolutions. I was assured on three separate occasions that I would receive updates, yet I have been met with silence and neglect. This level of unprofessionalism and unethical behavior is simply unacceptable. It reflects poorly on Frigidaire's commitment to customer satisfaction and speaks volumes about their lack of integrity. They make you run around without any resolution; basically, you come back to square one. Moreover, they blame Amazon Shipping issue even though it was the unit that was malfunctioning due to poor production from the manufacturing department: it was the water valve that was damaged. Water was spilling from the back of the unit where the small water tube releases the water. Due to the malfunction of the water tube, it damaged my wood floor without me knowing it was happening all along.

PCC,"Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2023","Three years ago I purchased two of these units to use in a new construction home; one for the basement and one for the second floor (recommended for the humidity inherent in new construction). I live in the New England where ambient humidity is only a problem for 4-5 months in the summer. Otherwise, the units do not run even with the extra humidity typically present in new construction. One of the units I owned quit working in just under 2 years & Frigidaire denied any warranty coverage as it was beyond the one-year warranty period. Thinking I might have just been unlucky with the one that died, I purchased another. Approximately a year later the replacement unit stopped working (yielding the same ""EC"" error code that the first unit had and which my research suggested was a malfunction that cannot be repaired). For a few weeks I tried re-booting the unit which worked for a short period of time but then the error code would return and the unit would stop working. Finally, I contacted Frigidaire again but got the same answer; no warranty coverage because I called a month after the warranty expiration, notwithstanding that the unit had actually died, either before or within days of the warranty expiration. My mistake for not checking the purchase date the minute the unit died but, surprising as it may be, my life doesn't revolve around warranty issues on appliances that should last a whole lot longer than one year. Functionally, the units worked well enough, typically keeping the rooms comfortable with the typical noise level of a dehumidifier (similar to a window air conditioner). However, these particular units simply do not last and Frigidaire's idea of ""customer service"" is to politely refuse any claim of product defect not communicated to them within the one-year warranty period.",1.0 out of 5 stars

J. Tamburello,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2023","So right out of the box this threw an error code ""EC"" within 30 minutes of first turning it on, which causes the unit to stop working. A quick search on the internet revealed that many of these units have that issue. What's REALLY annoying is that someone probably returned it for this exact issue, and all Amazon did was package it back up and resell it, which is HIGHLY unacceptable. Shame on you, Amazon.

BUT, there's sort of a silver lining — once the error code appears, I figured out that I just had to turn the power off and back on (there's an actual switch on the outlet it's plugged into), which forces the unit to resume normal operation without having to actually press any buttons. The unit actually works while it's running, but it just requires a witty hack to run continuously...*if* you have the right equipment.

I didn't feel like packaging this big thing back up and returning it, so I simply plugged it into one of my Wi-Fi outlets I had laying around the house and set a schedule to turn the power off then back on every hour (the Kasa Wi-Fi outlets have this feature). This is a hack of sorts which doesn't let the error code get in the way; thereby bypassing it by intermittently resetting the power which allows the unit to resume normal operation.

Even though the unit does work while it's actually running, it does require a hack for it to run continuously, so I still gave one star... but mainly due to Amazon's poor quality control. I'm more than sure if I would have packaged this back up and returned it they would have just sent it to be sold again to some other unwitting consumer. NOT cool! 👎🏻",1.0 out of 5 stars

After spending this much, it only lasted one season. It started displaying the EC code that everyone else has been mentioning when I plugged it in this season. This error indicates that the compressor or something in the device's ""sealed system"" has failed. The troubleshooting from the manual is literally unplug and re-plug after a bit... Well, that does nothing and while the fan continues to spin, the bucket remained bone dry until it eventually spat out the EC code again. I called support and, since the device was a couple weeks over the 1 year warranty, they wouldn't do anything and told me I should look into repairing it myself.

Think long and hard before you purchase this as you're potentially just throwing away your money. If you're like me and only need this during the summer months, the warranty is useless. It'll work fine when you first get it and then the warranty period will vanish while it sits in storage ready to fail when you need it again.

Our unit was working great using the bucket to empty, but we were tired of emptying the bucket 3 times a day. We purchased the Frigidaire Drain hose through Amazon. We had someone come and drill a hole in our basement cement wall. He screwed on the Frigidaire drain hose (part 18FFDHMH01) and it was draining outside downhill. The bucket, however, continued to fill and have to be emptied. I called THREE times to customer support. First time it went somewhere out of the country, where the loud talking in the background from other operators drowned out most of the information she was saying. Finally, I was told to unplug the unit for two hours and call back... after they closed. Then I could try calling the next day. I asked for a US number. Called that number, and once again was transferred to another country . Finally was given a third number, and that person told me that I needed to contact the person who connected it because they did it wrong. All he did was screw on the Frigidaire hose to the Frigidaire unit. I'm not sure how that could that be done wrong. We paid over $300 for this model so we could use continuous drain, and it didn't work, and all they told me is, call the guy who screwed the hose on the back. Unbelievable.

The instructions state to ""make sure there are no kinks or elevations"", but Muttley stated since there is no pump, the unit needs ""some elevation"" a few inches above hose.

Because they last about 1 year. I am grateful I purchases Asurion insurance which refunded me the entirety of my purchase (less tax) on the unit from 2023. Both units had the same error code: EC.
This error message indicates failure of the refrigerant, compressor or both.

I cannot state this firmly enough- do not waste your money on this product. The NYT Wirecutter review rated Frigidaire highly. They are either high on crack or used the product for a short duration (maybe both?).

Kathy and Tim,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2023","This unit froze up in 7 1/2 months. Unfortunately, it is necessary to go through the manufacturer as its still under warranty. I say unfortunately because it has been hell to accomplish and 1 month later there is still no replacement. We went thru the necessary process, providing model and serial number as well as photos and approval for warranty replacement was granted. Then everything stopped. Trying to contact fridgedaire is ridiculous, and its the same thing each time- after 15 minutes you finally speak to someone, they look up your information, verify the warranty replacement, and then put you on hold for about 5 minutes while they go to ask someone else where the replacement is, they return to tell you it should be coming soon but they cannot provide a tracking number. The supposed shipping company is Fareye, and if you go to their website its also impossible to input any information or call. I can go on Amazon right now and have this same crappy unit by tomorrow evening at 9pm, but if you need a warranty replacement, forget it. I would not recommend this unit to my enemy, and would have given it 0 stars if that was possible. I would also suggest getting the extended warranty through Asurion because you’ll be lucky if it makes it to the end of the manufacturer’s warranty period. Asurion will not cover if its still under manf warranty. I will be submitting a complaint with the BBB, but I don’t really expect anything to happen. I hope you read this thoroughly.

Purchased this brand as a recommendation from a friend who had an old frigidaire dehumidifier which has lasted him for more than 10 yrs as he bragged. He even let me borrow his when my basement flooded. So of course I am impressed and ordered the same brand. It worked fine for a year. Followed every recommendation and care on the machine. And guess what it broke passed the 1 yr warranty period this June. (Bought on May 2023) it threw in an EC code and the back of the machine is iced. Searched for solution but the fix is to replace the whole machine since the system is a sealed system. It would cost more the original price to repair the unit. I thought this would be a very good machine given it’s premium price. This is a $200+ peice of junk couldn’t last more than a yr.,1.0 out of 5 stars
Melsan in Ct.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2024","So here is a review of it less than eighteen months old. It is completely shot. Ices over almost ten minutes after turning it on. And no, it is not clogged up with dust/dirt. Air is flowing free, and temperature is above sixty five. Besides, this unit always functioned where it has been, even when it is fifty degrees and it did not ice up. Opening up unit shows coolant has leaked out of the condensing unit as it has everyone else's who bought these planned obsolescence units made in you know where. If you want something that will last, with at least a five year warranty, you need to look at commercial units. Yes, they do cost at least twice these. So if you are fine with throwing near two hundred or more at these units sold almost everywhere at your home improvement stores and such then do that. None of these units will go much more than a couple years and Fridgidaire has proven that once again. So haul it off to your local recycle/transfer station and add to the pile of these sitting there that look brand new just like mine. So there you have it. The U.S.A. way of manufacturing that really is not the way it used to be. But we are so, so, into recycling and doing good for our environment.... Yeah right!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Customer OSS,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2023","Short Story: Only got one season from dehumidifier in Summer 2022. Realized shortly after 1-year warranty expired that it was not working. Had evidence it wasn't working before warranty expired but Frigidaire would not honor warranty. If you buy this product, expect it to break at or shortly after the 1-year warranty expires.

Longer Story: Only got one functional season from dehumidifier in Summer 2022. The dehumidifier was setup on a wooden board over my basement slop sink with a hose connected to the back. It was set to continuous operation since I turned it on in late Spring 2023 and I did not touch it since then until shortly after the 1-year warranty expired. Thought it was working but realized it must have been making ice (machine broken) since before warranty expiration. I realized the dehumidifier air intake was iced up and the wooden pine board supporting it was wet in the back with a black water stain that must have begun before warranty expiration from continuously melting ice created by the continuously running but non-functional machine.

Adding insult to injury, Frigidaire kept me on a long chat with lots of questions (presumably for survey purposes) when the customer service rep. knew from my first contact disclosure/question that they would not do anything to help me out in honoring the product warranty.

Waste of my money, time, electricity and a waste of materials by Frigidaire in making an unsustainable product they must know will end up in the garbage in about one year. DO NOT BUY!",1.0 out of 5 stars

I first reported my problem to the manufacturer, and they sent me information that says used items will not be covered under the warranty. I admit I didn't think about any other possible issues besides a possible packaging problem. But the item was described as used so I knew it wouldn't be covered under the warranty. Amazon's policy is stated as I was purchasing this item, that your have 30 days to return the item. I called and they said I could return it, and that was the correct customer service thing to do since I just purchased it. But I was not informed that there would be a restocking fee. I was told that customer service is not responsible to inform you of the restocking fee since it is listed on their policy. I don't agree with that, but if I would have read their policies I would have known that.

Andrew H,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2024","Previously purchased a 70-pint (old rating system) Frigidaire dehumidifier in 2017 that worked well for several years before succumbing to an ""F0"" low refrigerant error. It was just past the 5 year warranty, so I begrudgingly shelled out nearly $300 for this new model (now rated at 50-pint). I figured that if I could get another 5 years it would be worth it. It's now been about a year and a half and the lower third of the coils ice up within minutes of turning on the unit while the upper portion of the coils is warm (see pictures, this is not a little frost). Virtually no moisture is removed from the air even though the RH is 70, the room is warm, and there is plenty of airflow over the coils. This is a well-known sign of a refrigerant issue, but apparently Frigidaire has now dropped their warranty to only a year so all I got is the number of a local repair shop to pay yet more money to fix the unit. Nearly $300 a year is far too much for a basic no-frills dehumidifier and Frigidaire is certainly not getting my business this time!!",1.0 out of 5 stars
John Gibbons,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2022","As many reviews have said, the built in water pump seems to be very prone to failing and instead of detecting that, the dehumidifier keeps on running and overflows its own bucket spewing water all over.

This happen to me about 3 weeks into using this Frigidaire Dehumidifier.

Incredibly poor design and ironically I was aware that this was a risk, so I placed the entire dehumidifier in a large plastic container and wrapped a homekit eve water sensor around the dehumidifier with an automation to kill power to the smart plug the dehumidifier was plugged in to if it detected water.

Well the pump failed and the plastic bin it was sitting in began to fill with water. The bucket subsequently cracked and finally the water sensor did detect water but it was too late as a pool of water got to sit on a wood floor for several days.

My mistake was I didn't have the eve leak sensor cord at the very bottom of the plastic bin as I never imagined the bin cracking within a month of being setup combined with a pump failure. The dehumidifier was set on top of styrofoam so that it was high enough up for the pump hose to freely clear the rim of the plastic bin and most of the leak sensor was at that level.

If you want one with a pump, I have also setup the Midea 50-Pint CUBE Smart Dehumidifier with Pump and it seems like a much better design but I also have only used it for a month. It starts pumping water when the internal bucket is at a pretty low level instead of allowing the bucket to fill and then pumping. I imagine Midea's design means that if the pump failed the normal full bucket cut off would engage but I can't say for certain.",1.0 out of 5 stars

1) Frigidaire will not offer a refund, only a replacement. I completed a replacement request, which would be evaluated within 3 business days.
2) After 10 business days I contacted customer service again and found out that. A) This is a known (common) problem and the company has an auto-replace policy for the unit because it costs more to fix than replace. They approved the replacement during the call. Unit is now supposed to be delivered within the next 2 weeks. B) The company does not pick up the unit nor pay for disposal. Because of the coolant, the unit can’t just be thrown out - it costs 25-50 dollars for disposal.

Paul F.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2022","I purchased this unit because of all the great reviews on it and talked to others who have had great success with it. It did work well for the first year then about 3 weeks after the one year warranty expired I realized it was not working. It was frozen up about 1/3rd of the way up the fins and not defrosting.

Since I had it on a continuous drain I didn't check it on a regular basis so I'm not sure when it stopped working properly but needless to say it was very close to the one year warranty period. After following all the trouble shooting recommeded by Frididaire and consulting with some local HVAC professionals it became clear that the refrigerant level was low. All of the functions are working fine but with low refriderant level it will just freeze up every time yet all other functions are working correctly. These units are not designed to be recharged like your car AC is so repairing it is out of the question.

I have called customer service a couple of times but they were of no help. They wanted to run through the trouble shooting steps over and over which I had already done. Their position was sorry but the warranty period has passed and they would not give me any consideration. In the end I was cut off on both of my calls and the line just went dead.

Considering that many people tell me about getting 10-12-14 years service out of their humidiers I am highly disappointed by the way it failed at one year and the lack of concern from customer service.

But as long as this thing was on, the large room it was in stayed at 76 degrees. Yes, it lowered humidity with a fair amount of noise. But what's the point if it heats the room that much?!? We had to return it because of this, and even with PRIME, they're saying they're going to ""TAKE OVER 30 DAYS TO REFUND THE PURCHASE PRICE.""!

VERY disappointed that you have to use the phone app for some features like the filter to work. No other controls to use them on the machine.

Given that they're holding our money hostage for A MONTH after returning it, this is the LAST Fridgidair product we'll ever buy. And if they steal the money, last time we'll be buying from Amazon PRIME.",1.0 out of 5 stars
trl01,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2022","I purchased a new home in Lexington, KY in June 2021, and I purchased two 50-pint Frigidaire Dehumidifiers from Amazon for my basement. I placed the one unit in the finished part of my basement and the second unit in unfinished part. The products worked fine from June -October 2021. The units were not used October 2021 - April 2022 because the humidity and temps were low in the fall and winter.

When I began using the units in April they worked fine. However, in late June both units began having issues. The first unit stopped dehumidifying all together. The second unit ices up and leaks all over the floor.

I called July 12, 2022, I explained to my situation to Frigidaire Customer Support. Since my units were only used 6 months within the first year, I requested replacements. The rep. agreed to replace both units and sent me the forms to begin the process. I was told to wait 10 days to get the new units.

Aaron,"Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2023","I bought this in February 2023 to replace a three-year-old Frigidaire FFAD7033R1 dehumidifier. The new one was a step up from the old model in a couple of ways (including a bigger condensate tank, a better dust filter, and a less-fragile float), and worked satisfactorily for exactly six months. My biggest complaint was that it was hard to empty the condensate tank because it doesn't have any kind of spout.

When the new dehumidifier hit the six-month mark, the coils started icing over in 85-degree temperatures -- so badly that I had to defrost the coils with a hair dryer twice a day and place the unit on plastic sheeting to catch the dripping from all the ice melting. The unit also started periodically shutting off with an ""EC"" error code. Since the unit was still under warranty, I filed a warranty claim as soon as I noticed the icing. I waited SEVEN WEEKS for my approved replacement unit, and the company's attitude was ""It'll get there when it gets there.""

As of August 29, 2024, I am on my THIRD successive warranty replacement for the original unit. None has survived more than six months -- the latest one just started icing over after only 68 days of operation!

It's borderline unethical and I will never by Electrolux/Frigidaire or any related brands again.

The one I bought started freezing up after 11 months, which I cleaned the filter regularly (was the first troubleshooting question). I called and got some troubleshooting steps which included unplugging and letting sit for some time. After trying numerous things, I reached back out to customer support as it was still not working properly. I was put on hold and then got disconnected. I then tried reaching out via chat, which the support rep SAID A NEW UNIT would be sent to me but I needed to fill out a form that I would receive via email. I filled out the form and submitted to the email address provided, which stated 10 business days to respond. 30 days later there was still no update on the status so I followed up and was told I would no longer be getting a replacement unit as it was past the warranty.

Well, I unplug it, plug it back in and it works just fine, so I thought. The next day the same code and light pops up so I unplug it again, works again but then the next day the code pops again.

Customer service was very helpful and they agreed to buy back the unit in July 2015. In August 2015 I purchase another Frigidaire model FAD70DWD and also purchased a protection plan from Asurion.

Steven,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2023","I did a lot of research before buying this product. I already own an Frigidaire refrigerator which works great and thought overall, the company made reliable and affordable products and provides good customer service.

Unfortunately, I was dead WRONG and ended up making the poor decision to purchase it. Some of the reviews mentioning reliability issues made me hesitant to purchase this, and I should I have listened to them.

The first year (2022) that I used this everything was fine. Then when I decided to use it this year, everything changed. Each time I plugged in the unit, an error message “EC” popped up on the display and the unit would not run. The filter was clean, and the humidifier was within the proper temperature range to function. Keep in mind, I only used this product for one summer (3 months) before it broke.

I contacted Frigidaire and they would not honor the one year warranty since it has expired two weeks ago and I would have to pay for a brand new unit.

Apparently more and more people are having the same issues with these units and are asking for Frigidaire to recall them. If you are debating on purchasing this, PLEASE save yourself the time, money, and aggravation and purchase from another company, I wish I had.

I purchased the 50 pint unit in June 2022 and used it successfully for 2.5 months before cleaning and storing it over winter.
June 2023 we resumed use.
End of September I find my basement floor full of water and discover the whole back side of the unit is covered in ice.
The auto shut off did not work.
The unit is displaying the EC code and I hit the internet looking for answers.

Curious if I was the only one having this problem I thought I’d start with the Amazon reviews.

After reading just the September 2023 1 star reviews I feel like I’ve been taken for a ride as all of them are stating similar experiences.

I now understand I purchased a product for $250 that was designed to fail just outside of the 1 year warranty.

There is no one who can fix it because it’s built (sealed) to prevent any consumer from fixing it on their own.

There is no support or recourse being offered from Frigidaire.

No one is taking responsibility and the consumers are taking the hit.

Lawrence,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2021","I read the instructions, looked the machine over, and noticed a few minor issues:
- The drain cap usually has a nub that allows it to be secured to the machine. The nub was missing/damaged, so the cap was just its own separate piece.
- The metal fins behind the filter looked damaged and were bent in quite a few places.

I thought maybe these would just be cosmetic, so I plugged in the power and tested the machine. It turned on fine and the fan spun up. The electronics seemed to work just fine, and I left it to run for a while. I checked from time to time, but the water level indicator never moved, so I just gave it more time.

When I checked on it again after a few hours, the water level indicator still had not risen, and removing the bucket revealed that there was no water inside. So now I thought that the dehumidifier simply wasn't working. Maybe the fan just spun and did nothing. But no, unfortunately that wasn't the part that was broken.

When I tried to move the machine to a different room to see if it would work better, I heard splashing sounds, and saw that it was leaking at the bottom. And the large wet spot on the carpet meant that it had been leaking for quite a while. Yet the bucket was still completely dry. Something must be wrong inside and the water never made it to the bucket.

I didn't dare plug it in again, since it's an electronic appliance, and it somehow had water sloshing around inside. Who knows how dangerous it was to have running it for hours! Definitely getting a refund and considering other brands or stores.",1.0 out of 5 stars

George,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2022","If my experience had been with only ONE unit, I would not be writing this review. I’ve owned THREE of the units. One is already in the landfill, and the other two have given the dreaded “EC” code, which means that is where they are headed.

The Frigidaire manual says the “EC” code is the result of operating outside the temperature limits or input voltage limits. THAT IS CATEGORICALLY UNTRUE. The “EC” code 99% of the time means the refrigerant has leaked from the unit due to poor quality Chinese construction, and your unit is headed for the landfill…Your first clue will be that the backside of the unit begins to ice up—classic clue that refrigerant is low. I understand HVAC, how it works, and how to repair it. The dehumidifier is not made to be EASILY recharged—that is, it has no recharge connections inside the unit. To recharge it, you must BRAZE in standard recharge fittings. Any competent HVAC technician can do this (for about $200 + refrigerant), and recharge your unit…but within a short time, the refrigerant will leak out once more and your unit will stop working. Since the Frigidaire unit is about $300, this does not make economic sense. Simply buy a better quality unit. This, and other Frigidaire/Electrolux products have equally bad service reputations. I’m going to buy two units from another manufacturer after CAREFULLY reading the reviews.

Dong W.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2022","In Feb 2021, I purchased this model after some careful research on the internet, knowing that our basement usually gets very humid in the three months of summer, and there is a range of performances among the models on the market. This model was great when it worked at the beginning, just as many positive reviews described. It then went to hibernation as fall came and the air became dry. After I turned it on the second summer, in 2022, I soon realized that something was wrong. A block of ice was accumulating on the condensing unit, which then grew onto the filter and the outer cover in the back. It eventually glued all of them together so that I couldn’t open the back cover without fearing to break it. This ice, when melted, does not collect in the tank. It accumulates elsewhere in the unit and then leaks onto the floor to form a puddle.
While waiting for the ice to melt after turning off the power, I went on the internet to look for the cause, and ruled out the simple factors: low ambient temperature, clogged filter, broken fan, etc. Outwardly the unit looks fine, making all the right noises when turned on. It has also been well maintained: if I told you it was brand new (see the first two photos), you wouldn’t be able to tell that it is 2 years old. Yet every time, 5 minutes after I turn it on, ices start to form. The last photo shows ice accumulation at the lower half after one hour of operation. It seems one of the sensors has failed, not something a non-professional can easily diagnose or replace.

When I called Fridigiare, I was told that I would have to buy a new one. They wouldn’t replace it because it was out of the one year warranty, even though I pointed out it was really in use for about three months. The company put dehumidifiers in their “major appliance” category, but it is not like a fridge that runs constantly, or a range that you turn on every day. It is more like an air conditioning unit that one uses only when it is really hot.

I understand that the 12-month warranty is just company policy and that as a company, it will try its best to avoid cost, but it feels rather shabby for a company to pretend that it is perfectly beyond reproach when one piece of their major appliance fails after one single season of use.

I am sure that most units of this model work superbly, and that many thousands of customers are luckier than I am. However, if you are about to shell out close to $300 on a dehumidifier, would you not worry that after you put it away after the first season, there is a chance it may not come back next time? Now that I am again on the market for a decent dehumidifier, at least it should have a meaningful warranty, and that rules out Frigidaire.

P.S. I indeed purchased an equivalent model from a different manufacturer, costing half as much as the Frigidaire one, with a warranty twice as long. Fingers crossed!",2.0 out of 5 stars
T.R.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2024","I cannot recommend this product. The unit seemed to function correctly upon delivery. However, exactly one month to the date, the dehumidifier began severely leaking. Specifically, the unit would not automatically turn off when the bucket became full--this is a serious issue in humid climates as 50 pints can fill up in a few hours. On more than one occasion, I awoke to find water pooling on my hardwood floors and baseboards.

Making matters worse, customer service has been virtually nonexistent. It took several weeks to file a warranty claim as same seems to be handled through a third party affiliated with Electrolux. After finally submitting my claim, it was approved and I was notified I would receive a replacement unit. Several weeks have passed and I have had no follow up. Contacting Frigidaire is unhelpful as the representatives provide different answers; one advises the unit is backordered and I will receive a comparable model. another that they cannot locate my warranty claim. The number provided for warranties leads immediately to a full mailbox of a random individual.

In conclusion, Frigidaire sold a faulty product and has yet to honor its contractual warranty. For these reasons, I strongly suggest you look elsewhere for a dehumidifier and consider Honeywell, Hisense, or any of the other options on the market.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Bruce,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2024","I loved this unit for the two summers I used it, but it failed afterwards. Being it was used in my main living space in my non-air conditioned home, I used the unit only in the evening and overnight hours as it generated a fair amount of heat when the compressor was active. So, its use was not constant. I kept it clean and cared for it and it did a wonderful job. It worked wonderfully up until I stored it this past winter. When I pulled it out to use for this summer, the compressor would not come on in spite of the high humidity readings in the room and a properly set machine. Sadly, there appears to be many such stories such as mine. One should probably take with a grain of salt the reviews that are glowingly written after only a few weeks of use. I do believe that a unit that I paid a lot of money for should have a life more than a limited two year span (really, only about 8 months of use and only at nighttime). Disappointing and disappointed. Will not buy a Frigidaire dehumidifier again and will think twice about any Frigidaire product moving forward.",2.0 out of 5 stars

no body,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2023","purchased direct from Frigidaire.

The controls for this unit are somewhat restrictive. It starts on the Continuous function, during which you can't see the relative humidity display. The humidity control has a range of 35-60. You cannot go higher, and below 35 is Continuous mode. I set the speed to low. The fan is quite powerful.

The unit draws air through the back and blows it through its right, or your left. Can kind of be rotated if you don't like that. Being a refrigerant dehmidifier, it does generate quite a bit of heat.

I really liked the water storage tank. The handle makes it easy to carry, and it didn't feel heavy. There are a number of openings through which you can pour the water, but this also means that the tank can release water back into the atmosphere when the unit isn't in operation. The unit will flash the ""full"" light whenever the limit switch is open, including when you remove the tank, which is nice and annoying at the same time.

The tank holding compartment design is where it fails. There is a tank retaining clip and it is FRAGILE. I've only removed the tank about 4 times, and on that 4th time, I couldn't get the tank to ""snap"" in. The left side would pop out slightly, and it was ""loose"". Upon inspection, there was a shiny clip below the tank limit switch that seemed to have bent when I pushed the tank into it. I am not sure what its original form is, but it seemed like it was attached to the top of the cube part, and it had broken off when the tank was lifted(during removal). This caused the shiny piece to drop down, where before it was in a semi-horizontal triangle.

Fortunately, I was able to ""fix"" it. This involves manually bending the clip around until the top JUST rests on top of the cube, and the middle has to have enough bend to allow the bottom to clear the limit switch, shown in picture. If it does not clear the switch, the unit will not stop if it overflows. If you're unable to do this, I hypothesize that it'd be possible to put tape on the top of the cube and attach it to the end of the clip so that it normally rests in a horizontal position.",2.0 out of 5 stars

John Danilson,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2022","Updated 5/2024
The pump has given up. It's out of warranty so the only recouse is an afer market pump which I will try. I'm downgrading this to two stars. My guess is the dehumdifier will go in another year or so. It seems all these units come from the same factory in China and all have limited life expectancies. I tried one of the commerical units and suspect it would hold up longer (3 to 5 year warranties) but it was way too noisy.

Original review 7/2022
Seems like a solid product and does the trick. I've had it running in our very damp basement (relative humidity was 76% before we started) for the past several days and we are now down to relative humidity of 40% according to our humidistat.

What I like:

1. the pump kicks in automatically when the bucket fills and sends it via a small hose where you want it. I don't know yet how much lift this pump can support but will be finding out as we direct this water outside via a basement window which will need a lift of about 8'.
2. the compressor stops when it reaches the set point. The fan stops shortly thereafter.
3. it is quiet enough but clearly it generates white noise which might be an issue in a bedroom.

Why not five stars:

1. the packaging is way too excessive. what a total waste. Too much styrofoam, plastic, and cardboard. Yes, I understand this comes from China but why wrap the power cord in a bunch of plastic, the instruction manual in plastic, and the whole thing in plastic and then surround it all by styrofoam and double thickenss cardboard. All of this held together with industrial tape!
2. There are two water outlets on the rear; one is for continuous draining and the other via the pump. I'd have preferred a single output and a garden hose attachement for both rather than the rather unimpressive 1/4"" plastic hose with a push fitting to the rear. time will tell how this stands up.

This is our second unit and we like the larger size and pump. It's worth the extra cost and has done a better job of drying out the room. We've exiled the smaller unit to the unfinished basement where I can drain it using a regular hose to a drain as it has no pump.

If I run into issues I will update this review. I have had a number of bad experiences with all the China manufactured dehumidifiers but this one does seem to have a better overall build quality. We shall see.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Kelly Fernandez,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2024","I bought this dehumidifier in March 2023. The unit worked amazingly well for 1 year. I mean honestly it worked very very well!

In the beginning of April 2024, my dehumidifier started to develop frost on the coils, and then it started to produce an error code ""EC."" The manual instructed me that this error code meant my dehumidifier needed to be repaired. I called customer service and they also told me that it needed to be repaired, and helped me schedule a repair appointment. The repair appointment cost me $100 since my dehumidifier was a few weeks outside of its covered warranty. When the repairman came, he said that he could not repair the device and then left within 5 minutes. I called Frigidaire customer service twice to get a refund for my appointment and they said they could not issue it since the repairman came already. Had I known the unit couldn't be repaired (i.e. if the manual and customer service didn't recommend me trying to get it repaired) I would have just bought a new dehumidifier from Frigidaire. But, due to their shit customer service, I bought a homelabs dehumidifier and I can tell you already that it's much quieter!

So basically, this dehumidifier works well but it there's a good chance it will break after a year or so (outside of its warranty). Also know that Frigidaire customer service is quite awful, and there are not a lot of resources on the web to repair this dehumidifier on your own. Best of luck!",2.0 out of 5 stars

This worked to turn the unit back on for the fan, but after a few hours (?) or less the code showed up again. Checked the drain hose and even undid the hose to let it drain to the internal tank but after several days of trying this (unplugging to reset the code) there was no water being drawn out even when the fan was running.

Zapix,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2023","I live in Connecticut, so it's quite humid here, but I also have central air... Purchased the 35 PINT model for a 980 sqft apartment. Reduces humidity quickly, but even when set to a certain humidity level, it seems to only lower the humidity just to that point on the unit.

After timing several cycles... The compressor would run for 6 minutes, then the fan only for 2 minutes, off for 1 minute and then repeat. It might as well be on continuous setting. I would expect it to cycle far less often considering this is only assisting central air.

I have 3 temp/RH sensors... Despite whatever the humidity setting, it will just run in cycles like this taking it as low as it will go. At a setting of 50, it would run until the sensors were reading 42%. at 55% it would get around 49%. Set to 60, it was around 52%. I think the unit's sensor is defective.

After 3 days of use a watt meter calculated 18.81 KWh of use. The highest draw was 440W when I first turned it on and the humidity was about 65. It was running at around 411W usually during the cycles after the humidity was in the 45~50 range. Despite running nearly nonstop, it doesn't appear to be a huge energy drain.

Initially filled the bucket after about 24 hours of use. Once it got into cycling on and off (for a minute, lol) it took about 36 to 48 hours to fill the bucket. I feel like there's something wrong with it. I turned it off, just using my central air, and the humidity is only 2% higher after 6 hours.

My hope was to keep the A/C at a higher temp (74F/75F) and keep the humidity at 50 or lower... If it worked as I would expect and the readings were right, I'd be happy. I'm not. Take it away. Might replace with the 50 pint in hopes of less cycling and more accurate RH reading.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Es,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023","My Haier 20 pint started dying on me and I have had it only for 2 years, so I invested in this Frigidaire one due to good reviews. However, I plan on returning it for the following reasons.

1) The dehumidifier takes much longer than my old one to bring down the humidity in a tiny bathroom.
2) The lowest it brought it down to was 43%. My old one brings it down to 35% and much faster at that!
3) The Haier has more options but Frigidaire does have a timer which Haier doesn't have.
4) Most importantly, this dehumidifier blows out air from the side. This is not good if you have a tiny bathroom like mine because space is limited, AND it is not good if you are trying to dry used towels and such. The Haier one blows air from the top. There is much more airflow, thereby bringing down the humidity quicker and more efficiently. In addition, if you have wet towels, you can position the dehumidifier so it blows hot air on to the towels thereby drying them out. The Frigidaire dehumidifier was unable to dry out my towels despite leaving it on for a couple hours in the bathroom with the door shut. The Haier completely dries out the towels, dries up all the water spots on the shower walls and doors, and brings down the humidity in less than an hour.

The only pro in comparison to the Haier model is that it is quieter and has a timer, but who cares about the sound level when it is not bringing down the humidity. As for the timer, you can just buy a smart plug and time it yourself. I just bought another Haier one and will be returning this Frigidaire one. I just hope the Haier lasts longer this time.

JB,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2022","I have mixed feelings on these units. They do de-humidify rooms well enough. But they put off an ungodly amount of heat.

And here's the thing...

For those of us in the northeast, our high-humidity comes during the hot humid months. So this obscene amount of heat is unacceptable. It literally feels like you're running a heater in your room.

We bought 3 of the 50L ones and one 35L model last summer when we moved into a new house because the humidity inside was very high. This did de-humidify. But we could reach 90F in rooms where these ran. It was crazy. And it's not a good trade-off.

We've since rigged up some portable a/c units to work with our crank windows (why we couldn't just put in window units to help cut the humidity and cool things together). They're supposed to also act as dehumidifiers, but they don't do a great job and don't hold as much. Under normal cooling operation, they also intentionally put the moisture back in the air so you don't have to empty them. It's awful. So we considered putting one of these in the same rooms so the a/c units wouldn't have to work as hard to dehumidify things. But the heat is bad enough the a/c units can't keep up.

So these have pretty much been relegated to the basement. And down there, they're less effective than we'd like.

We had a single dehumidifier at our last house in the basement. It was also a very humid area in the summers. It was smaller than 50L, and it still kept up with things just fine, and that basement stayed very dry as a result. We have all three 50L Frigidaire units in our basement now, and they struggle to keep up.

So, yes, they dehumidify rooms. But they're also like portable heaters, so they're not fit for summer use unless you have really strong air conditioning at the same time (which, really, should be doing the dehumidifying for you if you have it).

As for larger areas like basements, they're not great. But at least they do hold plenty, and the heat would be less of an issue there. Just know you might need several for an open area like that.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Chris M,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2023","I should have known better than to buy a built-in-pump unit at ~$150 less than competitors, regardless of it's higher reviews.

Right out of the box the pump unit does not operate correctly, which is the only unit reason I had for purchasing the unit. When set in ""Pump"" mode, water continues to drain into the reserve bucket and never switches over to pumping. The unit is then turned off when the bucket is filled, per normal operation. The pump can be ""forced"" on by waiting for the bucket to fill over roughly half, and manually cycling the pump feature off/on. This causes the pump to audibly turn on for roughly 5 minutes, but in that time no water is visually drained from the bucket, and the pump will not turn back on automatically again to prevent the bucket from filling.

When contacting Frigidaire for assistance, they then attempt to instruct you that in the case the pump isn't operating appropriately, to use the ""continuous draining"" (aka gravity drain) port instead, rather than attempting to troubleshoot and resolve the issue. This, obviously, supercedes the entire purpose of buying a multi-hundred-dollar pump-equipt unit. They also will not return/refund the unit, only offering warranty replacements.

TLDR: If you NEED a pumping unit, do yourself a favor and buy a real commercial applications model instead of this one, because you are functionally scamming yourself out of $250.

The warranty process was a pain. First, they aren't open on the weekends and you have to do it over the phone. Next, I called and had to go through troubleshooting even though the manual says EC is a total failure of the system. She asked me to check the house voltage?! Then after providing all the info she said I would get a link to order a replacement in my email. The link never came. I called the next day and the guy (who was very helpful) said he had no record of me calling. I had to provide all the info again. It was a 20 minute call (again!!). Then he sends the link and I have to provide all the same information on the web that I already provided over the phone. Twice. I haven't received the new one yet.

The dehumidifer worked well for 21 months then in April 24, it showed ""EC"" error code. Frigidare suggests in the owners manual to unplug unit and plug it back in to reset. But said if the error code persists, to contact their service department. The unit would run but did not collect water and the error code persisted. I made a claim to Asurion and same day they approved my claim and issued a full refund via an Amazon gift card.

jpn,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2021","update: dead after 2 years. Called support and they only provide a 1 yr warranty. These things always leak out all the refrigerant after about 1.5-2 yrs and they go in the junk. I've thrown away probably about 5-6 of these in almost as many years. They do work well, but not for long. I would gladly pay more for a product that lasted more than 2 yrs. I have one that's still kicking after ~3 yrs, but most are out of refrigerant by the 2nd year.

This is the best performer in my experience. I’ve gotten a new Frigidaire dehum every single year for the past 5 or so years. This vintage is a redesign, so I’m hoping they can hold the refrigerant charge, as every single other Frigidaire dehum I’ve owned has lost its charge within 14 months. The manufacturers warranty is exceptional. They will mail a new one to your door if you have a warranty replacement claim approved, so that’s really nice that they at least stand behind the product.

I’ve tried a number of manufacturers whose performance was just abysmal in comparison. These Frigidaire seemingly outperform the others. The 35pint keeps my 1600 sq ft basement at a perfect 40%RH all summer long in the Midwest (74F space temp). This is nice because it’s reasonably quiet, and rejects the heat back into the basement so it actually adds a bit of net heat to the space which is perfect for below grade. Also allows the central AC to run more effectively by tackling the majority of the space humidity load. I put them in all my houses and if they fail I immediately replace. I own two of these redesigned models and neither had failed yet after about a year and a half of ownership on the one.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Lekan Wang,"Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2022","Purchased in 2021. In the year that it worked, it was quite efficient sitting in the basement, running around 50% of the time constantly to bring humidity down to 40%. The noise was like a quiet fan from around 20' away with the door shut, but definitely noticeable. Hose output and the reservoir output both worked properly.

However, the condenser unit started freezing over after 1yr 2 months. I tried taking it apart and cleaning it thoroughly, but it still kept freezing over, even running it for just an hour at 55% humidity. After a week or two of trying to fix it, it now gives the EC error code, and will no longer turn on.

I called into the service desk, and after a tedious 10-minute automated phone tree and entering details, I was placed on hold for over an hour without any estimates for wait time. At 49min of hold time, the call disconnected me without warning. Called again, and similar thing happened. Still can't find a way to get to the service desk.

However, ended up chatting with an agent over text and he said that because it's over a year since purchase, there's nothing they can do, and that I should purchase a new unit from Frigidaire.com. I asked about service, or other things that I can do, and they said there wasn't. Tough argument to make for me to get another one of the same units...",2.0 out of 5 stars
Vinaka,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2022","Got this unit a few days ago to combat an overly humid apartment. Definitely has taken down the overall humidity in the approx 750sq ft space down by 10-12% even in the three days it has been running. The unit isn't totally quiet but it's definitely not obnoxious either if it is not right next to you. Given my location and air condition, the 35 pint has filled and been emptied twice a day.

This unit generates a LOT of heat. My example is this morning- temperature in my bathroom (the smallest space in the apartment) was 74. Temperature in the largest space in the apartment, near the kitchen/living room where the unit was located? 80 degrees. Outside temperature was 73 at the time. It may or may not make a difference depending on your needs, but it definitely does in the small space I can call my own.

After running for two weeks or so this was my test with no other changes in use of power. The cost to run this on my energy bill was over $40 on top of the unit cost - And this was not even a full month of running. Disappointed and sticker-shocked is definitely what comes to mind. Could have saved a lot of time and money to not have tried it out. Will no longer be running this unit unless mold becomes an issue.",2.0 out of 5 stars
William D.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2021","It died about 4 months after the warrantee expired. Keep in mind I only run it 6 months per year when humidity in basements climbs above 60%. It began flash the code EC.. I looked it up: “the sealed system and condenser is defective and the unit is not repairable.” Confirmed with a phone call to the manufacturer. Since it is out of warrantee, I’m out of luck — not even a discount on a replacement unit. Hopefully the new GE I purchased to replace lasts longer.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I purchased this to handle my walk-out basement (about 900 square feet). Relative humidity was consistently above 50% during New England winter and between 61% - 68% in the spring... not crazy high but enough to notice some musty smell and allowing some of my cheaper tools to rust.

After setting this up and running on “continuous” for first 4 days as per instructions, all is now well! Beware! The built in hygrometer is not accurate so be sure to buy a separate one to monitor actual humidity level. It took me about a week to find the best setting to keep humidity around 40% — for me, setting the dehumidifier on high at 50% keeps my basement’s humidity between 38 - 43%.

I can’t write about electric bill or longevity since I’ve only had it for a few weeks. Pump works well so far with no leaks (8 foot rise to drain) and the unit runs quietly. I have to actually be in the basement to hear it at all. Maintenance is easy! When I see the clean filter light, I remove both the air filter and pump filter and rinse. About 5 minutes of “work” every couple of weeks.

Unfortunately, I haven’t had one of these last more than a year at which time it’ll give you an error code, indicating that it is malfunctioning. I called the company after the first one died and they replaced it, but unfortunately would not replace it again after the second one died a year later. Instead they recommended a service technician at my expense. From online, I’ve gathered that this ‘EC code means the sealed system and condenser is defective and the unit is not repairable. The coils are either freezing and stop functioning or just not condensing at all. You can temporarily reset it by unplugging it, but the unit is going bad regardless and will quit functioning pretty quickly afterwards.’ Certainly not worth hundreds of dollars only to work for 1 summer.",2.0 out of 5 stars

So then I plug it in and the fan noise is much louder than I would expect. It also makes a really loud sound from time to time, like something inside it is about to fall apart.

Sharon S.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2023","We bought the new version since our old one worked so well for so long - 12 years. This one is a disappointment because although it appears to be functioning properly, it has some real drawbacks:
1. The bucket fills so full before turning off that it is impossible to get IT to the drain sink without spilling it.
2. There is no good place to grab onto the bucket to empty it without putting lots of lateral pressure on the plastic handle which will probably not last long.
3. The exhaust is in the top so unless you remember to turn the machine off before emptying, you get a strong blast of air right in your face when you return the empty bucket. Because of the mold that inevitably builds up inside the machine, this is very unhealthy.
The machine does have a hose drain function and we are going to look into how to set this up to avoid the above problems.

A Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2022","This unit apparently does draw some water from the air, but it is very noisy and it heats up the room significantly.

When running on low speed, this dehumidifier was the noisiest appliance in my apartment. It was louder than the dishwasher, louder than the air conditioner, and louder than the (world's noisiest) furnace. This unit is probably best placed somewhere out of the way of daily traffic and definitely far away from any bedroom. If placed in a living area, good luck trying to ignore the sound.

I was also surprised at how much heat was generated. After running for a few hours, the room where this unit was placed became uncomfortably hot. For me, humidity is an issue during the hot summer months, so I was running this unit at the same time as my air conditioner. Since the dehumidifier essentially acted as a very effective room heater, it did not make financial or environmental sense to run it at the same time as the air conditioner. So I returned the dehumidifier and kept the air conditioner.

Josh M.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2022","I've owned two Frigidaire dehumidifiers in the past. This was our third, but first with the built-in pump. It worked great for a while, really helping bring down the humidity in our basement. Unfortunately, at around the 18 month mark, the pump started having problems and was inconsistent. Despite through cleaning of the tank, flushing and ultimately replacing all the drain lines, etc., the problem continued. Meanwhile, and potentially related, the compressor began to fail, and the unit started displaying an EC error. A search in forums made clear this was a fatal problem for the unit, though power cycling would fix it temporarily. I contacted Frigidaire support, and there were clear and unequivocal that there is only a 1-year warranty on the unit and it is unrepairable and advised me to purchase a new one on frigidaire.com. And this is all before the unit's second birthday. A $240 unit can't last such a short period of time, especially when it is marketed as being designed for continuous use.

Over time, the flimsy aluminum toggle inside the bucket area got bent. This toggle is used to trigger when the bucket is full. Once it got bent, and didn't align with the tab on the bucket, the humidifier mistakenly thought the bucket was full so it would not run. I tried to troubleshoot, and bend it back, but no success. Since the toggle is less than 1/4"" wide a the plastic tab on the bucket, just as narrow, it was nearly impossible to readjust it. I got frustrated and threw the thing out.

philip smith,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2022","If you purchased this for the built in pump feature, save your money. The plastic hose plugs into to a lock collar. It’s hard to tell if it’s properly seated. This collar wiggles around with a lot of play. If the hose is not properly seated the water pumping out from the containment bucket will leak out all over the floor. I got it to work, but if anything touches the hose it can easily move the hose out of alignment and the water leak out. Because the pump only works when the bucket is filled you don’t know what will happen until the unit begins to pump. I finally gave up after 2 Weeks of inconsistency and sent it back and bought a cheaper GE with a similar plug in collar that doesn’t have play and is located near the bottom of the unit. So far no issues. Frigidaire needs to redesign the collar so the hose stays secure. It’s too bad because other than that it is a great item.

In the end they did nothing but waste my time. I did a ton of research and this model is consistently one of the highest rated. Certainly not for durability. Maybe they’re all junk regardless of brand. With a lack of demonstrated durability and such a limited warranty, it’s hard to justify paying a premium for a well known brand like Frigidaire.

I purchased this unit in July 2023. Ran great and lowered humidity as promised. Put it away for the winter in a closet. Brought it back out a few weeks ago and again seemed to be working well. Matched my Hygrometer reading within a couple degrees. However, I have noticed over the last several days that it just keeps running. The compressor turns on , it runs for awhile, then turns off, but then turns right back on again. So this evening I'm trying to sleep and it keeps doing this (I have it set at 45%). I have two Hygrometers in my room that both say the humidity is at 40%. The unit keeps running... so I set it to 50%, and it still just keeps running even though the humidity level is still down at 41%. I finally changed the setting to 60% and it finally has stayed shut down. And guess what?, both Hygrometers still say it's only at 41% in the room 30 minutes later. And thankfully the temperature has dropped 2 degrees to 73°. Guess I'll be calling to see if I can get a replacement. Fingers crossed! 🤞😬

Seez52,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2024","This is my 4th Frigidaire unit. This one lasted almost two years. I run it 24/7 all year long. It does a good job. This particular model is really quiet and it seems to work as it should. I use a direct drain and I like the setup Frigidaire uses for this. Occasionally the hose will become obstructed and the bucket fills. I purchased the model with wifi hoping it would tell me when the bucket is full but apparently that is not a push option on the app. Really that's the only useful thing the app could do.

I've had several brands of these: Maytag, LG etc. they all last about the same amount of time. Usually they fail just outside the warranty period typically 18-24 months. I do have another Frigidaire just like this one that's going on three years, wow! I learned about three units ago that you always purchase the extended warranty that Amazon offers during checkout. I get the 4 year one it's usually $50.

This one is a replacement for the same model purchased in June of 2022. I submitted a claim through Amazon on my phone and within 5 minutes had a credit on my account for what I originally paid. Ordered this one, it was a little more expensive, and it was here in two days. It was an easy and quick way to get up and running again. Never buy one of these portable dehumidifiers, regardless of the brand, without a 3 or 4 year extended warranty. They are all made in China and simply are not intended to be long term use appliances.

Judy L.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2022","We have a large basement with 3 rooms that I grow a number of vegetables and herbs in. Prior to getting this dehumidifier, the humidity in our basement was continuously in excess of 70% caused by evaporation of water in the pots. Unfortunately, we were told this caused humidity in our attic that wasn't noticed until we found mold growing. This was a very expensive lesson for us as we had to have the roof and all of the wood below it replaced at a cost of over $15K.

I am not going to get into any technical stuff like the efficiency of the condenser, but will say this dehumidifier has helped to solve our humidity problem. In searching for a dehumidifier to meet our needs, I had to learn the capacity of humidity remove was different than the size of the tank to be emptied. The 50 pint ( or 6.25 gallons) capacity of this dehumidifier is the amount of moisture that will be removed from the air in a 24 hour period. I would guess the water tank holds about 2 gallons of water as we need to empty it 3 times in a 24 hour period.

Since the humidity in our basement is high because of the plants, we have this unit set to continuous, but you can also set it to run until a desired humidity is reached. When the water container is full, it automatically stops until the container is emptied. You can also set the fan to high or low. When the filter gets dirty, a light shows on the top of the unit. Cleaning the filter is a matter of spraying it clean with a faucet spray and drying it with a towel.

This unit is in a room 30' x 15', and the humidity has been reduced from over 70% to 40%. We have had this dehumidifier for over a month, and are very happy with it. It consistently keeps the humidity down and is very easy to maintain.

UPDATE 5/27/22:
Since our basement is very large with 3 rooms, two of which contain plants, we decided to buy another one of these dehumidifiers so we could one in each of the plant rooms. The humidity in both rooms is staying around 40% and out attic is now staying dry. This has also helped to reduce the humidity in the house which make it much more comfortable during the summer.

UPDATE 09/24/23:
We bought 2 of the dehumidifiers, and they worked well for about 15 months. After the 15 months, both units started leaking which was, of course after the warranty had expired. We finally replaced both of them. Considering the cost, these dehumidifiers should last longer then 15 months, in my opinion. We replaced them with a different brand, and also bought the extended insurance just to be safe.

Simone S,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2024","After 3yrs of almost constant use my Frigidaire dehumidifier started acting up (seemed like compressor was stuck on and humming even when turned unit off) on Christmas Day. I decided to purchase the newer model (looks EXACTLY the same) as a used like new Amazon Warehouse return. It arrived on its side (not good) inside a larger Amazon box with zero packaging material in the Amazon box. The actual Fridigaire box was very slightly damaged but the product inside was strapped and taped with plenty of styrofoam (still brushing it off the machine lol) and seems brand new.

Unfortunately, when I plugged it in, it's much louder than the previous model and often makes an annoying clunking when the compressor turns off and on (old model didn't clunk). The compressor sounds like it's straining and similar to the old dying one I continued to use after the initial issues, to see if it was really done for (unplugged it when leaving house or sleeping). These noises are disturbing while I'm working from home. Unsure sure if I'm going to keep this, but may reach out to Fridgidaire to check warranty support first. I really don't want to pack this heavy thing back up and return it. I also wonder if it being shipped on its side (says not to tip the unit) somehow damaged it.

As far as pulling water out of the air, it works great. It's almost filled the bucket on low speed (off and on) since this morning. (FL EL Nino winter, 86% humidity outside at 1145pm.

Michael,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2021","Well, it is definitively an impressive dehumidifier. It reduced humidity from 71 to 35 in just one hour (in Continuous Mode). I adjusted it to 40, and the dehumidifier kept the humidity level to 40 all the time, even after taking a shower. Incredible!

BUT...

The Frigidaire's customer service is mediocre. I mean, if your dehumidifier gets broken, and you think Frigidaire will resolve your problem in a timely manner, all I can say is, good luck.

My dehumidifier stopped working two weeks after its first use. It was showing the error code: EC, which I don't know what it means but Frigidaire cannot repair it. The problem is, I spent all morning with the fabricant, after providing them with all the information they requested.

After the first hour of conversation, Frigidaire (the fabricant) told me I can still use the Amazon 30-day return policy. However, Amazon didn't has this in stock, and I wanted the same model. My hero was the Amazon's customer service who discussed the issue with Frigidaire to see if they can replace the unit (since Amazon didn't has it in stock). But the fabricant took another hour to figure out that the issue should be transferred to another Frigidaire's department. And that other department never answered us the call because they were too busy. At the end, Frigidaire was completely incompetent and unable to resolve the issue in a timely manner.

The fabricant made me waste my day for nothing. So after that, the Amazon's customer service representative suggested me to just use the 30-day money back guarantee, and I see if I can get it in another website (since I didn't want another model, and Amazon don't know when it will be back in stock). Amazon handled the issue very well. My concern is Frigidaire's customer service.

So, the end of the story: I used the Amazon's guarantee, and I purchased the same model in another website, and I'm waiting for the new one because I saw how powerful is this thing. This dehumidifier is definitively impressive. That's the reason why I give it 3 stars. I cannot give it 5 stars because of the mediocre Frigidaire's customer service.

Now, if I'm unlucky again with the next unit, I will let you know, and I will come back here to give it one star and move on to another dehumidifier brand. But so far, I'm impressed, let's see how it goes. I'll let you know.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Frigidaire refused to help us because they told us the seller was not an authorized seller and the warranty was voided. We then contacted Amazon, who took down our story and said they would contact the seller for us, and would stand behind their (Amazon's) listing. The seller, Reverse Logistics Center, contacted us and wanted to know about the issue. We asked for a refund of our money since it was under the warranty period stated on Amazon. They countered with offering a refurbished unit, not a new unit. Beggars can't be choosers, so we accepted. The unit arrived within a couple of days (this time, upright in the manufacturer's box), and so far it is working fine.

David B.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2021","I purchased this on behalf of my father but had it shipped to my address first. When I received it, I noticed that the box was kind of banged up, there were dings in a couple of the sides and it was clear that it had been dropped on one of the bottom corners. This was confirmed when I opened the box and noted that the bottom piece of styrofoam was cracked. I did a visual review of the exterior of the dehumidifier and found no damage. When I pulled the bucket, I noted that the float appeared to have been dislodged and was in the bottom of the bucket. I presume it was dislodged, because I felt if it was deliberately unattached, it would have been packaged and situated to prevent it from rattling around. I had to remove the plastic top of the bucket to retrieve and reattach the float. I plugged the unit in, turned it on, and set the humidity level low and let it run though the afternoon and overnight. It filled the bucket and shut off shortly before morning. I emptied the bucket and noted that it was not designed efficiently for pouring. After pouring out most of the water, I had to turn the bucket in order to get the rest of the water into position to get emptied out. Being satisfied that the unit was still in working order, I took it to my father and we installed it in his basement. We attached a hose to the Continuous Drain connection and turned the unit on again. Within minutes, water began dripping out of the hose. It worked quietly and efficiently. The only other thing that puzzled me about the design of the unit was the base. Either it was not designed to be operated without the wheels or if the wheels could be removed, then it was not well designed to sit on a flat surface, there was only a small triangular base that would touch the floor and it did not appear to be well suited for stability without the wheels. Dad has had it for a week now and has reported no issues with it.

Nicole,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2023","Does this do its job? Yes, definitely, but please take note of my complaints...

1. This thing LOVES to beep. It will beep when it's full. It will beep when you take the bucket out to dump it. And I don't just mean a single beep. It probably beeps 10 times each. And it's loud! I have this in the basement and can hear it on the ground level. If you are using this in a room you actually use, I imagine it would be even more annoying. It would definitely be impossible to sleep through the beeping.

2. The rated size seems incorrect. I got the 22 pint, rated for covering 2400 square feet. It's in a 700 square foot basement, so less than 1/3 the maximum area. It fills up twice a day. If it were in a 2400 square foot room, I can't even imagine how often it would need to be emptied.

3. Even besides the beeping, it is not quiet. I have never owned a dehumidifier so maybe it's normal for it to sound like a loud fan, but the image on the product description saying it's as quiet as a library is completely misleading. Again, I have this placed in a basement, but if everything is quiet on the main level, I can hear this thing running downstairs.

I typically run it twice a day. I will put it in a back hallway and run it and as the humidity drops it pulls it from the rest of the house and buy osmosis, lowers it across my house! If I have it in a room, like a bedroom and run it yes, it does increase the temperature but once I turn it off then the temperature levels out and I have less humidity so I’m more comfortable. I’ve had zero problems with it. I love that you can set a timer or a percentage of humidity that you want it to run out. Sometimes if I go to bed, I feel that’s a little humid. I will run it on a timer for an hour and a half And I then I’m comfortably sleeping. The noise is like a high fan noise which is why I have it in the back hallway.

Meghan McD,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2022","Updated Review (August 2022): The dehumidifier has not leaked since that first day and works well. This newer Frigidaire is not as effective and not as hardy as my old Frigidaire... but it's more quiet. I live in a one bedroom apartment, so not having to listen to how loud my old one was is making it ok that this fills up twice as slow, despite it being same cost and same size as my old one. So, I'm happy with it and am keeping it. :) I ended up giving it 3 stars but it really deserves almost 4... it's honestly probably still be4tter than a lot of dehumidifiers out there, just the decline in quality, how the bucket swings to and fro and feels like I would smash it if I accidentally tripped, compared to my hardy old Frigidare one, but it still costing over $200 is why I'm just giving it the 3.

Original Review (July 2022): I had my last Frigidaire dehumidifier for 4 years before giving it to my parents and buying myself a new one. I’ve had it plugged in about 8 hours and it’s left just as much water on the floor as it has collected in the bucket. The bucket doesn’t seem to be leaking, and neither is the drain outlet. This was HEAVY to drag from my landlady’s house up to my back house. lol. I’m so bummed I have to return it.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Little investigation, it is cutting off as a safety precaution. The compressor is reaching its max pressure and then tripping and releasing the excess pressure.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2022","After a few weeks, the unit is working great.

After substantial effort, I was finally able to connect with a customer support person. In the end, they said the feature is not available. it's in development, but there is no timetable. Great. I suspect it will never be available, because if you carefully read the product description, it never specifically says this feature is available. The app allows you to check on the unit remotely, change the settings, and see if the bucket is full. Presumably the push notifications it does send are for some sort of malfunction or error message.

And One,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2022","This was a new replacement for a prior unit that generated the dreaded EC code.

I have a medium size basement, and I keep two units running 24 hours a day to keep the humidity at a decent level (45%).

As I have 2 units, the sensor once the humidity level reaches above my defined setting, both should kick on. Unfortunately the unit I received the sensor's displayed setting was different hence the unit would not kick on at the same time as my existing unit.

I returned the unit and Amazon happily replaced it. Replacement works as expected.

The unit I replaced, Frigidaire replaced as a warranty replacement. (yes I have 3 running.)

My concern is that I'm on my 6th dehumidifier from Frigidaire.

Works like a charm for 1st year.
Then I'm either replacing via warranty or buying another.

To their credit, frigidaire is very good in replacing the appliance within the warranty period.

I'm using it in a small bathroom and run it during and after shower. The 50 pint was able to keep mirror/window from fogging up completely and this 22 pint wasn't able to do so. In addition the fan is on the side as opposed to on the top of the unit, which makes it feel like it's hard to circulate air properly this way, but may depend on your layout. Maybe it's because the fan is not as powerful as the 50 pint but if you like running the fan on without much noise then this is for you.

Chad,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2022","I was torn between this unit and the GE 50 pint so I compared them in real time. The GE collected more water in the same room on nonstop mode, and more water when they were both set at 45%.

Although the Frigidaire moves more air (CFM) it fails to do the most important thing -- collect more water.

Also, the Frigidaire was louder than the GE.

I think the reason why the Frigidaire seems to have more reviews and lands atop the ranking by these websites is simply because it is better looking than the GE to most.

I quit using the built-in pump, however, because it takes a long time to empty the unit and while the pump is running, the dehumidifier outputs 60% humidity back into the room for several minutes. So after getting the room down to 47-50% (according to a separate hygrometer), when the pump runs the room will increase in humidity back to 54-55%. Might not be a big deal for some, but I purchased this to help with our pianos tuning stability and am really trying to maintain a constant humidity in the room.

It is getting a bit noisier so we've moved it out of the bedroom and into the bathroom. My only complaint is that the air that comes out of it is about 78-80 degrees F. It was starting to warm the bedroom in an uncomfortable way. However, the bathroom being a little warmer is very nice on cool spring mornings. I would say it'll work great for us for another 2 years. I think in a basement or attic it would work great for a long time. We have a small apartment and you can hear this thing in any room. It's a dull roaring white noise sound. Similar to a bathroom fan. I usually shut it off at night because it did keepe up on occasion. I do think it started getting louder after 2 years. These are a necessity in central Texas in the summer.

If you're looking for something for the bedroom I'd suggest a smaller quieter unit you keep closer to your person to reduce humidity in a room.

I can't comment on longevity of the new model since I only just got it, but I would note that it is different from the old one. I think it is a bit noisier. It is also more compact- specifically in height. The only major difference is the vent. Unlike the older model that is pictured in the item description, this one does not have a vent and handle on top. The handle is gone and the vent is now on the side, which is both a good and a bad thing. It needs more space around the machine to make sure it can vent properly which means I can't put it back in the same place as the old one. But, it also means that dust isn't falling into the vent when the machine is off or in sleep mode, which is a huge plus for me since the reason I have it in the first place is due to a major dust allergy.",4.0 out of 5 stars

florida1,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2020","I bought these mainly for the wifi, since they had much less expensive models with similar features available. I bought 3 of these units to start, with hopes to perhaps buy at least 1 more. My first recommendation is to watch the connect to wifi video since you have to connect to the humidifier as if it was a wifi network, in order to connect. This is not intuitive, but even after doing this, it took multiple times before my unit would connect anyhow. Once connected, the app tells you that you have to register the unit, so I entered all my data and it kept giving me the same error message. (ECP0108, please check your information for accuracy). I tried many different ways to enter my information, but ALL gave me the same error message. (if you look on iTunes, it seems many people get the same error message), and I do wish I had read the app ratings before purchasing, since it has a 1.4 out of 5 star rating. I called their support Friday and after long holds and 20 minutes of discussion, was told I needed a different department. I was transferred and left a voice mail (and today, I was told by many, that they don’t even have a voicemail system). In any event, after wasting many more hours today and one email response with some suggestions which did not work.....I still have an app that is nonfunctional, since it says my unit it not registered. I was told they have sent a ticket to the IT department, who does not take calls, and someone will hopefully get back to me in a few more days. Dehumidifier so far, gets 4 stars, wifi gets 0 stars, customer service 1 star

Addendum: After much persistence on my part, I finally got to speak with IT, and they did release an app update that fixed some of the bugs. It took over a month, and they still need to optimize and fix further, but I do now have all 3 units hooked up and can control via iPhone or iPad app.

Just another comment, like any web based control, after a power outage or reboot of my router, only 2 of the 3 dehumidifiers connected back automatically back to the apps, so had I not been home, had been away on a trip, or whatever, I would NOT have been able to get it working. Turning the unit off and on, or trying to reconnect via the apps did nothing and the only thing that worked was unplugging the unit and plugging it back in. I will have to see over time how often this happens and if so, whether it is always the same unit that has trouble reestablishing a connection.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Paul,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","Updated 7/1/2023 - a couple weeks after the first review. Updated the app and it reconnects after returning home now . And the Alexa app is not powering the dehumidifier off. The skill is still strange, but it's no longer causing problems. Adding another star.

First review:
If you just consider this unconnected (no app, no Alexa) the dehumidifier works great. Quitter than older model. But the connected features are terrible.

The Alexa skill is strange - there is one slider labeled Humidity and one labeled Percentage. I assume onw of these the preferred humidity which I can set using the panel on the device. Why are there 2 sliders in Alexa skill? What do they do? Not explained. And after enabling this skill, the dehumidifier turns off. I disabled the skill.

The iPhone app works but needs hand-holding. Whenever I leave he house, I loose WiFi access and the app disconnects. This is expected. When I reconnect to Wifi, the app tells me there's a WiFi problem and I should check the router. This is a bug. The app should reconnect first. If I force the app the stop (using the iPhone App Switcher). Then start the app, all works fine. I have dozens of ""smart"" devices are all others handle leaving and returning to WiFi range fine.

Without the connected features, I'd give this 5 stars. But since I paid $100 extra for model with WiFi, I give this 3 stars. I hope the software is fixed and I can change my rating.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Kim,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2023","I share a house with my sister, I live down in the basement and we had a big storm that dumped a lot of water and well of course the sump pump went out causing flooding in my sanctuary. After the clean up I was dealing with 86% humidity, I bought this right afterwards and it was the best purchase. This is an older home and the basement only has a few outlets so I bought an air conditioning extension cord and I have had no problems. It is pretty heavy so getting it out of the box by myself was a slight struggle but other then that it is easy to move from room to room with the wheels. I use the bucket option and there is a handle which helps you carry it to the sink or toilet. as stated in the description it does hold 50 pints or about 6 gallons of water. I will say sometimes when removing the bucket water does dribble down from the machine, I shut it down leave alone for a few mins then dump the bucket I think this allows whatever moisture is still in the machine to go down. Noise level its not super loud but there is still puts off a air conditioning type sound, where you need to turn the TV or speakers up to drown it out, but its not annoying and I have slept through it with no issues.

AverageJoe,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2023","This dehumidifier did an amazing job at clearing moisture from spaces. Its noise level wasn't too bothersome. Ease of setup and operation made it enjoyable to work with. However, it ultimately had to go back for one reason and that is something that plagues any product like this. The amount of heat it puts out to do its job offsets the value it provides. Keep this away from where you regularly sit and relax.

Better yet talk to your HVAC repairman about putting a permanent setup into your primary duct work. They make units that will install directly above your coils and condition the air moisture as its leaving the main duct. That setup just requires you to do a season knob adjustment between winter and summer to change desired humidity levels.

Bottom line: If you're going to buy this and use it, keep it installed in your basement near the intake for your HVAC cold-air returns. At least that way it will condition the air your HVAC is cycling back out into the house. If you put this in a regular living space it will heat up that space.",4.0 out of 5 stars
kat,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2022","We purchased this unit because of good reviews from testing sites. We run a dehumidifier non stop in our RV in a coastal area with a lot of rain. Our first was a Keystone which worked great for 6 years, then started leaving water on the floor. Since it was not ranked as high we chose the Frigidaire.
First the Frigidaire doesn't have carry handles on the sides. We move it in and out of the RV or people moving it downstairs will find it slick to hold on. These are fairly big and heavy.
It has a hose attachment at the back. It warns to make sure it is tightly closed when not using a hose but we didn't. Water on the floor, but once tightly closed it is fine.
This unit does not pump warm air into the room as our other one did. Having warm air was nice in the RV but not needed in our house. This frigidaire fan pumps a lot of air but it is cool.
The air must be able to reach the back in order to take out the moisture. We always left our old one next to the cabinet to save on space, but noticed this one was not taking out the same amount of water overnight. It had to come out 12 inches into the room to work better.

This is a newer version of that same unit and so far so good but we haven't had it too long yet, so fingers crossed.

What I like about both the older and newer model is that the drier air blows out the top of the unit, giving better air circulation and keeping the moisture off the mirror, window and walls. Another nice feature is the timer function. You can simply press the timer to have it go off in 30 , 60 etc. min after you're done showering.

This model is harder to empty, there's really no smooth way to empty the container without splashing or dripping. They also moved the controls behind the fan vent so you have to reach across the air flow to press the buttons. not a big deal, just liked it better the old way.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2021","While after a few hours, I managed to get the float device attached in the water collection bin, the biggest barrier was the plastic cover on the bin itself. It looks like it can be removed but I was afraid to force it out of fear of breaking or cracking it. If the float comes loose again I'm afraid of the hoops I have to jump through to reconnect it. If anyone has been able to remove this seemingly useless plastic covering please let me know. I will revise this review after I have had the opportunity to test its efficiency and the pump function. I have found customer service to be horrible and unresponsive.

Update July 22: I discovered from reading all customer questions that the plastic splash cover does come off and the procedure for doing so, although I haven’t tried to remove it yet. I was also able to figure out which hose opening to use with the pump, again by reading customer responses to questions, so thank you Amazon customers! As far as customer service goes, to clarify, I rate the helpfulness from the manufacturer a zero. One Amazon customer service rep did her best to help me but we kept missing connections. When I attempted to call again, a second rep was willing to help but while she was trying to contact the manufacturer while I waited on the line, a different rep picked the phone up which meant I would have to go through my whole spiel again. By this time I was so fed up I decided to forget the whole thing. Then I read all the customer q and a and finally got my answer.

It is easy to operate and dump the water (there is a pump but I don't use it). The one major difference with this unit is it seems to always be running.

Steven,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2021","I'm surprised how well this unit removes humidity from the air. Happy with the dehumidification performance. The unit is OK loud, it's about 47db on low but it's just fan noise mostly. The compressor is not overly loud. I wouldn't want to sleep next to it, but it does well in a large basement or room.

Some of the setting can only be access via the app, so make sure you setup the Wi-Fi and use the app. You can't control the ionizer, the blue indicator light, and the child lock without the app. That's dumb and I wish they put buttons on the unit for all the functions. The app works well once you get it setup, it can even turn on and off the dehumidifier besides changing all settings.

One issue I did have was being able to connect to my Wi-Fi. I'm not sure why but the unit did not like my Wi-Fi router, it took so many tries to connect. I had to try over 20 times before it finally worked. For some reason this only happens with some Wi-Fi Routers, it would hang up with the error message no IP assigned. When I tried a different router it worked so I just keep trying over and over again with my original router till it worked.

Also the handle to move the unit around is nice, this thing is heavy at 50lbs, you don't want a crappy handle with a 50lb dehumidifier.

When I first got it set up there was a *huge* improvement in the humidity level vs the old, cheap dehumidifier. It's run in a basement that now has a lot of aqauriums in it, so especially in the summer there's a lot of humidity to deal with.

It would be nice if the noise level was a bit lower, but it's not terrible and more often runs at a quieter volume. Only had a minor issue with rattling/excessive noise compared to it's normal max volume, but just repositioning it a tiny bit fixed the issue.

Only major disappointment is the wifi app, it's really not worth the extra money compared to the equivalent of this brand without. So if that's something you're debating like I initially had, just go eith the other one.

Mr Toad,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2023","The good:
It does what it's supposed to do: take moisture out of the air. We're getting more water than I expected, and faster.
It works at a lower temperature than many other models. We use this in a vacation cabin. We turn the heat way down when we're not there, but this still works.

The bad:
The description implies that this thing is as quiet as a library. Ummmm... NO. It's a dehumidifier. Dehumidifiers are loud. It's mostly fan noise and compressor hum, which can start to blend into the background.
The beeps are really loud and annoying. Every time you press a button, it beeps. When the bucket is full, it beeps. Eight times. And whether or not it's the middle of the night. When you remove the bucket to empty it, it beeps. Eight times. Even if the machine is turned off. Why?",4.0 out of 5 stars

Paul11,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2021","Its a great unit, digital control and Humidistat are accurate. Set it in the basement- this is in a 750sq ft area with some dirt crawl space and it was soping wet when I unpacked it because the old unit locked up and it took a week to get this one. Had water pooling on the floor soaking the concrete for a week. Set at 55% it ran for 2 days and slowly saw things dry out. After it got to the set point kept the humidity +/- about 2 %. Checked using a digital gauge I compared to a wet bulb. This seems like the correct size for my basement that I would call above average dampness in the summertime.
Only thing I DONT like about all these new units is the water drain. The vertical units suck. They blow the air straight up and the drain is finicky. Make sure it isn't tilted away from the drain connection and use a short hose , no kinks, pitched towards the floor drain if your not using the supplied bucket and it works fine.

Deborah J McConnell,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2021","Anyone who has a consistent need for a dehumidifier knows that it is pretty hit or miss with reliability. I have had several dehumidifiers fail within the first year of use, even with proper maintenance. I bought this product because it was rated highly for reliability. I've had it for several months now and it worked fine....until it didn't. I'm now calling in a warranty claim. I will say that we weren't consistent with the maintenance (as stated in the manual which is to basically clean it every couple of weeks), however we did maintain it pretty well. I like this dehumidifier because it has a large bucket & it's in a place where I can't use the tube to constantly drain it. I would say that if you buy this product (or any other dehumidifier), purchase the optional service agreement that goes with it. Dehumidifiers are notorious for breaking down, no matter how good they are.

AJ,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2023","First dehumidifier I've used. I've learned a thing or two about them since.

It worked well to dehumidify the space that we needed dehumidified, however at the cost of making that space hotter. I don't know of any dehumidifier that also cools the air (other than A/C units that have a ""dry"" feature), but being that it's currently a super hot summer, the last thing that I wanted was for the space to get hotter and fight against the HVAC.

BVV,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2023","This dehumidifier is substantially quieter than GE’s similar 22 pint model, which I had tried first but found too loud, and the Frigidaire one has a more pleasant compressor noise by far. I can stand to be in the same room as it for quite a while when the fan is set on low. It can kick into a higher gear from time to time even with the fan set on low, which makes it louder for a period of time, but usually that is pretty brief.

It is slightly less energy efficient than the GE model from what I can tell on our energy bill, but not by much. It works well at removing moisture from the air, and has a good array of features including auto-shut-off. I would recommend it if you are looking for a small dehumidifier.",4.0 out of 5 stars

jmhr,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2021","It seems to throw a lot of heat but that may be typical of all dehumidifiers.

This one dries the basement area very well and doesn't make much noise.

It does throw a lot of heat which we can feel on the kitchen floor above where it's sitting. We have it suspended about 4 feet off the floor over the slop sink so there isn't as much space for the heat to disperse. Even so, that's a lot of energy.

Easy set up. I wish the display were on the front rather than on the top, but that's only because our unconventional installation places it so high.

I realize these are probably made in China by the same factories that churn out the no name brands but we went with a familiar brand.

The last one worked very well until it wore out - these things used to last decades - after about 3 years, but out of warranty. It got very loud and hotter than usual. So now it's in a dump where it will take half an eon to decompose and we have a new one.",4.0 out of 5 stars

But dehumidifiers don't gush, they trickle, so a thin clear tube is fine. If you want to drill a hole through your garage wall, you don't want it as big as a garden hose.

If the bucket fills to its capacity, it's a challenge to remove it from the unit without some water spilling.

Howie and/or Cyndy,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2023","I recently purchased the this dehumidifier, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. This incredible appliance has been a game-changer for maintaining a comfortable environment in my home, particularly on the upstairs level. It does kick out some heat and I learned quickly to run it only on the low fan speed.

One of the standout features of this dehumidifier is its exceptional ability to reduce humidity levels effectively. Prior to using this device, my upstairs level was plagued with excessive moisture, even though the space was air-conditioned. No matter what I tried, I could never get the humidity level below 60. However, since incorporating this dehumidifier into my home, I have witnessed a remarkable transformation. For the first time ever, the humidity level on my upstairs level has dropped to an impressive 40. It is truly amazing!

One of the reasons I opted for this particular dehumidifier was its convenience and ease of use. While it does come with a pump, I personally have not utilized it. Instead, I have been emptying the tank twice a day. The tank is user-friendly and straightforward to remove and empty. It's a minor inconvenience in exchange for the fantastic results I have experienced.

In terms of performance, this dehumidifier has been flawless. It operates quietly, allowing me to enjoy a peaceful and undisturbed living environment. Additionally, the energy efficiency of this device is worth mentioning. It runs smoothly without consuming excessive energy, which is not only beneficial for the environment but also helps keep my electricity bills in check.

Considering the outstanding performance and the significant improvement in humidity levels, I can't help but regret not purchasing this dehumidifier sooner. It has undoubtedly made a positive impact on the overall comfort and quality of life in my home. The difference in air quality is noticeable, and I no longer have to worry about the negative effects of excess moisture, such as mold and musty odors.

In conclusion, I highly recommend this dehumidifier to anyone struggling with high humidity levels in their home. It is an incredibly effective and reliable appliance that has tackled the excess moisture in my home like a champ. With its outstanding performance, ease of use, and energy efficiency, this dehumidifier has become an invaluable addition to my household. Don't make the same mistake I did by waiting—invest in this dehumidifier and experience the comfort and peace of mind it brings.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Randall W. Rasner,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2023","Honest review of Frigidaire FFAD5033W1 Dehumidifier, High Humidity 50 Pint Capacity with a Easy-to-Clean Washable Filter and Custom Humidity Control for maximized comfort, in White

I ordered this to replace one of another brand that failed to consistently drain via the hose into a sump well. This one had great reviews and a dependable name brand. I am using it in a damp basement that I do not frequent, so the continuous drainage option was a must for me.

Likes:
Very easy to set up and get to dehumidifying; it was basically plug and play, if you will.
Easy to learn controls; very self-intuitive.
Easy-to-Clean washable filter
Automatic shut off when the bucket is full if you use the bucket drain option. Plus, it shuts off when reaching the targeted humidity level
Front loading bucket with carrying handle and splash guard. I have not used the bucket, but it is easily removed and replaced. Plus, it has a red float to show the tank’s water level and can easily be seen on the front of the unit
The casters roll easily and in any direction
It has a pull-up carrying handle, which functions well and is not difficult to raise or lower
The cord is sufficiently long
Humidity control (but only in increments of 5%)
3-speed fan
I did not think that it was overly loud (my video has my phone very close to the unit)
Continuous drainage option (hose NOT included) that uses a standard garden hose or washing machine hose to easily screw onto the port in back of the unit
The continuous drainage has worked very well. I have the unit sitting on concrete blocks to ensure it is elevated above the required level to properly drain
It has a 50-pint air flow capacity, which is higher than many at this price range
Frigidaire is a brand I know and trust
1 year manufacturer’s warranty (I brought the additional 4 year warranty because I don’t have good luck with electronics and just over $10 per year is not too bad)

Dislikes:
There was not a drainage hose included (I bought a cheap and short garden hose to use)

Meh:
If it allowed 1% incremental humidity settings, that would be great, but it’s not a deal breaker to me
It is heavy (44 LBS) so it’s good that it’s on casters, but moving it up and down stairs is a chore

Hopefully this honest review helps someone decide about this product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
DECEMBER,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2023","I live near Portland, OR, and the humidity is always around 75-85% in my apartment. I also have an indoor vegetable garden, which adds to the already high humidity of the area. I was getting mildew on the windows and window sills.
I have 3 guitars and 3 basses, 4 amps, and lots of other electronics, recording gear, and a computer. My guitars kept developing fret buzz. I'd level the frets and adjust them, get rid of the buzz, then it would come back in a few months. It took me too long to learn that constant exposure to humidity levels like this were destroying the instruments. Gave up on these ruined cheapish guitars and bought one nice expensive guitar.
But I got this dehumidifier first. Not gonna let this one get ruined by humidity. It works well, keeps the humidity down to 45%, in the living room of a 1,050 sq ft 2 bedroom apartment. The bucket fills up within 36 hours, usually (about 2 gallons). I use it to water the garden.
It turns off when it hits the target humidity, and back on as needed. I had a different dehumidifier first which kept the fan running constantly, even when the dehumidifier was disengaged. And it kept freezing up, grill covered in ice, so I returned it. This one has been running for 3 months now, no ice, no problems, and no noticeable impact to the electric bill.
It is a tad loud, but not an irritating abrasive sound. The sound doesn't bother me at all, but when I watch TV I like to keep the volume as low as possible, so I have to turn the dehumidifier off. To hear the TV with the dehumidifier on, I have to put it louder than I like, but not any louder than most people I know have their TVs set normally.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Julez,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2024","This is a 50 pint Frigidedaire (Electrolux) dehumidifier. It does what it's supposed to do. It's new so I can't say much about its longevity, but overall, nearly any brand dehumidifier I've had in the last 15-20 years has been about the same and seems to die after a number of years. One feature that isn't promoted much on the website is that it does have a built-in air ionizer. So you have a little added bonus there.

The second part of this review has to do with something that I'm generally not thrilled with in most appliances and that's the available wifi and associated application for the device. Usually, these apps are trash and the wifi barely works. I thought, well maybe at a minimum it can at least part time tell me if the bucket is full, the cost wasn't much more, so might as well.

I'm so glad I went with the wifi option. Frigidaire created a clean and well built app. I'm actually impressed. I've added screenshots of the app.
It will direct you to the site you need to register the appliance with for warranty/recall purposes.
Shows you current humidity and humidity over time via graph.
You can toggle it on/off.
You can set a child lock so no one can play with the buttons.
There's a task scheduler for it and other appliances that are registered with it.
Nearly all control can be done from the app.
Push notifications.
And has all the associated personal assistant options.
I'm impressed with this, and I generally don't impress easily when it comes to IoT or appliance apps and their implementations.

However, this is still an IoT device and absolutely should NOT go on your internal network. It belongs on a guest or isolated network like every other IoT device you own. Nest, Ecobee, Kidde, Echo, Ring, Eufy, Phillips, any appliance manufacturer, etc... should always be isolated away from your computers, laptops, phones, printers, network storage, etc... devices.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Hunter Holmes,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2023","Energy efficiency , similar to wattage, can be misleading. This Frigidaire tested at full and continuous mode, used a little more energy than most of it's competitors. However it was found when used at a more typical setting, maybe 45%, rather than continuous. This machine now used less energy then it's competitors. As far as removing water, it's the best, I researched a lot. I have a Black and decker, same price range, it's lousy compared to this. These machines change almost every year, appearance, or cheapness or improvements. Ex: about 6 years ago, I had the same model Frigidaire and it was best back then, except one thing the water tank was just too small, Well guess what, now this Frigidaire has the biggest water tank of all of them. Also the hot air is less hot then they used to be, it's quieter than it used to be, by a considerable amount, more of a wind sound than a compressor motor sound. I think they actually found a better method, to quiet the compressor ( I'm not positive?) Anyway, it's a great unit. I would even go as far as to call it the industry standard. It removes a lot more water and at a quicker rate. It was the best 6 years ago,( at removing water) and it's a lot better now, all around. Except one drawback, the side slits that can be used for handles are not there, so it's a little harder to pick up, but the wheels are made well. You need not waste time looking further this is the best unit in it's price range, and like I said in the beginning, the energy used on all these products is only measured from one perspective, and perhaps it's not the best perspective. At typical settings this machine is more efficient than its competitors, except when it's measured at full throttle CONTINUOUS mode. And even then, it didn't score a lot less. I did get a lot of this information from, ( I can't remember,) but I also own this unit and have compared for myself.) I believe the competitors will be trying to copy, what Frigidaire has done here. At this price, I would call this product the industry standard! Look no further! Hunter Holmes -- Addendum -- I missed this at first. This unit has a handle that is sort of hidden. A recessed black plastic carrying handle that pulls out from the top of the unit with a 2 inch clearance and it's about 8 inches long. In this price range THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE INDUSTRY STANDARD! HUNTER HOLMES - ADDENDUM #2 - It's been about 3 months, and I still can't believe how quiet this machine is compared to, what was the same unit by FRIGIDAIRE 6 years ago, this current 2023 unit, I mostly hear fan and very little compressor refridgerator noise, the attenuated sound puzzles me in a great way.

Cory S. Estes,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024","We've had another dehumidifier for many years. It seemed to work fine and did what it was supposed to do in our basement but wasn't quiet and we noticed increases in electric consumption during the seasons ti was in use. One day a service technician was in inspecting a water control system in our basement. He looked at the old dehumidifier, said, ""Hmmm..."", pulled out his phone and looked up a recall article for that particular model. It seems it had been recalled by the company as a potential fire hazard. He sent me a link for the article and recommended we stop using it; he had the same model in his home. After reading through the recall I contacted the company as directed and was instructed to ""get on a list until it was determined how the recall was going to be handled."" At that point we decided it was time to buy a replacement!

We did lots of research and felt this was the brand and model to get. Low and behold there was even one available via Amazon Warehouse that was new-in-box but the top of the box was slightly damaged. Sold! It arrived in good time, was in the original box, and works perfectly.

We're very happy with it. It is much quieter, efficient, and though we haven't noticed the effect on the electric bill yet, it seems like it'll have to be an improvement because it's running for shorter time. We're happy with it and have recommended it to friends and family.",5.0 out of 5 stars

jewno,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2022","After reading many reviews ranging from 1 to 5 stars, I was scared to purchase this product, but I have to say, I'm not disappointed.

Let's start with why I purchased it - I needed to bring down the humidity in my west Texas home (~1,730 sqft). The humidity in my house with refrigerated air was between 55 (downstairs) and 65% (upstairs). After receiving the dehumidifier, I placed it upstairs in my loft, which overlooks most of my downstairs.

PERFORMANCE (5 STARS): I ran the dehumidifier on its continuous setting for about 3-4 days, and I didn't see any immediate results. The humidity in my house was the same, but it was removing moisture from the air - about 12 gallons a day. I was on the verge of returning the product, but on day 4 or 5, the humidity levels began to drop dramatically. After about a week of running, they are down to about 30% (downstairs) and 43% (upstairs), ±2%.

TEMPERATURE: I read some reviews about the air from the exhaust being hotter than the current air temperature - this is true on occasion. I felt that the air leaving the machine was a little warmer than the surrounding temperature; however, it wasn't anything significant. Other times, there was hardly any noticeable difference in the air temperature from the exhaust and the surrounding air temperature.

PLACEMENT: I read in the instructions that this unit should be placed at least 12 inches from the wall on any side. After looking at the unit, the air intake is on the rear (which looks like a design flaw). I feel this could have been better placed on the sides or front (but hey, I'm not an engineer). I wasn't going to put this in the middle of the room, so I simply turned the unit around and put the front of it against the wall, so the rear (where the air intake is) was facing outward. The only inconvenient part of this was that the water reservoir was only accessible from the front. This means you cannot see the water level or empty it without turning it around. This minor inconvenience takes seconds to do and needs to be done once a day (twice max). Even though you can't see the water level, the unit will automatically turn off once it is full.

NOISE (4 STARS): While quieter than others (from what I've read), this unit is still a bit noisy. I didn't conduct a decibel test, but it sounds like a large floor fan when on high.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Steve Cramer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2021","I was a bit concerned because it looked like a mix of reviews, but I found the unit worked incredibly well (in fact, I ended up turning it to 55% because at 45% I felt the moisture pulling out of my body when I walked in the garage. TOO dry!

The unit seems quiet to me, certainly not loud, but I do keep the fan on medium, not high. It's in my garage. I can't imagine being bothered by the sounds. It is more like a very small window A/C unit, not even that noisy.

(I had been using 'Dampits' and the bag took a month to fill, so I figured I really didn't have a humidity problem. But I noticed some mildew smells from some old cases I put in the garage, and when I saw some white mold on a sheet of plywood, I knew something was wrong. I turned on this unit, sprayed the plywood and cases with a mold disinfectant, wiped with paper towels, and the next day everything was bone dry, no trace of mold or mildew, and the plywood even turn lighter and flattened out. The tank had over a gallon of water in it. ONE night! So much for the Dampits.

I kept things at 45% for a few days, went over everything in the garage with mold remover spray, etc., and I could tell that everything was getting dried out nicely. I had a bunch of cardboard boxes stored in there and you could feel that mushy-sogginess that was then light and crisp and felt new.

Yes, this works extremely well. As I said, I found that 55% was a better setting for ongoing use, and the medium fan setting.

I still haven't set up the hose for automatic emptying, but now I only have to empty every other day, sometimes every 3rd day, depending on the outside humidity. At some point I will establish a permanent place for the unit and run the hose through the wall. I expect that the unit probably won't turn on much in the fall and winter months, mainly need this for late spring and summer, early fall.

(Btw, it is gravity feed for the hose, but the connection is in the middle of the back of the unit, so there is some height that allows me to put the hole through the wall above the 8"" concrete block height on top of my slab that my walls rise from.)

There is a filter that you will be reminded to clean, but I really haven't noticed it getting dirty. But my garage is quite new, so maybe it will get dirtier in other situation. Regardless, it washes out quite easily.",5.0 out of 5 stars
AJ,"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2023","Arrived on time and positioned upright as product box says (to keep oil in sealed compressor upright). After unboxing, it looked even better than pictures. Nice white glossy look and was easy to setup. Instructions inside, including App instructions if you plan to use Wifi feature
Download the Fridgidaire app first to make it super easy to setup (but app not require to run unit). The Frigidaire app provided video for setup and was easy to setup via app guided steps. Plug in unit and press power button prior to setting up Wifi. I'm glad I went with well known brand. You can see how professionally done to design product. Fan noise level was low. Nice smooth sounding fan with multiple speeds. Buyer beware: I bought and immediately returned different dehumififier named Domdre (sold by Domdre Star on Amazon) because I paid for 50 pint and they sent 22 pint (both look same but 50 is slightly larger. It looked like picture but seemed small for a 50 pint unit. I recalled a comment saying a man ordered 50 pint but got 22 pint, so I started checking model, dimensions, etc. They don't put pint identification on Domdre product box like Fridgidaire does to show total pints of unit. Model number on amazon listing didn't match either their 22 or 50 pint. So beware of that likely scam or just incompetence. I could see many getting scammed because they don't check to confirm they got what they ordered. So go with ""sold by Amazon"" to get Fridgidaire that unsures well designed and supported product. Btw, warranty final step using app didn't work. I got an error notification in app about app failure to communicate warranty to Fridgidaire. Day later, notification is gone.

S. Colley,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2023","I LOVE this dehumidifier. Everything about it exudes good design and quality.

It has straight forward, easy to use and understand controls. It has a convenient, hide-away handle for moving it up/down stairs. The front even has a nice red line that moves up and down with the level of the water in the reservoir, which also has a convenient carrying handle. And best of all - for me - is that it has a pump that can push the water through a small hose (which is supplied) to a higher draining location. I use mine in a cellar, and the drain is much higher than the floor, so and drain water has to go ""up hill"", as it were, and this unit does it easily. From the manual it's clear that one use case the maker envisioned was using the unit in a cellar or basement, and pumping water up to and out a ground level window.

While I can't provide an objective measure of such, it appears to rip humidity out of the air very quickly. If there is any downside at all, is that it is not silent. It's not loud per se, but it is audible. From five feet away, with the fan at the highest speed, it's just below 58 decibels, or a bit more quiet than a normal conversation.

B. Hamlin,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2023","It was recommended to me that a dehumidifier would be helpful in getting the ""old house"" smell out of our new property. I had used them before but didn't think this would be enough to be helpful with the overall smell. It was less than a week when we started to notice that the musty smell was going away.

The ""setup"" if you can call it that was incredibly easy. I took it out of the box and plugged it in. That was it. I ran a hose from the back of the unit to my sump and I was done. With that said, i read the instructions thoroughly to ensure I was doing as i should.

I will say this is pretty loud. We cannot hear it in the basement but you do hear it when you are down there. It doesn't drown out conversation but it is noticeable. The functions at the top are a breeze. You will need to ""reset"" it once in a while so that it can cycle through a clean out but really thats it.

This is an effective and user friendly unit. I am really pleased that this was the solution to our issue. You are able to see it working by seeing the reservoir fill or the water coming from the hose.

I'm very happy with this.",5.0 out of 5 stars
WK,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2023","I previously bought another dehumidifier because I didn't want to spend the money for a Frigidaire even though we had two Frigidaire dehumidifiers and they lasted 20 years (one recently stopped working). I made a huge mistake! The other model took a day and a half to fill the tank. I ended up returning the other one and broke down and spent the money for the Frigidaire. It's just as amazing as our 20-year-old dehumidifier with keeping our basement dry only better. Now they come with a pump option to have it drain into your wash basin (the hose is super long!) or wherever you what it to or you can use the garden hose option or empty the tank manually (for an average basement you would need to empty it twice). I have been using the pump option and it is unbelievable! You get what you pay for! In this case, it is well worth spending the money for peace of mind!!
The only con I have is that it doesn't have the added handle in the front of the tank to lift the bucket if you go with manually emptying it. Our old one has that. Not that we use it now, but it would be good for people who need to empty it manually. Makes it easier to pull out the bucket. The other issue some might find troublesome, it is not quiet. But is prefect for a basement.

Dave Shepherd,"Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2022","I play the double bass. I keep my two basses in a basement-level bedroom with the door closed. It's important to me that the temperature and humidity stay pretty steady. I aim for around 50% relative humidity.

This dehumidifier does an excellent job of controlling the relative humidity level in my bass room right around 50%. No matter what the humidity is in the rest of the house, with the door closed, my bass room stays between about 49% and 54% all the time.

The unit is quiet on the lowest setting. However, I do turn it off when I am actually practicing the bass. (The white noise level is just loud enough that I have a bit of trouble hearing fine details of the sound when it's running.)

One thing to be aware of is this: the unit does produce some heat. I have had to get used to practicing with the room temperature between about 79 and 81 degrees Fahrenheit (26-27 Celsius). It's not a problem for my basses, since the temperature is very steady. I hope that during the winter months that room temperature settles in closer to about 21-23 Celsius. It's not a problem as long as the temperature does not shift suddenly; and it doesn't with this unit.

[EDIT, October 14, 2022: Now that the outdoor temperatures are generally below 70F / 21C, I do not notice the unit heating up the room at all. It is still pulling moisture out of the air; I have to empty the bucket every couple of days or so.]

I am glad I bought the dehumidifier, and I'd buy another one in the future.

William H.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2023","So far I've experimented between running it on the ""continuous"" setting & running it to maintain a 50% RH level using all 3 fan settings. In all cases it uses approx. 280W. The power consumption is so close with every trial I'm probably just going to set it to 50% & leave it (even changing the fan speed has almost no effect on power consumption). At 50%, it hasn't shut down yet but I'm hoping as the seasons change the outdoor humidity will decrease & it will not need to run full time. It will reach 50% or about (the display increments in 5% intervals), just not low enough to quit running.

At this point I love it but wish I'd bought the next larger size. I would try to exchange this one if I could but don't feel right sending it back since there's nothing wrong with it. I live in the southeast where its very humid much of the year & should have gotten this long ago. It seems well built & isn't so noisy that it bothers me. The ""full tank"" alarm isn't overly loud & if you don't hear it go off it doesn't sound again but you can tell since the unit stops running so there's no fan noise. The tank is very easy to remove, empty & reinstall.

Lilithe,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2022","My husband and I recently bought a new house that happened to be built in the 1940's. Lots of things were done differently back then and some things were not invented or commonly used yet, such as a vapor barrier for the foundation. As a result the partially finished basement felt gross. Despite being the coldest place in the house, the way your skin would almost feel wet just walking down there made it uninhabitable. I had never had a dehumidifier, but I thought this must be what they are for and did a ton of research to land on this model. The rooms in nearly the whole basement felt completely different after even a day and after a few days it was completely comfortable to hang out in. I was planning on using the basement for my office and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to use it, but this Dehumidifier not only fixed the office itself but even the larger den area outside the room.

Pros:
- Pulls an unimaginable amount of moisture out of the air, it honestly astonishes me how much water ends up in the bucket.
- Works for a surprisingly large amount of space (Nearly the entire basement for me)
- Design looks pleasing to the eye
- Easy UI and setup

Cons:
- Relatively loud
- Creates a lot of heat, my basement is no longer the coolest part of the house(worth it to me)
- While being able to hook up a hose is convenient, it will not drain into a utility sink. I am fairly sure it just isn't able to force it up the hose and just uses gravity. If you have a floor drain for it to go into this would not be a problem though.

All in all, I am very happy with my purchase and glad it solved my problem so quickly!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Muttley,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2021","I bought this unit for my basement which gets over 65% humid in summers. I first started using it with its bucket but soon enough I realized it is impossible to keep up with emptying it. So I bought a hose. Here is my first suggestion: do not buy frigidaire hose. It is horrible and leaks l. Buy a heavy duty garden hose 3/4 inch size. Then you won't have leak issues. After attaching hose you need some elevation. If you do not have any then, hose efficiency may drop. So bucket starts filling at a slower rate. Some water goes to bucket and some to hose. After a week you may get an alert that bucket is full. A small elevation prevents this issue.

It is not quiet. Especially in the hi fan setting. So put it in somewhere it would not matter much. At low and medium settings it is better.

If your aim is to dehumidify a multistorey house it will disappoint you. I think it is mostly for large but closed spaces. It can decrease my basement humidity from 67% to 52% but the effect is much less pronounced on upper floors. However when I put this unit to my really humid garage (pretty large) then it has no issues getting it down to 45% even at low setting.

What I like most about it is the app and wifi connection. It has not let me down. I could even adjust settings and turn it on/off from out of state locations which is handy. I wish it was Alexa compatible ( I guess it is not) but otherwise it is pretty reliable.

One last minor thing is that you may get false alerts about filter. Often time filter is fine so don't even bother taking it out and checking it. Just press reset button and see if it will fix the issue. If the alarm comes back, then take a look.
In summary, I am happy with the purchase. It has limitations but if you set expectations rights, you will like it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Leslie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2023","To be completely transparent I was hesitant to spend this much on a dehumidifier but I am so glad I did!

Our house is two stories with very high ceilings, and approximately 3000 square feet. It works for our entire house! I purchased humidity gauges for our downstairs master bath, kitchen, powder room, and for various rooms upstairs such as bedrooms, office, bathrooms, and our son's playroom. All the the gauges are within 1% of each other. We have the dehumidifier upstairs. Our master bathroom, which is located downstairs, the furthest away from the dehumidifier, is exactly what it says upstairs most of the time and the few times it is not, the humidity gauge is within .1-.9% range.

The dehumidifier has wheels on the bottom and is extremely easy to move to another room as we moved it several times when we first purchased to determine where we wanted to keep it permanently.

When the dehumidifier turns on and off it is very quiet. It will alert you when the tank is full by beeping a couple times and the light indicator on the top will let you know as well after the beep notification. Also, it has a water level which can be viewed quickly as you walk by the dehumidifier. The tank slides out very smoothly and the handle on the tank makes emptying it super simple.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JWB,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2023","I'm a veteran of dehumidifiers. They usually last two or three years in my walkout finished basement, even though I check and clean filters regularly. The environment is quite clean, but the humidity can reach 55% or more during certain times of the year. I usually like to set the dehumidifier to 45 or 50% and let it run, either pumping or draining the moisture to a floor drain. So far, this unit lives up to the good reviews. Even on high, the fan isn't too noisy for me. The compressor adds an almost unnoticeably low hum. I'll add that the open area I need it to cover is 800-1000 square feet and the unit is located where it wouldn't disturb anyone. If it were used in a bedroom, the medium or low fan would probably be appropriate, along with a smaller unit. I set it up on constant run for a day as directions suggested. I now have it set to 45% and am listening to it cycle on and off as it senses rises in humidity. It appears to be reasonably accurate according to the inexpensive hygrometer I have. I have a meter connected at present that indicates about 520 watts with the fan and compressor running. This is a pleasant surprise since I expected greater power consumption. At present, I would say that this unit is the best I have owned so far. If it lasts beyond two years (my last Home Lab lasted two), I'll be even happier.",5.0 out of 5 stars

No basement, single story, 2000 sq ft. 65-70% humidity in the house beforehand! We set this at 55% and I have to empty it 1-2 times a day in July and August.

First 24 hours I emptied it 4 times a day until it got the house down. So much more comfortable now as it keeps it at 55%.

Downsides is that it blows out quite a bit of heat, so the AC has to fight that as well. Also, since the water bucket is so large, I don't really trust the handle as I'm caring it over to dump the water when its full. Not an issue, just a recommendation. [When we left town for a few days, I plugged a hose to the back and had it dump into the shower drain.] Also, when it kicks on, there is a noticeable clunk, so our German Shepherd jumped up and barked to check out the situation for the first few days.

G,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023","Great dehumidifier! After reading reviews and ratings, I decided to buy this oversized capacity unit for the lower level den. This took humidity levels from 63% down to 45% in the matter of 2 hours max! The only have 2 down sides: 1) is that you can’t set this for a 24 hour cycle. When the unit is off the timer turns it on per the timer setting. When running the timer turns the unit off per the timer setting. Since I’m in the den every day not a huge deal but this is not good if set in an unoccupied location unless you run it constantly. 2) in the percentage mode the unit cycles every nine minutes no matter what the actual humidity level in the room is. It would be better if it could sense the humidity while off and only turn on when the actual humidity reaches the set level.
This unit is so efficient that I would recommend it even with the couple of issues described above. I am very pleased with the efficiency with which it lowered the levels in the room.
Update: original unit stopped dehumidifying after about five weeks of operation. Replacement arrived in about ten days, absolutely no hassle.

Big Girl In Boston,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023","This unit was noisier than I'd expected, even at a low setting. I ended up putting it in another room. In addition, it blows out very warm air. It didn't seem to affect my window air conditioner all that much (I didn't notice that it had to run longer than usual), but I felt more comfortable putting it where it wouldn't be adding warm air to the room.

The controls are very easy and intuitive to use. I emptied the bucket twice on the first day, and then after that I was able to dump out the water once in the morning, and once before going to bed -- both times it was only 3/4 full. I kept the humidity level to 45%, and that was quite comfortable on very hot and humid days. If anything, I think it really helped the air conditioner.

Teresa R,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2022","I bought this dehumidifier for my bedroom because my central HVAC (although in working order) was not extracting enough moisture: On muggy days, the humidity inside my two-bedroom waterfront condo was almost as high as the humidity outside. When I set up the dehumidifier in my bedroom, I was dismayed to discover that it was blowing so much warm air it was making my bedroom LESS comfortable! So I decided to return it. Thank God, I realized, after talking to a neighbor, that even though the website had recommended the 50-pint model for a “large bedroom,” I needed to move it to a large open area in my condo where it could cool my WHOLE condo (about 1200 square feet). And indeed it did! So I got more than I had expected. However, then I noticed that the unit was leaking: The port for attaching a hose was dripping steadily, and since I had nowhere to drain the dehumidifier, I needed to empty the bucket instead of attaching a hose. But a quick trip to the hardware store solved that problem: I bought a rubber gasket (10 for $2.39), put it inside the screw top for the port, and, voilà, the leaking stopped immediately. So don’t give up if your dehumidifier isn’t working right at first. I am SO glad I canceled my Amazon return request (which, by the way, would not have covered the $75+ shipping charge)!

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2023","We live on the water and get a lot of humidity. Our basement is finished but was always damp and cool. This dehumidifier works great. We actually like that it throws off some heat as it dehumidifies because that gives the basement a nice warm dry temperature. I do recommend that you use the drain hose if at all possible because the bucket fills up quickly.

Also, the dehumidifier takes at least two days to settle in. At first it was always running. But once the humidity levels were reached and the unit had “settled in” its environment it does shut off once humidity levels are reached. How frequently it turns on is obviously going to be related the humidity of your area.

Finally, the filter check turns the unit off and seems to go on too soon in my opinion. The first time it went on I removed the filter and it was spotless. Now I just hit the filter reset button at least 3 times before removing the filter to clean it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

It kicks on periodically if humidity is above my setting of 40. So as of now I do like it and hope I don’t have future issues. I did buy the extended warranty just in case though.

UPDATE 1 : Two months of use with pump on and pump died. No longer pumping out. I have to empty the tank now manually. I am very disappointed. For this amount of money it should last longer then 2 months. This was exactly what I wanted until it died and now it is just a pain to use.

It is very effective at removing a lot of moisture from the air in a short amount of time. I’m very happy with my purchase. I purchased a second unit (same size) for my daughter. Her studio apartment ( 390 sq ft) is extremely humid, even more so than a typical basement. 50 pint dehumidifiers are a better value and more efficient that having a smaller unit cycle more frequently. This unit works well in a main living area as the noise level is pleasantly tolerable and even much quieter than our portable ac. Side note- some of the bad reviews regarding malfunction may be due to not allowing the unit to sit upright for two hours after delivery. It says right on the box to allow it to sit before operating.",5.0 out of 5 stars

This unit kept popping up in reviews from multiple testing companies. It doesn't have all the fancy features some models boast. But many of those "" features"" are gimmicks to entice buyers who don't research appliances. Each feature are more points to fail. This product is exactly as tested. Sound constuction that is pleasing to the eye.
Placed the unit in my basement living area of my son. He commented on quite operation and the speed it brought the humidity down to desired level.

The first day I plugged it up the Frigidaire was around 8am and came back at 8pm and the 50 gallon tank was full. I had it on auto setting which aims for a 50% humidity level. For the last couple of days, I do the same thing, I start it at 8am and check it at 8pm, but the tank is now only a quarter full. I could have probably gotten a smaller tank for my 1,400 sqft place.

fourperf,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2023","The Frigidaire 50 Pint Dehumidifier has been running in our basement for about 2 weeks now. I'm not using the pump or continuous drain features. It filled the bucket quite quickly (and repeatedly) for the first 3 days or so on the continuous setting, and as to be expected, it took more time to fill the bucket after the initial few days of use. I was concerned that the fan wasn't shutting off after I set a level of humidity that I wanted the basement to reach. After posting a question here (which I have since removed, since I had said that the fan never turned off) I got a helpful answer explaining that it should turn off and how that feature works. So I upped the level of acceptable humidity by about 15% as a test to see what would happen, and sure enough, the condenser and fan turned off automatically after about a minute. Works as described! It's doing a great job in a fairly large basement.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Jeremy Crouch,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2021","I've been using it just about 24 hours a day 7 days a week since I received it. It did freeze up at one point during the first temperature drop in my area however just setting it to shut off briefly whenever it reached the desired humidity level has completely stopped that. I also purchased a hose and an adapter in order to have it on constant drain mode so I didn't have to empty the tank out but before that arrived I was finding that I had to empty my tank about twice a day, I think that would be much less now that I have gotten the humidity much lower than what it was going from initially high 70% humidity down to between 40% and 45% humidity.
The fins on the condenser do have some minor damage to them, they're a little bent in some spots but this does not seem to be affecting performance in any way.
The filter if you can call it that does very little except keeping out larger particulate matter so if you have shedding animals in the home it will keep their hair out but dust will easily get in causing you to have to shut the unit down and using a towel or a brush of some sort clean the fins.
Overall I am completely happy with this purchase it runs great it's doing a really good job considering I have it in an area that is much larger than it should be in to perform optimally.",5.0 out of 5 stars
K20z3,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2023","This dehumidifier keeps my ~700sq. ft. apt at 40% rh all day. Only time I doesn't is when the bucket is full. Bucket is pretty good size, but with how humid it's been lately, I've had to empty it almost daily, more like every 1.5 days.

Noise is fine. The kuh-chunk when it cycles on the refrigerant system, which actually does the humidity condensing, is expected and fairly loud, but not too loud or bothersome. I like the noise it makes as it runs. Great white noise to go with the air purifiers and one actual white noise machine lol.

It does a great job and works for 700 sq. ft perfectly, especially if you don't have the extra hundred or so for the 50 pint.

Brent Skupien,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2022","I have a 35 pint for my 1300 square foot apartment, and a 50 pint version for the apartment complex I am a maintenance manager in. They are fairly quiet, but importantly the hum is white noise that I actually admire for rest/sleep. Never had a problem with either of them, and they eliminate humidity at the recommended levels shown.

Pro:
- The reservoir doesn't fill too fast, and design for pouring + shutoff + indicator + design as a whole is extremely professional and impressive.
- You can see the built in humidity monitor (for the room), Set point can be from < 85% room humidity ↔ 30%-which is full capacity dehumidifying >.
- only takes up 1 outlet spot (2 if you put it on the top one)
- continuous operation very important
- Disappearing (telecopes into top plane of unit) handle from the top for manueaverability + casters (wheels w/ lock) built in for easy movement
- Bucket slides out very well to avoid spilling

CONS:
- bucket fill level could be more like 15%→full, but it shows more like 40% fill → 100% fill
- a spot to put the instruction manual on the unit (engineer brain)

Wesley Davis,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2021","I have 3 in the townhouse. This one is downstairs where the home gym, guest BR and home theater are. It tends to get musty but this one, both 2 gallon ones, sucks far more moisture than the other, both new. So it works well she is more productive. I'd buy another done years later (they don't last forever but should go 5-7 years). I run it from late spring into the fall when it's humid in the mid Atlantic states. So it goes for months before I shut it off. Standard bucket design, three isn't a lot to say. Air vents out the top. My other one to the side. So I can place them according to furniture and walls. Know what and where before you buy.

This is in an air conditioned area but it losers the humidity from 60% to 45 and that is all the difference with no musty smell. It is full on all our 90 degree f days, the other one 2/3. I can't use the drain as this goes against the wall in a finished room. So I empty it daily. Feature wise I don't care one way or the other about most of the feature list.

If I'm watching a movie on the weekend I need to turn it off as I never find a unit as quiet as, say, a good for standing air purifier on low speed, even if the dehumidifier is also in it's low fan speed.

Chewy,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2023","I bought this because a 30 pint dehumidifier couldn't keep up with the humidity in my basement, getting it below 47% was rare. This pulls the humidity down to about 35-39% with ease on low fan. The biggest issue with this is I fear that the handle on the bucket will break. It pops out from time to time if you don't empty it properly and due to the weight of the water I definitely feel like it could easily snap off. I don't know if replacement parts would be easy to get or not. I'm hoping that I'm wrong, but to be honest, if it does break then you could easily rig something up to do a makeshift job. The noise level is much better than my other one as well, so it's a win. I'd definitely buy it again.",5.0 out of 5 stars
julie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2022","I’ve used the Frigidaire Dehumidifier for three months now, and I’m very impressed. We have a 1400 sq.ft.

I have the unit in one room and keep a monitor in the furthest room in the condo, and it has the same reading as the dehumidifier. It’s relatively quiet on the lowest fan speed, and like most noisy machines it just kind of blends into the background after a while. It’s quite noisy on the high fan setting, but that’s what’s to be expected and I only used this setting for the first 3-4 days after purchase to make sure I properly dried out the condo. I also noticed that this is the right sized unit for 1400 sq.ft. as it removes the 35 pints of water in approx. 24 hours (I live on the Texas coast, so to be expected). Long story short, we noticed a dramatic reduction in humidity and it’s much more comfortable to live and sleep in our condo. Great unit, I would buy it again.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Robert,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2022","I purchased the 22 pint version of this product. So far, I am impressed, it will remove the humidity in the air very quickly and I was seeing drops of 10% humidity in an apartment bed room in under an hour on the medium setting. They claim this dehumidifier is very quiet, and this really isn't the case. The fan is excellent at moving air, not being quiet and the compressor is even louder than the fan. Don't expect this to be running while you are sleeping unless you are used to a noisy window AC unit for example. This honestly isn't even a big deal, I leave on the 50% humidity setting all day and it will automatically kick on the fan and compressor. Once the desired humidity has been reached it turns off the compressor and will continue to run the fan, I've seen it run upwards of an additional 5 minutes without the compressor running. I turn it off at night and wake up in the morning to find the humidity level to have only raised 8%, your mileage may vary. For context this is an 80s built apartment building in Florida, so generally between 65% and 70% humidity on wet days indoors running the AC and not the dehumidifier.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The air intake area is facing outward away from the wall. This position makes it difficult to see the display, but will keep the coils from freezing up.

C. Ping,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2021","I got this for my basement, which is approximately 450 sq feet. My version automatically pumps out. I have it plumbed to pump into a sump pump that's about 4 ft off the ground so it doesn't need to pump very hard.

It works well. The basement was around 65% RH and it brings it down to 40% easily on low fan. It pumps out as expected, and if power is disconnected mine does retain the pump-out settings (some said it didn't). If you manually turn it off and then back on, it does stop pump operation so you have to remember to turn it back on.

It pumps out very slowly (takes about 30 minutes to empty the tank) so you can use it in series with a low capacity sump pump, no issues.

It does seem to run a lot, even when it reaches target humidity the fan still runs most of the time (you can tell since the air blows cold the dehumidifier function is off). I'm not sure why the fan runs so much if it's done dehumidifying, maybe to cool the unit off. Eventually it will turn off though until humidity goes up again.

As much as it runs, I'm quite happy so far. Good value.",5.0 out of 5 stars
John Levin,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2020","I have used many dehumidifiers. If you are new to them, it's important to know that they work best in cool humid environments, like basements. Also, all of these have inadequate hygrometers. Do yourself a favor and buy a few cheap ones so you know the humidity in the area you want to dry as well as the humidity elsewhere in your house.
I use them in Los Angeles which is rarely more humid than 65%. Ideally, I want humidity less than 50% which is a struggle for some of these units. Plus, if they are not in a cool place (e.g., basement) the heat they generate can be unpleasant. It can take some trial and error with the humidity setting, unit placement and fan speed to get the results you want.
The Frigidaires are the best in terms of quality. I have 4 of them in different settings and some have performed well for over 15 years. None has failed, but I have read that Frigidaire service is terrible and there are horror stories with other brands too. Conversely, I have had other units where I had problems and the service was excellent.
One area where most units have been disappointing is BUILT-IN CONDENSATE PUMPS. Until I bought this one, most have been junk with 10% either DOA or failing quickly. However, this unit may be an exception. I've had it for over a month and so far it works well.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Adobe Gardener,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2021","This 50 pint replaced a smaller 35 pint dehumidifier in our 900 sq ft basement. Stone walled basement has an interior french drain/auto pump system but w/o a dehumidifier, the whole house still gets musty and humid.

After reading many reports (most tech details over my head) and reviews, we landed on this one. Because we drain it directly to floor drain, we added a hose for continuous draining (it's a plastic bib so we used plumbers tape to ensure the seal is tight and minimize moving the unit; so far no leaks.) It's much, much quieter and we no longer hear fan noise on the 1st floor. Being bigger, it reaches the set 35% humidity level quicker, so it seems to run perhaps 40-50% less.

There are 3 speeds and a humidity level set which is great. Its pretty quite and it sucks up moisture fast.,5.0 out of 5 stars
jc,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2021","I was having an issue with a musty smell in the AC system of my older apartment unit (about 500 square feet). I live in Houston, Texas and the humidity is usually very high, especially in the summer. Within 8 hours of running the dehumidifier, I noticed that the musty smell was mostly gone. Before I purchased the dehumidifier, I first found out what the humidity level was in my apartment. It was easily over 50% humidity and as high as almost 70%. The recommended, I believe is under 50%. I have brought it to as low as 35%, but at that point the air is actually too dry for me. A good humidity for me is 45%. (Note: the dehumidifier seems to read the humidity as 10% higher than actual. So 50% on the dehumidifier, registers as 40% on my humidity monitor I purchased from Lowe's hardware.) If you are in a high humidity area like me, you will have to drain the tank about twice a day or use a hose to let it drain continuously. The water in the tank is not drinkable, but it is clear and has no smell.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Nick P,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2023","I have two of these. One in the garage and the other near my air handler closet. They work very well and keep the humidity in our 2700sqft home in a very humid location at 50% at all times. in the wetter months we have to empty the reservoir almost twice daily, but this isn't a big problem as I can always hook up a hose to let it drain itself automatically. I have opted to keep the process manual so I can keep track of how much moisture these are pulling out for now. Emptying the reservoir can be challenging for children and those with smaller frames.",5.0 out of 5 stars
UberPat,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2023",I had a smaller dehumidifier in my basement and it didn't have any chance of keeping up with the humidity during the summer months. I finally bought this dehumidifier and it pulled an additional almost twenty per cent of humidity out of the air within the first 24 to 48 hours. It's worth noting that I had both my old dehumidifier and this dehumidifier running at the same time. I think this is a great product though and it definitely moves a lot of air and efficiently removes humidity from any room.,5.0 out of 5 stars
johnny,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2021","I have been using it for a few weeks now. It seems to remove the moisture well. The unit isn't too loud. The noise is mostly the fan. When I am near it, I generally keep it at medium speed to reduce the air noise. It fills up with water at a good rate when the humidity is high. It has wheels to move it around and a handle to lift it. It has a garden hose connection which I don't use because I don't have a drain. It also comes with a second drain and a thin hose that pumps the water out when the container is full. This hose connection on the unit is kind of flimsy, but I have not encountered any leakage. The pump is on the slow side but otherwise works well. It comes in handy when you are sleeping or not at home to manually pour the water out. There is a button to turn the pump feature on and off. I have not used the energy saving setting. The unit does not take up a lot of floor space.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Tracy,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2021","I bought this dehumidifier to remove humidity in one of my bathrooms where the humidity was running over 70. The unit works great. It pulls buckets of water out of the air and I can see the results as my humidity readings go back in the 40's. One thing I did not realize is that the unit will expel hot air as it removes the humidity so you may want to keep that in mind. I use it after every shower or if I notice the humidity climbing in that area. I do not leave it running continuously due to it also heating the area. It is super easy to move the unit around to another room. I also bought a small countertop unit at the same time as I bought this unit. The small countertop unit did not work as it pulled very little humidity out of the air. I ended up returning it. If you need a dehumidifier I highly recommend this model. Even if it is more (bigger) than you think you might need, I would rather have a unit that actually does the job extremely well than a smaller one that hardly works.",5.0 out of 5 stars

M Gerrish,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2020","We have a small wood summer house that we built and it has a basement that is cut out of the granite. For whatever reason -- probably condensation from warm air colliding with cold air -- the basement is always damp. Our electrician has mentioned for the past couple of years that we should really get a dehumidifier or risk the upstairs walls getting moldy.

That, of course, would be bad.

Last year my husband added insulation in the basement ceiling and thought that would probably take care of the dampness, but no. This year on a hot day in a cool basement, the insulation's paper surface was dripping water. Literally dripping.

We ordered this unit, set it up with a garden hose (see manual) to continuously drain, and in less than 24 hours the whole basement is dry, including the paper covering the insulation. We'll continue it running at full speed for another couple of days as per the instructions, and then set the desired humidity level.

We've only had the unit for one day, so I can't review anything about problems. But I'm so delighted with how it's managed the first 24 hours, I had to post something.

I'll come back at the end of the summer season with an update, and I'll update if we run into problems. But we're very pleased.

UPDATE: ran it all season, all winter and into the new summer season and it worked great. Also worth noting, if the power goes out, the dehumidifier goes back on automatically when power is restored.",5.0 out of 5 stars

This dehumidifier is in the unfinished part of my basement where I do not have a drain. However the thin hose that comes with the pump mechanism fits into the same small hole in the floor as my furnace humidifier pipe. The pump pushes the water into this hole and the water then travels under the floor to the next room and into the sump pump. The true test will be time. How long will it last?

This unit was only used for a few months in 2023 during the summer and a short time so far this year so it wasn’t even used for a full year! Frigidaire was NO HELP! Despite our own trouble shooting the issue continued to occur. We had to go out and purchase a new dehumidifier. This was a waste of money as it only was used for and lasted a few months. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! It’s junk and the manufacturer will not back its product.,1.0 out of 5 stars

Luckily, my unit was still a few days within the warranty period and this was approved, though I had to push for this with customer service member. It has been over a month since then and I have received multiple assurances that a new unit is coming, that I will be contacted by service members, etc. all of which has not happened. I have now filed a claim with the BBB but have very little recourse otherwise outside of litigation. From my perspective, they will say whatever is necessary to appease me, but do not hold their end responsibly.

bob dee,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2024","I'm so curious why I see so many of the same reviews of this particular Frigidaire unit failing and how it fails. I'm wondering if because I run this on the lowest fan speed that this is the reason I have not had the freeze-up problem I read so much about. And the more I research de-humidifiers the more I see many of the same consistent problems and failures. It seems most units are built to last maybe 2 years at best. Mine (this particular model), is still working efficiently. I run it seasonally (June--September), and when nights get colder and humidity is generally less I put it away till the next year. I've done this for 2 years now. And after everything I'm reading I'm expecting this unit will fail soon. But I'm wondering that because I run it on the lowest fan speed that maybe it is adding to it's longevity. I don't know.

Howie and/or Cyndy,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2023","I recently purchased the this dehumidifier, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. This incredible appliance has been a game-changer for maintaining a comfortable environment in my home, particularly on the upstairs level. It does kick out some heat and I learned quickly to run it only on the low fan speed.

One of the standout features of this dehumidifier is its exceptional ability to reduce humidity levels effectively. Prior to using this device, my upstairs level was plagued with excessive moisture, even though the space was air-conditioned. No matter what I tried, I could never get the humidity level below 60. However, since incorporating this dehumidifier into my home, I have witnessed a remarkable transformation. For the first time ever, the humidity level on my upstairs level has dropped to an impressive 40. It is truly amazing!

One of the reasons I opted for this particular dehumidifier was its convenience and ease of use. While it does come with a pump, I personally have not utilized it. Instead, I have been emptying the tank twice a day. The tank is user-friendly and straightforward to remove and empty. It's a minor inconvenience in exchange for the fantastic results I have experienced.

In terms of performance, this dehumidifier has been flawless. It operates quietly, allowing me to enjoy a peaceful and undisturbed living environment. Additionally, the energy efficiency of this device is worth mentioning. It runs smoothly without consuming excessive energy, which is not only beneficial for the environment but also helps keep my electricity bills in check.

Considering the outstanding performance and the significant improvement in humidity levels, I can't help but regret not purchasing this dehumidifier sooner. It has undoubtedly made a positive impact on the overall comfort and quality of life in my home. The difference in air quality is noticeable, and I no longer have to worry about the negative effects of excess moisture, such as mold and musty odors.

In conclusion, I highly recommend this dehumidifier to anyone struggling with high humidity levels in their home. It is an incredibly effective and reliable appliance that has tackled the excess moisture in my home like a champ. With its outstanding performance, ease of use, and energy efficiency, this dehumidifier has become an invaluable addition to my household. Don't make the same mistake I did by waiting—invest in this dehumidifier and experience the comfort and peace of mind it brings.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Randall W. Rasner,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2023","Honest review of Frigidaire FFAD5033W1 Dehumidifier, High Humidity 50 Pint Capacity with a Easy-to-Clean Washable Filter and Custom Humidity Control for maximized comfort, in White

I ordered this to replace one of another brand that failed to consistently drain via the hose into a sump well. This one had great reviews and a dependable name brand. I am using it in a damp basement that I do not frequent, so the continuous drainage option was a must for me.

Likes:
Very easy to set up and get to dehumidifying; it was basically plug and play, if you will.
Easy to learn controls; very self-intuitive.
Easy-to-Clean washable filter
Automatic shut off when the bucket is full if you use the bucket drain option. Plus, it shuts off when reaching the targeted humidity level
Front loading bucket with carrying handle and splash guard. I have not used the bucket, but it is easily removed and replaced. Plus, it has a red float to show the tank’s water level and can easily be seen on the front of the unit
The casters roll easily and in any direction
It has a pull-up carrying handle, which functions well and is not difficult to raise or lower
The cord is sufficiently long
Humidity control (but only in increments of 5%)
3-speed fan
I did not think that it was overly loud (my video has my phone very close to the unit)
Continuous drainage option (hose NOT included) that uses a standard garden hose or washing machine hose to easily screw onto the port in back of the unit
The continuous drainage has worked very well. I have the unit sitting on concrete blocks to ensure it is elevated above the required level to properly drain
It has a 50-pint air flow capacity, which is higher than many at this price range
Frigidaire is a brand I know and trust
1 year manufacturer’s warranty (I brought the additional 4 year warranty because I don’t have good luck with electronics and just over $10 per year is not too bad)

Dislikes:
There was not a drainage hose included (I bought a cheap and short garden hose to use)

Meh:
If it allowed 1% incremental humidity settings, that would be great, but it’s not a deal breaker to me
It is heavy (44 LBS) so it’s good that it’s on casters, but moving it up and down stairs is a chore

Hopefully this honest review helps someone decide about this product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Dane,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2023","This dehumidifer seemed so promising, it looked so promising, it sounded so promising. It seemed like the perfect dehumidifer from what I thought was a good brand. I've had a full kitchen of appliances at 2 different locations from Frigidaire and so I thought what better company to purchase a dehumidifer from than them right? Wrong.
The stats were great. It looks better than most. It's energy efficient. It just all seemed so promising. I ordered it and when it was delivered I unpackaged it and in the basement it went. The basement never drops below 64F even in the winter.
It was quiet. It hummed along. It pushed a good amount of air even on low. The bucket had a window so you could easily see the level of water. The bucket was super easy to pull out and put back in, trust me on this. Becuase the replacement one I purchased from another brand works 100x better, but it doesn't look as good, doesn't feel as good, and the bucket is a bit more clumsy.
But then everything started to fail.
I noticed a stain in the bucket, but I didn't think much of it. I thought it was just something with the water. However, after doing some research it's the refrigerant leak that caused the stain...
After about 6-8 months of use set to 45% humidity and it was never running straight out, it would cycle on and off pretty healthily., it sprung a leak. The unit started icing up. I tried everything, but unfortunately they are not user servicable. It was still under the 1 year factory warranty so I called Frigidaire. And boy, this has been a horror show.
When I called them and explained to them the situation and gave them all of the information they needed, they deemed it needing a replacement and thank goodness I was still under warranty.
They email this site that isn't even related to them to to fill an online form to get a replacment. I did all that. Weeks pass by and I finally get an email that says my replacement has been approved I'll get another email in 3-5 business days when the warranty replacement ships.
Fast forward a month, and still nothing! So I call them back and spend 2 hours on the phone being transferred multiple times. Being told to call this company and that company. Having to call them back. Being pushed around again. No one knows anything! No status update, no replacement unit on the way yet. I try again a few days later using online messaging and nothing. Spent another few hours on that as they ""researched my concern"" to no avail.. It's been 2 months, I still don't have my warranty replacement. I filed a Better Business Bureau complaint against Frigidaire (Electrolux) and we shall see what happens. Totally disgusted...",1.0 out of 5 stars
DECEMBER,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2023","I live near Portland, OR, and the humidity is always around 75-85% in my apartment. I also have an indoor vegetable garden, which adds to the already high humidity of the area. I was getting mildew on the windows and window sills.
I have 3 guitars and 3 basses, 4 amps, and lots of other electronics, recording gear, and a computer. My guitars kept developing fret buzz. I'd level the frets and adjust them, get rid of the buzz, then it would come back in a few months. It took me too long to learn that constant exposure to humidity levels like this were destroying the instruments. Gave up on these ruined cheapish guitars and bought one nice expensive guitar.
But I got this dehumidifier first. Not gonna let this one get ruined by humidity. It works well, keeps the humidity down to 45%, in the living room of a 1,050 sq ft 2 bedroom apartment. The bucket fills up within 36 hours, usually (about 2 gallons). I use it to water the garden.
It turns off when it hits the target humidity, and back on as needed. I had a different dehumidifier first which kept the fan running constantly, even when the dehumidifier was disengaged. And it kept freezing up, grill covered in ice, so I returned it. This one has been running for 3 months now, no ice, no problems, and no noticeable impact to the electric bill.
It is a tad loud, but not an irritating abrasive sound. The sound doesn't bother me at all, but when I watch TV I like to keep the volume as low as possible, so I have to turn the dehumidifier off. To hear the TV with the dehumidifier on, I have to put it louder than I like, but not any louder than most people I know have their TVs set normally.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sunny Schubert,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2024","We bought the 50-pint dehumidifier. It's worked really well pretty much filling up daily for the last 3-years. It is getting a bit noisier so we've moved it out of the bedroom and into the bathroom. My only complaint is that the air that comes out of it is about 78-80 degrees F. It was starting to warm the bedroom in an uncomfortable way. However, the bathroom being a little warmer is very nice on cool spring mornings. I would say it'll work great for us for another 2 years. I think in a basement or attic it would work great for a long time. We have a small apartment and you can hear this thing in any room. It's a dull roaring white noise sound. Similar to a bathroom fan. I usually shut it off at night because it did keepe up on occasion. I do think it started getting louder after 2 years. These are a necessity in central Texas in the summer.

If you're looking for something for the bedroom I'd suggest a smaller quieter unit you keep closer to your person to reduce humidity in a room.

I'm removing 1 star because of the noise and the what produced. Otherwise it's a great product that still works as intended 3-years later.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Julez,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2024","This is a 50 pint Frigidedaire (Electrolux) dehumidifier. It does what it's supposed to do. It's new so I can't say much about its longevity, but overall, nearly any brand dehumidifier I've had in the last 15-20 years has been about the same and seems to die after a number of years. One feature that isn't promoted much on the website is that it does have a built-in air ionizer. So you have a little added bonus there.

The second part of this review has to do with something that I'm generally not thrilled with in most appliances and that's the available wifi and associated application for the device. Usually, these apps are trash and the wifi barely works. I thought, well maybe at a minimum it can at least part time tell me if the bucket is full, the cost wasn't much more, so might as well.

I'm so glad I went with the wifi option. Frigidaire created a clean and well built app. I'm actually impressed. I've added screenshots of the app.
It will direct you to the site you need to register the appliance with for warranty/recall purposes.
Shows you current humidity and humidity over time via graph.
You can toggle it on/off.
You can set a child lock so no one can play with the buttons.
There's a task scheduler for it and other appliances that are registered with it.
Nearly all control can be done from the app.
Push notifications.
And has all the associated personal assistant options.
I'm impressed with this, and I generally don't impress easily when it comes to IoT or appliance apps and their implementations.

However, this is still an IoT device and absolutely should NOT go on your internal network. It belongs on a guest or isolated network like every other IoT device you own. Nest, Ecobee, Kidde, Echo, Ring, Eufy, Phillips, any appliance manufacturer, etc... should always be isolated away from your computers, laptops, phones, printers, network storage, etc... devices.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Hunter Holmes,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2023","Energy efficiency , similar to wattage, can be misleading. This Frigidaire tested at full and continuous mode, used a little more energy than most of it's competitors. However it was found when used at a more typical setting, maybe 45%, rather than continuous. This machine now used less energy then it's competitors. As far as removing water, it's the best, I researched a lot. I have a Black and decker, same price range, it's lousy compared to this. These machines change almost every year, appearance, or cheapness or improvements. Ex: about 6 years ago, I had the same model Frigidaire and it was best back then, except one thing the water tank was just too small, Well guess what, now this Frigidaire has the biggest water tank of all of them. Also the hot air is less hot then they used to be, it's quieter than it used to be, by a considerable amount, more of a wind sound than a compressor motor sound. I think they actually found a better method, to quiet the compressor ( I'm not positive?) Anyway, it's a great unit. I would even go as far as to call it the industry standard. It removes a lot more water and at a quicker rate. It was the best 6 years ago,( at removing water) and it's a lot better now, all around. Except one drawback, the side slits that can be used for handles are not there, so it's a little harder to pick up, but the wheels are made well. You need not waste time looking further this is the best unit in it's price range, and like I said in the beginning, the energy used on all these products is only measured from one perspective, and perhaps it's not the best perspective. At typical settings this machine is more efficient than its competitors, except when it's measured at full throttle CONTINUOUS mode. And even then, it didn't score a lot less. I did get a lot of this information from, ( I can't remember,) but I also own this unit and have compared for myself.) I believe the competitors will be trying to copy, what Frigidaire has done here. At this price, I would call this product the industry standard! Look no further! Hunter Holmes -- Addendum -- I missed this at first. This unit has a handle that is sort of hidden. A recessed black plastic carrying handle that pulls out from the top of the unit with a 2 inch clearance and it's about 8 inches long. In this price range THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE INDUSTRY STANDARD! HUNTER HOLMES - ADDENDUM #2 - It's been about 3 months, and I still can't believe how quiet this machine is compared to, what was the same unit by FRIGIDAIRE 6 years ago, this current 2023 unit, I mostly hear fan and very little compressor refridgerator noise, the attenuated sound puzzles me in a great way.

RSH,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2023","For as long as I've owned a home I've bought Frigidaire dehumidifiers.

The units are NOT built to last. The codes are always the same. Fatal. F0 (Freeze Out) or EC (Evaporator Coil / Sealed System).

It appears to be a two-year ritual to search my mail for emails to electrolux.com and to re-familiarize myself and start a warranty claim... which I am once again in the process of doing. This time however I am writing this review.

When you receive a new unit it works exactly as expected. Hail the power of condensing water from air! Positive reviewers rejoice! It works its magic and all summer long you reap the rewards of a drier, less humid environment.

Then comes winter. The unit is stored, either powered on but sitting idle or fully powered off, eager for the next summer/fall blast of humidity and a call to action.

... except - next summer it no longer works. It's starting to get humid here in the Northeast and that is when I need this unit to work. It doesn't. It powers on. It runs the blower. You can even perhaps hear the compressor churn. Condensation. Nope. Pull the bucket. Bone dry. Eventually the unit cries foul and throws the F0 / EC code.

FAD704DWD (2014) - F0
FAD704DWD (2016) via RMA spring 2016 - F0 -- lasted that summer
FFAD7033R1 (2017) - EC
FFAD7033R1 (2019) via RMA summer 2019 (5 year sealed system warrant on 2017 purchase) - EC
FFAD5033W1 (2022) via RMA summer 2022 (a month short of 5 year sealed system warranty on 2017 purchase) - EC
FFAD5033W1 (2022) - separate purchase May 2022 - still running for now, now outside the 1 YR standard warranty

A part of me wonders if these units are simply designed with planned obsolescence in mind. Why build a unit that lasts one to two seasons? in the Northeast you generally would purchase one of these when humidity rises (late spring/summer) and you get a few months use then pack it up for winter with the expectation when you need it next it works.

So aside from the possibility of seeing if Frigidaire / Electrolux will replace the FFAD7033W1 (2022) that was newly manufactured December 2021 and only lasted the 2022 summer season... I do not believe my dollars are best spent on this brand any longer.

To Frigidaire's credit, the 5 year sealed system warranty is good and the RMA replacement process is usually painless. Fill a form. Get approved. Unit shows up at your doorstep. The problem is, the replacement process shouldn't be so painless in a way. It's like they've gotten really good at shipping replacements. REALLY good.

... I'd rather have the unit last 5 years and get a sense I got my money's worth than the hassle of a humid basement for a couple of weeks during the replacement process.

EDIT: So today I contacted Frigidaire by phone. It was not a good experience. I explained to them I had a FFAD5033W1 manufactured December 2021, bought May 2022 and put into service last summer for only a few months. It has been off all winter; no need. It of course is now June 2023. The first time I needed it was this month. It is returning EC code after repeated power cycles. Warranty Claim DENIED. They no longer have a 5 year sealed system warranty. The unit now has a single 1 year warranty from the date of purchase. I wonder why that is ... </sarcasm>

The unit is 18 months old from its date of manufacture... bought and ran for at most 3 months last year and is now dead.

EDIT: September 2023. The FFAD5033W1 purchased May 2022 is now returning EC code constantly. The unit is in pristine condition in a clean area and ran daily during the summer. In a room with ~60% RH and 70 degree room temperatures it has reached its end. This unit lasted essentially two summers and that's it.

I see Amazon touts ""sold 1K units last month"". I'm sure they did and Frigidaire loves you for it. While their reputation precedes here, folks are soon going to find out their money is well spent elsewhere.

NEVER will I buy anything Frigidaire again.",1.0 out of 5 stars

trish,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","I'm having the opposite problem than many other reviews... this unit won't stop running!
I purchased this unit in July 2023. Ran great and lowered humidity as promised. Put it away for the winter in a closet. Brought it back out a few weeks ago and again seemed to be working well. Matched my Hygrometer reading within a couple degrees. However, I have noticed over the last several days that it just keeps running. The compressor turns on , it runs for awhile, then turns off, but then turns right back on again. So this evening I'm trying to sleep and it keeps doing this (I have it set at 45%). I have two Hygrometers in my room that both say the humidity is at 40%. The unit keeps running... so I set it to 50%, and it still just keeps running even though the humidity level is still down at 41%. I finally changed the setting to 60% and it finally has stayed shut down. And guess what?, both Hygrometers still say it's only at 41% in the room 30 minutes later. And thankfully the temperature has dropped 2 degrees to 73°. Guess I'll be calling to see if I can get a replacement. Fingers crossed! 🤞😬
Also wanted to mention the fact that for 3 mornings I kept waking up completely dehydrated. Mouth so dry that I could barely swallow. Wish I had clued in sooner that the problem was the dehumidifier, not that I wasn't drinking enough water. (Derp!)

Seez52,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2024","This is my 4th Frigidaire unit. This one lasted almost two years. I run it 24/7 all year long. It does a good job. This particular model is really quiet and it seems to work as it should. I use a direct drain and I like the setup Frigidaire uses for this. Occasionally the hose will become obstructed and the bucket fills. I purchased the model with wifi hoping it would tell me when the bucket is full but apparently that is not a push option on the app. Really that's the only useful thing the app could do.

I've had several brands of these: Maytag, LG etc. they all last about the same amount of time. Usually they fail just outside the warranty period typically 18-24 months. I do have another Frigidaire just like this one that's going on three years, wow! I learned about three units ago that you always purchase the extended warranty that Amazon offers during checkout. I get the 4 year one it's usually $50.

This one is a replacement for the same model purchased in June of 2022. I submitted a claim through Amazon on my phone and within 5 minutes had a credit on my account for what I originally paid. Ordered this one, it was a little more expensive, and it was here in two days. It was an easy and quick way to get up and running again. Never buy one of these portable dehumidifiers, regardless of the brand, without a 3 or 4 year extended warranty. They are all made in China and simply are not intended to be long term use appliances. Once you understand that, and get the extra warranty, your satisfaction with the product is a lot better, LOL.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Judy L.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2022","We have a large basement with 3 rooms that I grow a number of vegetables and herbs in. Prior to getting this dehumidifier, the humidity in our basement was continuously in excess of 70% caused by evaporation of water in the pots. Unfortunately, we were told this caused humidity in our attic that wasn't noticed until we found mold growing. This was a very expensive lesson for us as we had to have the roof and all of the wood below it replaced at a cost of over $15K.

I am not going to get into any technical stuff like the efficiency of the condenser, but will say this dehumidifier has helped to solve our humidity problem. In searching for a dehumidifier to meet our needs, I had to learn the capacity of humidity remove was different than the size of the tank to be emptied. The 50 pint ( or 6.25 gallons) capacity of this dehumidifier is the amount of moisture that will be removed from the air in a 24 hour period. I would guess the water tank holds about 2 gallons of water as we need to empty it 3 times in a 24 hour period.

Since the humidity in our basement is high because of the plants, we have this unit set to continuous, but you can also set it to run until a desired humidity is reached. When the water container is full, it automatically stops until the container is emptied. You can also set the fan to high or low. When the filter gets dirty, a light shows on the top of the unit. Cleaning the filter is a matter of spraying it clean with a faucet spray and drying it with a towel.

This unit is in a room 30' x 15', and the humidity has been reduced from over 70% to 40%. We have had this dehumidifier for over a month, and are very happy with it. It consistently keeps the humidity down and is very easy to maintain.

UPDATE 5/27/22:
Since our basement is very large with 3 rooms, two of which contain plants, we decided to buy another one of these dehumidifiers so we could one in each of the plant rooms. The humidity in both rooms is staying around 40% and out attic is now staying dry. This has also helped to reduce the humidity in the house which make it much more comfortable during the summer.

UPDATE 09/24/23:
We bought 2 of the dehumidifiers, and they worked well for about 15 months. After the 15 months, both units started leaking which was, of course after the warranty had expired. We finally replaced both of them. Considering the cost, these dehumidifiers should last longer then 15 months, in my opinion. We replaced them with a different brand, and also bought the extended insurance just to be safe.

Altmanmom,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2024",I researched many dehumidifiers before buying this one. Works well. We empty it about every 2-3 days. Having a lid on the bucket is helpful as water doesn’t spill as much when carrying up the stairs from basement.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Simone S,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2024","After 3yrs of almost constant use my Frigidaire dehumidifier started acting up (seemed like compressor was stuck on and humming even when turned unit off) on Christmas Day. I decided to purchase the newer model (looks EXACTLY the same) as a used like new Amazon Warehouse return. It arrived on its side (not good) inside a larger Amazon box with zero packaging material in the Amazon box. The actual Fridigaire box was very slightly damaged but the product inside was strapped and taped with plenty of styrofoam (still brushing it off the machine lol) and seems brand new.

Unfortunately, when I plugged it in, it's much louder than the previous model and often makes an annoying clunking when the compressor turns off and on (old model didn't clunk). The compressor sounds like it's straining and similar to the old dying one I continued to use after the initial issues, to see if it was really done for (unplugged it when leaving house or sleeping). These noises are disturbing while I'm working from home. Unsure sure if I'm going to keep this, but may reach out to Fridgidaire to check warranty support first. I really don't want to pack this heavy thing back up and return it. I also wonder if it being shipped on its side (says not to tip the unit) somehow damaged it.

As far as pulling water out of the air, it works great. It's almost filled the bucket on low speed (off and on) since this morning. (FL EL Nino winter, 86% humidity outside at 1145pm.

Cory S. Estes,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024","We've had another dehumidifier for many years. It seemed to work fine and did what it was supposed to do in our basement but wasn't quiet and we noticed increases in electric consumption during the seasons ti was in use. One day a service technician was in inspecting a water control system in our basement. He looked at the old dehumidifier, said, ""Hmmm..."", pulled out his phone and looked up a recall article for that particular model. It seems it had been recalled by the company as a potential fire hazard. He sent me a link for the article and recommended we stop using it; he had the same model in his home. After reading through the recall I contacted the company as directed and was instructed to ""get on a list until it was determined how the recall was going to be handled."" At that point we decided it was time to buy a replacement!

We did lots of research and felt this was the brand and model to get. Low and behold there was even one available via Amazon Warehouse that was new-in-box but the top of the box was slightly damaged. Sold! It arrived in good time, was in the original box, and works perfectly.

We're very happy with it. It is much quieter, efficient, and though we haven't noticed the effect on the electric bill yet, it seems like it'll have to be an improvement because it's running for shorter time. We're happy with it and have recommended it to friends and family.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Ann,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2023","Just recieved the new model. I had the old one for just over a year and it broke. I decided to replace it with the same thing because I think the problem was user error rather than quality. I can't comment on longevity of the new model since I only just got it, but I would note that it is different from the old one. I think it is a bit noisier. It is also more compact- specifically in height. The only major difference is the vent. Unlike the older model that is pictured in the item description, this one does not have a vent and handle on top. The handle is gone and the vent is now on the side, which is both a good and a bad thing. It needs more space around the machine to make sure it can vent properly which means I can't put it back in the same place as the old one. But, it also means that dust isn't falling into the vent when the machine is off or in sleep mode, which is a huge plus for me since the reason I have it in the first place is due to a major dust allergy.",4.0 out of 5 stars

florida1,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2020","I bought these mainly for the wifi, since they had much less expensive models with similar features available. I bought 3 of these units to start, with hopes to perhaps buy at least 1 more. My first recommendation is to watch the connect to wifi video since you have to connect to the humidifier as if it was a wifi network, in order to connect. This is not intuitive, but even after doing this, it took multiple times before my unit would connect anyhow. Once connected, the app tells you that you have to register the unit, so I entered all my data and it kept giving me the same error message. (ECP0108, please check your information for accuracy). I tried many different ways to enter my information, but ALL gave me the same error message. (if you look on iTunes, it seems many people get the same error message), and I do wish I had read the app ratings before purchasing, since it has a 1.4 out of 5 star rating. I called their support Friday and after long holds and 20 minutes of discussion, was told I needed a different department. I was transferred and left a voice mail (and today, I was told by many, that they don’t even have a voicemail system). In any event, after wasting many more hours today and one email response with some suggestions which did not work.....I still have an app that is nonfunctional, since it says my unit it not registered. I was told they have sent a ticket to the IT department, who does not take calls, and someone will hopefully get back to me in a few more days. Dehumidifier so far, gets 4 stars, wifi gets 0 stars, customer service 1 star

Addendum: After much persistence on my part, I finally got to speak with IT, and they did release an app update that fixed some of the bugs. It took over a month, and they still need to optimize and fix further, but I do now have all 3 units hooked up and can control via iPhone or iPad app.

Just another comment, like any web based control, after a power outage or reboot of my router, only 2 of the 3 dehumidifiers connected back automatically back to the apps, so had I not been home, had been away on a trip, or whatever, I would NOT have been able to get it working. Turning the unit off and on, or trying to reconnect via the apps did nothing and the only thing that worked was unplugging the unit and plugging it back in. I will have to see over time how often this happens and if so, whether it is always the same unit that has trouble reestablishing a connection.",4.0 out of 5 stars

jewno,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2022","After reading many reviews ranging from 1 to 5 stars, I was scared to purchase this product, but I have to say, I'm not disappointed.

Let's start with why I purchased it - I needed to bring down the humidity in my west Texas home (~1,730 sqft). The humidity in my house with refrigerated air was between 55 (downstairs) and 65% (upstairs). After receiving the dehumidifier, I placed it upstairs in my loft, which overlooks most of my downstairs.

PERFORMANCE (5 STARS): I ran the dehumidifier on its continuous setting for about 3-4 days, and I didn't see any immediate results. The humidity in my house was the same, but it was removing moisture from the air - about 12 gallons a day. I was on the verge of returning the product, but on day 4 or 5, the humidity levels began to drop dramatically. After about a week of running, they are down to about 30% (downstairs) and 43% (upstairs), ±2%.

TEMPERATURE: I read some reviews about the air from the exhaust being hotter than the current air temperature - this is true on occasion. I felt that the air leaving the machine was a little warmer than the surrounding temperature; however, it wasn't anything significant. Other times, there was hardly any noticeable difference in the air temperature from the exhaust and the surrounding air temperature.

PLACEMENT: I read in the instructions that this unit should be placed at least 12 inches from the wall on any side. After looking at the unit, the air intake is on the rear (which looks like a design flaw). I feel this could have been better placed on the sides or front (but hey, I'm not an engineer). I wasn't going to put this in the middle of the room, so I simply turned the unit around and put the front of it against the wall, so the rear (where the air intake is) was facing outward. The only inconvenient part of this was that the water reservoir was only accessible from the front. This means you cannot see the water level or empty it without turning it around. This minor inconvenience takes seconds to do and needs to be done once a day (twice max). Even though you can't see the water level, the unit will automatically turn off once it is full.

NOISE (4 STARS): While quieter than others (from what I've read), this unit is still a bit noisy. I didn't conduct a decibel test, but it sounds like a large floor fan when on high.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Paul,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","Updated 7/1/2023 - a couple weeks after the first review. Updated the app and it reconnects after returning home now . And the Alexa app is not powering the dehumidifier off. The skill is still strange, but it's no longer causing problems. Adding another star.

First review:
If you just consider this unconnected (no app, no Alexa) the dehumidifier works great. Quitter than older model. But the connected features are terrible.

The Alexa skill is strange - there is one slider labeled Humidity and one labeled Percentage. I assume onw of these the preferred humidity which I can set using the panel on the device. Why are there 2 sliders in Alexa skill? What do they do? Not explained. And after enabling this skill, the dehumidifier turns off. I disabled the skill.

The iPhone app works but needs hand-holding. Whenever I leave he house, I loose WiFi access and the app disconnects. This is expected. When I reconnect to Wifi, the app tells me there's a WiFi problem and I should check the router. This is a bug. The app should reconnect first. If I force the app the stop (using the iPhone App Switcher). Then start the app, all works fine. I have dozens of ""smart"" devices are all others handle leaving and returning to WiFi range fine.

Without the connected features, I'd give this 5 stars. But since I paid $100 extra for model with WiFi, I give this 3 stars. I hope the software is fixed and I can change my rating.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Steve Cramer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2021","I was a bit concerned because it looked like a mix of reviews, but I found the unit worked incredibly well (in fact, I ended up turning it to 55% because at 45% I felt the moisture pulling out of my body when I walked in the garage. TOO dry!

The unit seems quiet to me, certainly not loud, but I do keep the fan on medium, not high. It's in my garage. I can't imagine being bothered by the sounds. It is more like a very small window A/C unit, not even that noisy.

(I had been using 'Dampits' and the bag took a month to fill, so I figured I really didn't have a humidity problem. But I noticed some mildew smells from some old cases I put in the garage, and when I saw some white mold on a sheet of plywood, I knew something was wrong. I turned on this unit, sprayed the plywood and cases with a mold disinfectant, wiped with paper towels, and the next day everything was bone dry, no trace of mold or mildew, and the plywood even turn lighter and flattened out. The tank had over a gallon of water in it. ONE night! So much for the Dampits.

I kept things at 45% for a few days, went over everything in the garage with mold remover spray, etc., and I could tell that everything was getting dried out nicely. I had a bunch of cardboard boxes stored in there and you could feel that mushy-sogginess that was then light and crisp and felt new.

Yes, this works extremely well. As I said, I found that 55% was a better setting for ongoing use, and the medium fan setting.

I still haven't set up the hose for automatic emptying, but now I only have to empty every other day, sometimes every 3rd day, depending on the outside humidity. At some point I will establish a permanent place for the unit and run the hose through the wall. I expect that the unit probably won't turn on much in the fall and winter months, mainly need this for late spring and summer, early fall.

(Btw, it is gravity feed for the hose, but the connection is in the middle of the back of the unit, so there is some height that allows me to put the hole through the wall above the 8"" concrete block height on top of my slab that my walls rise from.)

There is a filter that you will be reminded to clean, but I really haven't noticed it getting dirty. But my garage is quite new, so maybe it will get dirtier in other situation. Regardless, it washes out quite easily.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Dong W.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2022","In Feb 2021, I purchased this model after some careful research on the internet, knowing that our basement usually gets very humid in the three months of summer, and there is a range of performances among the models on the market. This model was great when it worked at the beginning, just as many positive reviews described. It then went to hibernation as fall came and the air became dry. After I turned it on the second summer, in 2022, I soon realized that something was wrong. A block of ice was accumulating on the condensing unit, which then grew onto the filter and the outer cover in the back. It eventually glued all of them together so that I couldn’t open the back cover without fearing to break it. This ice, when melted, does not collect in the tank. It accumulates elsewhere in the unit and then leaks onto the floor to form a puddle.
While waiting for the ice to melt after turning off the power, I went on the internet to look for the cause, and ruled out the simple factors: low ambient temperature, clogged filter, broken fan, etc. Outwardly the unit looks fine, making all the right noises when turned on. It has also been well maintained: if I told you it was brand new (see the first two photos), you wouldn’t be able to tell that it is 2 years old. Yet every time, 5 minutes after I turn it on, ices start to form. The last photo shows ice accumulation at the lower half after one hour of operation. It seems one of the sensors has failed, not something a non-professional can easily diagnose or replace.

When I called Fridigiare, I was told that I would have to buy a new one. They wouldn’t replace it because it was out of the one year warranty, even though I pointed out it was really in use for about three months. The company put dehumidifiers in their “major appliance” category, but it is not like a fridge that runs constantly, or a range that you turn on every day. It is more like an air conditioning unit that one uses only when it is really hot.

I understand that the 12-month warranty is just company policy and that as a company, it will try its best to avoid cost, but it feels rather shabby for a company to pretend that it is perfectly beyond reproach when one piece of their major appliance fails after one single season of use.

I am sure that most units of this model work superbly, and that many thousands of customers are luckier than I am. However, if you are about to shell out close to $300 on a dehumidifier, would you not worry that after you put it away after the first season, there is a chance it may not come back next time? Now that I am again on the market for a decent dehumidifier, at least it should have a meaningful warranty, and that rules out Frigidaire.

P.S. I indeed purchased an equivalent model from a different manufacturer, costing half as much as the Frigidaire one, with a warranty twice as long. Fingers crossed!",2.0 out of 5 stars

T.R.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2024","I cannot recommend this product. The unit seemed to function correctly upon delivery. However, exactly one month to the date, the dehumidifier began severely leaking. Specifically, the unit would not automatically turn off when the bucket became full--this is a serious issue in humid climates as 50 pints can fill up in a few hours. On more than one occasion, I awoke to find water pooling on my hardwood floors and baseboards.

Making matters worse, customer service has been virtually nonexistent. It took several weeks to file a warranty claim as same seems to be handled through a third party affiliated with Electrolux. After finally submitting my claim, it was approved and I was notified I would receive a replacement unit. Several weeks have passed and I have had no follow up. Contacting Frigidaire is unhelpful as the representatives provide different answers; one advises the unit is backordered and I will receive a comparable model. another that they cannot locate my warranty claim. The number provided for warranties leads immediately to a full mailbox of a random individual.

In conclusion, Frigidaire sold a faulty product and has yet to honor its contractual warranty. For these reasons, I strongly suggest you look elsewhere for a dehumidifier and consider Honeywell, Hisense, or any of the other options on the market.",2.0 out of 5 stars
AJ,"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2023","Arrived on time and positioned upright as product box says (to keep oil in sealed compressor upright). After unboxing, it looked even better than pictures. Nice white glossy look and was easy to setup. Instructions inside, including App instructions if you plan to use Wifi feature
Download the Fridgidaire app first to make it super easy to setup (but app not require to run unit). The Frigidaire app provided video for setup and was easy to setup via app guided steps. Plug in unit and press power button prior to setting up Wifi. I'm glad I went with well known brand. You can see how professionally done to design product. Fan noise level was low. Nice smooth sounding fan with multiple speeds. Buyer beware: I bought and immediately returned different dehumififier named Domdre (sold by Domdre Star on Amazon) because I paid for 50 pint and they sent 22 pint (both look same but 50 is slightly larger. It looked like picture but seemed small for a 50 pint unit. I recalled a comment saying a man ordered 50 pint but got 22 pint, so I started checking model, dimensions, etc. They don't put pint identification on Domdre product box like Fridgidaire does to show total pints of unit. Model number on amazon listing didn't match either their 22 or 50 pint. So beware of that likely scam or just incompetence. I could see many getting scammed because they don't check to confirm they got what they ordered. So go with ""sold by Amazon"" to get Fridgidaire that unsures well designed and supported product. Btw, warranty final step using app didn't work. I got an error notification in app about app failure to communicate warranty to Fridgidaire. Day later, notification is gone.

A Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2020","UPDATE: The cutoff switch failed so it spent several hours dumping water on the floor. As I pulled the overflowing bucket out (it normally shuts off with about 3/4 inch to spare) it started beeping to complain that there was no bucket. Thanks! Definitely a 0-star product. Original review below, which already wasn't great.

I've had 3 different dehumidifiers now. This one isn't great either, for a few reasons.

This is the kind with the optional hose output sticking out the back, and with a knob-style cap screwed onto it for normal bucket-collection use. I've seen a lot of reviews complaining about leaks from the cap, so I looked at it and oh boy is it not a quality device. Bear with me, it's hard to describe. First, the edge of the output tube the cap screws against is slightly rough, which is the wrong way to make something which has to fit against a watertight gasket (which is in the cap). Second, the gasket is a thick ring shape, with a hole in the middle. If it were a solid disc, just the contact between it and the thin edge of the output pipe would have to fit tight into the rubber to form a seal. But with the hole in the middle, it also has to be tight enough to seal the flat gasket against the inside of the cap. THIRD, the front side of the gasket isn't even flat! It has some kind of raised part number characters sticking out, so again you have to put it on extra tight to make sure the non-flat rubber seals against the pipe.

If you run it on ""continuous"" mode, the 2-digit number display turns into a ""CO"" and NO LONGER FUNCTIONS AS A HUMIDITY METER. The panel has no mode button and therefore no light to indicate the mode (continuous mode is accessed by clicking the auto level all the way down until it shows CO), so they hijack the humidity level display to show it. So if you want this thing to run continuously, you will have to buy a separate humidity meter in order to monitor the humidity level.

The fan is noisy, even on the lowest setting, in a slightly pulsing way, not just a loud woosh but an annoying up and down volume. I looked into the vent, and the fan cylinder (it's the type made up of dozens of long straight thin parallel blades arranged in a cylinder shape) wobbles as it spins. Junk. The compressor part itself doesn't seem much louder than a much weaker model I recently had, it's all the crummy fan. And in addition to being annoying, I have to wonder if this poor balance will shorten the life of the parts.

The collection bucket was poorly assembled from the factory. It consists mainly of 2 parts, the large white bucket and a clear lid which prevents re-evaporation. The lid is not supposed to be removable (the handle assembly makes this impossible), but it wasn't fully snapped in place. Easily fixed, but a sad statement.

There are so many of these things under different brand names. There are more brands of dehumidifiers here than there are flavors of ice cream or soda at a grocery store. It's ridiculous, and they are all junk for various reasons not directly related to the most expensive core technological component. There is no particular reason to get this one. I tried this one because it's a ""real"" brand, but it turns out it's just another piece of trash.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Michael,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2021","Well, it is definitively an impressive dehumidifier. It reduced humidity from 71 to 35 in just one hour (in Continuous Mode). I adjusted it to 40, and the dehumidifier kept the humidity level to 40 all the time, even after taking a shower. Incredible!

BUT...

The Frigidaire's customer service is mediocre. I mean, if your dehumidifier gets broken, and you think Frigidaire will resolve your problem in a timely manner, all I can say is, good luck.

My dehumidifier stopped working two weeks after its first use. It was showing the error code: EC, which I don't know what it means but Frigidaire cannot repair it. The problem is, I spent all morning with the fabricant, after providing them with all the information they requested.

After the first hour of conversation, Frigidaire (the fabricant) told me I can still use the Amazon 30-day return policy. However, Amazon didn't has this in stock, and I wanted the same model. My hero was the Amazon's customer service who discussed the issue with Frigidaire to see if they can replace the unit (since Amazon didn't has it in stock). But the fabricant took another hour to figure out that the issue should be transferred to another Frigidaire's department. And that other department never answered us the call because they were too busy. At the end, Frigidaire was completely incompetent and unable to resolve the issue in a timely manner.

The fabricant made me waste my day for nothing. So after that, the Amazon's customer service representative suggested me to just use the 30-day money back guarantee, and I see if I can get it in another website (since I didn't want another model, and Amazon don't know when it will be back in stock). Amazon handled the issue very well. My concern is Frigidaire's customer service.

So, the end of the story: I used the Amazon's guarantee, and I purchased the same model in another website, and I'm waiting for the new one because I saw how powerful is this thing. This dehumidifier is definitively impressive. That's the reason why I give it 3 stars. I cannot give it 5 stars because of the mediocre Frigidaire's customer service.

Now, if I'm unlucky again with the next unit, I will let you know, and I will come back here to give it one star and move on to another dehumidifier brand. But so far, I'm impressed, let's see how it goes. I'll let you know.",3.0 out of 5 stars

We finally got around and called Frigidaire since it was less than a year from delivery and the Amazon listing noted that there was a warranty period. Frigidaire refused to help us because they told us the seller was not an authorized seller and the warranty was voided. We then contacted Amazon, who took down our story and said they would contact the seller for us, and would stand behind their (Amazon's) listing. The seller, Reverse Logistics Center, contacted us and wanted to know about the issue. We asked for a refund of our money since it was under the warranty period stated on Amazon. They countered with offering a refurbished unit, not a new unit. Beggars can't be choosers, so we accepted. The unit arrived within a couple of days (this time, upright in the manufacturer's box), and so far it is working fine.

Bruce,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2024","I loved this unit for the two summers I used it, but it failed afterwards. Being it was used in my main living space in my non-air conditioned home, I used the unit only in the evening and overnight hours as it generated a fair amount of heat when the compressor was active. So, its use was not constant. I kept it clean and cared for it and it did a wonderful job. It worked wonderfully up until I stored it this past winter. When I pulled it out to use for this summer, the compressor would not come on in spite of the high humidity readings in the room and a properly set machine. Sadly, there appears to be many such stories such as mine. One should probably take with a grain of salt the reviews that are glowingly written after only a few weeks of use. I do believe that a unit that I paid a lot of money for should have a life more than a limited two year span (really, only about 8 months of use and only at nighttime).

David B.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2021","I purchased this on behalf of my father but had it shipped to my address first. When I received it, I noticed that the box was kind of banged up, there were dings in a couple of the sides and it was clear that it had been dropped on one of the bottom corners. This was confirmed when I opened the box and noted that the bottom piece of styrofoam was cracked. I did a visual review of the exterior of the dehumidifier and found no damage. When I pulled the bucket, I noted that the float appeared to have been dislodged and was in the bottom of the bucket. I presume it was dislodged, because I felt if it was deliberately unattached, it would have been packaged and situated to prevent it from rattling around. I had to remove the plastic top of the bucket to retrieve and reattach the float. I plugged the unit in, turned it on, and set the humidity level low and let it run though the afternoon and overnight. It filled the bucket and shut off shortly before morning. I emptied the bucket and noted that it was not designed efficiently for pouring. After pouring out most of the water, I had to turn the bucket in order to get the rest of the water into position to get emptied out. Being satisfied that the unit was still in working order, I took it to my father and we installed it in his basement. We attached a hose to the Continuous Drain connection and turned the unit on again. Within minutes, water began dripping out of the hose. It worked quietly and efficiently. The only other thing that puzzled me about the design of the unit was the base. Either it was not designed to be operated without the wheels or if the wheels could be removed, then it was not well designed to sit on a flat surface, there was only a small triangular base that would touch the floor and it did not appear to be well suited for stability without the wheels. Dad has had it for a week now and has reported no issues with it.

Nicole,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2023","Does this do its job? Yes, definitely, but please take note of my complaints...

1. This thing LOVES to beep. It will beep when it's full. It will beep when you take the bucket out to dump it. And I don't just mean a single beep. It probably beeps 10 times each. And it's loud! I have this in the basement and can hear it on the ground level. If you are using this in a room you actually use, I imagine it would be even more annoying. It would definitely be impossible to sleep through the beeping.

2. The rated size seems incorrect. I got the 22 pint, rated for covering 2400 square feet. It's in a 700 square foot basement, so less than 1/3 the maximum area. It fills up twice a day. If it were in a 2400 square foot room, I can't even imagine how often it would need to be emptied.

3. Even besides the beeping, it is not quiet. I have never owned a dehumidifier so maybe it's normal for it to sound like a loud fan, but the image on the product description saying it's as quiet as a library is completely misleading. Again, I have this placed in a basement, but if everything is quiet on the main level, I can hear this thing running downstairs.

Overall, it does what it's supposed to, but I honestly regret thinking that a familiar brand name was worth the price increase compared to the random foreign Amazon brands.",3.0 out of 5 stars
AverageJoe,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2023","This dehumidifier did an amazing job at clearing moisture from spaces. Its noise level wasn't too bothersome. Ease of setup and operation made it enjoyable to work with. However, it ultimately had to go back for one reason and that is something that plagues any product like this. The amount of heat it puts out to do its job offsets the value it provides. Keep this away from where you regularly sit and relax.

Better yet talk to your HVAC repairman about putting a permanent setup into your primary duct work. They make units that will install directly above your coils and condition the air moisture as its leaving the main duct. That setup just requires you to do a season knob adjustment between winter and summer to change desired humidity levels.

Bottom line: If you're going to buy this and use it, keep it installed in your basement near the intake for your HVAC cold-air returns. At least that way it will condition the air your HVAC is cycling back out into the house. If you put this in a regular living space it will heat up that space.",4.0 out of 5 stars

kat,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2022","We purchased this unit because of good reviews from testing sites. We run a dehumidifier non stop in our RV in a coastal area with a lot of rain. Our first was a Keystone which worked great for 6 years, then started leaving water on the floor. Since it was not ranked as high we chose the Frigidaire.
First the Frigidaire doesn't have carry handles on the sides. We move it in and out of the RV or people moving it downstairs will find it slick to hold on. These are fairly big and heavy.
It has a hose attachment at the back. It warns to make sure it is tightly closed when not using a hose but we didn't. Water on the floor, but once tightly closed it is fine.
This unit does not pump warm air into the room as our other one did. Having warm air was nice in the RV but not needed in our house. This frigidaire fan pumps a lot of air but it is cool.
The air must be able to reach the back in order to take out the moisture. We always left our old one next to the cabinet to save on space, but noticed this one was not taking out the same amount of water overnight. It had to come out 12 inches into the room to work better.

no body,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2023","purchased direct from Frigidaire.

The controls for this unit are somewhat restrictive. It starts on the Continuous function, during which you can't see the relative humidity display. The humidity control has a range of 35-60. You cannot go higher, and below 35 is Continuous mode. I set the speed to low. The fan is quite powerful.

The unit draws air through the back and blows it through its right, or your left. Can kind of be rotated if you don't like that. Being a refrigerant dehmidifier, it does generate quite a bit of heat.

I really liked the water storage tank. The handle makes it easy to carry, and it didn't feel heavy. There are a number of openings through which you can pour the water, but this also means that the tank can release water back into the atmosphere when the unit isn't in operation. The unit will flash the ""full"" light whenever the limit switch is open, including when you remove the tank, which is nice and annoying at the same time.

The tank holding compartment design is where it fails. There is a tank retaining clip and it is FRAGILE. I've only removed the tank about 4 times, and on that 4th time, I couldn't get the tank to ""snap"" in. The left side would pop out slightly, and it was ""loose"". Upon inspection, there was a shiny clip below the tank limit switch that seemed to have bent when I pushed the tank into it. I am not sure what its original form is, but it seemed like it was attached to the top of the cube part, and it had broken off when the tank was lifted(during removal). This caused the shiny piece to drop down, where before it was in a semi-horizontal triangle.

Fortunately, I was able to ""fix"" it. This involves manually bending the clip around until the top JUST rests on top of the cube, and the middle has to have enough bend to allow the bottom to clear the limit switch, shown in picture. If it does not clear the switch, the unit will not stop if it overflows. If you're unable to do this, I hypothesize that it'd be possible to put tape on the top of the cube and attach it to the end of the clip so that it normally rests in a horizontal position.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Thankfully there is just about a month left of the manufacturers warranty and hoping they send a new one. But ultimately if I'm spending $250 or more, i expect to get more than 5-6 months use out of a product. Frigidaire has provided us with many hard working appliances in the past, and many we still have in the house, but sadly this has really put a bad taste in my mouth about purchasing another Frigidaire dehumidifier in the future.

Edit: Now on a month of back and forth with them regarding my warranty replacement that was submitted May 22nd and approved May 29th. Told to watch for email stating that it was shipping and to contact them in 5 days if i saw nothing. Of course i got no contact from them in the week following. I've had to call and be on hold with them for hours on June 10th, June 17th and June 24th and its the same generic run around ""oh, yes, i see there isn't any updates on your account, let me put in a contact for you and get that going and yes, please give it another 7-10 days to receive an update on your account/replacement/shipping"". It is nonsense. Currently on hold with them for over an hour now. NEVER AGAIN will i buy another Frigidaire and I will make sure everyone i know hears of this as well. The breaking of the unit in less than a year is nonsense, but the unwillingness to actually follow through with their warranties is disgraceful. I will be putting in a complaint to the BBB or whoever else i can find to flag this companies practices.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2021","While after a few hours, I managed to get the float device attached in the water collection bin, the biggest barrier was the plastic cover on the bin itself. It looks like it can be removed but I was afraid to force it out of fear of breaking or cracking it. If the float comes loose again I'm afraid of the hoops I have to jump through to reconnect it. If anyone has been able to remove this seemingly useless plastic covering please let me know. I will revise this review after I have had the opportunity to test its efficiency and the pump function. I have found customer service to be horrible and unresponsive.

Update July 22: I discovered from reading all customer questions that the plastic splash cover does come off and the procedure for doing so, although I haven’t tried to remove it yet. I was also able to figure out which hose opening to use with the pump, again by reading customer responses to questions, so thank you Amazon customers! As far as customer service goes, to clarify, I rate the helpfulness from the manufacturer a zero. One Amazon customer service rep did her best to help me but we kept missing connections. When I attempted to call again, a second rep was willing to help but while she was trying to contact the manufacturer while I waited on the line, a different rep picked the phone up which meant I would have to go through my whole spiel again. By this time I was so fed up I decided to forget the whole thing. Then I read all the customer q and a and finally got my answer. So Amazon's customer service was great in one respect and poor in another - if that makes any sense.

The pump has given up. It's out of warranty so the only recouse is an afer market pump which I will try. I'm downgrading this to two stars. My guess is the dehumdifier will go in another year or so. It seems all these units come from the same factory in China and all have limited life expectancies. I tried one of the commerical units and suspect it would hold up longer (3 to 5 year warranties) but it was way too noisy.

Original review 7/2022
Seems like a solid product and does the trick. I've had it running in our very damp basement (relative humidity was 76% before we started) for the past several days and we are now down to relative humidity of 40% according to our humidistat.

What I like:

1. the pump kicks in automatically when the bucket fills and sends it via a small hose where you want it. I don't know yet how much lift this pump can support but will be finding out as we direct this water outside via a basement window which will need a lift of about 8'.
2. the compressor stops when it reaches the set point. The fan stops shortly thereafter.
3. it is quiet enough but clearly it generates white noise which might be an issue in a bedroom.

Why not five stars:

1. the packaging is way too excessive. what a total waste. Too much styrofoam, plastic, and cardboard. Yes, I understand this comes from China but why wrap the power cord in a bunch of plastic, the instruction manual in plastic, and the whole thing in plastic and then surround it all by styrofoam and double thickenss cardboard. All of this held together with industrial tape!
2. There are two water outlets on the rear; one is for continuous draining and the other via the pump. I'd have preferred a single output and a garden hose attachement for both rather than the rather unimpressive 1/4"" plastic hose with a push fitting to the rear. time will tell how this stands up.

This is our second unit and we like the larger size and pump. It's worth the extra cost and has done a better job of drying out the room. We've exiled the smaller unit to the unfinished basement where I can drain it using a regular hose to a drain as it has no pump.

If I run into issues I will update this review. I have had a number of bad experiences with all the China manufactured dehumidifiers but this one does seem to have a better overall build quality. We shall see.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Jason,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2023","I have an old small house in Florida that I've lived in for about 30 years. It gets humid inside the ~1400 sf of air conditioned space. I had an older version of this dehumidifier for years and it never quit. I decided to ""upgrade"" to a whole house dehumidifier that is connected to my A/C system so I got rid of the old portable dehumidifier. The whole house system cost me about $5000 by the time it was installed and it sucks!

I ended up getting one of these newer portable dehumidifiers and it works just as well as my old one but has the exact same problems that one did. Things I don't like about it: 1. It is loud. Louder than a refrigerator. Put it at least two rooms away from where you plan to sleep. 2. It takes up space (not tucked in a closet or attic like a dedicated unit would be). 3. It is messy to empty. I don't know why they don't make a better pouring spout for these things. Just dump it out quickly in a bathtub or outside to avoid a mess.",3.0 out of 5 stars
S. Colley,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2023","I LOVE this dehumidifier. Everything about it exudes good design and quality.

It has straight forward, easy to use and understand controls. It has a convenient, hide-away handle for moving it up/down stairs. The front even has a nice red line that moves up and down with the level of the water in the reservoir, which also has a convenient carrying handle. And best of all - for me - is that it has a pump that can push the water through a small hose (which is supplied) to a higher draining location. I use mine in a cellar, and the drain is much higher than the floor, so and drain water has to go ""up hill"", as it were, and this unit does it easily. From the manual it's clear that one use case the maker envisioned was using the unit in a cellar or basement, and pumping water up to and out a ground level window.

While I can't provide an objective measure of such, it appears to rip humidity out of the air very quickly. If there is any downside at all, is that it is not silent. It's not loud per se, but it is audible. From five feet away, with the fan at the highest speed, it's just below 58 decibels, or a bit more quiet than a normal conversation. With the fan on the lowest speed that drops down to 52 decibels, or the level of a quiet refrigerator. And it's heavy, but I assume that's and outcome of being solidly built.

All in all I'm delighted with this dehumidifier, and recommend it without reservation.",5.0 out of 5 stars
UmpStu,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2024","I bought this Frigidaire product in May 2023 as I had purchased a larger one of the same brand several years ago. That one worked perfectly for 4 seasons (these are only used for 4-5 months during the summer), then it failed.

This new product worked for 4.5 months and it was put away for the winter in my basement (no possibility of freeze). When I tried to use it in May 2024, it would not reduce the humidity. The fan ran but nothing else was working. I contacted Electrolux (the Frigidaire parent company) and was sent an electronic form which I filled out. On May 24, 2024, I received an email from Electrolux informing me I was eligible for a free replacement, and it further advised that if I hadn’t received a confirmation within 5 working days of the email, I should again call customer service.

4 Jun 2024 – Call #2 - I waited 10 days and then called. I was informed that my request was pending. I asked how it could be pending when I got an email response telling me it had been approved. The representative then put me on hold for about 10 minutes and came back and said that the shipping was pending but the replacement for my unit had been approved and that I should hear something when it was scheduled to ship.

25 Jun 2024 – Call #3 - After another 21 days had passed and I still had not been contacted I called again. I spoke with a different agent (foreign), who advised me she couldn’t find anything in the records regarding my claim other than a note from the prior agent I spoke with advising that he was requesting a shipping date of 3 June 2024. Only the “back office” had the information and initiated contact with customers so this agent was not able to email me with what the response to her request would be.

Stay away from this company and do a little research before you buy one to ensure it's not from the Electrolux parent company. The front-line customer service folks are great, but all the decision making is done higher up, and those folks are not reachable.",1.0 out of 5 stars
B. Hamlin,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2023","It was recommended to me that a dehumidifier would be helpful in getting the ""old house"" smell out of our new property. I had used them before but didn't think this would be enough to be helpful with the overall smell. It was less than a week when we started to notice that the musty smell was going away.

The ""setup"" if you can call it that was incredibly easy. I took it out of the box and plugged it in. That was it. I ran a hose from the back of the unit to my sump and I was done. With that said, i read the instructions thoroughly to ensure I was doing as i should.

I will say this is pretty loud. We cannot hear it in the basement but you do hear it when you are down there. It doesn't drown out conversation but it is noticeable. The functions at the top are a breeze. You will need to ""reset"" it once in a while so that it can cycle through a clean out but really thats it.

This is an effective and user friendly unit. I am really pleased that this was the solution to our issue. You are able to see it working by seeing the reservoir fill or the water coming from the hose.

Kelly Fernandez,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2024","I bought this dehumidifier in March 2023. The unit worked amazingly well for 1 year. I mean honestly it worked very very well!

In the beginning of April 2024, my dehumidifier started to develop frost on the coils, and then it started to produce an error code ""EC."" The manual instructed me that this error code meant my dehumidifier needed to be repaired. I called customer service and they also told me that it needed to be repaired, and helped me schedule a repair appointment. The repair appointment cost me $100 since my dehumidifier was a few weeks outside of its covered warranty. When the repairman came, he said that he could not repair the device and then left within 5 minutes. I called Frigidaire customer service twice to get a refund for my appointment and they said they could not issue it since the repairman came already. Had I known the unit couldn't be repaired (i.e. if the manual and customer service didn't recommend me trying to get it repaired) I would have just bought a new dehumidifier from Frigidaire. But, due to their shit customer service, I bought a homelabs dehumidifier and I can tell you already that it's much quieter!

So basically, this dehumidifier works well but it there's a good chance it will break after a year or so (outside of its warranty). Also know that Frigidaire customer service is quite awful, and there are not a lot of resources on the web to repair this dehumidifier on your own. Best of luck!",2.0 out of 5 stars
WK,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2023","I previously bought another dehumidifier because I didn't want to spend the money for a Frigidaire even though we had two Frigidaire dehumidifiers and they lasted 20 years (one recently stopped working). I made a huge mistake! The other model took a day and a half to fill the tank. I ended up returning the other one and broke down and spent the money for the Frigidaire. It's just as amazing as our 20-year-old dehumidifier with keeping our basement dry only better. Now they come with a pump option to have it drain into your wash basin (the hose is super long!) or wherever you what it to or you can use the garden hose option or empty the tank manually (for an average basement you would need to empty it twice). I have been using the pump option and it is unbelievable! You get what you pay for! In this case, it is well worth spending the money for peace of mind!!
The only con I have is that it doesn't have the added handle in the front of the tank to lift the bucket if you go with manually emptying it. Our old one has that. Not that we use it now, but it would be good for people who need to empty it manually. Makes it easier to pull out the bucket. The other issue some might find troublesome, it is not quiet. But is prefect for a basement.

Others have experienced this within 1 year. I read 1 person contacted corporate (their unit died right after warranty expired). The unit was not repairable and was offered 50% off a new unit.

Dave Shepherd,"Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2022","I play the double bass. I keep my two basses in a basement-level bedroom with the door closed. It's important to me that the temperature and humidity stay pretty steady. I aim for around 50% relative humidity.

This dehumidifier does an excellent job of controlling the relative humidity level in my bass room right around 50%. No matter what the humidity is in the rest of the house, with the door closed, my bass room stays between about 49% and 54% all the time.

The unit is quiet on the lowest setting. However, I do turn it off when I am actually practicing the bass. (The white noise level is just loud enough that I have a bit of trouble hearing fine details of the sound when it's running.)

One thing to be aware of is this: the unit does produce some heat. I have had to get used to practicing with the room temperature between about 79 and 81 degrees Fahrenheit (26-27 Celsius). It's not a problem for my basses, since the temperature is very steady. I hope that during the winter months that room temperature settles in closer to about 21-23 Celsius. It's not a problem as long as the temperature does not shift suddenly; and it doesn't with this unit.

[EDIT, October 14, 2022: Now that the outdoor temperatures are generally below 70F / 21C, I do not notice the unit heating up the room at all. It is still pulling moisture out of the air; I have to empty the bucket every couple of days or so.]

I am glad I bought the dehumidifier, and I'd buy another one in the future.

It is easy to operate and dump the water (there is a pump but I don't use it). The one major difference with this unit is it seems to always be running.

William H.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2023","So far I've experimented between running it on the ""continuous"" setting & running it to maintain a 50% RH level using all 3 fan settings. In all cases it uses approx. 280W. The power consumption is so close with every trial I'm probably just going to set it to 50% & leave it (even changing the fan speed has almost no effect on power consumption). At 50%, it hasn't shut down yet but I'm hoping as the seasons change the outdoor humidity will decrease & it will not need to run full time. It will reach 50% or about (the display increments in 5% intervals), just not low enough to quit running.

At this point I love it but wish I'd bought the next larger size. I would try to exchange this one if I could but don't feel right sending it back since there's nothing wrong with it. I live in the southeast where its very humid much of the year & should have gotten this long ago. It seems well built & isn't so noisy that it bothers me. The ""full tank"" alarm isn't overly loud & if you don't hear it go off it doesn't sound again but you can tell since the unit stops running so there's no fan noise.

When I called Frigidaire, they said they had processed the replacement request and I would receive another unit in 10 business days and to call them if I didn't hear from them. I called and the rep said that he knew the issue was the fact that Frigidaire doesn't honor ""Woot"" as an authorized reseller and he would fix the problem and call me back after it was sent out but never did. When I spoke with multiple reps afterword including a supervisor they all refused to acknowledge that Woot is Amazon (they bought it in 2010) and refused to complete the replacement that they had processed earlier. One rep even pasted a script that I hadn't waited the 7-10 business days after I had already waited 18 business days since the initial ""processing"". Customer Service was among the worst I have ever experienced. Don't be fooled by this ""Frigidaire Store"". If Amazon decided to assign this product to their wholly owned subsidiary and you have a problem with your Frigidaire product you are toast in your invoice. You are toast. Its game over.

Last Frigidaire product (or any other Electrolux subsidiary) I will ever buy. The only way I would advise buying the product is if you add the maximum warranty choice to it. Given my experience in Frigidaire rejecting support from an unauthorized reseller, this warranty needs to be able to cover you no matter what Frigidaire does/says. I have no idea how these work so Caveat Emptor but it seems likely that your 3rd party warranty would likely work out despite Frigidaire giving you the cold shoulder if your invoice says ""Woot"". Considering how many EC error reports are out there within a relatively short period of time, the extra warranty would seem more worth it. Not that I would suggest throwing good money after bad but the 4+ year warranty offerings could solve a few problems (at least for the duration of your extended warranty).

Steven,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2021","I'm surprised how well this unit removes humidity from the air. Happy with the dehumidification performance. The unit is OK loud, it's about 47db on low but it's just fan noise mostly. The compressor is not overly loud. I wouldn't want to sleep next to it, but it does well in a large basement or room.

Some of the setting can only be access via the app, so make sure you setup the Wi-Fi and use the app. You can't control the ionizer, the blue indicator light, and the child lock without the app. That's dumb and I wish they put buttons on the unit for all the functions. The app works well once you get it setup, it can even turn on and off the dehumidifier besides changing all settings.

One issue I did have was being able to connect to my Wi-Fi. I'm not sure why but the unit did not like my Wi-Fi router, it took so many tries to connect. I had to try over 20 times before it finally worked. For some reason this only happens with some Wi-Fi Routers, it would hang up with the error message no IP assigned. When I tried a different router it worked so I just keep trying over and over again with my original router till it worked.

Also the handle to move the unit around is nice, this thing is heavy at 50lbs, you don't want a crappy handle with a 50lb dehumidifier.

Lilithe,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2022","My husband and I recently bought a new house that happened to be built in the 1940's. Lots of things were done differently back then and some things were not invented or commonly used yet, such as a vapor barrier for the foundation. As a result the partially finished basement felt gross. Despite being the coldest place in the house, the way your skin would almost feel wet just walking down there made it uninhabitable. I had never had a dehumidifier, but I thought this must be what they are for and did a ton of research to land on this model. The rooms in nearly the whole basement felt completely different after even a day and after a few days it was completely comfortable to hang out in. I was planning on using the basement for my office and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to use it, but this Dehumidifier not only fixed the office itself but even the larger den area outside the room.

Pros:
- Pulls an unimaginable amount of moisture out of the air, it honestly astonishes me how much water ends up in the bucket.
- Works for a surprisingly large amount of space (Nearly the entire basement for me)
- Design looks pleasing to the eye
- Easy UI and setup

Cons:
- Relatively loud
- Creates a lot of heat, my basement is no longer the coolest part of the house(worth it to me)
- While being able to hook up a hose is convenient, it will not drain into a utility sink. I am fairly sure it just isn't able to force it up the hose and just uses gravity. If you have a floor drain for it to go into this would not be a problem though.

Abraxas,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2023","Ordered about 5 months ago and so far everything is going well, granted over winter it's not been running too often. When I first got it set up there was a *huge* improvement in the humidity level vs the old, cheap dehumidifier. It's run in a basement that now has a lot of aqauriums in it, so especially in the summer there's a lot of humidity to deal with.

It would be nice if the noise level was a bit lower, but it's not terrible and more often runs at a quieter volume. Only had a minor issue with rattling/excessive noise compared to it's normal max volume, but just repositioning it a tiny bit fixed the issue.

Only major disappointment is the wifi app, it's really not worth the extra money compared to the equivalent of this brand without. So if that's something you're debating like I initially had, just go eith the other one.
Would appreciate it far more if it clearly said what the *current* humidity level is at, not just the goal humidity. As well, I would really appreciate a history chart logging the actual humidity.",4.0 out of 5 stars
WJ,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2024","This was a pretty good dehumidifier for the humidity during the August /Sept of 2022 and All of summer of 2023. In mid August of 2024 it quit with error code EC.
There was ice all over the back on the filter and a puddle on the floor as it was melting.
Apparently this EC code is an internal error not serviceable by a the purchaser and funny how this happens 2 days after I am out of warranty.
Sadly I am looking for a different brand for my next dehumidifier.",2.0 out of 5 stars
CJM,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2023","Had it for about two weeks with no problems, exceppppppt, when I installed a hose to get the continuous water flow and not empty the tank, it didn’t work. The tank still got full and the machine stopped. I put I on my kitchen sink counter with the hose going directly in the sink and it still filled and stopped. I looked online like a mad man trying to figure out if I was doing something wrong, but found nothing. Just attach the hose, make sure no leaks and turn on machine. That’s all, even company’s website, I found it said. Somewhat frustrating. Any way I’m keeping it. It does do a nice job for my small trailer home, but I got to figure out this continuous water flow thing.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Muttley,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2021","I bought this unit for my basement which gets over 65% humid in summers. I first started using it with its bucket but soon enough I realized it is impossible to keep up with emptying it. So I bought a hose. Here is my first suggestion: do not buy frigidaire hose. It is horrible and leaks l. Buy a heavy duty garden hose 3/4 inch size. Then you won't have leak issues. After attaching hose you need some elevation. If you do not have any then, hose efficiency may drop. So bucket starts filling at a slower rate. Some water goes to bucket and some to hose. After a week you may get an alert that bucket is full. A small elevation prevents this issue.

It is not quiet. Especially in the hi fan setting. So put it in somewhere it would not matter much. At low and medium settings it is better.

If your aim is to dehumidify a multistorey house it will disappoint you. I think it is mostly for large but closed spaces. It can decrease my basement humidity from 67% to 52% but the effect is much less pronounced on upper floors. However when I put this unit to my really humid garage (pretty large) then it has no issues getting it down to 45% even at low setting.

What I like most about it is the app and wifi connection. It has not let me down. I could even adjust settings and turn it on/off from out of state locations which is handy. I wish it was Alexa compatible ( I guess it is not) but otherwise it is pretty reliable.

One last minor thing is that you may get false alerts about filter. Often time filter is fine so don't even bother taking it out and checking it. Just press reset button and see if it will fix the issue. If the alarm comes back, then take a look.
In summary, I am happy with the purchase. It has limitations but if you set expectations rights, you will like it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I'm Just a Dude who Buys,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2023","This dehumidifier does one thing really well, and that’s dehumidify. It has no bells and whistles to bloat the cost and complicate the interface. Just some simple controls for auto-on/off and fan speed.

I haven’t tried the built-in pump, but when I do I will update this review.

It’s smart home compatible! What does that mean? Does it have a wifi chip and a built in computer? No, it’s simpler than that, when it loses power at the cord and the power comes back, the unit turns on to its last state. I plugged it into an Eve Smart Plug (but this will work with any smart plug) so when the humidity gets high (via my sensors around the house) the unit gets power, and when the humidity gets low, the smart plug cuts power. It’s almost magical.",4.0 out of 5 stars
aman5,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2024","I never write reviews but this product warrants it. It really does a fantastic job of removing moisture out of the air. I live in a place where it can get humid but not hot in the winter. It makes no sense to try and run the AC but I could not stand that awful sticky feeling and the possibility of mold growth. The unit itself is relatively quiet. The fan makes noise but it is more like a white noise so you don't notice it after a while. The wheels make it easy to maneuver. I bought the 50 pint version for my 2200 sq ft home and it will drop humidity 10 percent in an hour or so. Less concerned about cost to run, as I only run it when needed. If you need a dehumidifier this is the one to buy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
One Realizer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2023","This was a replacement for an older model of pretty much the same unit. The new one has 3 fan settings, two of which are quieter than the old one, which had only one speed. We love that! The new control panel is an improvement as well. The only drawback is that the water reservoir has lower sides, which makes it more difficult to empty without splashing water on the floor. If carried by the handle alone, it is manageable, if not a little heavy.
Some reviews have said that this model has broken down and been problematic. It's too new for me to weigh in on that, but I hope I've got another good one. I'd recommend it based on my experience so far.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Olde Fogey,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2024","I've previously purchased Frigidaire, 90 pint, dehumidifiers for over 30 years. On average, they lasted about 5 years which I felt was a fair trade off. In 2020 the DOE changed the rules about capacity. Google it. Now, the 90 pint equivalent is 50 pints, which is the largest you can buy.

I moved in 2020, and have a 1900sf very humid basement. I had to buy 2 of these dehumidifiers from an appliance store, which were then, the top rated model for portable de-humidification. Both failed after one season and beyond the warranty period. I bought 2 more from a BB store the following year. They both failed.

In 2023 I ordered two from Amazon. One failed within the Amazon return period and Amazon sent a new one. The other failed beyond the return period and, after supplying documentation, Frigidaire sent me a new one. I used them for one summer season.

This summer, when I started them up, they both failed. Both were still within the Frigidaire 1 year warranty period. I contacted Frigidaire, supplied the required information and received an e-mail saying that my replacements had been approved. That was in May. I never received them despite repeated calls.

They work great if, and when, they work. But they don't last. You'll be lucky to get a full season of use from these.

When reviewers rate dehumidifiers they test them in the same environment. They don't test how long they last. Since 2020, I've gone through 8 of these dehumidifiers having spent well in excess of $1500.

I'm having an Aprilaire E080, whole house dehumidifer professionally installed. These are sold here on Amazon but Aprilaire will only honor the 5 year warranty if it's professionally installed.

Do yourself a favor. Save your money. Don't buy these. If you do, purchase the Asurion warranty. You may, or may not, get your money back.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Leslie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2023","To be completely transparent I was hesitant to spend this much on a dehumidifier but I am so glad I did!

Our house is two stories with very high ceilings, and approximately 3000 square feet. It works for our entire house! I purchased humidity gauges for our downstairs master bath, kitchen, powder room, and for various rooms upstairs such as bedrooms, office, bathrooms, and our son's playroom. All the the gauges are within 1% of each other. We have the dehumidifier upstairs. Our master bathroom, which is located downstairs, the furthest away from the dehumidifier, is exactly what it says upstairs most of the time and the few times it is not, the humidity gauge is within .1-.9% range.

The dehumidifier has wheels on the bottom and is extremely easy to move to another room as we moved it several times when we first purchased to determine where we wanted to keep it permanently.

When the dehumidifier turns on and off it is very quiet. It will alert you when the tank is full by beeping a couple times and the light indicator on the top will let you know as well after the beep notification. Also, it has a water level which can be viewed quickly as you walk by the dehumidifier. The tank slides out very smoothly and the handle on the tank makes emptying it super simple.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JWB,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2023","I'm a veteran of dehumidifiers. They usually last two or three years in my walkout finished basement, even though I check and clean filters regularly. The environment is quite clean, but the humidity can reach 55% or more during certain times of the year. I usually like to set the dehumidifier to 45 or 50% and let it run, either pumping or draining the moisture to a floor drain. So far, this unit lives up to the good reviews. Even on high, the fan isn't too noisy for me. The compressor adds an almost unnoticeably low hum. I'll add that the open area I need it to cover is 800-1000 square feet and the unit is located where it wouldn't disturb anyone. If it were used in a bedroom, the medium or low fan would probably be appropriate, along with a smaller unit. I set it up on constant run for a day as directions suggested. I now have it set to 45% and am listening to it cycle on and off as it senses rises in humidity. It appears to be reasonably accurate according to the inexpensive hygrometer I have. I have a meter connected at present that indicates about 520 watts with the fan and compressor running. This is a pleasant surprise since I expected greater power consumption. At present, I would say that this unit is the best I have owned so far. If it lasts beyond two years (my last Home Lab lasted two), I'll be even happier.",5.0 out of 5 stars
BrodyA,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2024","I don't think I care about the maneuverability of a dehumidifier as much as I care that it dehumidifies. And that the sensor is accurate, and that it's fairly quiet.

R. Reed,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2023","I've had this for a little over a month now and it's done a pretty good job keeping my main living area comfortable without keeping the AC constantly running.

It's a little louder than I expected, so I try to run it during hours when I'm not in the room the unit is located.

The idea of having this Wifi connected is a bonus, but the app features are pretty limited and the unit always loses connection.

App feature requests:
(1) FIX THE CONNECTIVITY!!!!! Wifi connection always drops and I have to unplug/plug the unit back in. It almost makes paying extra for that feature a waste of money.
(2) Offer on/off schedules in app. I don't always run the unit, so I'd like to be able to schedule when the unit comes on/off. The current timer feature doesn't do this.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Don,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2023","This dehumidifies the room well, but now my room is 80 degrees. Will increase room temp by 5-10 degrees. A few times it randomly stopped but then somehow turned itself back on again. So far had this for a month and it’s been decent so far. I don’t run it constantly , only at night time or when I have clothes drying. The heat it gives off will shrink sensitive clothing fabrics as they dry.

B. Pearlman,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2024","I had the unit in my basement set to continuous drain (didn't end up needing the pump so never tried that). The unit worked well enough for about a year and a half but I noticed a couple months ago it didn't seem to be running as it always did. Noticed an error code of EC on the display, which seems to indicate an internal compressor fault of some kind. Tried the troubleshooting of unplugging it to reset the code, checked the air filter and to see if there was any obvious damage to it. This worked to turn the unit back on for the fan, but after a few hours (?) or less the code showed up again. Checked the drain hose and even undid the hose to let it drain to the internal tank but after several days of trying this (unplugging to reset the code) there was no water being drawn out even when the fan was running. I have another Frigidaire unit without the pump that is about the same age that works fine. Of course this is well past the one year warranty but an appliance of this type shouldn't die this early.",2.0 out of 5 stars

DCDudlak,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2024","Same complaint as many of the other ONE STAR reviews. Bought this item on Amazon in June of 2022. It lasted exactly two years. It was used in my basement. Only ran between the months of June to mid September. It stopped working June of 2024. Coils would freeze up starting from the bottom and going upwards over a period of 30 minutes. Filter was clean as well as all the evaporation and radiator coils. The unit was not placed less than 12 inches from the wall. All indications point to a refrigerant leak. The blower fan is pumping cool moist air. Use to blow warm dry air that came from the radiator. Now the radiator is cool to the touch. The evaporator coils are cold at the bottom but at the top they feel like the ambient air. I had another unit bought in 2021. Can't recall the brand however it lasted exactly one year. It stopped cooling altogether even though the compressor was running. This current unit comes with a ONE year warranty. Shows how much confidence the manufacture has it their product. Not surprising if you examine the guts of the dehumidifier. I watched several YOUTUBE videos on ""HOW TO FIX YOUR HUMIDIFIER"". Different brands having same problem as my unit. Guess what? The inside look exactly the same as mine. Several manufactures use the same supplier for the inner workings. Only difference is the outer shell and the logo. Can you find a real QUALITY dehumidifier that doesn't crap out in two years? Maybe I should be grateful. Most of the other complaints had units lasting much shorter than mine.",1.0 out of 5 stars
