PROS: Loaded with features, sleek controls, quiet, works well.

DETAILED REVIEW:
Let me preface this review by saying that I also own the original Molekule air purifier which costs about the same, so I will compare the two from time to time.

LG's PuriCare Air Purifier is made almost exclusively from plastic. The plastics are high quality and nicely finished, but the materials are nothing special. In contrast, the Molekule is made from brushed metal and has a leather strap.

The LG is also quite large. It is squat and wide. It looks like a futuristic trash can to me. The Molekule is smaller and sleeker with a built-in cord wrap.

When it comes to cleaning and features the LG absolutely trounces the Molekule.

The top panel of the LG is touch sensitive and has a large a bright display. The color of the display changes depending on the air quality condition. (FYI: those bright lights can be disabled by activating the sleep timer). You can also control the LG via the included remote or an app on your smartphone. The app is fully featured, but it took me a few tries to get the LG connected to my Wi-Fi network.

The LG has a smart mode, a boost mode, and a normal mode. In smart mode it will change the fan speed and mode automatically based on the air quality. Boost mode is truly unique. Basically, the top of the air purifier rises up and an additional fan turns on to blow the purified air into the room. You can also oscillate that fan. It's effective and unique. In this mode the fan speed can also be set to change automatically. Lastly, normal mode does not activate the boost feature.

The LG is unoticable on the lowest speed. Even the highest speed is not overly obtrusive. The Molekule was very loud when turned up to max.

The LG cleans the air effectively. My husband commented that the air in the room smelled fresher and cleaner when we replaced the Molekule with this LG. We have the purifier in our 14' x 10' foot living room which opens to a dining room and kitchen. I too have noticed that the air in the room has a cleaner smell to it. It's hard to describe, but it is noticeable. Moreover, the LG's auto fan mode works marvelously and instantly raises and lowers the fan speed based on air conditions. For instance when we blew out a candle that was across the room from the LG it almost instantly turned up the fan speed to clear out the smoke from the extinguished candle.

Replacing the large circular filter is easy. The panels are magnetically hold in place and the filer slides out without tools. Other than replacing the filter you need to wipe down the air quality sensor with a cotton swab every other month.

All in all... a terrific air purifier.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Ann Neris,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2021","After 4 hours of this being on in my upstairs attic room it felt like walking in to a hospital but without the smell of hospitals. I was able to take deeper breathe than normal.
The kids name it R2D2 ðŸ˜„
Besides using colors and numbers to clearly understand when the air of the room is clean, you can choose on the top to have it move side to side like fans do, also it allows you to adjust how strong it blows air.
With the app it will comunicate with your phone and give you diagnostics.
The remote control is simple but useful if you are within distance and dont want to get up.
Setting it up was like eating a banana, simple, quick and easy.
It has a sleep mode up to 8 hours, the good part about sleep mode is it turns off all the lights except one little light which indicates is in sleep mode ðŸ˜´ I personally like that feature because if I want to get away from everyone and go upstairs to take a nap the attic is the place to go, is a office, craft room, it has a reading area where we like to enjoy silence, read and take a nap because with lights off it can be dark.
Air ventilation up there is limited and is all carpet, with time the air felt heavy and we resourced to cleaning up there with a robot vacuum in order to not end up with asthma.
Now I have this feeling of not wanting to leave the room because of how good and clear it feels for me to breathe.
Another thing I notice is that my husband snores loud, if I'm watching TV I have to put the volume up, the last 3 days we have spend long hours up there he has taken numerous naps and he is snoring a lot less and much less louder, I have no clue if this has to do with having better quality air but at night when sleeping in our room he snores as usual and as traditional. The 3rd time I record him so he could see the difference. We decided to check our numbers and buy another one for our room.
In reality we had no idea how much of a difference it can be to have a air purifier, is air! How dirty can it be? Well it can and you get use to it, dont notice the difference until you have one of this cleaning one room and you leave that room to walk in to anotherone where suddenly the air can feel heavy.
I know the ticket is a big one, is 705 with tax but for me the difference is so noticeable that is worth the investment.
One last very important detail, this air purifier arrived in its own original big black box with big images of the unit and LG brand, anyone can see what it is inside, so if left at your door or porch it will be a nice temptation for porch pirates, make sure someone is home.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I'm just blown away by how incredible this Air Purifer is. We have a Dyson and a Vornado ... neither are a match this this LG's power, aesthetics, customizability, and technology.

So, first, download ""LG ThinQ"" app. Pairing to the app is no problem (just follow the step-by-step instructions). Once you have it paired with the app, you can change the speed via the app, check the air quality, etc. It's pretty cool! Then, teach Alexa the ""LG ThinkQ"" skill. Then, you can ask Alexa to ""Activate LG air purifier,"" ""Turn off LG air purifier,"" etc. You will hear a series of tones from the air purifier and this indicates that command is being employed. You think you don't need the voice command ... until you have it! Then, it's super handy! (Especially, when you are cooking).

Now, we left this on turbo overnight. When I came out of my bedroom, the entire house smelled really ""crisp."" It's hard to put into words, but it wasn't merely ""clean,"" it was really pleasant.

And, I really like how this helps with those nose-blind moments. Sometimes we finish cooking, eating, cleaning-up ... and, it feels like our home is back to normal. And, then I see this is lit up yellow and I know that odors definitely remain. And, it is so gratifying to finally see the color change back to happy green!

I uploaded a video of this operating a full speed. You can hear that even on ""turbo,"" the noise level is relatively low. Our heating/cooling system is louder (and that's pretty quiet).

This really provides such peace-of-mind. And, I expect it to be genuinely helpful in the spring and fall when my seasonal allergies are moderately active.

This outshines all like products ... by a hundred miles.

Totally incredible! Very, very highly recommended! So much ""WOW!""",5.0 out of 5 stars
Lisa,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2021","I am actually very amazed with this product. It is both an air filter and a fan in one. The top can come up and til to act as a regular fan. It is the quietest air filter I have ever used. I have tried a handful of less expensive and very expensive air filters from $50-800 dollars. This one is by far the quietest. It is also made in Korea. The filter is very easy to change out, but it is a custom size so you will have to dig for alternative replacement filters. The frame is held together by strong magnets. It is a very heavy air filter so it is made to stay in place. It is good for a larger room. Does not come with a carbon filter so you will have to buy that separately, especially if you have pets. Overall, it is a very good filter and worth the investment.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Melrel05,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2021","Iâ€™m going to be honest, I thought that the pop up fan part of this air purifier was going to be gimmicky and would not really add much to how well it worked. But I live for air purifies as I have kids with allergies and asthma so I figured it would be worth a shot anyways. And boy am I glad I got this!

It works amazing! You can actually fell the air moving around the room, which I donâ€™t get with any of my other air purifiers. And one of those other air purifiers is over double the price as this one! It does have lots of settings and readings and stuff but honestly Iâ€™m one of those people that doesnâ€™t care much about the settings and readings, Iâ€™m more as long as itâ€™s working and Iâ€™ll change the filter when itâ€™s due.

There are a few downsides though. For starters itâ€™s pretty noisy. Itâ€™s not an annoying noise, but itâ€™s still noisy none the less. It also covers a much smaller area than others its size and price range. But honestly as long as itâ€™s working Iâ€™m ok with that. Overall Iâ€™m happy with it!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Eric and Liz Aderhold,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2021","I got this air purifier to help keep the air in my basement more breathable. I'm quite impressed with it so far!

The top of the unit has a colorful lighted circle that helps you tell at a glance what the current air quality is, from green (good) through to yellow and orange and red. There is a more detailed numeric display of parts per million of pollution as well.

The ""smart"" mode automatically adjusts the intensity of airflow based on the current air quality. When it's green the device is whisper quiet, blowing just a bit to ensure some air circulation around the sensor. When it gets up to yellow the fan kicks up a notch and is a bit louder. At orange or red levels, the entire top opens to blow air sideways rather than just straight up.

My basement tends to alternate between green and yellow levels with this air purifier on. It feels a bit better now down here than it did before I got the device.

The only negative thing I have to say about this is regarding the size. It's rather large. You might need to clear a fair amount of space in your house to make room for it.

That aside, I'm really very impressed with it. It should be useful year-round in my basement. With the occasional wildfires we have here in the Pacific Northwest I expect it to be a lifesaver in the rest of the house come summertime.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Antoinette,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2021","I watch LOTS of Korean television. I have seen this actual model on recent shows. I didn't know it was available in America. I'm glad that this new tech made it here. This air purifier is a step up from anything else on the market. The top of the unit flips up and rotates to circulate the air around it. This makes it more efficient and effective at air purification than the competition. The unit fits nicely in most rooms without being obtrusive. It's whisper quiet, so you can use it in a nursery with no problems. You can even operate it by voice command or via the app. If you're in the market for a high quality air purifier, I HIGHLY recommend this one.

Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5.0 out of 5 stars
MOCTODNOZAMA,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2021","This thing is a beauty! It's like R2D2's long lost cousin or something. LOL! You can control everything by app, set a schedule and you're good. It uses a True Hepa filter that is said to collect fine dust, ultra fine dust and allergens. It also has a carbon deodorization filter layer to remove, smog, airborne chemicals and odor, which is why anytime you cook, the led indicators change to red. That means your food is stinky. LOL! I have not gotten it to work with Alexa yet, but I'm looking forward to that. This single version will cover 310 sq ft. This seems like a new product to the market, so I don't think you can find any 3rd party filter replacements yet, so at the moment, if you need a new filter, gotta go directly to LG. Manual says to replace the whole filter every 1 year, but the PM 1.0 sensor should be cleaned every 2 months. BTW, this thing is super, super, super quiet. That's three supers!

One thing to consider when getting one of these air purifiers is that itâ€™s going to be in the middle of your room and you get a look at it all the time, so in addition to its functionality, looks are very important.

Monkeycow,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2021","Very quite and it really does the job, i rec'd a new air fryer unboxed and run a test before my first use. The airfryer has a super strong plastic smell after few minute start and also smoke my kitchen as well (Glad no fire), so i start my ventilation for almost 15minute and it still have strong smell so i decide to give this LG Air Purifier to try. OMG red light is on (BAD air) but it only take less than 2 minutes all plastic smell were gone and the lighting turn to green (good air).

So i was thinking maybe the air fryer was too new so i leave it unbox for 2 days and give it another try, er........same same strong plastic smell & smoke after few minutes, this time i'm smart i started the air purifier and let it run without my ventilation, YUP it work, took less than 2 minutes all smell are gone, boxed the air fryer & return it.

This LG air purifier is amazing, it has auto detection and there is different color of lighting telling you the status of the air, very strong but quite. Another feature i like is it can link with Alexa ^_^ super recommend this product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jack,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2021","I got this to install into my room. The setup is really easy just pull the side frames out, remove the filter cover, reinstall the filter, then put the side panels back on and turn it on! Thereâ€™s an included remote to control the air purifier and it comes with a battery. I noticed that after a few hours my room became odorless. It cleaned the air so well the room went from having a smell to smelling like nothing at all which is great! The air also feels fresher to breathe in and Iâ€™ve noticed my sleep has improved because of it! The build quality is really nice on this device and feels sturdy, as expected for the price tag. I was surprised at just how quiet this air purifier operates. Itâ€™s about the size of a small-medium stool and I keep it in the corner next to my bed but I can barely hear it. It just sounds like a near silent calming wind which again, helped me sleep! I also enjoy knowing I donâ€™t have to worry about the air quality in my room anymore since this filters just about everything out!

Sunny,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2021","Using this has helped make the air cleaner and much easier to breath in in my basement. Iâ€™ve noticed that it helps with snoring too.
It's very simple to set up and use. The top of the purifier has a lighted circle that alerts you to what the air quality is. Just like a traffic light green=good to go, yellow=okay, orange & red =increasingly worse. From the top you can also adjust how the air blows (EX: side to side) and how strong it blows. You can also connect your phone to the app and control it that way (can set up a schedule). This can even hook up to ALEXA. There are two modes: sleep mode which lasts 8 hours. During sleep mode all lights are off. Smart mode sets the strength of the airflow automatically. As the color goes from red to green, the device works harder and so there is more noise.
It is pretty big and powerful.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Beth K,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2021","I've had several top-brand air purifiers, but this one is superior! We are feeling the difference!
Easy set up right out of the box. It's fairly huge, but not an eye-sore. In fact, it's a cool, sleek, modern style.
It's quite heavy, which may deter my plan for moving it from room to room (since it only covers, per description, 305 sq ft and I'd love to use it in every room.)
Noticeable difference in air quality.
It has on/off button, mode button, air quality indicator (smart/booster/normal), and a fan button that connects wifi. The booster button controls fan booster. There is also a swing button, an indicator button to check concentration of the particles, and a sleep timer. We leave the fan speed on auto so it kicks on as needed.
It's fairly quiet on lower speeds.

This really provides such peace-of-mind. And, I expect it to be genuinely helpful in the spring and fall when my seasonal allergies are moderately active.

Melrel05,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2021","Iâ€™m going to be honest, I thought that the pop up fan part of this air purifier was going to be gimmicky and would not really add much to how well it worked. But I live for air purifies as I have kids with allergies and asthma so I figured it would be worth a shot anyways. And boy am I glad I got this!

It works amazing! You can actually fell the air moving around the room, which I donâ€™t get with any of my other air purifiers. And one of those other air purifiers is over double the price as this one! It does have lots of settings and readings and stuff but honestly Iâ€™m one of those people that doesnâ€™t care much about the settings and readings, Iâ€™m more as long as itâ€™s working and Iâ€™ll change the filter when itâ€™s due.

There are a few downsides though. For starters itâ€™s pretty noisy. Itâ€™s not an annoying noise, but itâ€™s still noisy none the less. It also covers a much smaller area than others its size and price range. But honestly as long as itâ€™s working Iâ€™m ok with that. Overall Iâ€™m happy with it!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Eric and Liz Aderhold,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2021","I got this air purifier to help keep the air in my basement more breathable. I'm quite impressed with it so far!

The top of the unit has a colorful lighted circle that helps you tell at a glance what the current air quality is, from green (good) through to yellow and orange and red. There is a more detailed numeric display of parts per million of pollution as well.

The ""smart"" mode automatically adjusts the intensity of airflow based on the current air quality. When it's green the device is whisper quiet, blowing just a bit to ensure some air circulation around the sensor. When it gets up to yellow the fan kicks up a notch and is a bit louder. At orange or red levels, the entire top opens to blow air sideways rather than just straight up.

My basement tends to alternate between green and yellow levels with this air purifier on. It feels a bit better now down here than it did before I got the device.

The only negative thing I have to say about this is regarding the size. It's rather large. You might need to clear a fair amount of space in your house to make room for it.

That aside, I'm really very impressed with it. It should be useful year-round in my basement. With the occasional wildfires we have here in the Pacific Northwest I expect it to be a lifesaver in the rest of the house come summertime.",5.0 out of 5 stars

So i was thinking maybe the air fryer was too new so i leave it unbox for 2 days and give it another try, er........same same strong plastic smell & smoke after few minutes, this time i'm smart i started the air purifier and let it run without my ventilation, YUP it work, took less than 2 minutes all smell are gone, boxed the air fryer & return it.

It's very simple to set up and use. The top of the purifier has a lighted circle that alerts you to what the air quality is. Just like a traffic light green=good to go, yellow=okay, orange & red =increasingly worse. From the top you can also adjust how the air blows (EX: side to side) and how strong it blows. You can also connect your phone to the app and control it that way (can set up a schedule). This can even hook up to ALEXA. There are two modes: sleep mode which lasts 8 hours.

Beth K,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2021","I've had several top-brand air purifiers, but this one is superior! We are feeling the difference!
Easy set up right out of the box. It's fairly huge, but not an eye-sore. In fact, it's a cool, sleek, modern style.
It's quite heavy, which may deter my plan for moving it from room to room (since it only covers, per description, 305 sq ft and I'd love to use it in every room.)
Noticeable difference in air quality.
It has on/off button, mode button, air quality indicator (smart/booster/normal), and a fan button that connects wifi. The booster button controls fan booster. There is also a swing button, an indicator button to check concentration of the particles, and a sleep timer. We leave the fan speed on auto so it kicks on as needed.
It's fairly quiet on lower speeds.

It is the quietest air filter I have ever used. I have tried a handful of less expensive and very expensive air filters from $50-800 dollars. This one is by far the quietest. It is also made in Korea. The filter is very easy to change out, but it is a custom size so you will have to dig for alternative replacement filters. The frame is held together by strong magnets. It is a very heavy air filter so it is made to stay in place. It is good for a larger room. Does not come with a carbon filter so you will have to buy that separately, especially if you have pets.

Miss Pink Lemonade,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2021","I'm just blown away by how incredible this Air Purifer is. We have a Dyson and a Vornado ... neither are a match this this LG's power, aesthetics, customizability, and technology.

So, first, download ""LG ThinQ"" app. Pairing to the app is no problem (just follow the step-by-step instructions). Once you have it paired with the app, you can change the speed via the app, check the air quality, etc. It's pretty cool! Then, teach Alexa the ""LG ThinkQ"" skill. Then, you can ask Alexa to ""Activate LG air purifier,"" ""Turn off LG air purifier,"" etc. You will hear a series of tones from the air purifier and this indicates that command is being employed. You think you don't need the voice command ... until you have it! Then, it's super handy! (Especially, when you are cooking).

Now, we left this on turbo overnight. When I came out of my bedroom, the entire house smelled really ""crisp."" It's hard to put into words, but it wasn't merely ""clean,"" it was really pleasant.

And, I really like how this helps with those nose-blind moments. Sometimes we finish cooking, eating, cleaning-up ... and, it feels like our home is back to normal. And, then I see this is lit up yellow and I know that odors definitely remain. And, it is so gratifying to finally see the color change back to happy green!

Anthony Pantliano,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2021","FAST FACTS:
PROS: Loaded with features, sleek controls, quiet, works well.
CONS: Large and a bit plasticky.

DETAILED REVIEW:
Let me preface this review by saying that I also own the original Molekule air purifier which costs about the same, so I will compare the two from time to time.

LG's PuriCare Air Purifier is made almost exclusively from plastic. The plastics are high quality and nicely finished, but the materials are nothing special. In contrast, the Molekule is made from brushed metal and has a leather strap.

The LG is also quite large. It is squat and wide. It looks like a futuristic trash can to me. The Molekule is smaller and sleeker with a built-in cord wrap.

When it comes to cleaning and features the LG absolutely trounces the Molekule.

The top panel of the LG is touch sensitive and has a large a bright display. The color of the display changes depending on the air quality condition. (FYI: those bright lights can be disabled by activating the sleep timer). You can also control the LG via the included remote or an app on your smartphone. The app is fully featured, but it took me a few tries to get the LG connected to my Wi-Fi network.

The LG has a smart mode, a boost mode, and a normal mode. In smart mode it will change the fan speed and mode automatically based on the air quality. Boost mode is truly unique. Basically, the top of the air purifier rises up and an additional fan turns on to blow the purified air into the room. You can also oscillate that fan. It's effective and unique. In this mode the fan speed can also be set to change automatically. Lastly, normal mode does not activate the boost feature.

The LG is unoticable on the lowest speed. Even the highest speed is not overly obtrusive. The Molekule was very loud when turned up to max.

The LG cleans the air effectively. My husband commented that the air in the room smelled fresher and cleaner when we replaced the Molekule with this LG. We have the purifier in our 14' x 10' foot living room which opens to a dining room and kitchen. I too have noticed that the air in the room has a cleaner smell to it. It's hard to describe, but it is noticeable. Moreover, the LG's auto fan mode works marvelously and instantly raises and lowers the fan speed based on air conditions. For instance when we blew out a candle that was across the room from the LG it almost instantly turned up the fan speed to clear out the smoke from the extinguished candle.

Replacing the large circular filter is easy. The panels are magnetically hold in place and the filer slides out without tools. Other than replacing the filter you need to wipe down the air quality sensor with a cotton swab every other month.

All in all... a terrific air purifier.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Ann Neris,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2021","After 4 hours of this being on in my upstairs attic room it felt like walking in to a hospital but without the smell of hospitals. I was able to take deeper breathe than normal.
The kids name it R2D2 ðŸ˜„
Besides using colors and numbers to clearly understand when the air of the room is clean, you can choose on the top to have it move side to side like fans do, also it allows you to adjust how strong it blows air.
With the app it will comunicate with your phone and give you diagnostics.
The remote control is simple but useful if you are within distance and dont want to get up.
Setting it up was like eating a banana, simple, quick and easy.
It has a sleep mode up to 8 hours, the good part about sleep mode is it turns off all the lights except one little light which indicates is in sleep mode ðŸ˜´ I personally like that feature because if I want to get away from everyone and go upstairs to take a nap the attic is the place to go, is a office, craft room, it has a reading area where we like to enjoy silence, read and take a nap because with lights off it can be dark.
Air ventilation up there is limited and is all carpet, with time the air felt heavy and we resourced to cleaning up there with a robot vacuum in order to not end up with asthma.
Now I have this feeling of not wanting to leave the room because of how good and clear it feels for me to breathe.
Another thing I notice is that my husband snores loud, if I'm watching TV I have to put the volume up, the last 3 days we have spend long hours up there he has taken numerous naps and he is snoring a lot less and much less louder, I have no clue if this has to do with having better quality air but at night when sleeping in our room he snores as usual and as traditional. The 3rd time I record him so he could see the difference. We decided to check our numbers and buy another one for our room.
In reality we had no idea how much of a difference it can be to have a air purifier, is air! How dirty can it be? Well it can and you get use to it, dont notice the difference until you have one of this cleaning one room and you leave that room to walk in to anotherone where suddenly the air can feel heavy.
I know the ticket is a big one, is 705 with tax but for me the difference is so noticeable that is worth the investment.
One last very important detail, this air purifier arrived in its own original big black box with big images of the unit and LG brand, anyone can see what it is inside, so if left at your door or porch it will be a nice temptation for porch pirates, make sure someone is home.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2022",I have severe allergies including mold. Guys this is the best thing I could have ever purchased. I use it in my bedroom since that is where I spend most of my time. The air quality has major improvment. We have a little mold in crawl space so this has saved me from that. It is quiet but does make a soft noise which I love. The light acts as a soft night light to me which I love. I highly suggest you buy this if you are looking for a high quality product. Everyone should have this regardless of allergies. It makes your room smell neutral. If you fart it even detects that so don't be surprised.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Dawn Bader,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2023","I used Rabbit for 10+ years and the quality of devices is not comparable. Plus the sleek futuristic look. It is quiet too. My favorite feature is that it displays which job it is doing: odor clearing, Pm 2.5, 10 or it is really toxic in the kitchen while cooking and it is purifying that. Sorry for the lack of vocabulary. My only con is the sleep mode - the LED light is too strong and I have to shut it off or wear sleep mask. I love this device!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Emily Souvannaseng,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2021","Live in a split level house, had a dog with pee pads and a cat with litter boxes (one litter box on each level). Cat had separation anxiety and would pee in the corners of the house, on the stairs and mostly down stairs of door frames. Since both pet's passing we tried using chemicals and multiple carpet shampooing but it still had lingering smell in the house. I set up the purifier upstairs now after just a week we noticed a big difference. You would think with pee soaked carpet and wood it would still smell. Now we want another one to keep downstairs. Love the smart function, it would automatically boost the fan when we are cooking and frying.",5.0 out of 5 stars

PROS: Loaded with features, sleek controls, quiet, works well.
CONS: Large and a bit plasticky.

DETAILED REVIEW:
Let me preface this review by saying that I also own the original Molekule air purifier which costs about the same, so I will compare the two from time to time.

LG's PuriCare Air Purifier is made almost exclusively from plastic. The plastics are high quality and nicely finished, but the materials are nothing special. In contrast, the Molekule is made from brushed metal and has a leather strap.

The LG is also quite large. It is squat and wide. It looks like a futuristic trash can to me. The Molekule is smaller and sleeker with a built-in cord wrap.

When it comes to cleaning and features the LG absolutely trounces the Molekule.

The top panel of the LG is touch sensitive and has a large a bright display. The color of the display changes depending on the air quality condition. (FYI: those bright lights can be disabled by activating the sleep timer). You can also control the LG via the included remote or an app on your smartphone. The app is fully featured, but it took me a few tries to get the LG connected to my Wi-Fi network.

The LG has a smart mode, a boost mode, and a normal mode. In smart mode it will change the fan speed and mode automatically based on the air quality. Boost mode is truly unique. Basically, the top of the air purifier rises up and an additional fan turns on to blow the purified air into the room. You can also oscillate that fan. It's effective and unique. In this mode the fan speed can also be set to change automatically. Lastly, normal mode does not activate the boost feature.

The LG is unoticable on the lowest speed. Even the highest speed is not overly obtrusive. The Molekule was very loud when turned up to max.

The LG cleans the air effectively. My husband commented that the air in the room smelled fresher and cleaner when we replaced the Molekule with this LG. We have the purifier in our 14' x 10' foot living room which opens to a dining room and kitchen. I too have noticed that the air in the room has a cleaner smell to it. It's hard to describe, but it is noticeable. Moreover, the LG's auto fan mode works marvelously and instantly raises and lowers the fan speed based on air conditions. For instance when we blew out a candle that was across the room from the LG it almost instantly turned up the fan speed to clear out the smoke from the extinguished candle.

Replacing the large circular filter is easy. The panels are magnetically hold in place and the filer slides out without tools. Other than replacing the filter you need to wipe down the air quality sensor with a cotton swab every other month.

All in all... a terrific air purifier.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Ann Neris,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2021","After 4 hours of this being on in my upstairs attic room it felt like walking in to a hospital but without the smell of hospitals. I was able to take deeper breathe than normal.
The kids name it R2D2 ðŸ˜„
Besides using colors and numbers to clearly understand when the air of the room is clean, you can choose on the top to have it move side to side like fans do, also it allows you to adjust how strong it blows air.
With the app it will comunicate with your phone and give you diagnostics.
The remote control is simple but useful if you are within distance and dont want to get up.
Setting it up was like eating a banana, simple, quick and easy.
It has a sleep mode up to 8 hours, the good part about sleep mode is it turns off all the lights except one little light which indicates is in sleep mode ðŸ˜´ I personally like that feature because if I want to get away from everyone and go upstairs to take a nap the attic is the place to go, is a office, craft room, it has a reading area where we like to enjoy silence, read and take a nap because with lights off it can be dark.
Air ventilation up there is limited and is all carpet, with time the air felt heavy and we resourced to cleaning up there with a robot vacuum in order to not end up with asthma.
Now I have this feeling of not wanting to leave the room because of how good and clear it feels for me to breathe.

I'm just blown away by how incredible this Air Purifer is. We have a Dyson and a Vornado ... neither are a match this this LG's power, aesthetics, customizability, and technology.

So, first, download ""LG ThinQ"" app. Pairing to the app is no problem (just follow the step-by-step instructions). Once you have it paired with the app, you can change the speed via the app, check the air quality, etc. It's pretty cool! Then, teach Alexa the ""LG ThinkQ"" skill. Then, you can ask Alexa to ""Activate LG air purifier,"" ""Turn off LG air purifier,"" etc. You will hear a series of tones from the air purifier and this indicates that command is being employed. You think you don't need the voice command ... until you have it! Then, it's super handy! (Especially, when you are cooking).

Now, we left this on turbo overnight. When I came out of my bedroom, the entire house smelled really ""crisp."" It's hard to put into words, but it wasn't merely ""clean,"" it was really pleasant.

And, I really like how this helps with those nose-blind moments. Sometimes we finish cooking, eating, cleaning-up ... and, it feels like our home is back to normal. And, then I see this is lit up yellow and I know that odors definitely remain. And, it is so gratifying to finally see the color change back to happy green!

I uploaded a video of this operating a full speed. You can hear that even on ""turbo,"" the noise level is relatively low. Our heating/cooling system is louder (and that's pretty quiet).

This really provides such peace-of-mind. And, I expect it to be genuinely helpful in the spring and fall when my seasonal allergies are moderately active.

This outshines all like products ... by a hundred miles.

Totally incredible! Very, very highly recommended! So much ""WOW!""",5.0 out of 5 stars
Lisa,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2021","I am actually very amazed with this product. It is both an air filter and a fan in one. The top can come up and til to act as a regular fan. It is the quietest air filter I have ever used. I have tried a handful of less expensive and very expensive air filters from $50-800 dollars. This one is by far the quietest. It is also made in Korea. The filter is very easy to change out, but it is a custom size so you will have to dig for alternative replacement filters. The frame is held together by strong magnets. It is a very heavy air filter so it is made to stay in place. It is good for a larger room. Does not come with a carbon filter so you will have to buy that separately, especially if you have pets. Overall, it is a very good filter and worth the investment.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Melrel05,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2021","Iâ€™m going to be honest, I thought that the pop up fan part of this air purifier was going to be gimmicky and would not really add much to how well it worked. But I live for air purifies as I have kids with allergies and asthma so I figured it would be worth a shot anyways. And boy am I glad I got this!

It works amazing! You can actually fell the air moving around the room, which I donâ€™t get with any of my other air purifiers. And one of those other air purifiers is over double the price as this one! It does have lots of settings and readings and stuff but honestly Iâ€™m one of those people that doesnâ€™t care much about the settings and readings, Iâ€™m more as long as itâ€™s working and Iâ€™ll change the filter when itâ€™s due.

There are a few downsides though. For starters itâ€™s pretty noisy. Itâ€™s not an annoying noise, but itâ€™s still noisy none the less. It also covers a much smaller area than others its size and price range. But honestly as long as itâ€™s working Iâ€™m ok with that. Overall Iâ€™m happy with it!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Eric and Liz Aderhold,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2021","I got this air purifier to help keep the air in my basement more breathable. I'm quite impressed with it so far!

The top of the unit has a colorful lighted circle that helps you tell at a glance what the current air quality is, from green (good) through to yellow and orange and red. There is a more detailed numeric display of parts per million of pollution as well.

The ""smart"" mode automatically adjusts the intensity of airflow based on the current air quality. When it's green the device is whisper quiet, blowing just a bit to ensure some air circulation around the sensor. When it gets up to yellow the fan kicks up a notch and is a bit louder. At orange or red levels, the entire top opens to blow air sideways rather than just straight up.

My basement tends to alternate between green and yellow levels with this air purifier on. It feels a bit better now down here than it did before I got the device.

The only negative thing I have to say about this is regarding the size. It's rather large. You might need to clear a fair amount of space in your house to make room for it.

That aside, I'm really very impressed with it. It should be useful year-round in my basement. With the occasional wildfires we have here in the Pacific Northwest I expect it to be a lifesaver in the rest of the house come summertime.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Antoinette,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2021","I watch LOTS of Korean television. I have seen this actual model on recent shows. I didn't know it was available in America. I'm glad that this new tech made it here. This air purifier is a step up from anything else on the market. The top of the unit flips up and rotates to circulate the air around it. This makes it more efficient and effective at air purification than the competition. The unit fits nicely in most rooms without being obtrusive. It's whisper quiet, so you can use it in a nursery with no problems. You can even operate it by voice command or via the app. If you're in the market for a high quality air purifier, I HIGHLY recommend this one.

Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",5.0 out of 5 stars
MOCTODNOZAMA,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2021","This thing is a beauty! It's like R2D2's long lost cousin or something. LOL! You can control everything by app, set a schedule and you're good. It uses a True Hepa filter that is said to collect fine dust, ultra fine dust and allergens. It also has a carbon deodorization filter layer to remove, smog, airborne chemicals and odor, which is why anytime you cook, the led indicators change to red. That means your food is stinky. LOL! I have not gotten it to work with Alexa yet, but I'm looking forward to that. This single version will cover 310 sq ft. This seems like a new product to the market, so I don't think you can find any 3rd party filter replacements yet, so at the moment, if you need a new filter, gotta go directly to LG. Manual says to replace the whole filter every 1 year, but the PM 1.0 sensor should be cleaned every 2 months. BTW, this thing is super, super, super quiet. That's three supers! That should tell you I really mean it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Steve Garfield,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2021","I love the look of this air purifier. Itâ€™s so cool, it looks like it was some thing out of Star Wars. The display is very detailed, and is highlighted by colors showing you the status of the air in your room. One thing to consider when getting one of these air purifiers is that itâ€™s going to be in the middle of your room and you get a look at it all the time, so in addition to its functionality, looks are very important. This one excels at Luxe. Check out the video where my wife Carol turns it on for the first time. Hope this helps.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Monkeycow,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2021","Very quite and it really does the job, i rec'd a new air fryer unboxed and run a test before my first use. The airfryer has a super strong plastic smell after few minute start and also smoke my kitchen as well (Glad no fire), so i start my ventilation for almost 15minute and it still have strong smell so i decide to give this LG Air Purifier to try. OMG red light is on (BAD air) but it only take less than 2 minutes all plastic smell were gone and the lighting turn to green (good air).

So i was thinking maybe the air fryer was too new so i leave it unbox for 2 days and give it another try, er........same same strong plastic smell & smoke after few minutes, this time i'm smart i started the air purifier and let it run without my ventilation, YUP it work, took less than 2 minutes all smell are gone, boxed the air fryer & return it.

This LG air purifier is amazing, it has auto detection and there is different color of lighting telling you the status of the air, very strong but quite. Another feature i like is it can link with Alexa ^_^ super recommend this product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jack,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2021","I got this to install into my room. The setup is really easy just pull the side frames out, remove the filter cover, reinstall the filter, then put the side panels back on and turn it on! Thereâ€™s an included remote to control the air purifier and it comes with a battery. I noticed that after a few hours my room became odorless. It cleaned the air so well the room went from having a smell to smelling like nothing at all which is great! The air also feels fresher to breathe in and Iâ€™ve noticed my sleep has improved because of it! The build quality is really nice on this device and feels sturdy, as expected for the price tag. I was surprised at just how quiet this air purifier operates. Itâ€™s about the size of a small-medium stool and I keep it in the corner next to my bed but I can barely hear it. It just sounds like a near silent calming wind which again, helped me sleep! I also enjoy knowing I donâ€™t have to worry about the air quality in my room anymore since this filters just about everything out! I think this is a great device that everyone should have in their homes and highly recommend it!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sunny,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2021","Using this has helped make the air cleaner and much easier to breath in in my basement. Iâ€™ve noticed that it helps with snoring too.
It's very simple to set up and use. The top of the purifier has a lighted circle that alerts you to what the air quality is. Just like a traffic light green=good to go, yellow=okay, orange & red =increasingly worse. From the top you can also adjust how the air blows (EX: side to side) and how strong it blows. You can also connect your phone to the app and control it that way (can set up a schedule). This can even hook up to ALEXA. There are two modes: sleep mode which lasts 8 hours. During sleep mode all lights are off. Smart mode sets the strength of the airflow automatically. As the color goes from red to green, the device works harder and so there is more noise.
It is pretty big and powerful.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Beth K,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2021","I've had several top-brand air purifiers, but this one is superior! We are feeling the difference!
Easy set up right out of the box. It's fairly huge, but not an eye-sore. In fact, it's a cool, sleek, modern style.
It's quite heavy, which may deter my plan for moving it from room to room (since it only covers, per description, 305 sq ft and I'd love to use it in every room.)
Noticeable difference in air quality.
It has on/off button, mode button, air quality indicator (smart/booster/normal), and a fan button that connects wifi. The booster button controls fan booster. There is also a swing button, an indicator button to check concentration of the particles, and a sleep timer. We leave the fan speed on auto so it kicks on as needed.
It's fairly quiet on lower speeds.
