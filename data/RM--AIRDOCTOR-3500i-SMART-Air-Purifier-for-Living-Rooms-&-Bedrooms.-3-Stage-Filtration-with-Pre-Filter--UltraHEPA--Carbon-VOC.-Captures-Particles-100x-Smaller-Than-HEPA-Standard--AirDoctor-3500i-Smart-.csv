Jeffrey Remmel,"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2024",Extremely impressed with the quality of this machine. Stylish design and works very well.

Peter,"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2020","There are so many purifiers out there, and it's difficult to make a decision. This one is the best bet for the cost, can clean a fairly large space, and can capture particles even finer than most other purifiers available. Yes, there are better units available, but they're going to cost at least twice as much. This unit outperforms everything else in its price point.

It is very quiet. There are a few reviews of people complaining about the noise level. The lowest two settings are barely noticeable. The highest two settings are louder, but it's the whoosh of the volume of air that it's moving. The noise is not mechanical or that of fan blades, it's purely the air noise. You can't change physics. Don't know what these people are on about. Honestly, I'm glad that it is able to move so much air that you can hear it; but you don't need to run it on high or turbo for long amounts of time, anyway.
Filter costs are very reasonable - you will spend about $140 a year. A lot of people are sticker shocked by filter costs, but these are an amazing value when put against the competition.
When I ran this for the first time, I left it on turbo for about an hour. All odors in the house were completely gone. The smell, if there is one, from the purified air would be best described as fresh, perhaps faintly sweet.
It's well made, and when coupled with high-end filtration in your central air system, it will keep your house clean and fresh.",5.0 out of 5 stars
TheQ,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2023","I have noticed some big improvements to my air quality here. I have mine in the middle of my home in a hallway. It's on default setting all the time runs quietly (which was why I bought it). The thing that pleasantly surprised me one morning was when it went red and in high gear... I stood there for a few seconds wondering what set it off. Then it hit me. I had done my hair. That thing was cleaning the hairspray out of the air. Then another night, I was ready to go to bed and I heard it kick into high gear. I was thinking, ""no, I didn't just do my hair....hmm."" Then I heard the dishwasher changing cycles. I forgot I had started it up. The Air Doctor sensed the dishwasher soap in the air and was cleaning that too. I also loved coming back from a trip and walking into my house and not noticing the cat smell I'm used to it when I am home all the time. This time, I didn't notice it after my trip. My smoke alarms don't go off anymore when I cook smokey things in the kitchen these days either.",5.0 out of 5 stars

BF,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2023","We’ve gotten two of the 3500 units for our home and they work incredibly well. I feel so much better when I wake up; my throat isn’t all dry and my nose is not stuffy. One of my children is medically complex and it feels great to know this purifier will filter our air so we know what we’re breathing is clean and free of irritants. We leave ours on auto and it turns up to the yellow or red setting when we’re doing nebulizer treatments, running the dishwasher, and sometimes while cooking in the kitchen; usually if we’re using a high temp for the oven or stove top. I turned it on high manually the other day when I was sweeping and dusting and it literally sucked up everything; I could see it moving right towards the purifier from across the room because the sun was shining at that time. I’ve even turned it up if we have visitors that are wearing too much scent like perfume. It’s easy to set up and very sleek looking too. We got them late in the fall so I am curious how they’ll do at the start of next fall when the ragweed affects my entire family. I’m hopeful based on what we’ve noticed so far. My mom has bought one since we got ours too and she’s not usually into products like this but I can’t help but rave about it to everyone. Highly recommend, thank you!!
Update 4/7/24: The light just came on to replace the carbon filter for the first time. So it lasted almost exactly 6 months as expected. You do have to manually reset the change filter light which can be done by holding down the timer and ion buttons for 3 seconds. Easy. Thank you!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Usually such deception would warrant a one star, Ive made an exception. I'll make this short. At first a bit of odor but after running for a couple of hours any odor is gone. it does have an ionizer. i love the WiFi. The carbon filter is substantial. I was suspicious when it went immediately to blue. So, I took one of my wife's face creams, opened it and placed it near the sensor, in a few seconds it turned orange, I was impressed.

Scrambled Eggs,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2024",I wanted to love this machine. The power to move the air was great but as soon as I opened the front to remove plastic cover over the charcoal filter a strong chemical odor over took me. It gave me instant sinus pain. It was a very strong chemical smell coming from HEPA filter. I immediately closed it and placed right back in the box to return. The smell was chemical in nature and directly coming from the filter. It gave me such pain that I knew I couldn’t keep it. Very disappointed.,3.0 out of 5 stars
Robert S. Berner,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2024","I have owned many air purification devices in the last 30 years. This one is clearly the best as far as its ability to quickly react to changing environments. If we change the cat litter pan, or cook in the kitchen (far away from the unit) the purifier senses the change and goes on high mode to more quickly purify the room.
Cheaper units closer to the kitchen do not react as quickly if at all. I first saw this unit at my dentists office waiting room and witnessed the same results there.
Pricey, but with the cost better results.",5.0 out of 5 stars
AM Lovejoy,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2019","Bought this to try and clean out an apartment unit that was absolutely pungent with second/third hand cigarette smoke from the neighbor. What pulled me in was the promise of the large treatable area (over 1000 sq ft) and the ultra HEPA filter that filters particles smaller than usual - small enough to filter smoke particles. With that and the ionizing feature and the coconut carbon filter, I thought I'd be set.
Upon setting up the purifier in the unit's living room, I, like a few others, noticed a plastic-y smell the first time I turned it (and a second unit I also tested) on...but it went away within a day. I was going to leave it on ""Auto"" mode but the air quality light went from red to blue in less than two minutes (turning the fan on the lowest setting)...even though the place was clearly contaminated with who-knows-what from the smoke seeping in...so I manually left it on high. The entire apartment unit is only ~850 sq ft, so I expected it to be able to filter everything...and it definitely helped...but I just didn't get the quality I was expecting. The unit still smelled pretty bad upon entering, and I couldn't stand to be in it for more than about 40 minutes before feeling ill (which is a big improvement over not being able to stand it for 10 minutes previously).
So I thought, okay, maybe the space is just too open and/or the contaminant (which renews itself quite frequently) is just too strong. So I gave up and put it in the bedroom, which is no more than 300 sq ft, but also along the wall shared with the smoking neighbor. Left there for two days on the second highest setting and with the ionizer on...it completely transformed that room and its closet into a livable space. I was astounded. My clothes, which previously reeked of cigarette smoke, actually went back to smelling good...no trace of smoke at all. It was amazing. There is now, at least, one room in the apartment where I can breathe without complications.
Unfortunately, I don't have the funds to dish out for 2-3 more of these to fill the apartment unit with, so I'll likely be keeping one of these and returning the other (and moving out!). Though, speaking of funds, you can find these off Amazon for almost half the price advertised on the AirDoctor website if you just search around a bit.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Susan C.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2023","My husband has severe asthma, so a friend of ours recommended the AIRDoctor 3000. We both LOVE IT!! We keep it on Auto and boy does work! Typically it runs on a low and extremely quite volume, but when our two lab mix dogs come in after wrestling in the grass, the machine kicks in full throttle, which tells me to get the pups back outside for a good brushing. I take the filter out once every two weeks and vacuum it. It’s unreal how much dust, dog hair, dander it picks up. I’m sure there’s more than just what I see!

My wife is also very sensitive to cooking smells when it involves something like frying anything. Bacon would be a good example. I set this up.last night and the air quality indicator was on blue most of the time. My daughter came down with us for awhile and at one point it turned yellow briefly. Of course I said it was her fault lol. This morning i got up and decided to fry some sausage and eggs. Well I got sidetracked while the sausage was going. This thing kicked in and turned red, fan went to high. After about 30 minutes we are back to blue and low fan speed. I guess time will tell.

Jim & Janet,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023","The AIRDOCTOER air purifier solved my problem. I bought this more expensive air purifier as it filters 0.0003 microns of stuff in the air. I had overdose my house on bug powder and thought I would never get rid of it. I had wiped the floor, counters, and everything else in my house many times with no luck. One week of running this air purifier on the second speed and the powder was gone. As one reviewer said - it did not work by using Auto as it would go off in two minutes. I just put in a room, set it on the second speed and ran it for several hours. The room was free of the powder. I move it to another room each day now just to enjoy a dust free house. Noise at speed two was no problem.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Ralph W. Reid,"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2022","This filter was just what I needed in my home office. I placed the unit on the floor next to the side of my desk. I can hear the fan running while working in my office chair, but the noise level is very low--lower than a desktop computer running on the top of my desk. I feel a draft in the room while the unit is running, even when it is on low speed. My home office is less than 144 square feet, so this filter is more than enough for the space, so it almost always runs at low speed. As a blind person, I had to guess where the sensors were on the control panel because it is a touch panel (no mechanical buttons or switches), but I have it figured out well enough so my nose runs less and I do not sneeze so much while working at my desk. I hope to get many years of use out of this air filter.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Curtis Womack,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2021",After my wife got sick from taken the covid shot . She started having allergy's to everything in and out side along with food allergy's. So I started looking to buy a purifier to help. I came across the AirDoctor Purifier and did my home work. So I bought it and I have no regrets because when I order it it came in three days. I got it out of the box and read the instructions and then I plugged it in and it is great. The third day I open up the shads on the window and I didn't see anything in the sun rays like before I bought the Airdoctor and the air is clear and we both feel great.

BMG,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2020","Any unit with a fan will always have some sort of a humming sound-that is just how fans sound like. But I guarantee that this unit is a lot more quiet in comparison to other air purifiers when set on low or in auto when the air is clean. Another good thing about this product is when set to auto, the machine readjusts the cleaning power to clear up the air and goes back to low when everything is cleaned-not only that, it notifies you the quality of air you have indoor by the color changing design. The carbon and the hepa filters are disposable - depending on usage, the machine will tell you when to replace but for normal use, the carbon filter is advisable to be replace once every 6 months and the hepa once a year and /enjoy the rest of the days that you are breathing the cleanest of air. The unit works best when windows are closed. The smell of fresh crisp air is so noticeable after being outside for awhile and that is where I know it works. I love the Air Doctor - So worth it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Anni,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2021","I researched just about every site for reviews of the best air purifiers. Of course, there was not a consensus but I compared prices, sq feet covered, times per hour it cleaned, and many other technical stats that I have already forgotten.
I have blueair 211 (rated high on CSR and Wired), Coway Mighty (top choice on Wired) and needed at least one more. Both my husband and myself suffer from terrible allergies. With these purifiers, my nose is no longer constantly running and my husband has severely cut down on his sneezing.
Although I like the Coway and Blueair, the AirDoctor has specs that rival the IQ air Health Pro Plus for a lot less money. It is so quiet you barely know it's on. The design is very thin and not wide. Unobtrusive. I cannot say enough positives. I am so glad I did my research!",5.0 out of 5 stars
JazzyGirl,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2020","I own Honeywell HEPA Air Cleaners and Austin Air. During the wildfire smoke that invaded my home despite closed windows and doors I did not find these two to help as much as I'd hoped. Well, the Austin seemed to have a better filter by comparison, but both were loud and I was still reacting with asthma with all the ""wind"" created by the two units. I also found that after the smoke cleared our air, something was making my mouth numb, lungs seize up and dizziness outside, then inside. I am chemically sensitive. Researching further, I found out that the VOCs (volatile organic chemicals) in the air were very high. The Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) is a gas. HEPA does particles, primarily. So, researched and found out AIRDOCTOR is recommended for chemical sensitivity and removes VOCs plus particulates. It's not perfect but does a much better job than HEPA alone. Nice surprise is that it is soooo much quieter.",4.0 out of 5 stars

B Barron,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2019","So, its really hard to tell if an air purifier actually works, you can’t really see whats in the air. I was able to test my air doctor when I got a new stove and used the oven for the first time. - Stoves need a protective coat to make the oven heat resistant and manufacturers add it, when that coat burns for the first time you use it, it releases a nasty smoke and very toxic smell. I immediately turned the air doctor on, the ring was red and orange for a while and then after a couple or hours it got blue. The toxic smell was gone!. Same thing happened with new furniture smell, and fresh paint for my new baby’s room. I swear by it.
Allergy season is a big one in texas, it definitely helps keeping allergens out. (Rhinitis over here)

All in all, it's excellent, but I couldn't quite rate 5 stars because it costs more than double the price of a regular HEPA air filter -- and I'm not sure I wouldn't get just as good a result if I ran two cheaper ones at the same time.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jessica,"Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2018","I am so glad I decided to finally try an air purifier and try this brand in particular. I suffer from chronic sinusitis and it has been 3 weeks since I set this up. I can honestly say that I feel a difference in the morning, my nasal passages are clear and I just feel I get a better nights sleep. The set up was extremely easy an quick. This product was honestly worth the investment.
Update:
I would like to update this review because I just noticed something awesome. I recently bought a vape pen and I was using it in the room where I had the purifier. The purifier picked it up almost instantly and went on full force for a couple of minutes and slowed back down after that. The automatic sensors are awesome! I am just so happy to know this is really purifying the air I breathe.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Connie,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2019","I purchased 2 Air Doctors and really like how easy it is to use and appreciate the night setting. I have 2 issues - the air flow on lowest setting sounds like it pulses which keeps both my husband and I from sleeping with the Air Doctor on. We are used to white noise but this doesn’t sound like a quiet steady flow of air. During the day it doesn’t bother me, so we continue to use it. My main issue is the smell coming from both machines. I’m not sure if it’s off gassing as mentioned in a couple other reviews, but when I leave the Air Doctor on in a room for a while, that room has a pretty strong smell from the air coming out of the units. It’s to the point I hardly run the machines in bedrooms which is unfortunate as I paid a lot for 2 Air Doctors. Wanted to love them, especially after all the doctors I know are recommending them, but concerned about why there is an odor coming from the air when the unit is running.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Angel,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2020","I couldn't tell the difference between when I ran it and when I didn't. I bought it because my nephew is allergic to pet dander, dust, and maybe other things. Sister ran it for 2 days straight before our gathering. He was there for less than 2 hours and got the allergic reaction anyway. However, he said if he runs one of these continuously for a week or more it makes his own apartment livable. Maybe I will give it to him if his dies, or lend to family to run before family gatherings to try to help him. It doesn't ever show high level of air contaminant when I would expect, like if I have a wood fire burning in the same room or haven't vacuumed as often. But when cold air from outdoors hit it, it showed high air contamination. HA! We're in small town in Central WI. I guess it reacts to cold temp more than cat dander or dust or burn particles.

Searched for long time. was too hard to find one,finally decided to buy this Dr. one.
This co. says “whisper quieter...”
that whisper means to me was very quite,
Also an expansive filter means purifies very well.
So that sounds like meet my needs for even a sensitive person like me.
1. Yes. This one opened my clogged nose after few hours of the lowest setting.
simple and easy to use except one thing.
2. No.No Peace!!! way too noisy for me even the lowest mode with gentle music on.
After few hours,
unpleasant machine noise felt like train passing by neighborhood to me, felt tired.
When sleep,
got louder, so turned off even need the most.
Next morning,
tried again with hope of a better feeling because hate returning process.
But continuously the unpleasant noise made me even headache...
3.Its hard to return:
packing box is way too big, cannot carry with hands.

Zilla606,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2021","Cleans air but at the expense of your health. Do not use it in a bedroom. After my experience, I can say that air purifiers cause more respiratory irritation especially if your susceptible, which is why you probably bought one in the first place. Not only because of ozone, but due to the negative ions emitted. Through digging in deeper with the research on purifiers I found out they create negatively charged oxygen ions that attract dust, dirt, and mold from the air, which later stick to surfaces. Your lungs and throat being two of them. It doesn’t purify air, it just moves the containment’s to a different place. You’ll notice white smudge on black surfaces (and “black wall effect”). As good as it sounded, the health effects to my throat and lungs are not worth the change in odor. I woke up with headaches constantly, which dragged on until the evening. It took me sleeping somewhere else to finally realize what was going on. Goes to show you, you can’t just magically change the environment of your home with a product from Amazon.

In addition to that I have dogs and a cat that sleep in my bedroom with me. I did not dust for several weeks so the air quality in my room was very poor. I turned the airdoctor on and for 8 seconds it was red, then for 4 seconds it went orange, and then it went blue and stayd on blue. That seemed odd considering I purposely tried to create a poor air scenario. I then turned on my TheraPure and it immediatly went to orange and stayed that way for at least an hour (pic #2). I left the Airdoctor running for several days and it stayed blue the entire time. My Therapure also was blue each time I turned it on. Today I decided to FINALLY clean, dust and vacuum my room. I did that with both the Airdoctor and Therapure running. The Airdoctor stayed blue the entire time while the Therapure turned orange (pic #1). I even shook the dust rag in front of the Airdoctor and nothing changed. Save hundreds of dollars and purchase a cheaper air purifier that works better. Also, the Airdoctor smells like melting plastic - even after running it for 96 hours straight. I am not impressed and don't believe that this product is any better than more cheaper products out there, infact, I think it may be worse.

W Dortignac,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2019",At 5 months we burnt the beans in the kitchen next to the bedroom that the filter was in. Immediately we turned the filter on to Auto mode and within seconds it went to blue (indicating that the 10x12 room was clean). It was NOT clean. It never picked up speed to clear out the room or showed even orange (which would mean the air quality was fair). The supervisor at AirDoctor kept saying that “that’s how it’s supposed to work”. That the sensor reads the room and adjusts accordingly and when I kept telling him that it obviously didn’t read the room correctly or it would’ve adjusted and ran at a higher speed etc he just kept saying “it did what it was supposed to”. So just because the light did its fancy thing I’m supposed to believe the filter cleared the room? Somehow the supervisor must’ve been at my house after the smoke was in there and he just knew that it worked properly?? NO. He was NOT there and after explaining again and again and going around and around he said they’d replace it if I paid the shipping for the new filter.

The unit still would not work, so the customer service rep (from another country) instructed that he was sorry, there was nothing more he could do since it was out of warranty, and that I would need to purchase a new unit. My husband took the unit apart to see if he could fix it and found the circuit board appeared to be burned in areas.

The replacement filters are almost as expensive as the units themselves which makes me consider to just buy a cheaper brand with a better reputation because buying filters alone are equivalent to a whole new air purifier. I run them all day long and on high when I'm not home. I can not tell a difference in the air quality in my home.,1.0 out of 5 stars

Onebeat,"Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2022",We have had two of these air purifiers for over a year. We ordered replacement filters for both of them and they smelled like burning rubber. We ran it for many days multiple times in the garage to see if the smell would go away and it did not. We have spent almost 2K on these air purifiers and the smaller ones Air Doctor ones. I will never buy from this company again. They said they would send out return receipts so we could get our money back for the filters and didn't receive it. We are not asking for our money back for the air purifiers themselves which we will never use again. We felt it was fair to get a refund on the air filters at least. We had to replace these all our Air Doctor units with Blue Air purifiers and are happy with how they work and how affordable the filters are and have no toxic smell to them.,1.0 out of 5 stars

Carebear,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2020","Let's talk value/price. They play pricing games where they have an artificially high retail price then discount that price differently for different promotions. The replacement filters are expensive and when you order them they charge separate shipping and ""processing"" for each filter ordered even if in the same order and shipped together which is a rip off. You can't order replacement filters without agreeing to their ""terms and conditions"" but I couldn't find what those terms and conditions are anywhere on the filter order page. Their site says 100X More Effective than Ordinary Air Purifiers. This appears to be an outright lie. Over the summer I had a leak that resulted in mold in my kitchen. I also have a Winix air filter that I paid less than half the price for and when I would alternate between the Winix and Air Doctor in the kitchen the mold smell was noticeably less when using the Winix and it was obvious to me the Winix was filtering out the mold better than the Air Doctor for less original purchase price and less cost on replacement filters. When I ordered my Air Doctor it was on a promotion where I was supposed to get a free filter and I was told it would ship later which it didn't so it was a hassle getting the free filter I was promised. Another review mentions the pulsing sound of the fan which mine does too which can be annoying. A unit in this price range shouldn't have that problem, I've never had any other air filters do that.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2020","UPDATE: Extended attached 99.97% graph to include AirDoctor data point. It's worse than I thought.
The manufacturer states ""UltraHEPA FILTER removes 99.95% of particles as small as .003 microns.""
I can't find any specification for ""UltraHEPA.""
The common standard for HEPA filters specifies the filtration efficiency at the ""most penetrating particle size"" (MPPS) which is lower than for particles SMALLER or LARGER. A 99.97% filter has a MPPS of about 0.2 microns; it has a >99% filtration efficiency at 0.01 microns.
AIRDOCTOR should stick to a common specification so intelligent comparisons could be made, or at least demonstrate their filtration efficiency at the common index point (MPPS) for filters which adhere to accepted standards. As it stands, I think the AirDoctor filter is probably overpriced.

Jane,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2021","I received my first Air Doctor (via the Air Doctor website) and it smelled so toxic (like off-gassing plastic/ oil) that I couldn't even keep it in my home. My family and I experienced immediate headaches and dizziness from being near the machine. Air Doctor customer service instructed me to plug it in outside and leave it running for a few days. Nothing shifted. Customer service shared that because of the demand, the units are being packed immediately after they come off the assembly line without time to off-gas. Air Doctor agreed to send me a new unit. This time the toxic smell was much less, but still present. Anytime I turned on the machine, the plastic odor would waft through the air making us feel so sick. This time, I pinpointed the toxic plastic odor to the casing around the filters. This machine is supposed to clean the air in a space, not make it more toxic! Super disappointed, I gave up and sent the second unit back.

JB,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2024","Knowing what I know now, this is it a company I would recommend.
The HEPA filter works… probably like a lot of other HEPA filters. It says it’s good for smells and VOCs— it is not. You need 15-20lbs of activated carbon to begin to touch VOCs (like the IQAir has).
The little light will change with cooking, any kind of spray or powder in the air… but the real air quality concerns are happening at levels the sensor can’t detect.
If you’re just looking for particulate filtering (what HEPA is good for), this is decent enough… just very overpriced compared to comparable models, which will do the same for much cheaper.
If you’re looking for something that will filter everything from viruses to VOCs, look into the IQAir Multigas— not cheap at all, but life-changing for folks with things like Multiple Chemical Sensitivity.
AustinAir is also known for having a good amount of carbon, for smells.
If you’re a healthy person just looking to give your air a little help, aren’t really concerned with smells or VOCs, and don’t mind over-playing, knock yourself out. Models like Winx or Caroway will do the same for cheaper.

Alex Gebhardt,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2019","This is a difficult review to write - not because it doesn't serve a purpose. As an purifier it works well. You can crank it up to its highest setting and it will circulate a good amount of air and essentially clean anything that crosses its path. Also it's a fairly quiet unit even at its highest setting. But the reason I'm giving this purifier 3 stars and nothing higher is because it's main feature of having an automatic sensor is dismal in performance and an afterthought at best. Initially I purchased this unit for my dining room/kitchen area which is roughly 350 square feet combined. I noticed upon purchasing the unit that the only time the purifier would change speeds and LED colors was when powering the unit up, otherwise it would remain ""blue"" and in low setting. This was also upon un-boxing it where most times the air would be more polluted. Sure enough it did nothing. I tried cleaning the air sensor on the side of the unit and that too had little effect. I then called up the company which ran me through a battery of test (lighting a match next to the sensor and blowing smoke towards it - didn't know it also functioned as a fire alarm) which of course had no effect as well. The only time it self engaged was when I pan fried hamburgers in the kitchen and even then it was a good 10 minutes after cooking. I would be amiss to say it didn't work at all, just very poorly. After explaining to the customer service tech that it was malfunctioning (like another reviewer stated they tried to say it was working fine since the light changed colors upon powering it up - I vehemently denied that saying it was simply an initialization cycle and didn't prove the sensor worked in any capacity whatsoever). Finally she agreed to send a 2nd unit and a week or so later guess what....same result. Instead of fighting with customer service on receiving another defective unit I decided to keep it based on its merits of simply being a purifier. If I smell an odor in the house I simply turn it on full speed and wait a good half hour till it's no longer apparent (if you walk out of your house for a few minutes and walk back in you'll noticed the difference instead of your nose getting accustomed to any scents). This is not what's advertised but the filters on the unit seem to be of high-quality and seem fairly reputable thus far.

OzMoses,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2020","UPDATE: 3/15/20
Three weeks after installing new filters, the replace filter light for Filter 2 just went on. Filters are almost spotless.
Weird!!
ORIGINAL: I bought this direct from Air Doctor about 3 years ago. So, it's a bit difficult to rate. I've found that the air quality sensor is completely out of sync with what air quality devices readings show. My stand alone air quality device will show poor quality air when I'm grilling/cooking indoors and the Air Doctor will stay blue and then when the air quality device shows clean air, the Air Doctor will occasionally go yellow. Makes zero sense. Additionally, neither the sensor for determining when to replace the charcoal filter nor the Ultra Hepa filter every light up. I've attached a pic of what the Ultra Hepa looks like after 13 months of use (a couple of months of which were continuously used in the lobby of my apartment building near the entrance to the indoor/unventilated garage. The charcoal filter was also full of dust etc and no indicator light. I just decided to replace them all. Another concern is whether at a certain point the dust/toxins, etc. begin to recirculate once the filters reach a certain level of filth. I haven't noticed any health improvements with this purifier any more than any other cheaper device so I'd say, if you have a super noticeable air quality problem and health issues, go for it, but if you're not sure, try something cheaper first. Even a DIY 20x20 box fan with 20x20 13MERV filter from Home Depot might be worth a short term try. Bottom line is that I'd be much happier if I could rely on the Air Doctor's sensor to do it's job.",3.0 out of 5 stars
albinoshrink,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2020","Aesthetically it has a nice design and I agree with other reviewers in that it's easy to use. When I took out the filter to switch it out after a year, I didn't find it that dirty in comparison to the other air purifier I had in the same room. I have a awful condo neighbor who chain smokes, and it has not been effective in removing the smoke even running it 24 hrs a day on the highest setting. I realized a year later that air gets sucked through the sides of the front panel, which is so unbelievably inefficient. I decided to remove the front panel so the fan in the back can suck in more air from the front and although it doesn't remove the smoke, the air is now more breathable and the fan can work more efficiently. It does have an activated carbon filter that is not a filmsy spongy carbon screen, so at least it does remove gases and smoke theoretically. It's very overpriced however, you can get a cheaper one with similar features. However, I do think it is true to its advertising, has a true Hepa filter, real activated carbon filter and a screen for dust.

BBD,"Reviewed in Canada on July 12, 2024","I want to like this air purifier.
The controls are easy to use, and the filters are easy to install and remove. I find the fan noise to be completely acceptable based on the amount of air this thing can move through the filters. On auto mode you can easily fall asleep with the fan noise (typically setting 1) - in fact, I think it actually helps similar to a typical room fan that provides a white noise effect to help lull you to sleep. On full blast (setting 4) it sounds like it is moving enough air to take flight.
Build quality is solid - nothing feels cheap or poorly made. Even the filters feel like they are made from sturdy materials. And I REALLY like that the filters have a notch in the bottom right corner that prevents you from inserting them incorrectly - this is a GREAT feature.
Here's what I don't like about this air purifier. While I was able to easily find a study from a seemingly ""reputable"" source that claimed the removal of Aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 from the air, I was able to find a TON more Facebook-mom-for-pay, completely anecdotal reviews that just throw up instant red flags. This might not be so bad if this air purifier was inexpensive, but it absolutely is not. Replacement filters are also expensive and give me a ""printer ink"" vibe, even if they are well made. To be fair, on the model I have the recommended replacement cycle is annual so the expense isn't completely unwarranted. I would love to see scientific, completely independent 3rd party comparisons of these air purifiers against claimed air purification criteria the manufacturer specifies. UltraHEPA doesn't really mean anything until that happens.

RR,"Reviewed in Canada on June 4, 2024","Edit: huge disappointment in regards to filter replacements. When I wrote my original review the filters were replaceable for around 50$ I looked into replacing the originals as they’re supposed to be replaced every 6 months or so only to find they’ve jacked the price to 219$ for the same filters that were 50$ a few months ago. My machine still runs well, but to replace filters twice a year at that price is ridiculous. Lowering my review to 3 stars. Something doesn’t feel right about how the filter price, it feels like price gouging.
A great machine, well made and built solid. Weight wise it’s easy to move around by carrying it, it doesn’t have wheels so no rolling it. It’s easy to use and just takes a few minutes to setup and start using it. There been some reviews about noise level so I specifically tested and measured the noise levels, which you can see on the attached video. My evaluation is on auto mode or the lowest setting it’s almost unnoticeable the noise it makes, clearly stepping up the speeds generates more nouse, but I imagine the only reason a person would run this on speed 4 is if there is an issue that requires a lot if air to be filtered quickly, otherwise most jormql usage wiuld be at a respectable 40db or so. Ot has a dimming function to turn off almost all its lights, a timer as well as an ion function. Auto and a manual 2 speed fan function. Filters get changed regularly per the manual, but the machine has indicator lights to tell you when it’s time to do so, Amazon has replacement filters as a set for about 50$.
We have had it running for a week now, we feel there has been an improvement in air quality and we’re very happy with this air purifier a solid 5 stars on this machine.",3.0 out of 5 stars

R. Bernstein,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2024","I really like these machines. They warn you when it is time to change filters, they are reasonably quiet, they have an ionizer feature, and the controls can be dimmed if the unit is in a bedroom.
I was disappointed that such an expensive unit has only a one year warranty. I have two of these machines and the electronics began to fail not long after the warranty was up. I complained to the company but did not get any satisfaction until I posted a bad review on Amazon. At that point however, they did come through and replaced both of my machines. I am very grateful for that.
IMO, a machine in this price point should have at least a five year warranty, if not ten. After all, the real money is made selling filters!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jeremy,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2024","We have two units in our apartment. When I cleaned the filter, I noticed plenty of dust, hair, etc. so that tells me the unit is doing something. One unit is by the kitchen, but it does not seem to remove odors / aroma from the air (which in theory is the purpose of the carbon filter layer, but it does not work).",4.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2022",We purchased two. AD3000s one for upstairs one for downstairs. 2400 square feet total. No major complaints. We just went through some intense wild-fire smoke in the Puget Sound area. For several days our air quality was than the world. Even when compared with major industrial areas. The Doctors did a great job. We follow the rules. Filters firmly in place and the enclosure fully closed.. We ensured adequate clearance around the devices and placed in a level area. My wife keeps the upstairs unit on 4-6 days a week. It showed the 'replace filter indicator' after 1 years 2 months of life. I run the downstairs unit 1-3 days a week. We ran both units in manual mode for 5 days during smoke event. They are pricey but we are pleased with the results during out real world scenario.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2020","Ok, I have been married for 40 years. My wife has snored for about 15 of those 40, and when I say snore I mean like a 747 landing in my room, I never considered sleeping elsewhere.
I put up with it by ordering a box of 3M ear plugs at a time, that's just how it was.
I decided to buy an air purifier. My wife checked reviews and we ended up buying Air Doctor.
After a week of using it I noticed how much better I felt, the reason was my wife was no longer snoring!
First I thought it might be my imagination, now after almost three months I know that the Air Doctor is the reason.
I can't believe it, i bought it to help air quality in my home, I live in So. Cal and we have been hit hard with fires in the area and Air Doctor has helped our home in that area as well. This is one Happy Customer, Thank you Air Doctor!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Debra S.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2020","I have had my air doctor for 6 months and it has been wonderful; quiet, fresh air with no smell like others have mentioned, it has not skipped a beat.
It is a bit heavy but it won’t tip over easily so that’s a plus. I’m 70 yrs you g and I can move it when needed. I run it 24/7 it is extremely quiet, it has a night mode so the light panel is dimmed. We have pets and our windows are open often the air doc clear s the air of dust, mold pet hair smoke with no problem at all. I recommend this product from my pleasant experience owning it for 6 months",4.0 out of 5 stars
gil moses,"Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2023",Seems powerful and got a lot of personal recommendations for this. My only real dillema is it always had blue saying my air quality was good. Which then makes it work on low and it almost seems like a waste. Oddly enough only one time it gave me an orange light and just for a few hours. So that was odd. Over all seems like a good buy.,4.0 out of 5 stars
JMD,"Reviewed in Canada on September 10, 2021",Does a great job including smells which other purifiers were not very good at that we had. Not sure how contaminated air has to be to get a higher fan level (you can do manual if you like) but even in rooms we know the air quality could be better we still get the blue light for good air. Called the company and they walked me through some tests to make sure the sensor was working and it passed the tests with no problems. So I think the air has to be very dirty before color would change and resulting in the fan automatically increasing the speed. I would recommend using manual mode and choosing your fan speed for the room. Very easy to use and directions simple and understandable.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Foster Alexander,"Reviewed in Canada on July 30, 2021",Seems like a good product - auto mode seems to work exactly as presented - higher air flow when there's dust/smoke/smells in the air - then settles down to low flow rate and almost silent running when it's cleaned the air. Month of use with no issues and no complaints. Was somewhat expensive compared to other similar capacity offerings so I can't comment on value-for-cost but main point is it seems to work.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Wildbluyonder11,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2018","Love it! It senses the air pollution level and adjusts the fan speed to take the pollution out of the air quickly.

And I can tell the difference because the smell of the cooking chicken is not nearly as strong as it usually is.

I feel like the fact that this is still the model that is sold today in a post pandemic world, truly is a testimony to the science behind this machine and the integrity of the company that built it.

Rachell Wright,"Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2022","We got this during fire season when the air quality is awful and it has worked WONDERS in our house. We tried a few things to see if this actually works and IT DOES! When on auto mode my husband farted Infront of it and it kicked in full blast (yes, you read that right… no shame!), it kicks in if I even light a scented candle, spray hairspray, room spray, perfume, while cooking, etc. when the light is blue meaning “good” it’s very quiet and barely noticeable. When it kicks onto red or orange it does get a bit loud but honestly I don’t mind it, it if means my air is clean.
MY ONLY CON: (even though this isn’t really an issue now since the newer models have this) it needs a control lock. We have toddlers who are FASCINATED with pushing the buttons and hearing the beeping sound and lights. I cannot get them to leave it alone. Or my cat will jump on top of it to get to the window and push buttons. I wish our model had a lock on it but I guess we will just have to upgrade to a newer one now!
The filters seem outrageously priced so we ordered replacement filters off Amazon and so far everything works just as well. I work at an HVAC company and verified with my parts manager that using generic filters would be just as efficient.",5.0 out of 5 stars
