Marsrutt,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2024",I love this Blue Air Purifier! It is so quiet and I definitely have less dust in my rooms. The app works great and I like that I can adjust the settings from my iPad or phone.,5.0 out of 5 stars
ShootTheProgrammer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","We have two of these, now. The new one is in my office with cherry furniture. The wife bought a nice enough unit at Target, but the weekly dusting exercise diminished not. When I saw the Blue Air on a deep discount, I ordered one. Not only is it quieter (per dB meter), but there's significantly less dust. Hopefully, it will perform as well and as long as our other unit, which has been rock solid in continuous use for several years. With the older unit, it was many months before it signaled a filter change. New filters are cheap, and the knock-off brand we use seems to work well.

That's not to say there's no bats in this belfry. First, with a cloth cover of the corrugated filter, it is a little delicate. You pick it up by the cloth cover, and risk damaging the filter. I try to pick it up by the white plastic top, and usually manage to rotate it 1/16 of a turn, releasing the filter assembly to tumble across the floor, releasing the accumulated dust. It does tend to teach the careless to care.
Changing filters isn't the easiest, as it generally takes two of us to pull the cloth pre-filter over the HEPA filter without creasing the fins. And, after an episode you will certainly only do once in your life, never decide to sterilize the cloth cover by washing it in hot water followed by a hot dryer. You'd think I would have learned my lesson the time I did that to my expensive cashmere sweater, turning it into a garment for my toddler. Did I forget to mention? Wash the cloth pre-filter under a cold tap, and allow it to air dry.
Final observation. The first Blue Air came with a blue filter. This one is black, with a spare blue. Perfect, as I needed an extra cover to replace the one I cashmered. I like the black better. As it accumulates dust, it turns into an attractive mottled gray. The blue one doesn't look so good as it accumulates dust, with ugly streaks where the dog wiped his nose (we've learned to keep the air cleaner in a corner to keep it upright).
However, the ugliness that the blue one becomes may be a blessing as it encourages more frequent cleaning. As I vacuum the house, I see it needs cleaning so I'll take an upholstery attachment to it. Shortly, there's a screech, and I'll find myself vacuuming it outside. Being cylindrical with a cloth cover over paper fins, it's not the easiest thing to vacuum, and nothing but washing seems to help the dog snot problem. But I suppose there's worse things the dog could wipe on it.
The down sides are pretty inconsequential to me. OK, I need to learn to be delicate with something for once. The important things are it makes it easier to breathe. The house is easier to clean. And it seems to work, day after day for years, without making a lot of noise, smoke, or requiring a carpet cleaner who specializes in blue goo. As well, at least the dog doesn't wipe his nose on the expensive drapes.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Wesley Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2024","I am reviewing the BlueAir 211i Max and 411i Max series in this review as I bought both - one for living room and one for bedroom. Bottom line, these are very impressive units and for the price I am impressed and pleased with each for functionality and effectiveness. I think the aesthetics of it are pleasing as well. It looks nicer than a black box wheezing in your room.
Pros for the BlueAir series. very very quiet. On auto maintenance mode - you can't hear the thing. These are smart machines. You can monitor every aspect of your air quality through the app. You can adjust the control lights from off to bright. It tracks months of air quality data for the room it is in by month, week, day. You can adjust from sleep mode, auto, and 3 fan speeds using the app remotely. It tells you how much filter life is left. It tells you the outside air quality and compares to your inside.
Example of its effectiveness; I was saut√©ing some Italian sausage and onions, the unit detected the particles and immediately went into high mode for about 5 minutes until all the odor was eliminated and then went back to silent. The front LED bar changes from Blue to Green, orange and red depending on the air quality while at the same time adjusting the fan speed to address the corresponding level of air quality indicated. Same thing happened when smoking some meat on the back patio. I left the door open to bring in the food, the unit detected the smoke and the front LED went red. After closing the door, it ran on high mode until the LED indicators began to regress back to blue and the fan speed decreasing accordingly until all the smoke odor was eliminated from the room.
Cons for the BlueAir product. It is a bit pricier than other options - but for all the differences - so far, I feel the Blue Air product is definitely worth the price difference, for me at least.
What I have not addressed: the longivity of the products; the life of the filter; ease of maintaining; Both of my purchases are within the first month;",5.0 out of 5 stars
Careful Shopper,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2018","Have had it a week. It arrived on time in perfect condition. It came with 2 prefilters (large long stretchy socks that slip over the main filter). One was sky blue and the other black. I'm using the sky blue right now. It's easy to slip it over the filter which is the lower part of the machine.
It's very attractive. It's lightweight. It's so quiet on first setting you don't know it's on, but I wonder how much filtering it would do. It's fairly quiet on second setting, you do notice that one, but not unpleasantly. It's somewhat loud on third setting, definitely noticeable, especially when I'm trying to compose or listen to music or watching a movie, it can become annoying. Doesn't bother me as much when I'm resting, reading, or trying to sleep. But it's not as loud as some of the Holmes or other brands I've tried over the years.
It's easy to vacuum the prefilter (as I said, the stretchy sock that slips over the filter). With a brush attachment to my vacuum I vacuum that part first. And then I pull it down so as to vacuum the filter itself. Or when the prefilter becomes dirty, you can remove it completely, hand wash or machine wash (drip dry because I think it will shrink). You can slip on the spare one in the meanwhile. Make sure the prefilter is always pulled up and covering all parts of the main filter, as well as tucks underneath the bottom of the filter. All to prolong the life of the filter. I will be vacuuming 1-2 times a week. It's very dusty here and I have horrible allergies.
I do notice the air to be fresher when this has run for a few hours.
I'm still confused as to whether this has an ionizer or not. If so, it's always on. I wanted one that had no ionizer or the ability to switch it off, such as with the Holmes that I've used for years. But since I had some bad luck with my latest favorite Holmes, I decided to try something new, such as this Blue Pure 411.
Minor complaint, depending where it is located. I both like and dislike the touch-on button located at the very top. I like that it's a touch-on and with lights that display which of the 3 settings is running. But sometimes it doesn't touch-on easily, other times too easily. And if you set the purifier on the floor or a coffee table you can easily reach the touch-on and see which lights are on. But if you have it setting on taller furniture, as I do, I have to tip the purifier to see the lights and reach the touch-on. As I said, a minor complaint.
Time will tell how long this will last. I will report back later, if necessary. If it holds up and does the job, I'll raise it to a 5-star at that time.
Oh, if you are looking for the serial number. I was told by the company it is located underneath the fan, which is the touch-on section that sits on top the filter. I will need to remove the filter to get the s/n. So far I haven't done it.
Also, if you get an account and complete the Blue Pure warranty that comes with it, it will be extended up to 5 years. (Here in California anyway. Don't know about other states.) As with any warranty, it's wise, soon after you purchase, to jot down date of purchase, place of purchase, model and serial numbers.
I hope this helps answer any of your questions.",4.0 out of 5 stars
R. Shaw,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2024","This is easy to set up and run. You can control it from your phone via WiFi or directly. The sensors on top of the machine can tell you how much air pollution there is and what type (size of the particles). The purifier can run as you set it or automatically, which will adjust the fan speed to whatever level of air pollution is present. I have an older one as well, and though it is quiet, this one is much quieter. Any downsides? I love the smell of bacon cooking. With this unit, that aroma disappears within a minute or two.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazonaholic,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2024","So far so good, I did quite a bit of research prior to making this purchase. Pros-Easy set up pretty much plug and play. Whisper quiet I rarely hear it on, which implies it does not need to use the highest fan setting to efficiently clean the air. I like the idea of a washable filter I have a Honeywell 50250-s and an AeroMax 290 that are about 6 years old. I needed ones for other rooms, so I added these which are rated higher according to Consumer reports than my older ones, these are Wi-Fi compatible with a smooth easy set up once you download the app, and you can control them with Alexa and Siri I think if that is a feature you like. The app is relatively simple as far as making adjustments, to LED brightness and fan speed. There are 4 speeds, auto and night mode. It gives you the filters status. You can set a schedule. Generally, if you put it in auto, it will adjust according to the rooms needs and the night mode which I really like because it is super quiet and it's relatively close to my bed, and it has minimal lights. I thought about the Winix 5500, but it was actually rated lower than this by a significant amount and while other reviewers recommended it over the more expensive Coway I thought this was a good meeting in the middle especially during prime day. The Winix runs around $132-$155 while the Coway runs a bit higher about $339 at the time of my review. For prime day this was $199 so your mileage may vary as it typically might price at about $280. As for a comparison with my older purifiers the AeroMax still performs well it requires 2 filters be replaced, while this one has a washable filter and a replacement filter, which are reasonable affordable. With purifiers the gift that keeps giving is the filter replacement. I hope to one day find an affordable washable filter that I never have to replace, but for the companies where is the fun in that. If you are looking for a highly rated air purifier this would be my choice. For a bedroom the large seems too large, but mine does not have to work as hard to clear the air. My Honeywell is totally manual, so it's outdated compared to these and it's pretty loud on its lowest setting so we run it on high at night downstairs, while we can easily run these all day and night without really noticing. My AeroMax is more automated and automatically adjusts for its changing environment and has an indicator light that adjusts according to the cleanliness of the air.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Charlie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2024","I upgraded our air purifiers to this brand Blue Air, and I can tell a difference in my home‚Äôs air quality.
The sleek design fits well in any room, and it operates quietly, which is great for my home office.
It effectively captures dust, pollen, and pet dander, which has been a relief as a pet owner. The air quality indicator is also a fantastic feature, letting me monitor the air in real-time.

P. Mendelberg,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2024","I have purchased two of these and overall I like them. It was a little challenging to register the product. I first tried on their website which didn't work right but it allowed me on the app that I had downloaded onto my phone. The units work well and are fairly easy to set up. It works through the app as well as from the unit. Mostly I use the console on the unit if I want to change anything. It doesn't look difficult to change the filters. The inside one is a little pricey if you want the more hypoallergenic filter. However filters seen to last around six months. The controls are easy to use. The hardest thing was to adjust the dimming of the light which was a little tricky before I got it. It is not clear whether to run it on the automatic setting or use the fan for faster air exchange. I find the information offered not that detailed. I have taken to running in on the ""2 fan blade"" setting (low medium?). My only complaint is about running them on the two higher setting. In both one has a mild ""buzzing sound that won't go away. And the other has a mild vibration such as fan bladed not being quite balanced. But since it doesn't really seem necessary to run at the higher speeds, it is not a big issue. At the lower setting it is quiet. Being large they are somewhat unwieldy to move around and as such I bought roller caddy's like for large plants which work well. Lastly",4.0 out of 5 stars
greeneyedlady,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2024","Our house is very very old and very small. But it is not small on issues. We have a crawlspace underneath our house which makes our house very damp and very cold all year round.

The contractor who was supposed to fix the roof, could not do it because we had rain, every single day for about two months solid. In the meantime, they put a tarp over my roof, which made all the water run down to the end down through my light fixtures into my bathroom and every light fixture of the lower end of my house.

azfatboy,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2024","I bought a couple of these to help my wife's allergies. One upstairs in the bedroom, one downstairs in the living room. Setting them up was easy. Just took it out of the box, plugged it in, hit the power button, and Voila! One HUGE exception: connecting them to my WiFi was a pain--the first unit especially seemed really against the idea, but eventually they capitulated.
Hard to tell after just a couple weeks, and it might be psychosomatic, but the air does seem a bit cleaner. I have them on Auto, and have yet to hear them. I also locked both panels, so my grandkids can't mess them up. I wanted something wall-mounted, but these are actually working out, and now I have the flexibility to move them easily if I want.

Samuel,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024","Was looking for an air filter that would do its job efficiently and effectively. I had purchased a product from BLUEAIR before so I went with the bigger model for the living room / kitchen. It runs beautifully and actually isn't a hideous machine that sticks out, but blends in to the overall aesthetic of the home.
One feature I love is that it has an accompanying app that can control the air filter but also tell you when / if the pollutant levels change as well as the lifespan of the replaceable filter and when it should be changed. It's the rare time when the app actually is helpful!

I normally dislike when I have to download an app to use a household product, but BlueAir's is perfect and I have no complaints with it. It definitely adds value and is easy to navigate for visual learners (shows the filter life, pollutants in the air, allows you to set an automatic daily timer for what setting you want the purifier to work on based on the time of day). The filter goes a little haywire when I use my essential oil diffuser, but other than that it does a good job of monitoring air quality.

ed!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2023","I wanted an air purifier for my bedroom, so I settled on the Blue Air 411i.
I mostly went with this product because other reviews indicated it was good, and I particularly liked the low wattage & low noise. There are other similar models from Blue Air, and I sprung for the wifi-enabled ""i"" version. While I'm glad I opted for the ""i"" version, I also find it annoying that you need to pay extra for seemingly basic features like scheduling, which I don't believe is possible for the non-wifi version. That is, you can schedule the purifier to change modes & light settings on a custom schedule on the Blue Air app.
The Good:
- Quiet. On the lowest couple settings, it's inaudible to me unless I put my ear very close to it. If you crank it up to the highest settings, it's certainly audible. The specs say 18-46 dB. A very quiet room is probably 30-40 dB of ambient noise.
- Energy-efficient. I don't have a watt-meter, but the power specs state it's 20W (which I'm sure varies by the speed it's set to).
- Ability to turn lights off. You can turn the indicator lights completely off, so it's good for use in bedrooms.
The Bad:
- This is rather large for a placing in a bedroom. Dimensions are 18.9 X 10.6 X 10.6 in (H X W X D)
- Its circular design means that it's optimally placed without obstructions around it, which is not practical for most rooms. The Levoit Vital series air purifiers probably have a better design/form factor for bedrooms since they're designed to be pushed up against a wall.
- This is top-heavy and may be a tipping hazard. The bottom two-thirds or so of this product (where the air intake occurs) is basically empty space, while the business end of this is all on the top. The unit as a whole is not particularly heavy, so it' probably not a big deal if it does get knocked over, but a more stable base would've been nice.
- If you want the ability to program a schedule on this, you must pay the extra cash to get the wifi-enabled ""i"" version of this product. I have mine programmed to shut the lights off at night when I'm sleeping.
- The user interface of this thing is less than great. There are a couple touch buttons (that don't actually depress), and you have to use odd combinations of holding & pressing buttons to change the light brightness settings, and you have to cycle through the various speeds in a one-way direction. I understand a nicer interface would have required more buttons or a small screen, which is probably why they have the wifi version with an app which is much easier to use.
Also, the cost of the replacement filters should be taken into consideration when purchasing an air purifier. MSRP is $30 for two filters (though, 3rd party filters can be had for cheaper), and they recommend changing the filter every 6-9 months. There's also an indicator light that tells you when you're supposed to change the filter (though, I have no idea if it's based on time or air flow or both).
As a side note, the product I received from Amazon was defective. It would randomly shut off about once a day. It would basically behave as if it was unplugged, and I would have to unplug & re-plug it in to reset it (the power button wouldn't work). Blue Air support was good though. Friendly customer service, and they shipped me a replacement right away (before waiting to receive my defective unit & allowed me a couple weeks or maybe up to a month to ship it back & provided a postage-paid UPS label).",4.0 out of 5 stars

Linda C.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2024","When I was looking for an air purifier, my Son In Law suggested the Blueaire. This is my second Blueaire. My larger 311i+ is in the primary bedroom. This smaller one is in a guest bedroom, where my grandchildren will nap, when they are over. I have 4 dogs and even though I clean every few days, there is nothing I can do about the air quality.
What I love about this purifier. This model connects to their App via Bluetooth. The App will tell you the status of your air as well as when you need to change the filter out. But the lights on the unit itself will show you how your air quality is. I keep this unit in ""Auto"" mode, so it will sense the air quality and kick up the speed when needed. When the air is clean, this air purifier is so silent you don't even know it's on..but you can feel the air coming from the top.
These ""smart"" air purifiers sense any unusual particles in the air, and when it does, when it's on Auto, will kick into high gear until the air is once again reading at ""Excellent"", on the App...then the lights go back their normal color, and the unit runs silent again. You can also put it on different speeds that will run at that speed 24/7..but keeping it on Auto, it will self adjust as to the air quality. With my other unit, in the primary bedroom...when my husband uses baby powder, after a shower...if I use a spray hair product...if I use a spray sunscreen, from the on-suite bathroom, the Blueaire fan will kick into a higher setting...the lights on the unit change, showing it working harder..then after about 10 minutes, you hear the fan getting quiter as the air gets cleaner....so smart!

A. Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2023","‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ONE YEAR UPDATE‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢
Here‚Äôs the review you want to read.
I have MCS, asthma, and severe life threatening allergies. I‚Äôm dealing with multiple neighbors smoking cigarettes and pot illegally in a posted no smoking building (pot isn‚Äôt even legal here), and trying to mask it with air fresheners and incense etc., and I have been hospitalized via ambulance several times near death from it. (No, I can‚Äôt move somewhere else, or I would.)
I got the 311i Max after reading so many glowing commentaries and spin about it, and deliberately went way over powered for my space too, out of necessity: this thing is lab rated for a space much larger. It‚Äôs in a studio under 220 square feet including bath, and the machine‚Äôs ideal room size is around 650 square feet. They say that at 650 square feet or so it should be clearing a full cycle of the room‚Äôs air in around 12 minutes, and I wanted it to clean the air ASAP without laboring for it. It‚Äôs always a good idea to go for a machine a bit stronger than you think you need.
Out of the box, the first thing I noticed was my asthma spiked up bigtime from it weeping intense VOCs, nearly hospitalizing me. It‚Äôs been running now for about 3 weeks, and that‚Äôs finally just beginning to fade.
My rescue inhaler consumption is through the roof, and my nose/sinuses are sealed shut and constantly gushing now‚Ä¶ which shouldn‚Äôt be happening at this level of filtration. The air circulates in here so much now, I feel a breeze, and it‚Äôs ruffling my wall scrolls across the room. Serious air output.
The ‚Äúsmart‚Äù feature app doesn‚Äôt work with my iPhone. I tried several times, and it doesn‚Äôt want to connect or stay connected. I read their troubleshooting instructions, and even phoned their useless, rude tech support. I can tell you this much about it: it only monitors PM2.5, and the feature connecting to outdoor pollution monitoring by BreezoMeter doesn‚Äôt agree with BreezoMeter‚Äôs app set to my exact location‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs claiming that the outdoor air quality is much better than it actually is. Meanwhile, it was claiming that my indoor air quality was excellent‚Ä¶ as I was struggling in anaphylactic shock from my neighbors lighting up. Yep: still smelling the pot and cigarettes too.
I‚Äôm not the only one who is having problems with their app connecting at all, staying connected, and disagreeing with BreezoMeter‚Äôs app: they‚Äôre chronic problems that he majority of peoples reviews have been complaining about in the Apple App Store for years. Yes, years, and they‚Äôve still not gotten it fixed. (Somewhat similar complaints to a slightly lesser degree in the Google Play store too-
I checked out of curiosity to see if it was only iOS users complaining.) So I have absolutely no access to any of the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù features, and the machine is 24/7 constantly blinking an annoying warning light, telling me that it‚Äôs failing to connect to the app.
Most of the time, the air quality indicator light on the machine is blue, claiming that the room has exceptional air quality, even when cooking. I‚Äôve seen it go red twice for a couple of minutes when I had a hamburger cooking pan with mildly singed drippings in it. The burnt cooking smells take a long time to fade, including using the bathroom vent fan.
The dust being removed is very different from the dust my previous underpowered HEPA ionizer was removing: I now have a layer of dust quickly accumulating everywhere that I didn‚Äôt with the other machine, and strangely, it‚Äôs gritty and coarse in an immaculate room. My previous machine‚Äôs pre filter would become covered in thick, dense gray dust and have to be washed off every couple of weeks. This‚Ä¶ after 3 weeks, it has a few specks of black lint from my bedding, visible if you look closely. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm noticing a huge difference in performance without the ionizer. 2 days post Swiffer detailing, I can swipe visible dust from the top of my desk and dresser with my hand. I can‚Äôt even figure out how that‚Äôs possible with this thing. There‚Äôs even a thick layer of fluffy toilet paper dust accumulating on the back of the toilet now, for the first time. I also go to the extreme measures of sealing entirely around the front door with blue painter‚Äôs tape to stop the shared air flow from the public hallway. That‚Äôs unfortunately been a way of life here for years‚Ä¶ so you can‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs pulling in and filtering air from the hall.
Across the board, it has not been as advertised. A very expensive mistake that I‚Äôve had absolutely no health benefits from so far.
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢
ONE YEAR OF CONSTANT USE AT HIGHEST SETTING, + 1 filter replacement later:
The smart features never worked, which is a huge portion of the cost/value of the machine. It was the deciding factor for this purchase to begin with.
It also has a strange tendency to shut itself down completely for about a minute or so, then turn itself back on‚Ä¶ though it‚Äôs not in automatic mode. A chip/electronic issue somewhere.
The machine is absolutely useless for thick second hand pot and cigarette smoke! It doesn‚Äôt even register the smoke, and says the pm2.5 is A-OK, ideal! Rarely does it think that anything is wrong with the air, in fact. Useless for mold- the room thickly reeks of it still! And ironically, it‚Äôs useless for dust too! A thick layer of dust settles in less than 24h after detailing the place top to bottom with a swiffer! The most visible dust it leaves behind on everything is what appears to be natural skin sheddings, which are dust mite food.
UPDATE 2: July 24th 2024
After strange indicator light behavior for a couple of weeks, all of the indicators are now dead. The colored light PM2.5 meter (which has never been trustworthy, and the app has never functioned with it) is now dark, along with all the lights on top of the machine that indicates that it‚Äôs running and and which speed. It‚Äôs now a very expensive fan with a filter medium over the top of it‚Ä¶ and considering that it‚Äôs 100% electronics in there, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before the fan refuses to even run.
All in all, the worst HEPA filter machine I‚Äôve ever owned‚Ä¶ and the most expensive too!",1.0 out of 5 stars

Kelley,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","I purchased three of these, replacing big not-so-great 2 Honeywell units that were $300 each. The Honeywells were not energy efficient and the covers to change the filters broke pretty quickly and we had to tape them closed.
I was unsure about the BlueAir because right out of the box they recorded that we have excellent air quality on all three. This was hard to believe, however, when I used hairspray the morning after installing these, the bedroom unit which is 15 fee away from the bathroom where I used the hairspray immediately had a red light on the front indicating bad air quality. Took about 10 minutes to clean the air from the hairspray. I was really impressed with this. It also made me realize I should wear a mask when applying hairspray!
I highly recommend these units! They are very easy to assemble - basically zero assembly. It was VERY easy to get all of these on our wifi - all three were set up in a matter of 15 minutes including unpacking and downloading the app and connecting to wifi.
When the California fires start we will be glad we have these and when the house next door barrels out tons of toxic dryer sheet air that always infiltrates our home and gives me asthma, I am guessing these units will quickly get the toxins and odor out.

Bubble Metropolis,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2024","I've been using the BLUEAIR Blue Pure 211i Max Smart Air Purifier for a while now, and it has become an essential part of my home. Here are a few reasons why I highly recommend it:
Efficient Performance: This air purifier does an outstanding job of refreshing the air in my space. It quickly removes common household odors and leaves the room feeling cleaner and more pleasant.
Smart Features: The smart capabilities are a game-changer. I love being able to control and monitor the air purifier remotely through the app. It‚Äôs convenient to adjust settings and check air quality from my phone.
Quiet Operation: Despite its powerful performance, the Blue Pure 211i Max operates quietly. I can run it all day without it being disruptive, even in the bedroom during the night.
Sleek Design: The design is sleek and modern, fitting seamlessly into my home decor. It's not just functional but also adds a touch of style to the room.
Easy Maintenance: The filters are straightforward to replace, and the indicator light lets me know when it's time for a change. The overall maintenance is hassle-free, which is a big plus for busy households.
Cons - ""Welcome Home"" Feature: The only minor issue I've encountered is figuring out the ""welcome home"" feature. Despite following the instructions, I haven't been able to get it to work as expected. It would be helpful if the user manual provided more detailed guidance on setting this up.
Overall, the BLUEAIR Blue Pure 211i Max Smart Air Purifier has impressed me with its performance, convenience, and design. It's a great addition to any home, making the environment more comfortable and enjoyable.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Also, I cannot use the Auto setting. When particulate levels spike, the fan ramps up to a high level and the unit gets very loud for about 10 - 20 seconds, then goes back to a lower, quieter level.

Virginia Booklover,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2023","I needed to set up a filter in my home office once I started sharing it with a parakeet, and decided to go for this model, as offering a good combination of size, appearance, and functionality. I also splurged on the 411i (internet connected) just to try it out.
I'm surprised at how much I'm enjoying the connectivity. Not that I NEED to be able to adjust fan speed from a thousand miles away, but I could!! More importantly, this gives me the ability to program a schedule - lower fan speed when I'm working, higher in the evenings / weekends. It also lets me set intermediate fan speeds, e.g. 2.5 versus 3, or whatever.
Noise: I have it set to 1 during the day, and I genuinely do not notice it unless I deliberately listen for it. When I'm in the office later, it is louder - but it's just white noise, so it's not bothersome. And my allergies do seem to be slightly better.
HEPA filtration: The manufacturer uses the term HEPASilent, not true HEPA. Doing some further reading, this is because the unit's filter is NOT a true HEPA filter, which by itself traps 99.7% of particles of 0.3 microns (and supposedly, even more for larger or smaller particles). Instead, this unit combines a barrier filter with an electrostatic unit - presumably this is responsible for the low noise level and the energy efficiency. Having used true HEPA units in the pasts, the BlueAir unit is definitely quieter.
Because of the electrostatic component, the device will emit a small amount of ozone. As it falls within all regulatory limits, including California's tough rules, this seems to be low enough that it is not worrisome. If you are particularly concerned over ozone, and/or plant to use this in a closed room without adequate ventilation, it's something to consider.
A note on the filtration efficiency: BlueAir claims that their unit removes 99.7% of particles 0.1 microns in size - which would seem to be even better than the HEPA standard. However, since the HEPA standard says that they will likely trap MORE particles larger and smaller than 0.3 microns, it is certainly possible that the BlueAir doesn't work quite as well. I don't know if that's the case, and I suspect that for household uses, it would not make any difference for practical purposes - the difference would be trivial.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Adam Samuels,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2024","We bought the BLUEAIR Blue Pure 211i Max because it's AHAM verified, highly rated by Consumer Reports, and has mostly positive customer reviews. Once it arrived and was set up in our living room I noticed it resembled a large cat scratching post. Unfortunately, our cats also noticed this. I was able to redirect the cats but was afraid they would tear up the cloth prefilter when they were home alone. Also, the cloth prefilter is the only thing protecting the main HEPA filter. This, too, could have been damaged by unsupervised cats. I put the our 211i Max in our guest room and closed the door while deciding what to do. It was looking like it would have to be returned which was disappointing. Ironically, the cats were a major reason for purchasing this air purifier and they might potentially be its demise. I contacted Blueair customer support to see if they had any suggestions. Their suggestion was to place the 211i Max where the cats couldn't access it. They must not be cat owners. Besides, putting it in a closed room would defeat the purpose of buying it. Fortunately, I was able to find my own solution. I purchased a Cat Scat Mat from Amazon and attached it to the 211i Max with zip ties (see photos). One zip tie is a reusable type so it can be loosened to allow easy removal of the Cat Scat Mat. This is necessary for periodic cleaning of the prefilter. This may not be the most aesthetically pleasing solution but the cats leave it alone and it allows for ample airflow. I've named our 211i Max ""Porky"" because it resembles a porcupine. üòÇ

Wizbang_FL,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2018","2-1-2019 Updated....I have been using the filter now for over a year and generally have been pleased with the results my only complaint is that occasionally the filters will have a very very strong chemical or manufacturing smell i‚Äôm not sure if this is because of a change in their supplier but when I order the filters again I will return them if they have the same smell. The odor dissipates within two to three days. The filter otherwise still works just as well as it did when I originally purchased it. I highly suggest getting on a subscriptionFor the filters as it lowers the cost but you be to the judge of that. Left at 4 stars pending next filter delivery.
1-8-2018 Ibought this filter based on the reviews of organizations and users alike, overall everyone was happy with varying levels of satisfaction. Here are the items that I have observed after one month of use. #1. The unit is very quiet and I was surprised upon opening it how simple the design is. It consists of the top fan assembly. The barrel filter with the activated charcoal filter inside and a simple frame that the filter is attached to with a cloth cover. Motor is connected by placing on top and turning a bit clockwise to lock the 2 together. #2 The entire unit is slightly larger than 2 gallon cubes of milk stacked one upon the other. (IE: It won't fit on a small nightstand or under a normal short bedside lamp. Also the unit should not be enclosed on a shelf as the air exhausts from the top and the intake is from the sides all around. I have mine on the floor beside the nightstand between the bed. #3. The outer cover actually acts as a pre-filter. Be prepared to do a quick hand wash of it every week (this will help your primary filter from being clogged with larger particles that can be caught in the fabric. My filter came with a blue and gray filter cover (the pre-filter) so I will trade then off every week and hand wash and hang dry the other one. #4. That being said there was some construction going on to a building next to ours and it smelled of burning and chemicals for just over a week. Afterward I looked at the filter (because I wash the outer filter every week.) and I saw honest truth to the filter being effective because the filter was extremely dirty. I tapped out the filter outside to remove some of the accumulated dust and debris. It still is working well. I expect I will have to replace it next month. But I would anticipate changing it out every three months because I do have strong allergies and my sleep has improved so much since it's use that it's a small price to pay. I will be getting a larger unit for the living area/office. Also happy to see that the replacement filters are not extremely expensive. I have seen some of the other mfr's filters that are 50+ for a filter for a unit that covers the same area and needed replaced every 3 to 6 months (which is what this says)
After a week of using it I questioned if it was doing any good. My roommate entered and commented how fresh the room smelled. So I started to think about when the last time I woke up in the middle of the night, which was a normal occurrence. Since I started using the unit I hadn't woke during that week. Also when I woke I felt much more rested. I have always had allergies and my roommates commented I would often snore loudly. Since I started using the filter constantly no snoring and have had a much more restful sleep. I have been very happy with this purchase. I will say that this unit is best for a Smaller room of up to 125 sq ft with standard 8' ceilings. aka 1000 cubic feet of space (LxWxH) which represents how much air the filter can process effectively. Beyond that it will be challenged to perform adequately. It is small enough that it could fit in a large suitcase and I would certainly take it if I were still traveling for work where I would spend a few weeks in a hotel room and then move to another location for another few weeks. A couple things to be aware of that I didn't initially understand.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Its lowest setting is so quiet you wouldn‚Äôt know it is on, the mid setting is what we keep ours on for more air flow and some white noise. The high setting is perfect when you want to quickly (like in 5-10 minutes) filter out any funk from a messy diaper change without opening windows.
As a side: my husband has traveled (driven) with ours when he had a work trip to an area near bad wildfires. It helped get rid of the smoke smell in his hotel room.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The last room I needed one for was my office. I was excited when I saw the price on this one since I have two other 411s as well. What I didn‚Äôt realize is that those ones were autos and this one isn‚Äôt. Not a deal breaker but had I known explicitly, I wouldn‚Äôt just paid a little more for the auto one. I guess it‚Äôs my fault for assuming that all of them were already auto. The first one I bought was over 3 years ago so I just figured.

G.W.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2024","I like the adjustable speed, and the display of air quality information. This unit can display measurements for 3 different particulate sizes: PM1, PM2.5, and PM10. When used in conjunction with the app, you can track the amount of each pollutant over time. This is useful if, for example, you want to see how your air quality tracks activities like cooking or outdoor air quality. Each of the 4 preset speeds is generally quiet. You can hear the higher speeds, but it‚Äôs not too disruptive.
My reason for not giving five stars is the noise generated in automatic mode. The unit continuously adjusts the speed based on air quality. On its own, this is a nice feature. However, certain speed ranges of the fan only reached in automatic mode produce some intrusive ‚Äúhowling‚Äù sounds. It sounds like some sort of resonance that is much louder than any of the preset speeds. I wouldn‚Äôt suggest setting this unit on automatic while sleeping or in other situations requiring quiet. The unit does not have this issue when set on one of the 4 preset speeds.",4.0 out of 5 stars

MrPandaladin,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024","First off why is ""Maneuverability"" a rating category? Am I driving with this thing?
Positive:
-HEPA catches everything and Carbon get the gases!
-Consumer Report recommended!
-Filters last a long time and price is reasonable. (Up to 9 months)
-Has built in air quality sensor with AUTO mode. (It will kick up the fan when needed especially while I am cooking.)
-Great designs. (The design sucks in air from 360 degrees, super efficient.)
-Great fan noise and speed ratio. (While on auto the low fan mode is quiet and is running all the time. Even at 50% the fans are not that loud.)
-Has scheduler and night mode for the keypad.
-The keypad can also be locked out via APP.
-The APP is very useful and will give you a filter life remaining indicator.
-Your air quality is recorded and you can review it whenever you want.
Negative:
NONE!

kailee beaton,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2024","This air filter is fantastic! I moved into a new apartment with my 2 year old (who has severe allergies) in October. Within the first week I realized there was a mold problem and we both began struggling with health problems. Cleaning and other measures were not enough.
I did some research and found this filter and decided to take the risk and try it out. I was worried about the price, but did the payment plan and it worked out great for me.
What I really love about this air filter is that it has a phone app. It shows the quality of your air and also the air outside so you can see the difference. I was able to see that the air quality in my house was ‚Äúvery bad quality.‚Äù After a couple days of moving the air filter around my house to make sure each room was getting filtered - I noticed a huge difference.
Another cool feature is that the filter goes on automatically when it detects something and continues to filter until the air is clean. At night time I put it into nighttime mode or just shut off.
Super easy to use and comes put together. All you have to do is take it out of the box and plug it in!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Shane,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2023","I was forced to buy this unit to replace my original BlueAir 211 unit from 2016 which is still going strong. Sadly the manufacturer is no longer making replacement filters for the original units, although they will eventually have a metal cage and filter one can use. The newer unit was on sale via Amazon Prime Day so I picked one up to compare. The newer 211i Max unit is slightly larger than the older version. At maximum the sound is similar, but what is cool about the newer one is you can modify the fan speed in tiny increments to lower the sound and speed where the original unit only had 3 preset speeds. I'd say overall, the newer unit isn't as quiet as I'd hoped but is surely no louder than the original. The app says my air is ""excellent"" and as such if I toggle it to the Auto setting it puts the fan speed on the lowest setting. However, since I have allergies to dust and pollen, I decided to keep the fan at 60% (~the middle setting on the original) to ensure the air stays clean. I don't trust their ability to understand the air cleanliness in my home due to other reviewers saying they blew pollutants into the unit and it couldn't differentiate them. If I could trust it - it'd be a nice electricity savings as well as noise reduction. The app is OK - but not excellent as it is not intuitive (e.g., they show PMIs of 1, 2.5 and 10 but the list is only for show - I initially thought we could choose to toggle which PMI level we wanted to remove from the air). Overall I'd imagine the unit will perform as the original did, but no better, but I'd have preferred to keep the original rather than buy the new one. At least the Amazon Prime Day Deal took some of the sting out of the ""upgrade"".",4.0 out of 5 stars

The prior unit was left on low all day , every day, for a year, however it never seemed to make any difference. Most notable for me was the ability of the Blueair unit to remove cooking smells. Prior to purchasing the blueair, I would have to open the door and run two powerful fans to air out the kitchen and living room and even then, all detectable smells would take days to dissipate. With the blueair unit I don't need to blow out the cooking smells or leave the doors open. It clears all traces of the smells with 2 hours.

Mrs F,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2024",I bought this because it is supposed to recognize the air quality is bad and start running. Since being plugged in all it has shown is blue for great air quality which is wrong. Right now my oven is cleaning and my house stinks from it. The air purifier is sitting in the kitchen and says the air is great. If I separate the top from the filter it suddenly recognizes that the air is bad and goes red. When I put it back on it turns off and goes to blue again. I looked closely at it and noticed the one I was sent by amazon does NOT have the circular disc to remove and clean the sensor. I believe this is the problem...I don't know if maybe this was a manufacturing error and they are shipping faulty ones through amazon hoping customers don't notice or what. I am on the phone with amazon right now to see about getting a replacement for the $199.99 that I paid on prime day instead of returning it and having to buy it again.

Trad,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2024","Out of the box, the unit clattered occasionally on the lower fan speeds, and the unit emitted a chemical smell. The smell dissipated somewhat (though not entirely) but the noise got worse.
Despite a variety of outdoor air quality readings, good to moderate, the particle detector read ""0"" most of the time for the 3 particle sizes. The one exception was slight burned popcorn, which hit the 20s. As they claim the unit bases filter assessments on the quality of the air, it would last forever at that rate (which can't be accurate). And the ""auto"" feature obviously won't work properly if the air quality detector is inaccurate.
Finally, the app is a bit testy, and it doesn't appear that the unit retains prior air quality data when unplugged for several hours. If so, this would also render the filter assessment invalid.

Joe Blow,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2023","I have had the BluAir 211i Max for a couple of months now and I wish I had sent it back soon after I started using it.
1. As others have reported It emanates an antiseptic/plastic type of smell, still after two months of use. It's a very unpleasant smell!
2. It is really noisy! My unit has become progressively noisier with use, it emanates a loud hum noise that increases with fan speed and on Lvl 3 the fan interferes with the case and so in addition makes a high frequency clicking sound.
I feel that a cheap electrical motor is used and manufacturing Quality Control is below an acceptable standard.
It does clean the air effectively however the noise and smell of the unit negate this fact. In the end I will just throw it out and buy something else. A total loss in my view!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Jay,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2023","Before purchasing, I spoke w/ a Blueair rep who confirmed that this unit reduces VOC‚Äôs. However, all tests I‚Äôve run show that VOC levels INCREASE while this unit runs. VOC decreases when I turn the unit OFF. I‚Äôve run the unit long enough that any unit off-gassing would have stabilized.
The sensor on this unit reads PM levels at zero even when my 2 ‚Äúverified‚Äù monitors read PM 2.5 as high as 17. Therefore ‚Äúauto‚Äù mode doesn‚Äôt kick in when needed.
The unit does decrease PM levels well, but only in smaller spaces & at fan speeds 2 or higher. I have not seen it affect PM levels in large spaces as claimed.
I tried contacting Blueair support via email re these issues but got no reply. I was able to use their live-chat support just once - other attempts gave a message stating that live-support was not working.
I‚Äôm returning this item and searching for a better option.",1.0 out of 5 stars

When I try to set up a weekend schedule, it says my scheduled time overlaps the weekday schedule DESPITE it being completely different WEEKEND DAYS than weekday days. We‚Äôre home differently on weekends than weekdays. Their iOS app checks the times BUT NOT THE DAYS and gives you an OVERLAP error when clearly no such overlap exists!

Also, not sure what genius decided that light gray text on a white background is readable, but simply using black text would make everything readable.

Susan Fitzsimons,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2021","I ordered this one based on CR reviews and other research. The 411 model worked well and then suddenly stopped. Called customer service and they sent a replacement after sending them the docs they needed. The replacement lasted 5 months and suddenly stopped (Both were never put on high). Called customer service and sent them the docs this is still within the 1 year warranty and they sent me a notice of getting it. Now after they stall and the one year is up, nothing no notice no calls just ads asking me to buy another one. Seriously, 2 unit both die within 11 months and I am to buy another unit. One defect OK, 2 there is something very wrong. Stay away from this unit especially at the $120 price point. While customer service was good on the 1st call, they have gone AWOL and left me in the dark. Buy at your own risk and hope the unit works and if you need a replacement pray it lasts longer than the first. Horrible experience from the product and customer service, now off the hook that the one year warranty is over I guess.

DLPeters,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2020","It's basically a giant paper filter cartridge covered in a polyester sleeve with a round fan unit sitting on top. On low speed its totally ineffective drawing in air toward the filter. On high speed, the total intake surface area of the filter is still too much to draw any air toward the filter unless it's less than 6 inches away from the unite, also the noise at top is kind of annoying. I placed the unit on the floor in my home office and frankly it competes with the soft music I play while working. As others have noted, I also believe the unit has been used previously as there is some light dirt on the filter, so I suspect this is a return and repackaged and sent out as new. I'm not going to bother returning it as it's just too darn much hassle. I'll keep it in my home office and run it while I'm not in the room. Will see if it does any good and will update my review after about 30 days, but I can't really stand it running while I'm working.

It also claims to be 'so effective it reduces ozone', which is clearly a lie since the product emits ozone.
An air purifier should never add anything to the air - it should only remove contaminants. Adding a contaminant like ozone is unacceptable regardless of the volume generated. The ionization chamber needs to be removed for this to be a viable purifier.

67241,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2017","Love the Blue Pure 411 - if you have allergies or chemical sensitivities or just want to breathe clean fresh air, this is the best product ever. I have two at work at they clean the air of perfume / cologne worn by colleagues. The highest setting is a bit loud, but the medium level works perfectly well and is very very quiet. I have purchased other air purifiers that cost more money but the Blue air purifiers are by far the best and most efficient.
Updated October 11, 2018: all three of the Blue Pure 411 units are malfunctioning - long after return eligibility. I noticed they were still making a motor noise even when turned completely off - I had to actually unplug all three units to get the motor to stop running, Very scary and glad I noticed this before any potential fire hazards.

Carolyn Tara,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2020","*** After 6 months of light/periodic use, this stopped working entirely. Downgrading to 0 STARS. ***
3 stars because it's fairly effective at minimizing the smell of my neighbor's smoke, which was my main reason for purchasing. However, this is listed under Amazon's section for HEPA Air purifiers incorrectly. This is NOT a HEPA air purifier and therefore there is little to verify that it makes any significant difference to air quality. I have certainly not noticed any improvement in the level of dust in my small living room.
If this item is appropriately categorized as non-HEPA then I will modify my rating, because as a carbon purifier it is fairly effective. But this listing is misleading -- as you can see from many reviews and answers that talk about this as a HEPA air purifier.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Amazonite,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2021","This filter may have 3 speed settings, but as far as I'm concerned, it only has two: too quiet, and too loud.
On the lowest setting, it is barely moving air and wouldn't filter any space larger than the box it came in. On the medium and high settings, it is way too loud for an office environment, which is where I need it. There is no way anyone is going to have a coherent thought in the same room with this thing running on medium or high. Someday a company will produce a small air filter with a dial setting where the user can precisely set the level of noise they can tolerate, rather than leaving it to the manufacturers who clearly feel that users love continuous loud noises.

Kratze,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2024","I am in the process of returning the ones I bought. Nothing in the advertising said ""By the way, the LED lights on the 411s can't be turned off at night and they will glow like a huge nightlight all over your walls when you are trying to sleep"". I would never have bought them if I'd known this. Do NOT get these if you need a dark room in order to sleep - even cheap actual nightlights can be switched off! (Worth noting that the 311 model does have a night mode so maybe spring for that instead.) This is 85% of the reason for my return.
For the rest, I also did not notice any difference in the room or my sleep quality; it just didn't seem like it was doing anything useful. If I turned it on a higher setting, it made a distracting noise; on low, it just didn't seem functional. It definitely doesn't help with odors; I have a room with several laser-cut jigsaws in it and the smell of burnt wood (side effect of the process) stayed exactly the same.
That's not to say they aren't working, since I don't have tools to measure progress. For that reason, I am keeping the 311 for downstairs a little longer to give it a chance, especially since the LEDs can be turned off. I gave the 411s 2 stars simply because I can't prove they are useless, just that they didn't do anything useful that I actually noticed.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Lisa Brodsky,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2021","I have a cat with severe allergies that cause her to scratch herself bloody. I bought another air filter about a year ago, half the size and half the price of this one, and it significantly reduced her scratching. Just one problem: it only runs for 12 hours and then shuts itself off. I heard about this one, which can run 24/7, bought it on Prime Day and started running it as soon as it arrived.
I was very happy that it continued to run without interruption for three days, and my cat seemed fine. But on the morning of the third day I noticed that my cat was getting scratchy, as she usually gets if I forget to turn the 12 hour one back on (it's so quiet I sometimes don't notice when it turns off). I was appalled. I checked the device and the instructions to make sure I hadn't forgotten anything, made sure there wasn't any plastic covering the filter or a filter I didn't put in place, watched a video about setting it up, but everything seems to be in place. It just doesn't work as well as the one I already had for half the price.
I thought about returning it but I think I'm going to keep it here, on the other side of the room, as a backup for when I forget to turn the 12 hour one back on. Within about 10 minutes after I turned the old filter on, the cat seemed significantly less scratchy.
As for the noise level: I saw a lot of commercials that talked about how quiet this device is. On it's lowest level, it's very quiet, so quiet I was not even sure it was on, but I barely felt any air moving so I'm not sure it was doing anything. At the second level, it's a little bit louder but not at all troubling. At the highest level, it's loud enough to be very annoying. I kept it at the second level.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Folk Rock Blues,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2021","I initially really liked the Blue Air Pure 411. I even bought a couple more of the Auto models for additional rooms of the house. It seemed to do a good job, I could sleep just fine with the white noise of the highest speed, and it was easy to just run my vacuum's hose over the outer filter every couple of weeks to keep it clean.
After 6 months, the first one went bad, with red lights flashing, indicating it was time to change the filters. So I removed the inner (not a true HEPA) filter and outer filter and installed new ones, carefully reassembled the unit, plugged it back in and turned it on.
The red lights continue to flash, and the air coming out is full of a very fine dust. Almost as though they were on timers, the same thing happened with the other 2 units. The warranties are no longer in effect because I didn't purchase replacement filters often enough.
So now I have a few hundred dollars invested in units and replacement filters that don't work, and at best are good for target practice. I'm guessing none of the ratings companies (including CR, who I really trust) tested these things for more than a few days.

However, while the cloth on the outside was slightly dusty (see picture), the filter inside looked totally pristine! Now full disclosure -- I never laundered the blue cover. But frankly, although it now looks dusty, it was NOTHING like some of the pictures I see of collected dust. Is this because I didn't wash the cloth? But then, shouldn't the cloth have been just totally gross and filthy?

Saro Nalbandian,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2019","After years of waking up tired and congested, I decided to try an air purifier. I chose Blue Pure 411 for looks, size and cost of purchase and operations. I purchased one, which worked great, and then purchased 3 more. All 3 fans were defective and had clicking noise, more audible at low settings. I immediately returned 2 and the one I sent as gift to family apparently also has a slight clicking sound, so will be returning as well.
1st UNIT: Very happy with this first unit.
Pros:
- Super easy to setup and operate
- Worked great! Ran it on low mode all night and woke up with clear sinuses, so refreshed.
- Totally silent in ""Low"" mode. Mid and high modes are more audible but sound like white noise so depends on your noise sensitivity, Low setting seems to work great at night.
- Light weight, can easily be repositioned around the room.
- Simple and clean design.
- Affordable to purchase and replace filters ($20 on Amazon).
Cons:
- The lights did not turn off (decided to live with it).
2nd SET (Purchased 2 pack for other rooms and another single unit as a gift):

chill28,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2019","Unless size is your #1 concern, avoid this. Spend a bit more ($40 ish) to get something that's x5 times better. The fan on high is not something that you're going to want while occupying the room, it's loud and an annoying pitch. Med isn't much better but barely tolerable. A slightly larger unit will move much more air and do it with 0 audible/bothersome noise.
It's my understanding that most all of these filters get their room size/air flow rating on a high fan speed. Meaning if you run this on low and you have it in a closet is the only way it'll do what you'd expect. It's supposedly rated at 161 sq ft (161 sq ft = ~12 x 12ft) and cleaning that on low is a joke. If you need to put this on high you'll hate it, medium isn't great either. I wouldn't use this in anything bigger than an 8x8 space, maybe then low would do.
On low it's inaudible but the air flow is really low, you need to run med or high to really get anything out of it. And it's that small fan higher pitch annoying whine, don't keep it in a room that isn't loud already unless it's on low.
I use a 16"" fan on high for white noise to sleep, love that. It's loud but a lower pitch and not annoying to me like this thing is.",2.0 out of 5 stars

CA,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2021","This purifier seemed like a great choice after reading reviews so I bought several for my family and myself, but as others have said, I found the lights to be way too bright at night even dimmed with the unit on low so only one light was illuminated. Once my eyes adjusted to the dark, the room was lit up enough to be easily walked through. Other family members have covered the lights with objects but at this price, I feel that improvised solutions to design flaws are unacceptable.
After looking here for ideas, I emailed the company about getting a few light covers and was told they'd ship them out but to expect delays due to the pandemic and wildfires (from the previous year, really?). In the time since, I've bought and received several packages but Blueair has still failed to send me anything.
As for noise, the fan is silent on low, but on medium and high it's noticeably noisy and disturbing. In light of this, I kept mine on low and questioned whether the unit even moved and filtered enough air to justify it's use, eventually deciding that it did not and requested a refund.",2.0 out of 5 stars

AmazonUser,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2020","It's about as light as a football, so you can throw it across the room if needed.
Otherwise, a disappointment. The low setting barely moves any air -- at all. You can hardly feel anything with your hand right above the unit. Medium speed makes a fairly quiet yet annoying humming sound. Nothing like the deep noise of a normal fan. High sounds like a model airplane taking off and still moves relatively little air.
I was looking for something I could run 24/7 and not be annoyed by. This does not fit the bill. The pitch of the sound is mid-range, not low like my old Blue Air 503. I cannot speak to the quality of filtration, but I can say the unit is little more than a cylindrical filter with a tiny fan inside. I would guess < $15/pc to manufacture.
Update: the pre-filter and the HEPA clog within a month -- and this is in a relatively clean environment. I used ro respect Blue Air. Not so much any more.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Peter M,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2019","Overall I am unhappy with this product for the money spent. I wish I had instead gotten another 211+. My 211+ cranks air out even on the Stage 2 (Middle) setting. Back to the 411: There are 3 stages for the fan to drive air through the filter. Stage 1 is impressively low power and pumps a little air through the room but I found it to be too little airflow to use. Maybe if I am gone for a week on vacation I'll use it, probably not. Stage 2 is better airflow but I still find it lacking for an 11x12 room (Kids room). This stage is what I end up using all of the time since Stage 3 gets to a level of noise that I find annoying. In Stage 3 (Max airflow) I find that the air is moving at a much more desirable level but I find the whining noise to be annoying so I can't handle actually keeping it on stage 3. It is VERY close to not being annoying but it is over the line for my whiny noise tolerance.",2.0 out of 5 stars
R. Adams,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2019","I bought this knowing that some customers have complained about it giving off an odor after reassurances from the manufacturer that this is a rare problem caused by filter adhesive. It‚Äôs not rare. As soon as I turned it on it changed the smell of the air in the room to a sort of electrical/wet dog smell. The company has been incredibly responsive. Over the past three weeks, they have sent me four replacement filters and every one of them had the same odor. Other than a bright on/off light unsuitable for a bedroom, (they‚Äôll send you a sticker to cover it), the design is beautiful and filter easy to replace. I bought this because I wanted a place to sleep and retreat to with clean air and because it was top rated on Consumer Reports, which it should not have been with this issue.

Confronted with returning a second unit, I found that it I use a two thumb approach and press hard on the switch I can get it to respond. One would think that this design error would be addressed.

zdgp,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2023","We bought this unit because it was check rated by Consumer Reports. We have had it only a couple of weeks, so it is too early to judge performance.
There is a touch display that has the usual on/off and fan speed switches.
You can also toggle between three numbers: PM 1, PM 2.5, or PM 10. I think PM stands for ‚Äúparticulate matter‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt a clue what the numbers mean. The instruction booklet and website were no help. There is also a three digit display that currently says: zero. Zero what? It looks like this unit claims to have all kinds of sophisticated functions, and I question whether they really exist. Therefore three stars.
Two-month update: We have now had it for almost two months. The first month it was set at PM 2.5. The 2nd month I am running on PM 1 and can‚Äôt detect any difference. The 3rd month I‚Äôll try PM 10. It has been on fan speed 2 the entire time. The display always shows ‚Äúzero‚Äù and the blue light never changes.
All it does is draw air through a filter with a choice of four fan speeds. That‚Äôs it! Air cleaners that do this can be purchased for a third of what we paid for this unit.
One other possible source of information might be the Blueair app. I tried to set it up on my Galaxy 23, but couldn‚Äôt do it. The Bluetooth connection kept telling me to install the app which I had already done. That‚Äôs as far as I got.
A final mystery is why this item was check rated by Consumer Reports, which usually indicates a good combination of price and value.
Additional update: We purchased a Blueair 511 for a bedroom. It has one button and a choice of three fan speeds: just the basics. It cost about one third the cost of the 211.

1). Getting initial wifi connection took nearly 30 mins. I am a heavy PC user by the way. And I have a degree in IS/IT. But after the initial connection issues it was solid.
2) The app would never provide current PM2.5 levels unless I shut down the app and restarted it.
3) Sensor is not very sensitive so the auto mode is useless unless air quality is very bad.
4) I ran a test where I lit half of an insence stick. After a full day of the unit running I could still smell the insence. Not impressive.
5) The purifier has 3 fan speeds selectible from the top. The app allows far more resolution of fan speeds which is nice. Above the 2nd setting the unit is very loud. Not just loud, but it's a very irritating type of white noise. I believe that's because of the high frequency content - but I didn't verify that wirh a spectrum analyzer. It's my perceived/subjective assessment. For example I have a large fan that is easily louder in terms of decibels, but it is a relaxing sound (like a hum) that helps sleeping.
6) I noticed very little change in the amount of dust settling on surfaces. And that's with forcing the unit to run on a higher setting than auto mode would select by itself. The reality is that this unit doesn't move much air.
I see two main use cases for this:
1) In a small-ish room, running it on the lowest speed (or close to) and placing it within a few feet of where you are - say at night.
2) In a larger space (maybe almost as large as what it's rated for) by running it on high while you are away (say at work) then slowing it down when you are home so it's not annoying.
It's a fine unit, but you just need to understand its limitations. It's for small volumes only in my opinion. I think a separate ""stirring"" fan would help bring air particles around so this unit could snag them. But then I think it makes more sense to just get a larger air purifier. Keep in mind a larger unit (albiet more expensive) has three big advantages:
1) It can clean the same volume of air as a smaller unit - but at a lower (read quieter) fan speed.
2) When necessary, it will be capable of cleaning a larger volume (pulling in from a greater distance).
3) It can clean the same volume of air as a smaller unit, but quicker.
Considering the experience I had, I returned mine because it simply didn't meet my needs. I purchased a much larger unit and will deal with the size. In the end I care more about the quality of my space than I do the decor.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I wrote the following review yesterday.
This product did not come with an initial starter air filter. It just arrived today, and we have to order a filter for it before we can try it out. I will be contacting the manufacturer about this because the instructions did not indicate you have to purchase your first filter separately. The only way I found out is because I double checked that it had a filter before I would turn it on the first time, and it does not have a filter.

Apparently, they wanted to add more features which resulted in this version, and it works ok but the fan starts to make a strange humming sound that is loud enough to wake you up.

Steve Koff,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2024","I purchased two of these units July 2023.
The good: the units are pretty quiet even on high speed. It's simple to operate with a one touch power setting that's fairly sensitive. The pre-filter catches most of the heavier dust and is able to be rinsed out. Even with one next to my woodstove, (which creates a good amount of dust), I didn't have to change the HEPA filter for 6 months
The bad: one of the units only lasted 6 months before it somehow died. I've tried everything in the troubleshooting guide to resolve it but no good.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Arash,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2023","I have 3 of these BlueAir 411's around the house and they were great for a while. I swapped out the prefilter and main filter regularly and could notice a difference in household allergies while these were running. They helped quite a bit with seasonal allergies and things like wildfire smoke going through the area.
Unfortunately all 3 of these have now stopped working after about 3-4 years of use. Since the device is mostly mechanical (mainly just a fan), I expected them to last longer. And the fact that all 3 went out within months of each other makes it seem less a coincidence.
While I was happy with these while they working, I won't be getting Blueairs to replace them. I will look for something that lasts longer or at least has a longer warranty.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Robert Klaproth,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2022","Updated review‚Ä¶. I‚Äôve had these for over a year now and am still suffering miserably with my allergies. I have found that they are very effective with all the windows and doors closed but the reality is if you live in a place like San Diego you want to open your doors and windows in the evening to cool your home off without spending hundreds per month on AC bills. Turns out the money spent on AC bills might be worth it to prevent my allergy attacks.
Prior review:
This is definitely one of the quietest air purifiers I've ever owned (except on the high speed). I have one of these in my office and one in the bedroom, and the bigger 4 series in our living room. I have suffered from allergies to mold and tree pollen for years and I would say this has made a small difference for me, but has not completely solved all of my allergy problems and for that I will deduct a star. The filters are easy to replace and I really appreciate that the pre filter is washable so you don't have to keep buying them (and you get an extra one with the unit so you never have to be without a prefilter). The filters last about 6 months and you can get a good discount direct from the manufacturer if you auto-ship them.",3.0 out of 5 stars

JB,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2023",I was really excited to get this purifier. Over the years I've owned dozens of different brands and thought this would be the best yet. The design is great and the features are great. But the fan motor hums and is really noticeable. My other models you would just get the noise of a fan moving air as you increased the speeds but with this you get the air noise and a motor hum. I think it has a high quality fan unit but the issue is it's loud because of this. I honestly don't know how people aren't complaining about it. I've found Reddit threads with people saying the same thing. I'll be reaching out to the company to complain an and return.,3.0 out of 5 stars

NiobiumOasis,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2020","This worked very well until I started using it on its highest setting more often during an intense fire season. It started putting off a smell like burning plastic today after it was on the highest setting for about 8 hours due to heavy smoke from nearby fires. Before this, I pretty much only used it on low or medium and it worked quite well.
But if you use it a lot on high, you might find out that your filter needed to be changed a long time ago and end up with a damaged fan motor. Or worse, I‚Äôm probably not ever going to use it again, since the fan doesn‚Äôt have a timer-shutoff function nor any sort of clogged-filter-shutoff safety feature either. It seems like it would have started a fire if I hadn‚Äôt been home when it started making the burning plastic smell.
The fan seems to work okay when it is detached from the filter and doesn‚Äôt make the burning smell. It might be fine because I immediately noticed the smell, shut it off, and inspected the main filter. The prefilter looked clean when this happened and I replaced the main filter about 2 months ago, but the main one was absolutely filthy.
I decided to pay $50 more for the Coway Airmega 200M that has an air quality sensor so there is an accurate warning of when to replace the filter and can dynamically set its speed depending on where the pollution levels are at. Though the Blueair 411 was reviewed favorably by the Wirecutter, the Coway Mighty and Airmega were their top picks and now I see why.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Henrietta Chic,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2019","Hello. I just received my air ""purifier"" and have been running it all day at high speed. I got this particular one because it was the budget recommendation from wirecutter.com. The sound is not bad at all even on high and I like the simple design. The replacement filters (recommended to change every 6 months) are around 20 dollars. This is supposedly a good deal in the long run compared to other air purifiers. The sleeve needs to be pulled and stretched out to fit the machine. It feels like the material of tights or stockings. There is a choice of a bright aqua blue and a gray sleeve. It is bigger than I expected, but is very light and easy to move around. All you do is press the button to turn on, increase the speed, and turn off. You do not have to press the button hard. Very simple.
The reason I purchased this was for my son's allergies that have been coming and going. He usually coughs at night and in the mornings because of our unusually high pollen count this season where we live. My only issue is the strange odor that is coming out from the machine. It smells like stinky socks/chemical smell from the filter. This is a brand new machine with a brand new slip on it. The slip smells fine. Maybe I got a bad filter? When I put my face over the air, my eyes start to sting. I wonder if I'm introducing chemicals into my son's room rather than cleaning the air, which is a bad feeling. I'm giving it a chance because I heard the smell will go away after a few days? If it does, I will purchase another one for my husband's office.

Dennis,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2020","I have recently purchased a couple different brands of this device to replace two I purchased many years ago, so I feel like I have something to compare this device with. This device has a fan on top with a single button you tap repeatedly to select low, medium, and high speeds. Three lights around the button come on to indicate low, medium and high settings. You cannot suppress these lights, as you can in some other devices that are currently cheaper on Amazon. The low speed is silent but moves very little air. The high speed is quite noisy, the medium is in between. I like to sleep to white noise, so for me the noise is a bonus. Below the fan is a long cylindrical filter that is surrounded by a fabric sleeve that can be removed and washed. My device came with a blue fabric sleeve and a spare gray fabric sleeve. The sleeve surrounds a large filter. This is not a HEPA grade filter, however, meaning that many small particles get through. If you are allergic, this would be an issue, since the smallest particles get farthest into your lungs. Other devices that I have purchased, have a HEPA filter, have more electronic controls and timers, lights off mode, and cost less. I would recommend buying one of those. Can't say anything about reliability, since I have only had it a short while. Replacement filters cost about $20, same as HEPA filter for other brand I have recently purchased.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I say this because we had the 211+ in our bedroom first, which is 4 times the size, and it was so quiet on the low setting and the medium setting. A nice low frequency hum, like a fan.

Its not offensive though and it doesn't seem to cause problems for the chemically sensitive resident.

Green means 'good,' but the yellow is in yellow text, so cannot read what it means. I have not been running it on 'high' speed, bur only on 'low' (to keep the noise level down). What really irks me is how I'm still suffering with allergies, so my air quality has NOT improved significantly, and no, I have NOT have any windows open. Unfortunately, I'm still sneezing, blowing my nose, almost constantly, and still go through about 6 boxes of Kleenex each month.

- Unless your exact location can be identified it simply won't allow a connection (terrible for international customers)
- My unit is defective
- There is some insane order that needs to be followed to the T to get this unit to connect if you're unlucky (first pair the bluetooth device, then ??? it's anyone's guess).

Turtle77,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2023","2020 was a bad year for smoke here in the Bay Area of California from nearby fires, so we purchased one of these in 2021.
It is early in 2023 and we have used it since we got it. We have purchased a refill pleated finter and laundered the fabric prefilter twice--we have the third prefilter on the unit now, meaning one that has gone through the laundry once.
I have always preferred the filter being reuseable--one that can be cleaned and reused--but this has worked out well even as the filters are not inexpensive. The filtration is good, the prefilter works pretty well in slowing the accumulation of stuff from depositing on the main filter and forcing replacement.
We have it on most nights and in the winter it circulates and de-stratifies the air in our dining room almost as well as a ceiling fan would and since I prefer not to have something rotating above my head, this is adequate; it can put a narrow shaft of moving air right up to the ceiling without causing a draft if you position it near a corner of the room near a window.
It does not make too much noise in the medium setting and the high setting can really eliminate odors, dust, and temperature stratification fast.

Book Reviewer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2023","I have owned this 411 for over a year now. We keep this one in our bedroom and have noticed a significant difference in waking up with the sniffles in the morning from dust (I guess). We have an older dog that smells bad sometimes. I noticed a strong dog smell in my child's room and moved the filter in there. Within an hour or so, the smell was gone! I really love this little air filter and would like to purchase one for each bedroom eventually.
My only complaint is that there seems to be a little glitch with the filter change alerts. Neither time the filter has needed replacing has it turned orange. The light goes straight to red. I had read that it was supposed to turn orange to alert you to order a new filter, and then it turns red when it is time to replace. Not a big deal, but I do like things to work the way they say they will.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Science Tech,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2018","The Blue Pure 411 is compact, light and attractive. It comes with two colored (blue and black) washable bag-like pre-filters that fit around the outside of the main air filter. The main filter is a single combined particulate and carbon filter. Air is drawn in from all directions and expelled out the top. There's only one button, on the top of the purifier, surrounded by concentric lights that indicate the fan speed. Currently, there is no HEPA rating for this purifier although the combined filters seem more than capable of filtering out fine particulates.
There's three fan speeds. On the lowest speed it's practically silent. Medium speed has a whooshing white-noise sound, but it's low enough that you may be able to sleep with the purifier on. High speed is a small hurricane for when you want to clear the air fast; it's fairly loud and hard to ignore. Changing the filter is easy. When new, there is a slight new-thing smell with a hint of charcoal, which is probably coming from the filter. This may explain one of the reviews that claimed there was a burning smell. The smell has diminished after a couple days of use. But I wonder if the charcoal smell is normal for new filters? This seems odd.
The purifier remembers its last setting, so if the power goes out or you move it to another room it will start up at the same speed as it was last running.After using it for a few days, I'm happy to say it seems to clear the air quite nicely and my allergies have diminished.
There's two design flaws, however. First, the fan speed lights are bright enough to interfere with sleep. I read somewhere that they are supposed to 'dim' a few seconds after selecting a speed, but this isn't the case. I've started placing objects on top of the purifier to block the light. The second flaw is more serious. The single fan-speed button on top of the unit is attractive but not really a button. There's not detents or positive click feeling when you select a speed; it's more a matter of deforming the hard plastic cover to select a speed. I'm a strong guy and the amount of pressure it takes to change the fan speed is a bit alarming. Another reviewer commented that theirs did not work when new -- I suspect they simply weren't pressing the ""button"" hard enough. I have found that even pressure with the palm of my hand works better than pressing with a finger. A simple rotary knob would be much more usable (BLUEAIR, are you listening?). Now that I know how it works I don't have a problem, but you definitely don't want to buy this for an elderly person who can't muster that much effort.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Unlike the larger models, the filter is not inserted into a plastic housing which the top fan piece connects to. Instead the filter actually connects directly to the fan unit.
Unlike the larger models, the pre-filter is actually stretched over the filter itself. You can feel the ribs of the filter under the fabric. This makes the whole thing feel less stable and definitely less sturdy. A swift kick from one of my kids or something hard bumping into it could easily dent the filter.
Other notes:
Kids think the touch panel is super cool to mess with, particularly my 1 year old. That means this thing rarely stays on the speed you set it at.
Because the default state for this is always off, you can‚Äôt connect it to any kind of smart plug. If you run it in a vacation house and that house loses power, it won‚Äôt come back on when power is restored.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Wasn‚Äôt sure it was actually doing anything UNTIL I changed the outer cover and saw the filter üòÆ. Yeah it‚Äôs working. I bought extra covers for color change. It comes with blue automatically, I ordered grey and got grey and the blue it comes with. Not realizing that it came with 2, I ordered a pink one also. When I changed it and hand washed the cover I was surprised how dirty it was although it didn‚Äôt look it. My only complaint is the top. It‚Äôs a little tricky to lock it back in place when you open it. If you don‚Äôt get it right it will fall right off the bottom part of unit. It‚Äôs small but it‚Äôs in a bedroom. If using it in any bigger space I would get a bigger one or two. It‚Äôs easy to move it though. At night I bring it in the living room easy enough.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2019","This little purifier has really helped deodorize and clean the air in my baby nursery. I can smell and feel the difference. It is very lightweight and a lot cheaper feeling than I expected for the price, that being said it seems to do a very good job. Think a big cylindrical HEPA filter with just a material sock cover it. It doesn't have plastic or anything except for at the top its kinda like a big filter just sitting there no screens nor body really it looks like it has a body in the pics but that's just the blue sock like fabric covering. Also If you have animals or an active baby they can easily knock this over if you keep it on the floor. It also has a lights on the top to show whether it is on high medium or low and the lights are quite bright if you are wanting a completely dark room I would not recommend this. Additionally, if it is on the medium or high setting it quite loud. I personally like it loud because I use a sound machine and it adds another layer to the baby room noise at night which is a good thing for me, however, I could see it annoying some people. I am happy with the product though because I wanted it solely to help purify my child's air and it seems to have a big difference. It cleans the air for sure.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I scoured the web, though, and there are ZERO available. And the manufacturer is out of stock. Called the company in a panic - were they being discontinued?

Stephen Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2019","It does its job well, showing a significant impact on PM2.5 as measured by my IQAir. Before using this unit, the house HVAC would kick up lots of particles every time it turned on, and any vaping would impact air quality for many hours as it slowly dissipates. On low, PM2.5 in my bedroom stays below 10 ug/m^3, usually hovering around 5 or simply undetectable. Any vaping is quickly filtered out back to undetectable levels within an hour on low, and on high, my IQAir never sees it at all.
For sound, the low is pretty much undetectable, the medium is a non-obnoxious audible level, and high is a bit much for 24/7 use. I wish it was a tad bit quieter on medium and high, but for light use, the low setting seems to be perfectly adequate.
My main gripe is that it doesn't include an air quality sensor to automatically change between fan speed settings - I'm definitely jealous of my friend's coway unit for that. So I would knock off a star for that combined with the higher speed settings being a tad bit loud, but overall an excellent and sleek unit for any room.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I'm going to move it into a better spot instead of it being in a corner of the room.
I have both this and a Holmes filter, when set on high, the Holmes filter is much louder. This machines job is to suck in air and push out clean air.

I gave this a 4-star rating since it does not eliminate the stink but it does a pretty good job. I use one of my smaller bedrooms as a home office so the filter doesn't have to work very hard (approximately 200 sq. ft.). I did also purchase another cover to put on while the other one was drying from being hand-washed. I have noticed that I don't have to dust my home office after installing this filter.

CJ,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2019","I bought this model after having had a 211+ (the larger version of this) in my bedroom for a year or so. The slight odor it emits for the first couple weeks is similar to that of the 211+. I believe it comes form the carbon filter, and to me it smells ""clean"". On low, you can barely hear it. On medium or high, the fan noise is a bit too high-pitched. This may not bother most people, but half the reason I use an air purifier is for the white noise at night. The 211+ emits a nice deep ""whooshing"" fan noise. The 411 sounds like what it is; a small fan. I couldn't sleep with this one on medium or high. It's been moved to the living room and will be kept on low. It gives my home that ""clean"" smell I was after, so I'm still satisfied.

Sylvester,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2018","This is a great little machine which takes up very little space and is quiet enough for sleep on medium and low speeds.

Keeping the bedroom door closed (so cats cannot enter the room) and running the Blueair air purifier for about 12 hours let my boyfriend sleep well and wake up without symptoms of asthma. I was thrilled and hopeful. However, as the days have lengthened, and my cats are shedding more, the Blueair is (understandably) less able to combat the cat dander which is inevitably all over the house, though he is still far better off with the Blueair than without it.

Dan Plater,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2024",This air purifier is extremely quiet as we have it in our bedroom. The blue tooth app works well with the unit and lets the user know the particulate count (started with a 2.5 and has reduced it to 1.0) currently being processed with the machine. The Bluetooth app also provides filter status and per cent of remaining filter time. We love this.,5.0 out of 5 stars

I‚Äôve only had this air purifier for two days now, and so far, so good. For the most part, it‚Äôs been on standby or level 1‚Äî displaying ‚Äúgood air quality‚Äù on the app.
As I type this review, there is a neighbor cooking a putrid meal‚Ä¶ and the odor is seeping through the vents. I turned the air purifier to its max, and within 2 minutes, the smell has dissipated.
In comparison to my Dyson air purifier when on its max setting, this one is a bit quieter (video included with television on in the background for reference), though still a bit noisy.
Aesthetically, I like how it looks in my living room. The led lights are dimmable, which is nice (not dimmed in my photos).
As I stated, so far, so good. I‚Äôll update this review at a later date if anything changes.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Cassidy,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023","I bought this air purifier due to the Canada wildfires causing air quality issues in my area for the duration of summer- and because I live in an old apartment- for someone with respiratory problems this was a must. it definitely does its job quickly and effectively!
it senses changes in air quality fast- if I open a window nearby while the air is bad, the light flips to red and the fan starts running on high. it manages to clear the entirety of my 650 sqft apartment in minutes. I've even noticed it starts running a little harder after I use dry shampoo. it has five fan settings- auto (which changes fan speed depending on the air quality), night mode (does the same but quietly and therefore more slowly), and 3 set fan speeds. I included a video which hopefully shows noise level and fan power well. (please excuse my cat, she liked my tissue paper method)
setup was ridiculously easy. just plug it in, connect to the app, and it starts going at it. it is a bit large, but the design is modern and pleasing enough that it's not an eyesore. it's also not heavy at all, definitely less than 10lbs.
the app is also very convenient- you can control fan speed, schedule (if you want one), a child lock, and even the brightness of the LEDs. while away from home I can check in and see if there have been any spikes in poor quality air. blue air also has a wonderful feature that allows you to see the remaining lifetime of your filter. I believe the model I bought has an advertised lifetime of 6-9months, and after a full month of use on auto mode, I'm still at 93%.
the only negative I've noticed so far is not even really due to the purifier itself- the outside is fabric, which is turning out to be a very tempting scratching post for my cats. I believe the fabric can be replaced however so it's not really a big deal.
overall I really love this purifier, it's definitely made a difference in my breathing this summer!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Stephen Paul,"Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2024",This was a more expensive filter than others on the market but it's definitely worth every penny. It is controllable through its own app. It tells you the inside PM concentration. It will turn on automatically if it detects allergens or pollutants in the air. We had to degrease the oven which made a bit of a smell and some smoke and it automatically turned on and we saw the PM concentration drop as it filtered the air. Then it cycled down and eventually turned off. Highly recommended. Only bad thing I can say is that is a little loud when running it full capacity but nothing intolerable.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Olin Enzor,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2023","Bought this originally because we were living in a camper. The camper itself is not sealed the greatest (non-are) and we wanted to have something to help filter the air. In a space if about 360 sqft, this puppy cleans the air fast! I mean, fast! A few times when we were cooking the display would show the ppm rising as air particles became polluted. Placing the unit on high would filter any smoke or smell out in about 5 minutes. The fabric pre-filter on the outside is nice because it‚Äôs mesh and actually traps dust and dog hair before it even makes it to the main filter. I think that‚Äôs why the main filter lasts as long as it does. I‚Äôve had for about 6 months or so and still have the original filter. Now having a child who is I‚Äôll and has frequent hospitalizations, I trust this unit to filter out my homes upstairs air. Upstairs is about 1000 sqft and having sanitized, cleaned and wiped down every surface I have yet to sneeze and we have been back in our house for over 3 weeks. This is a great product. When it comes to the health and we‚Äôll being if the family, I will be purchasing a few more like this. Highly highly recommend!! Could not be happier!",5.0 out of 5 stars
RBG,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2024","The biggest drawback to heating with a wood stove is the inevitable smokiness. It's intermittent and usually associated with refilling the stove, but once it occurs, it really can leave smoke in the house for a prolonged period. Enter the BLUEAIR air purifier. It actually can tell when there's smoke or other particulate debris and turn itself on to the level necessary to clear the air. Most of the time it's on zero and doing nothing. Then it springs to life when needed. Even at it's highest the noise level is not unbearable. Most of the time it's running very quietly. My wife was ready to make me stop using the woodstove, and many evenings she would have to close the bedroom door at night, and then the room gets very cold. Now we don't have a problem. I am very happy. Also, the cover and the filter are both washable.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Paul,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024","I can literally taste the cleaner air. This thing is esthetically beautiful, and purifies the air FAST. I leave it on 24/7.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024","This is a game-changer! The sleek, modern design fits seamlessly into my home decor, and the built-in air quality monitor sets it apart from other purifiers.
The real-time air quality display provides valuable insights into the pollutants present in the air, allowing me to monitor and adjust the purifier's settings accordingly. The HEPA filtration system effectively captures dust, allergens, and most importantly dog hair, resulting in a noticeable improvement in air quality.
What impressed me the most is the purifier's adaptive mode, which automatically adjusts its fan speed based on the air quality data. This ensures that the air remains clean and fresh at all times, without the need for constant manual adjustments.
Its super quiet allows me to enjoy purified air without any disruptive noise, and the programmable timer adds a layer of convenience to its usage. The filter replacement indicator is a helpful feature that ensures the purifier continues to perform optimally.
After using this purifier for several months, I can confidently say that it has made a noticeable difference in the air quality within my home. I no longer have to worry about indoor air pollutants, thanks to this advanced air purifier.
Blue air purifier has exceeded my expectations with its air quality monitoring capabilities and efficient purification technology. If you're looking for a purifier that goes above and beyond, I highly recommend giving this one a try!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2023","I was skeptical at first that this air purifier would do anything noticable. However, I did A lot of research on air purifiers and found that this BLUE AIR brand was highly rated by most who purchased it as well as product testers who tried out several different brands to compare them. What this Air purifier does well is - 1. It does actually keep dust particles off of your shelves and out of the home in general. I noticed a need to dust much less often.
2. It keeps smells out of the home. I have two dogs and while I keep them very clean, I am always paranoid that my house will smell like dogs when people come through my doors. (I believe this air purifier works well for pet dander)
3. This item is great for taking cooking smells out of the home. If i cook bacon or fish or a food dish that tends to have a lingering smell, this air purifier just takes the smell right out! It has really impressed me and I am SO happy with this purchase.
Overall this BLUE AIR purifier was quiet, worked great and is actually designed pretty nice and has a pleasant look to it. It is one of the higher priced air purifiers out there but still less money than a Dyson. (Was actually going to purchase the Dyson air purifier because I thought it must be better but almost all of the reviews that compared BLUE AIR to Dyson showed BLUEAIR worked better)
If you are still not sure, read the other reviews posted, there are lots of reviews posted that agree this is a superior product compared to various other air purifiers.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bade,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2024","We wanted an air purifier for our kitchen area where we suspect there may be remnants of mold underneath in the crawl space but also for kitchen smells. Wow it really works great, came on when I was cooking and the room was fresh smelling quickly. When it is not on high alert it is so quiet you literally won't know it is there. Unfortunately some of the smells drifted to another room where we have a different brand of purifier and I can still smell a little bit of my meal up in that room. Forgot to order the one with the extra filter and regretting that because I suspect we will want to change it on schedule.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Juliann Bethke,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2024","I have it in our living room, so the small amount of noise it makes is not noticeable.

Sandra Oney,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2024","I‚Äôm returning the 211i. I like the design and the app, but mine was way louder than specified, even on night mode. I could hear it from the living room all the way down the hall to my bed and to the nursery. It also wasn‚Äôt white noise, but a resonate frequency somewhere between a D# and A# depending on the speed of the fan. I have two other Blue Air models that are quiet and that I like just fine, but this was just louder than advertised.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Creatics,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2024","Received this as a gift from friends and was something we likely never would have purchased. An air purifier? Our air was fine. But open the door during smoky days (from wildfires), or that burger burning in the pan, and this unit kicks into gear. Particulate matter we typically inhale all the time is suddenly brought to your attention. And the opposite, when the light just stays blue and the monitor shows ""zero,"" also brings one a sense of calm. One big tip: since you can't access the sensors, we simply give them a quick blast of air (the two horizontal lines in the back of the unit, above the plug-in cord); ours was going nuts for awhile and we thought that something was wrong with our air conditioning. Turns out, the sensors had picked up a few specks of dust and was going on and off throughout the say. A quick blow in the back did the trick...that and changing the filter! Good luck...nice, super-quiet machine...",5.0 out of 5 stars
