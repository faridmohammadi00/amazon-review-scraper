Kassidy,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2024","I was definitely a bit hesitant at first, but when my Fitbit died I figured it was time to give this a try. Price was way more affordable than buying from the store. Product came quickly and looked BRAND NEW. Besides a generic box, watch came with accessories and nicely packaged. I‚Äôm so happy I purchased this product. Don‚Äôt let the ‚Äòrefurbished‚Äô title scare you, has all the same features/look as a new watch with half of the price. I do wish battery life was extended, my Fitbit lasted 2x as long as my apple watch. However, I love the extended features including reading/sending texts, being able to accurately track specific workouts, track sleep, and take calls. If you‚Äôre in the market for a watch, this is the one!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jake,"Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2023","This isn't a long term review, but if anything changes I'll update it. As of now the watch is amazing. I see after one person mentioned presentation, that improved greatly with mine lol. Packaging aside, everything is working great, battery life is 100%. The entire watch looks and feels brand new from the apple store. The first day had me seriously concerned about the battery lasting though, but apparently the watch was just doing a lot of downloading and setting up in the background which was decreasing the battery by at least 20% per hour which I thought seemed nuts. After changing some settings and getting things set up efficiently plus the set up process finalizing, everything is perfect. Under normal circumstances it's been on for over an hour now with a few text alerts coming through etc. and battery is still 100%. At this rate it should last a solid amount of time. The apps on this are really cool. The health stuff like heart monitoring and blood oxygen levels are awesome to have. The workout apps are set up pretty nice as well. It would be nice if there were a better way to do updates and whatnot though than doing it via your iphones bluetooth. Like youtube reviews etc. mention it's sooooo slow. I thought something was wrong with the watch at first. Set up and downloading watchOS 10 take a solid 3-4 hours. The install is beyond slow doing it via bluetooth. Going through this thing with a fine tooth comb and getting every single app optimized for battery efficiency etc. took a good 12 plus hours and a ton of youtube videos all mentioning different little tips and tricks. Lots of troubleshooting occurred too. The complications on the watches face screen weren't functioning right which required to reset the location and privacy data in the phone plus a couple other steps. The watch was doing a lot of weird stuff that was destroying it's battery and wasting storage at rapid speeds. That's all just apple, nothing to do with it being renewed or the seller etc. They all run the same software in them regardless. Just being real about it, the set up process of this watch wasn't pleasant and kinda made me disappointed in the purchase initially but once I got that out of the way it's working incredibly well. Also this being a cellular version, you need to contact your carrier in advance and register this with them via the IMEI number from the phone's about section. You'll just get errors when trying to set up cellular prior to that. All in all though, the watch is great, and I love the design, especially how easy it is to switch out straps of whatever style or color you want. Those are much cheaper than I expected them to be as well so I immediately grabbed a handful of different options. Definitely recommend anyone interested in an apple watch to try this. It shows up in brand new condition, these only came out less than a year ago so even original parts are still very lightly used with a long life ahead of them. Even with a few frustrations, it gets two thumbs up from me.",5.0 out of 5 stars

So for much less money I got this Series 8 Apple Watch in excellent condition. Transferring from an old Apple Watch to a new(er) one is far more cumbersome as Apple's brief, chirpy ""instructions"" imply, but eventually I got it done.

Mary Kay Black,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2024",I was so happy with the purchase of my second refurbished apple 8 watch from you. I was so happy with mine -- that I bought my daughter one for Christmas. Unfortunately after Christmas she did not get it set up to us until March. About two weeks ago she called me and said in would not stay charged -- would not update --when coming off the charger would only have something on the face for about two minutes. So I had her bring it home to me. I worked on it awhile and had the same result. So on Friday -- May 17th -- I was visiting a larger city that had an Apple Store. The employee worked on it about 45 minutes and had the same result as the two of us. He said it had a major problem. So with a long story short -- is there any way you can take this watch back an send me another one? I saved my money to buy my daughter this one. Thanks for considering. Received on December 7th. Thank you.,4.0 out of 5 stars

If yes to 3 questions with no interest in upgrading soon, purchase.
==== Review: Overall 4.5/5 =====
I hesitated to buy the watch because it was labeled ""renewed."" Ironically enough, the product did me one better by not turning on. I struggled to contact the Seller because of Amazon and not the business. The watch did not work for the first 2-3 weeks because of the charger, but it's perfect now.
Trust me when I say the mic quality is impressive. I'm not flashy, but I believe this purchase is worth it just with the mic ALONE. You'll see me eating ramen for the next month to rock this! The watch makes me feel energized and productive.
I find myself using the watch more than my phone. There's not one connection issue or call drop like there is on my actual phone. The box looked a little dinked, yet authentic. I assume the previous owner didn't keep the box in shape. No scratches, the product includes a soft band, and the customer service is prompt and understanding.
I can only choose 4 or 5, so I decided on 5 because of the merchandiser.
==== End Review: Overall 4.5/5 =====
Series 7 v 8:
The Series 8 has Bluetooth 5.3, and the Series 7 has Bluetooth 5.0.
The 8 has temperature sensors that separate your data from outside factors like weather. If you don't care about Dust protection, Crash detection, Ovulation predictions, or System trackers, go for the Series 7 for all the same features for ~10.
Pricing:
If you want to save cash, go for the Series 6 to save ~$100. It has all the same features as the Series 7. Its only differences are the 1mm screen and a slightly slower chip that won't be noticeable for another 2-3 years. You will also have the option to add a cellular data plan for $10/month to purchase before prices are closer to the initial 7 or 8 models.
Cellular Data Plan v Raw Dawg:
The data plan is if you are typically 100m away from your phone. For all my struggle babies, 100m is a little more than half a football field or ~4 times the size of a basketball court. Do people run without their phones? Cellular data is ideal for hiking, amusement/water parks, and running because you can leave your phone locked away.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Richard Crowley,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2024","I purchased a new Apple Watch 9 (41mm) that was unfortunately too small for my wrist and I didn't feel like hunting around for aftermarket bands, etc. I decided to give Amazon a try and go with a last gen device (Apple Watch 8). Considering the larger watch renewed was less expensive than the smaller series 9, I thought I'd splurge and go with the GPS + Cellular option.
That was a great decision. The watch was basically new with no blemishes or scratches, came with a USB C power cord (no brick though) in a basic box. Setting it up was a breeze and it almost automatically paired with my phone. Mobile set up took a bit as I was new to the eSIM thing but was able to put the IMEI into my carrier to get it activated. Most watch versions of Apple Apps worked flawlessly with the exception of one which was easily disabled and reinstalled from the Watch iOS app on the phone.
In checking through various settings, I also found the battery life settings and found that the watch is capable of 100% charge (one concern I had buying refurbished), so basically I got a late model watch with more features that I expected for hundreds less than buying a new one.",5.0 out of 5 stars

vardelda,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2023","Look, I know the world is full of people who fall over themselves to get whatever latest gadget Apple comes out with. But pretending these guys produce anything near 'great' tech nowadays is crazy. This is a very nice smart watch -- as long as you don't want to actually use it as a watch. About 1/2 the time I glance at my watch to see the time, I get something else -- extremely annoying. Battery life is abysmal. You'll spend almost as much time charging this thing as wearing it (gee Apple, how many people do you think would have preferred a 30% larger watch with 100% more battery life, hmmm?). And since it has to be charged so often, you'll have to make a choice between charging at night (no Sleep tracking!) or during the day (wait, didn't you want to be wearing it during the day?). And the notifications!! Good lord, you leave this thing in default settings and it will be beeping, buzzing, and flashing CONSTANTLY. Look Apple lost their way years ago and now produces tech with so many UX compromises most is really no longer worth it. But I know many of you are so deep in their ecosystem you can't even see what ""outside"" looks like so, yea, buy this watch (cause Apple basically give you no choice).

You would not be able to tell the difference between this one and one straight out of an Apple Watch box. I did not use the watch band that was included, but it looked brand new as well. The charger was new and still had the protective stickers on it.

Took two attempts, after the first receiving of an apple watch that wasn't at all what I ordered, seller took care of making that right; - well, better, anyway. The second time received the watch noticed it had the wrong size band, and wrong charging cable (not the usb-c that comes original from apple) vs. what was ordered, but the watch itself was ok. Watch also has a very small crack in the crystal. Since seller gave quite a discount to make up for the first order mistake, just keeping the watch and will go with it.

Matt,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2024","Your mileage may vary, but this device came in practically new condition (no visible wear, went to Settings > Battery and the capacity was still at 100%) and the price for a cellular Apple Watch S8 (which is very close spec and feature wise to the current S9) was insane. I was debating between this one and an Apple Watch Ultra (or 2) as my goal is to get outside and leave my phone behind without losing all contact as I work a busy schedule and can't go 100% off grid. So far so good and I think this will meet my needs just fine!

Taylor S,"Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2024","I purchased this Apple Watch refurbished with an ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù quality rating. When it arrived it has some white scratches along the aluminum casing. The screen also had some light scratches but was mostly not noticeable unless you really looked. Not a big deal I decided to look past those issues, even though I paid for an ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù quality refurbished device.
Upon turning the watch on I notice it glitched out a lot when I touched the screen. I figured it was cause I wasn‚Äôt wearing it and was at a weird angle so my touches weren‚Äôt registering right.
I let it charge as it was on 3% out of the box and it took 4 hours to charge to 50%. It came with the old generation charger (USB not USB-C) as well without a box if you‚Äôre curious.
When it finally charged I put it on and set it up. I immediately noticed the screen was not responsive and when it was it was incredibly glitchy. It would tap characters multiple times or just not respond at all. This is consistent every time I go to use the watch.
I reached out to Amazon who referred me to the seller to see if they could offer a replacement. They did not. They refused to assist me guiding me to return the device through Amazon and get my money back.
After coordinating with Amazon they agreed a return is the best solution and offered me a promo credit on my next purchase for the inconvenience and the sellers inability to resolve the problem.
I also activated this device within my phone plan prior to confirming it was fully functional, but this is not anyone‚Äôs fault but my own. I‚Äôll call that a personal loss. Just some advice to anyone purchasing an Apple Watch with intentions to activate it within their plan, test drive the watch a bit first. I‚Äôm now out $50 and have a useless line on my phone plan that I cannot use until I purchase a new Apple Watch from a different seller.",1.0 out of 5 stars
1MurrietaMom,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2024",The watch functioned well but developed air bubbles all around the watch face. Then I compared my watch to my sister's and the watch face appeared to be bulkier than hers and looked strange next to it so I believe the watch face had been refurbished unsuccessfully. I decided to return it but the only way to return it was by UPS pickup the next business day. There is no pickup window given so it can be literally any time during the next business day. There was no attempt to pick up on the next day and I saw no evidence of any attempt on my home security cameras. I called UPS the following day and they said they couldn't help me without a reference number and all I was given was Amazon's RMA. I called Amazon and was told that UPS had picked up the package the day before. I assured them I still have the box and I have no idea what they say they say they picked up. The rep said there was not a way for me to drop it off at a UPS store and instead created another next business day pickup. So now I need to stick around my home waiting for another day or risk putting an expensive watch on my porch where it could possibly be stolen. Seems like they are deliberately making it difficult to return. Disappointing return policy Amazon.,1.0 out of 5 stars

But what about the product it‚Äôs self? Look the pictures don‚Äôt lie. The watch was just thrown in ziplock bags and shipped out. The watch itself is all dirty. Whoever sent it didn‚Äôt even care enough to clean the outside of it. Where the bands go you can see how crusty it is, where the glass of the face of the watch is you can see a thin white line of something and the face of the watch was smudge with fingerprints. Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know how excited I was to receive this watch. As a matter of fact this was my Christmas gift but the first one we order was too small, then the second one we ordered just suddenly never turned back on and now this junk.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2023","I recently purchased the Series 8 watch in 45mm and, unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. From the moment I opened the package, red flags started popping up. The watch face and band were carelessly packaged in separate, cheap plastic bags, giving an immediate impression of low quality.
To add insult to injury, the watch charger included seemed to be an obvious knock-off, complete with a bread tie hastily wrapped around the cable. It was clear that corners were cut in the production of this accessory. The heart rate sensor, indicated by the green light on the watch, was inoperative right out of the box, rendering a key feature useless.
Moreover, the watch exhibited communication issues with my phone, making the device unreliable and setting were impossible to change. What's more concerning is that all of this loosely tossed into a box with no padding, leaving them susceptible to damage during shipping.
Given these issues, I promptly initiated a return for the product. Such a lack of attention to detail and quality control is unacceptable, and I cannot recommend this seller to others based on my experience. I hope they take these concerns seriously and work to improve the overall quality of their product.

I have purchased many Apple refurbished products directly from Apple in the past. In every case that product was indistinguishable from a new product. However, this Amazon refurbished Apple Watch was very poor. Despite it being the highest quality of the refurbished choices there were multiple visible areas of damage on the body of the watch itself. most concerning, the display under the crystal was not centered and was shifted slightly to the right so that the entire display was not completely visible on the right side. This also made it so that touch targets off and it did not reliably respond to touch interactions. This was an absolutely unacceptable product and immediately required a return and a refund.

This started the proprietary apps, iTunes, and iCloud. The shift to something new is painful to think about, so now on my iPhone 11, I continue to soldier on. I finally decided due to apnea and age, to get a smart device like this to track my heart rate, sleep quality and EKG.
Sleep- gives a decent breakdown and overall for a watch it gives good data.
EKG- tells me if I am in sinus rhythm which is good
Heart rate - overall pretty solid and I like that if things go sideways on my heart, it will identify and call 911 (if you have that set up)
Apps- pretty nice that a lot of your apps on your iPhone pair decent in the watch.
Phone- ohhh this is where I think the ‚ÄúDick Tracy‚Äù crystal clear commercials is deceiving. It sucks, people can‚Äôt hear me, I can‚Äôt hear them, unless I‚Äôm in a quiet room. Yes if you have AirPods I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs great but isn‚Äôt that self defeating of the speaker on the watch??
GPS- you have to pay extra
Battery life- decent, lasts about 24 hrs
Honestly I would have returned it if I didn‚Äôt accidentally toss the box and note that a 50% restocking fee would be dinged to my refund. I have a friend of mine with a Garmin Fenix 7 and GPS included along with a ton of other health things I want. I‚Äôll end up buying that and giving the Apple Watch to one of my kids.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I was disappointed in the fact that I checked the compatibility chart and ordered based on the watch working with IOS 16 only to find out that the watch received required iOS 17. This was also the case with a series 6 that I ordered from another vendor. Maybe the watch was updated prior to the renewal process. Either way I will need to return it as I cannot use it since I went with an iPad cellular gen 9 when I upgraded from my phone and Apple doesn‚Äôt permit setup from the iPad. Kind of ridiculous that a cellular watch requires a newer iPhone to initially setup.",3.0 out of 5 stars

The watch component itself is fully functional and fine (I did have a few issues pairing the watch but a reset fixed them). However, I found the advertising of the watch components to be misleading at best. When looking at the pictures they feature an authentic Apple Watch band and charger (combined value of $80 from Apple) and the description just states band and cable (does not clarify if authentic or not). This seems to lead the consumer to believe the components would be authentic, even with the refurbished product, and they are not. Customer service was very disappointing when trying to reach some type of solution. Overall, I would just buy from Apple to save yourself the time and energy. If you do not care about those components, it‚Äôs a good purchase.",3.0 out of 5 stars

However, I‚Äôm a little disappointed with Apple and its functionality. I was expecting some great things like the AirPods. It was extremely challenging to configure it and I‚Äôm a IT person. I was also expecting some great watch faces, but everything they had. There was mediocre but anyway now I say I have a Apple Watch and that‚Äôs some fake one.

Lois E Johnson,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2024","I purchased this watch when I saw that it had fall detection and that I could read it at any time. I had seen others who had to shake their Apple watches to read them so held off buying one. I live alone and am handicapped so fall detection was important to me. The watch connects to my phone and will call 911 if i don't respond after a fall. i can also tell it to call 911, if I need to and am conscious. For the price of a refurbished watch, it will pay for itself in less than a year compared to the cost of monthly charges for life alert type of devices. And I can answer calls on the watch. That makes me feel like Dick Tracy, a detective in old comic strips, who had a two-way radio on his wrist. I recommend Apple watches for senior citizens especially.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Arlene,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2023","I bought this watch for my 19-year-old daughter for the medical aspects of this watch and also the crash detection. We always worry about our teens and young adults nowadays and this brings me a little peace of mind. She also has a medical condition.
I like that it doesn‚Äôt need to be charged every 12 hours like my Series 5 model. The battery was still at 70 percent by the time I went to bed.
Compared to the Fitbit, that thing doesn‚Äôt need to be charged but every six days. It‚Äôs amazing. However, I noticed that the Versa 4 was causing me to lose calls when I would use my earbuds. I‚Äôm often times hands-free and when I go to answer with my earbud it would hang up on them instead.
I don‚Äôt have that happen on this watch. Maybe it‚Äôs something Apple did intentionally so that we only use their products? lol
I‚Äôm not a fan of the band they sent me with the watch but it works and I can always change it for her.
I did end up buying Amazon‚Äôs insurance which I recommend especially when buying refurbished or renewed as they like to call it.
So far I‚Äôm really happy with what we got.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Besides that scratch everything is great and it‚Äôs just like brand new from the store.
I recommend it‚Äôs totally worth the few hundreds you‚Äôre saving for buying this one rather than a new one.
I wanted to wait about a month of using daily before writing a review in case of any issues but nothing wrong so far and I am really satisfied with this product. You can buy without worrying about it.
The battery usually lasts 2 days and 1 night and that leaves me a quarter of the battery so i charge it. It can last 2 nights and 2 days but it will go to low battery mode.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Rebecca D. Ayers,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2023","Awesome! Love the watch, I had no issues. Installing to the new iOS for Apple Watch was mostly painless, and connecting to my iPhone (14) was easy too‚Ä¶ but the watch itself is perfect. What a great job refurbishing it! Will buy one again when I need another.
That being said, go into the new iOS and change your settings. It took me a few days of use to figure out why my battery was draining so fast. Before I blamed the watch, I needed to understand the setting. Once I finally got the factory defaults changed out, my battery will last between 2 and 3 days before a recharge, and it only takes about an hour for a full charge. So that issue is not a mechanical one.
Switching out bands is a breeze. And all the sensor stuff like the EKG and health related hardware works like a champ.
Not one defect on the screen either.

So, you got your eye on an Apple Watch Series 8, but your budget is set for a ""lower trim?"" Amazon Renewed is the answer.
This Series 8 GPS + Cellular watch is the latest offing from Apple and was sold by Russ Enterprises LLC. We saved almost $200. We can't say enough good things about the product Russ Ent. sells. It's a shame the pictures may not show the true condition of the watch which is absolutely flawlessly--it looks brand new (ignore the dust specks and the odd reflections). Russ Ent. also included new, Apple USB-C watch charger and genuine Apple s/m and m/l bands.
We've opened several Apple products to include series 6 and Series 8 watches and we completely understand the satisfaction of the ""Apple unboxing experience.""

When I tried to turn it on it had the Apple snake of death and at first it worried me, but I put it on the charger for 45 minutes and it was already halfway charged and on, which means it was COMPLETELY dead, dead.
