FST,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2024",I typically don't write reviews This fan or as Dyson markets it as an air multiplier is fantastic. Other reviewers claimed cheap plastic. I don't. Cars are made of plastic now. I don't need a product at twice the weight. Thank you Dyson!,5.0 out of 5 stars

Aj,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2024","I purchased this air purifier/fan combo thinking it would be one of the best that's being sold but sadly I was mistaken. This overpriced piece of plastic feels cheaply made; the build quality did not seem like it was going to last so I ended up returning it. You would think a $500+ item would at least have some metal in it or at least feel like it would be built to last but I have plastic storage containers that would hold up better than this thing.
As far as it working, the fan was ok, nothing special. Also, it was pretty noisy, and the fan speed wasn't the best. When the oscillating feature would be turned on, you could literally hear the plastic moving and making sounds. Overall my biggest grip is with the built quality. No way is this worth the price its at or even half the price.
The other thing that is a horrible design is the fact that the remote controller is the only way to control the unit and the controller was already acting up after just having it for a few days. buttons would be hard to press, and you would need to be pretty close to the unit in order to change anything. I even thought my controller was bad so I looked up how much a new one was and they were over $60+. I thought I should return the unit before I got stuck with this thing. Overall, just a horrible, overpriced product.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2024","I have had this machine for about a month now and aesthetically it is like all Dyson products; sleek, streamline, clean looking. I bought it because I live on a warm third floor so I wanted some thing to help the AC along. The claims of this being a cooling product don’t feel quite accurate. However as far as a purifier goes it is incredible and comes with tons of features/info to help clean up your space. Just not really a fan in my opinion.",4.0 out of 5 stars

SB,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2024","I love the idea of dyson - my dyson airwrap, those coo dyson vacuums, and everything else. The boujee vibes - I’ve always wanted a dyson fan and when I saw they made one with an air purifier I said TAKE MY MONEY!!!! I figured this was an investment as it was a fan & air purifier in one - and remote controlled too? Can’t get better. The cheaper model looked enticing but as I was about to checkout, this one was advertised as improved and quieter. I haven’t used this until the past month as it’s been very hot here in Connecticut. But once a few minutes pass by…. NOPE!!! Every time I turn my fan on it sounds like I’m in a rocketship about to take off. I noticed this a little at first but thought I was being dramatic, it seems to be getting worse (or maybe I’m getting more annoyed) I have been a levoit air purifier girl at night for years - subtle white noise, cleans the air, just no fan. Super simple, no stats, was like $50 on prime day a few years ago. I was super excited to switch to this beautiful, rich girl fan but it’s far from white noise or being quiet; I’ve tried troubleshooting, cleaning filters, turning off night mode & continuous monitoring, etc. Every day I read and google dyson threads on how to fix this. It’s 90 out and I have no AC, no fan, just this loud high pitch noise keeping me company. My closet dyson store is 2.5 hours away so I doubt there’s anything I can do — the only thing I like about it is the remote control & app that tells me all the stats. So please, let me, a 24 year old girl with a spending problem tell you - DON’T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!",2.0 out of 5 stars
T. O'Brian,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2024","I am unsure why this thing has the word ""Cool"" in the title. It does not cool our room. However, as far as cleaning the air, it's AMAZING. Our bedroom used to consume SO much dust, and I couldn't figure out why. Our black nightstand would be white within a week from dust. Since we got the Dyson, it's been a month, and hardly any dust has accumulated. Even our breathing and allergies are a lot better.
As for cooling, not so much. Our bedroom is upstairs, so the heat rises. Naturally it's hotter up there. We have a thermostat on our clock, and I wake up super hot every night. Since we got the Dyson, it's not cooling the room at all. It's just a fan blowing dormant air unfortunately. But still worth the buy for the cleaner air. I DO recommend.",4.0 out of 5 stars

KW,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023","It's hard to justify $500+ for an air purifier / circulator. If you're considering this fan, you just know. You get what you pay for with most things. Apple, Sub Zero, and Dyson are elite in this category. There's a ton of engineering that Dyson puts in to their designs; the fit, finish, and implementation work to great effect.
The TP07 is a solid built. It's easy to replace filters. It circulates air. It filters down to .3 micron.
Some have complained about the noise level with this fan. One reviewer claimed it was as loud as a box fan. That is absolutely untrue. I currently have it on 5 of 10, 45 degree oscillation, regular daytime mode and it is barely audible with a gentle breeze. Upping to 7 or 10 increases the noise level but nowhere near approaching box fan levels. One reviewer went as far as to say it sounds like one of their vacuums. I also strongly disagree here. At 10 you can hear it, sure, but it's not going to distract from whatever you are doing.
The software is fantastic. If all smart devices had an interface and stability as good as this (ahem, Samsung, myQ) the world would be a less frustrating place. Aside from the interface and ease of use itself, the features are remarkable. From the app you can schedule several events daily, monitor air quality status, change the fan level, oscillation amount, night mode, or put it in Auto. The pairing mode between your phone was utterly painless. That's not common either.
The remote control is small and minimalist with fan level, auto, oscillation, and night mode settings. It works like you'd expect it to.
There's not much not to like. If I had to say something, I'd probably suggest a more readable remote control. Having a backlight on the buttons would allow better visibility in dim lighting...or even just more contrasty labeling. Other than that, I don't know how I'd make it better aside from making it less expensive, but good products require good engineering and that is expensive.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I own many Dyson products..about 15 vacuums over the years for myself and other family members, 3 airwraps in the family and now this fan/purifier. Dyson makes amazing products, although they are pricey! But they are the best!
This is no exception!!! Costco had another Dyson purifier/fan on sale and I was tempted to buy that one. But Amazon had this one which has the remote and wifi compatibility, plus I could get it next day. Amazons return policy is the best out there, and I figured if it was not worth the $$ paid, I would send it back.
This is NOT going back!!! I LOVE it!!
I have several Germ Guardian air purifiers around the house, as we suffer from allergies. They work ok.
I also have several tower fans which seem to work.
I am experiencing night sweats and hot flashes (yep) , which is the main reason I researched this product, and I can say it works great for both my allergies and heat.
My son was visiting who has AWFUL allergies and he was sneezing and taking Allegra while here. I got this fan and plugged it in while he was watching sports with my husband and he felt immediate relief. I then carried it upstairs at night for my bedroom and it also worked great for the night sweats and allergens.
Although I love the app feature with this particular model, the identical model without the remote/wifi is on sale for $150 less on another site, so I just ordered two more!! They are expensive but worth it.

This particular one I set up in a basement gym to clear the air and within hours the air quality was so clean and fresh. I pretty much keep them on 24/7.

LMP,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2023","I was in love with this thing. It has an incredible ability to detect pollutants quickly. For example, if I pull out a single alcohol wipe, it turns on high within seconds of detecting VOCs. The design is sleek and beautiful. It's easy to assemble. Love the remote control.
That said, after 4 months of use (3 active, since I was away and it was fully powered off for a month) the thing started making high-pitched whistling noises. I followed the directions on the website for troubleshooting. Unplugged. Cleaned the outside. Removed the filters. Put the filters back. Stopped the rotating function. After these actions, the problem resolves for approximately an hour, and then it returns to whistling. (It's a high-pitched whistling that makes me want to throw it out the window and put myself out of my misery.) I tried calling customer support but the wait time was over an hour, and the automated answering thing just keeps repeating the same promotional message over and over - there isn't an option for hold music or silence. (I figure their strategy is to drive people insane - I only lasted 15 minutes before hanging up.) I will try again another day, but it's still an unexpected time suck and hassle to have to deal with it.
Bottom line - this thing was my favorite purchase of the year for a while, but it functioned well for a FRACTION of the time that I expected for the price. Not worth the money.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Richard Woolf,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2023","I like the idea of having the air filtered in my room. My wife has very bad allergies, so we are thinking this should help a lot. But w are also the type of people who always have a fan on us. But this fan is only good for short ranges. It has 10 speeds but anything over 6 sounds like a jet. But it requires it to be on 10 just to move the air more than 5 feet. And even then it’s maybe only reaching 6 - 7 feet. So I highly recommend this Dyson if you want to filter the air and have a light breeze. But if you need a real fan, you’d probably better get something else. You can definitely get a better, cheaper fan elsewhere.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Happy Girl,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2023","Very satisfied with this product. I don’t have to run my air conditioning units as much because the fan on the TP07 keeps me cool even though it is just a fan. The app is very useful. I have been using the fan daily (purchased 4 weeks ago) and the air quality in my home has improved. I use the fan at night on 10 and the noise level does not stop me from falling asleep. My home smells fresh & clean. The filter was easy to install. On the app, you can change the airflow direction, precisely point the fan in any direction. The remote has a magnet, so does the fan so you can store the remote on top of the blade. The unit is light and easy to move from one room to another. No regrets buying this product.

AlexanderJacobs,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2023","At first, I was a little concerned about spending $649 not including tax to get this however, being someone who suffers from asthma, and also having 44 animals in the room, air circulation, airflow as well as proper filtration is absolutely essential. I also live in California which deals with fires from time to time so it’s very important to have a high quality filter. One thing I want to state do not buy the cheap third-party filters for the system. They will not filter as you want only buy genuine OEM Dyson filters which you can purchase from their website. You cannot get official Dyson filters on Amazon, however this product exceeds absolutely everything I was looking for it even lets you know what type of substances it is filtering with its active air purification system.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2024","I enjoy the fan, but not even after 10 days of purchase. My remote has stopped working and some thing I did not know about this series is you cannot control this Dyson without a remote. The app has no use for the TP 10 there are no other buttons except for the power button. To make matters worse, It is near impossible to find a replacement remote Unless you want to spend $60 and buy it off of some guy on eBay. Dyson themselves are out of stock and I genuinely do not want to waste more money buying a remote that says it works for TP09 and won’t be a compatible with mine because mines a TP10. So now I have to wait 20 days until my warranty through Amazon is assessable to request a new remote so now I have a fan/air purifier that stuck at two fan speed for probably over 30 days. So I’m at the point where I either have to return the whole thing to just get a new remote or have $300 just sitting in my room until my warranty is available. So if you’re thinking about getting this Tp10 You better hope for a good remote or just don’t purchase this fan and maybe possibly save for the ones that have app control.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2024","This moves some air around. It’s mostly a purifier. The cooling even at max doesn’t do much. Not good in a small room and not good in a big room. For the price it’s not helpful. A classic tower fan does a lot more and is cheaper. It just doesn’t look as cool but they actually cool so 🤷🏻‍♂️
An asthmatic blowing through a straw would’ve done more than this. Sitting next to an open fire might be better at cooling than this fan. The “cooling” aspect of this just is not cooling. I’m using this in a small bedroom that gets hot. The fan was placed near an open screen door to move some nice cool air into the bedroom. It did not do that part of its job successfully. Maybe in the loosest terms because it moved some air around. It did however catch pollen so it does that well. Not very loud and it has a wide oscillation. So I guess those are pluses. Be cautious due to its big price if you want a fan. Just buy a fan and an air purifier separately and they are probably better and cheaper.",1.0 out of 5 stars

First, lets talk about how awful UPS is. They can't seem to deliver a package in good condition and that boggles the mind. I've attached a photo for reference.
Now I have to spend time contacting Amazon, they have to set up a pickup because I'm not driving across town to return this, I have to wait for a replacement- all a waste of my time. All because UPS can't deliver a box properly. If this were the first time, not a big deal, but this seems to happen with pretty much all of the deliveries from UPS.
Amazon- stop using UPS!!!
So, now for the fan. This order is actually for a second fan. I already have the same model and it is so good that I ordered a second fan. The first one (same model) I have had since May of 2023 and it has run pretty much constantly since I got it. It is fantastic. The fan is super quiet and the HEPA filter does a great job.

Charles D.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2024","This oscillating air purifier looks elegant and feels well-made. Its remote control has an auto mode that will adjust the settings based on the air quality. It has a timer and ten-speed levels. With the night mode function activated, this purifier will run with its quietest settings. It has an LCD display that reports air pollution in real time. It has a two-year warranty for parts and labor, excluding labor.
The following organizations certify it:
• FCC (Federal Communications Commission), Part 15, which certifies that the radio frequency of this product does not cause harmful interference to licensed radio communication services.
• ETL (Electrical Testing Laboratories), which certifies that this product complies with necessary safety standards required by North American safety regulation. ELT is the certification division of Intertek Testing Laboratories.
The ETL certification assures us of the safety of this air purifier. Most air purifiers specify their coverage area and CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate). Dyson does not believe in the accuracy of CADR, thus choosing not to test for it. Instead, Dyson provides the performance data of its air purifiers based on how many pollutants they can capture. Before retiring, I worked in a data-oriented environment, and test data are what we used to determine how well a machine or a system performed. Therefore, only time can tell how well this air purifier works.
This is a very nice air purifier, so I am letting my daughters use it. Its display of a colorful graph showing the actual air quality is really neat. Besides, Dyson is a respectable company; therefore, I am giving this air purifier a 4-star rating, but I will revise my review if its performance does not meet our expectations.",4.0 out of 5 stars

JF,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2024","** Tip - after assembling the filter cover, it must be oriented on the base so that the display screen is opposite the power plug port for the oscillation feature to function **
Let me start by saying the primary reason for getting the Dyson Purifier Cool TP4B should be for the air purification capabilities. While the unit is great at circulating air, even in a large open space with the 350-degree oscillation and dual 20” area for air distribution on the U-shaped tower, in addition to the 10 levels of fan speeds, there are certainly better cooling options out there and fans that put out more direct airflow for cooling purposes.
Where this unit really shines is in the air purification, with the HEPA filter removing 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns in size. Particularly impressive is the auto function, which has a very sensitive sensor and automatically reacts to changing air quality conditions. For example, during testing, I placed the unit in auto mode with excellent air quality, and the unit's oscillation was stopped with the fan at level 1. I lit a candle in a room 30 feet away, and just the breeze walking from room to room brought in some contaminants. As I walked into the room, the purifier sensed it and sprung into action, began oscillating, and increased the fan speed slightly. As the candle continued to burn in the other room, the level of pollutants slowly increased, as did the air purifier, ramping up the fan and purification until the levels were diminished before slowing down. Finally, as the levels returned to healthy again, the unit stopped oscillating and the fan level returned to 1. I found this automatic sensing and reacting to environmental conditions impressive.
There are a few things I think could be better. I am disappointed that they did not improve the control features of the unit. You are still left with only the remote to control the unit; the only button on the unit is power on/off. This boggles me, because there is plenty of room on the unit to incorporate other buttons while keeping the sleek look. At a minimum, if they were going to continue to use this design, they should have included two remotes for the price tag, so if you lose the remote or it breaks, you wouldn't be out more money getting a replacement.
Additionally, almost the entire unit is plastic, aside from the magnetic strip on top for remote storage and perhaps some internal pieces. Even the silver filter housing that looks like it would be metal in pictures is plastic. While I somewhat understand this for design and weight considerations, for the price tag, I expected something that felt more durable and solid. I'm sure there are lighter metal materials that could have been used to achieve this.
Overall, the Dyson Purifier Cool TP4B is an impressive air purifier with excellent automatic sensing and purification capabilities. However, its cooling function is secondary, and there are areas where the build quality and control features could be improved. If air purification is your primary need, this unit is a strong contender.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Alex,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2024",Am I the only one who has always wanted a Dyson fan but could never afford it? Maybe? Just me? Anyways - I think this is a great entry level Dyson purifier that will let you decide whether or not you want to spring for the higher end models. The assembly was very straightforward and simple and the machine itself is very elegant. I was initially not happy with the noise that it made but then I started to think about how the air has to pass through the filter to actually be able to blow out and I kind of got over it. I think it is a very great value for the money especially if you are someone that has allergies or just has a sensitive nose or lungs. I wish they had an app integration on this version but in auto mode it's able to detect the air quality pretty quickly and kick on when it needs to. As soon as my roommate is cooking in the morning it turns on. One thing I'm not too happy about is the remote control. This is going to be the physical thing that you will be using 99% of the time so having it feel cheap and plasticy is not a great feeling. I have seen other higher-end Dyson models in stores and their remotes are metallic and feel great in your hand. I wish Dyson had made the remote metallic at least.,4.0 out of 5 stars
eric chow,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024","Disclaimer: I did not buy this product from the Amazon website. I brought the item from the Dyson website and conduct the process from there.
In my opinion, this is a nice fan with added technology to it. On the machine, there is a small display which provides readings of the speed of the fan, the pollutant levels in the current room, and if the filters need to be changed. To see each of the display, you are able to cycle through it using the remote provided from the company. All of the interactions are done from the remote (night mode included). The only interaction you are able to do with the fan itself is the power button.
The fan conducts air quality control by absorbing the pollutants with its filters. The filters are located on the bottom of the machine and it easy to remove and install. The user can look into the air quality level by cycling through the display on the fan.
The fan can rotate between 45 degrees to 350 degrees (45, 90, 180, 350), or it can be stationary. There is a speed you can set on the fan from 1-10, 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest. Around at the speed of 5 or 6 you will start to hear sounds and as you go higher the fan will produce more noise. As for the machine making sounds during rotation, I have not yet experienced it compared to some of the reviews I have read.
Recommendation:
The fan is unique in its own way with its displays, air quality control, and keeping the person cool. However, I do not believe this device can keep the entire room at a lower temperature despite its 350 degree rotation. Around 75 F - 85 F (Fahrenheit), I have set the fan speed to 8 or higher and stationary to keep me cool. If the fan is rotating around 75 F - 85 F for multiple people or being used to reduce the environments temperature, it will be ineffective at its job. The consumer might as well buy an A/C using $429.99.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I love the idea of dyson - my dyson airwrap, those coo dyson vacuums, and everything else. The boujee vibes - I’ve always wanted a dyson fan and when I saw they made one with an air purifier I said TAKE MY MONEY!!!! I figured this was an investment as it was a fan & air purifier in one - and remote controlled too? Can’t get better. The cheaper model looked enticing but as I was about to checkout, this one was advertised as improved and quieter. I haven’t used this until the past month as it’s been very hot here in Connecticut. But once a few minutes pass by…. NOPE!!! Every time I turn my fan on it sounds like I’m in a rocketship about to take off. I noticed this a little at first but thought I was being dramatic, it seems to be getting worse (or maybe I’m getting more annoyed) I have been a levoit air purifier girl at night for years - subtle white noise, cleans the air, just no fan. Super simple, no stats, was like $50 on prime day a few years ago. I was super excited to switch to this beautiful, rich girl fan but it’s far from white noise or being quiet; I’ve tried troubleshooting, cleaning filters, turning off night mode & continuous monitoring, etc. Every day I read and google dyson threads on how to fix this. It’s 90 out and I have no AC, no fan, just this loud high pitch noise keeping me company. My closet dyson store is 2.5 hours away so I doubt there’s anything I can do — the only thing I like about it is the remote control & app that tells me all the stats. So please, let me, a 24 year old girl with a spending problem tell you - DON’T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!",2.0 out of 5 stars

tk,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","This TP10 is a profound disappointment. I own a Dyson DP04, one of the older round units rather than the oblong tower. I love the DP04 I bought 3+ years ago. I use it as a fan/purifier in my living room. It's awesome! So I bought a TP10 to use as a fan/purifier in my bedroom. It's a joke compared to the DP04 (which for some ridiculous reason, they don't make anymore). You want it to act as a fan? Forget it. On 10/10, I could not detect any air at 10 feet. My round DP04? Great fan. At 10 ft, I usually keep it on 5/10 and it blows plenty hard. Plus the DP04 has a superior filter, while the TP10 is the simplest base filter. Also, the phone app is fully featured and has a remote function that is awesome on my DP04. The TP10? No wifi. I seriously don't understand why this plastic-feeling, overpriced unit is getting so many good reviews. I assume they are from people who aren't fortunate enough to have enjoyed Dyson's prior models before they obviously started cutting corners. And since they no longer make the far superior DP04, it's safe to say I will never buy another Dyson air purifier. They have obviously discarded the notion of using them as fans. So they're basically just air purifiers now. And you can spend half as much, or even less, and get a good air purifier. What a disappointment. I'd buy another DP04 in a heartbeat.

I had a TP01 they pushed you need to replace the filter to fix Error code I knew it was not the problem code was for short in motor and temp sensor so I told them you buy the filter and I will put it in and test because I knew it's not the problem so why spend 70.00. They sent me a filter free what do you know still error codes and fan shuts off on it own. After weeks of games they sent a new one which is a TP07 to make up the difference for there poor customer service and tech service skills. Just so you know manual even said it was a short but they did not care because there job was to push filters. Now TP07 works but app can not find my location only a town over and data report does not work so now they are trying to see for three days now why this is happening. TP07 is very very over priced your paying for 350degree turn,app and monitor over the TP01 other then that it's a TP01. All Dyson air products should be priced at 100.00 to 200.00 max that's what they compare to on the market or sometimes below in that market base on model.For a true good fan I recommend Dreo smart pedestal fan it's 118.00 on sale and 139.00 list price. Higher CFM then Dyson,more adjustability and better app and cheaper. Air purifier recommend Vornado CYLO50 it's 69.99 on sale to 99.99 list. It's small and power full and filters are only 19.99 to replace. Power efficient does not ring up a crazy electric bill. If you want to add a air monitor Amazon basic monitor it's 39.99 on sale to 69.99 and it's better then the Dyson. For all the products I just listed at full list price it's 309.00 and Dyson TP01 lowest model list price with no app,monitor system less ajustment,more money filter 399.99. TP07 close to 700.00 list. Hope my research helped you out.

Mike C,"Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2022","- If you buy it as an Air Purifier with a option as a fan, note that the fan is mostly useless.
Let me put it like this. At the highest setting is powerful as my airmate fan at lowest setting and but with 10x times the noise. They screw this one up big time.
- If you buy it for the fan, is useless, has no power and very very noisy, just don't. They probably tried to use the same motor from the Vacuum or something, I don't know what they tried to do but is definitely wrong.
- If you buy it for the Air purifier and the air quality monitor ...is ok probably because it combines the swing action with the fan which is very helpful, but also in order to do the job probably needs to do be at a higher setting, judging from the amount of air that spits out at a setting lower than 7, it might take a day to actually clean a 20mp2 room, so I highly suspect ""night mode"" which goes to level 4 max is almost useless. Probably that's why they don't actually say how long it took in their
tests to clean that 80mp2 room they brag about.
- Check if you can download the Dyson Link app in from your region, for some unknown reason you cannot download it from anywhere and if is not available you will have to download the apk manually trough some 3rd party website. Why Dyson... why???
- This product I think is 80% about it's looks rather than functionality but note that the remote control at both end is fully transparent, you can actually see the components inside. I don't know who thought this looks cool but to me looks like an unfished product and is very ugly when you put it on top of the machine.
I'm a big fan of their products, we have the V15 vacuum and the hair dryer but this air cleaner/fan.. I find it very hard to justify it's price, is more like a 300$ at best... .and even at that price I'm not sure I would recommend it. I understand that there were a lot of costs involved, the sensors, the app, the R&D, but the result while it satisfy the nerd in me, unfortunately lacks the most important thing: ""the good functionality"".
I remember when I first plugged in my first Dyson vacuum, my reaction was ""WOW!"".
When I first started this air purifier fan... was: ""W T F ??""
Although won't look so cool for the same amount of money you can add a fan and a purifier in each room and probably get much better results but not sure you can find someting so convenient ..remote air quality monitoring, controll app etc.
Update after 6 months:
It does the job ok I think.
Stays in the bedroom and I scheduled it to clean the for 1hr at max setting before we go to seleep. (you can't stay innthe same room witht that noise). Then hoes into auto+night mode which caps the power to 4. For me at 4 is still nosy but because I use earplugs I cannot hear it.
In this 6 months I noticed that the formaldehyde value spikes randomly for cooking gases I suspect...so I doubt is so accurate as they claim, maybe better than other within the price range but not great by any means.
So ..would I recommend it?
Depends.
I really like:
- The app, remote monitoring, scheduling etc, very very convenient!
- The fact that it swings, so it projects the air everywhere across the room
What I don't like:
- The noise
- The fact that I had to go trough a 3rd party to download the official app",2.0 out of 5 stars

JB,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2024","A nice sleek design. Blows cool cleaner air. Not too loud and plenty of settings.
I gave it only 3 stars because you can't change settings without the remote. The remote is suppose to set on top of the fan but it slips off easily. Also, it would be nice if the remote had raised buttons. During the night you have to turn on a light if you want to change the settings.
Other than that, its a nice fan, works great and easy to assemble. Personally, not worth the high cost.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Evan F.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2023","The words clearly read, ""Dyson filters are guaranteed for 12 months."" I got to month 9 before I needed to buy a replacement filter. I spoke to customer support who pulled out language from supposedly deep in the ToS which lists additional conditions. They refused to honor the clearly written language, which actually gets read, and did not offer any support.

Leonardo,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2022","The air filter on this is mediocre. You will have to get another separate air filter to get substantial results. The breeze output is mediocre…it’s only for one person so it does not provide great circulation in a room. It is Aesthetically pleasing for sure and feels like it would last a long time. It’s not quiet. It’s louder than an lg ac unit when on. When picked up or moved around, makes the same flimsy plasticy sounds as when you pick up their vacuums. All in all you’re only paying for aesthetics because the performance is laughable. I would buy again because the other fan options out there are way too hideous.",3.0 out of 5 stars

David B,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2024","This is a Dyson, so obviously it is supposed to be quality and it does look stunning. I can definitely tell the air purification in my bedroom. The fan works well when turned up. So...why do I say overrated? Well for this price point I believe we are missing some key features. This would be connected to WiFi and making this a smart fan. Almost all my others do this with cheaper price points, but still pricey units. I will not state brand, but if you want a smart device this is not it. Oscillating feature starts lowest at 45 degrees. It would be nice if it started at 30 so that way the air would just go back and forth the length of me bed. I have no use for 350 degree oscillation, but they do act like this is a selling point. Maybe if I was drying a painted room? But am I using a Dyson for that kind of air circulation? Last, it replicates a tower fan, and an elongated oval. This doesn't allow for direct air to be concentrated into a smaller spot.
Again, do not get me wrong. It's a nice looking device and if you have the money and care about brand status, this is the fan for you. I own air purifiers and this seems to be far superior to those cheap units when detecting air quality. So if you want great air quality I would consider this. If you just want a fan blow on you when your are sleeping, then I believe there are other options to suffice at much lower prices.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Olive Candles,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2024","I have been using this Dyson air purifier in a small office area of about 200 square feet. It has been a great addition to the room. The air purifier function is excellent and has significantly improved the air quality. It provides a lot of useful information about the air quality of the room, including particulate size, volatile compounds, and nitrous dioxide levels, which can be viewed by cycling through the screens with the remote. These insights are valuable for understanding and monitoring the air quality if you like detailed information like this.
The build quality of the purifier is also quite nice.
However, the fan function is disappointing. 😕 It doesn't cool the room at all, as it is just a fan, and it isn’t very powerful. Considering this is a small space, this is particularly underwhelming. Additionally, the remote control feels cheap and sits haphazardly on top of the fan, held in place by magnets.
Overall, while the air purifier works wonderfully, the fan feature falls short. If you're primarily looking for an air purifier, this Dyson model is a stellar choice. But if you need an effective fan, you might want to keep searching.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Machine Gun Kelley,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2024","First off, this is an air purifier. It does not refrigerate the air so is not what I would call an air conditioner. It pulls air through high quality HEPA and carbon filters and then fans the clean air out into your room. There is no additional cooling effect other than the moving air, so I'm not sure why they list ""cool"" in its name.
As an air purifier it is on par with other purifiers of this price range. It's got good sensors and a quiet fan motor. The device is tall - about 3.5ft but doesn't take up much room as it has about a 1 square foot footprint.
I like that it comes with a remote that magnetically attaches to the top of the unit to minimize losing it. However, if you do lose the remote there isn't a way that I could find to run the unit without the remote. There are different purifying settings including auto which senses the air to clean as much as is needed which should save filters and power. I do like the oscillating air output and the option to change direction of airflow.
Overall, I like this purifier. Dyson has a solid reputation for good engineering and reliability. The device looks good and does a good job cleaning the air. I'm starting with 4-stars for the somewhat deceptive ""cooling"" advertising and my concern of how to operate if you lose the remote control. I'll update if something changes.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Clay D.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2024","You get what you pay for with this fan, it is solidly built, circulates the air very well, and the filter works great and is also easy to replace. The one nitpick i have is that it's a little bit louder than I expected at higher settings, even then it is quieter than the tower fan I replaced so it's not really a big deal. It has the ability to set oscillation based on temperature, theangle of the rotation when oscillating. I like these feature and they are usefull. My favourite feature is the hepa filter, it has really helped me with allergies, which were going crazy this summer. Love it",4.0 out of 5 stars
LKF,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2024","I love Dyson stuff but I am also confused by why it costs so much more than equivalent products from other sellers. This unit is beautiful to look at and works well but you can buy 4 or 5 large equivalent HEPA filter air purifiers on Amazon for less than this costs. You could also buy a top rated A/C unit for less than this costs.
This is a combo fan and air purifier using HEPA technology. It doesn't actually 'cool' the air--it just moves it without changing the temperature at all. A built in HEPA filter takes care of the particulates in the air.
It's an effective and attractive fan and an efficient filter as well--moving more air than most HEPA type filters can and keeping the air in a fairly large room fresh. A small LED screen reports on what it is removing and giving you a sense of the air quality in the room in real time. It would be nice if there was a paired app which could keep track of the info over time.
As with all things Dyson, cutting edge technology and high style are melded into one.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Highmoon,"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2023","This review is for the Dyson Purifier Cool™ Gen1 TP10 .
I had quite a few air purifiers in my home prior to this unit .
I was of course intrigued by this Dyson Air Purifier and air multiplier/ fan .
Is it a fan or a air purifier , or both ?
It’s not cheap but nothing quality ever is .
After testing it for about a month I can say that this is the best air purification I ever experienced from a single unit .
I was able to retire two smaller purifiers immediately.
The fan or air multiplication function confused me a little at first, I was thinking , can something be great at two different things and is it even worth it ?
I came to the conclusion that it all makes sense. Even though we are entering the colder month here now, I couldn’t believe how often I do enjoy a gentle purified breeze coming from the fan.
I appreciate how I can set this on auto and it keeps monitoring the air quality continuously.
After a month of using this to get rid of stale air ,smoke from wildfires, even just cooking odor , the filter is still in good shape according to the indicator on the unit . I took the filter out and reinstalled it when I first got the unit , and it is like everything with Dyson products, if done right it „clicks“ together . Very easy to use and maintain . Safe for kids, seniors, pets .
What I wish was different :
I actually prefer the simple operation, I don’t mind that this model isn’t compatible with the Dyson app , however , since that makes the remote extra important I wish it was backlit . It is hard to read for us older folks .
I wish there was a turn- off button for the fan . So that I can use this solely for purification because sometimes it is too cold and the only option this model gives me is to make the fan stop oscillating ( via remote) and turn it so the air flow is turned away from me.
I think that this model is probably best for non tech savvy people who would not want to use an app anyway.
The size of this and the design sure makes it easier to clean than bladed fans and smaller air purification devices. I find the noise level is low , no complaints there.
I really like the white and silver on this model. It looks so futuristic and I can easily pick it up and place it somewhere else . it looks heavier than it is which is also nice .
Would I purchase this model ?
No, I would see if there was a model which one could turn the air multiplication feature on and off independently from the purification.",4.0 out of 5 stars
LillianG,"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2023","This is my first time getting a Dyson air purifier. It comes nicely packaged and supported for shipping. It’s big, but lighter than expected and easy to move. Setup is easy, just unpack it and plug it in. The remote control is probably my favorite part, with intuitive icons I could figure out through trial and error. I should mention at this point that my air purifier didn't come with a manual, which I found very strange. There's a QR code for registering the device that I eventually got around to scanning and filling out all the information for, and it seems the manual is digital. I guess that's alright. Don't lose the remote, as there's no way to change the settings otherwise as far as I can see.
I have an air quality monitor and noticed that running the fan at the ""auto"" setting didn't do much to affect the room, so I put the monitor's intake right up to the fan at full power just to check if it was actually working (pictured), and sure enough, the monitor changed to reflect perfectly clear air quality. So it does work, it just takes a while. After running the fan at full power for a few hours, the monitor finally started to show the air quality a few feet away from the air purifier as improving. The fan isn't very loud; rather, it's about the same loudness and power as a typical fan. The only downside I see is I'm going to be miserable in the winter when it's blasting cool air, but I'll just point it away from me and hope it all works out.
I like that this air purifier acts as a fan, air purifier, and air quality monitor all in one, but I still feel that it's overpriced. You can buy a good quality fan, air purifier, and air quality monitor separately and the cost would still be less than half the price of this. The majority of this product's cost is the brand name. I recommend it for people who like the brand (and have money), but for everyone else, I recommend a small brand that has a reliable supply line of filters (I'm not looking forward to buying the filters for this), and an air quality monitor so you can make sure it works. And also buy a fan if you want a fan. It might take up more space in all, but it's much cheaper. I do still like the remote though.",4.0 out of 5 stars
ShiverShay,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2023","This is a review for ""Dyson Purifier Cool™ Gen1 TP10""
I feel like when I ordered this, the description on the sales page used the word ""fan"" implying this was not only an air purifier but also a fan. When I look at the post now, it does not have the word ""fan"" in the title. That is definitely more accurate. As I was working through writing this review in my head, I was thinking of the phrase ""calling this a fan is an insult to fans"" or something like that. Yes, it can circulate air, but it is not the device you would turn to in the summer to circulate air.
My other massive complaint (apart from the price) is that mine did not come with any sort of manual. I had to go out of my way to go online to seek out the Dyson website and download and the manual for myself. For the cost of this thing and the fact that a manual is flat and would not take up any space in the box, the directions for how to interpret the various screens and settings, should have come printed inside the box. I definitely took a star off for this. This would not have increased the price by any significant amount and would have gone a LONG way to improving my satisfaction with this product for the first week I had it.
I really like the wide width of its ability to swivel, but I LOVE how you can control the size of the oscillation, from a small arc to nearly 360 degrees.
My gripes out of the way, as an air purifier it works well, has much more flexibility in terms of fan speed and level of quality to purify the air than my previous purifier that finally bit the dust after 15 years.
If you are deep into the Dyson culture, this in one more device they have researched and constructed well and you will not be disappointed.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Trell Williams,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2023","I'm knocking one star off for one reason and one reason only. I already own two of the Dyson Pure cool Link TP02 tower fans. I've had them for about 4 or 5 years now and they still work as well as the day I go them. I have moderate to severe allergies to things like pollen, various dust mites, certain pet dander, mice & rat droppings and urine, and cockroach droppings and urine. The air purifiers worked well for apartment living as I did not have central air and heat, and no matter how clean I kept my place, if the neighbors had pests, so did I.
When I saw that this fan was available and appeared to be an upgrade to my other Dyson, I was very excited to get this. It is more effective at purifying the air and removing more particles than my original fans, it has a greater degree of oscillation so instead of having two fans in one room, just having this one in a central point of the room is very effective at cooling. The unit itself is slightly larger than the Pure Cool Link TP02, yet the airflow isn't as powerful as the TP02 when comparing the two fans at max setting.
It isn't so loud as to be distracting and keep you up at night, though it can be a bit noisy on the highest setting, which is to be expected. But unless you live in a very hot climate, I doubt you'll need the highest setting. I live in a State that is known for its sunny and hot weather and the only time I've ever used a setting higher than 5 out of 10 is when trying to dry wall paint or air out a room that's either been painted or had some other fumes.
The one thing that I don't really like is that this fan has no app or home link connectivity. So it can't be controlled with Google Home, Alexa, or the MyDyson app. This kind of bothers me because I like being able to control the fans from the other room or even adjust the fan speed when away from home.
I do like that Dyson has kept the curved magnetized remote to neatly store it on top of the unit.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Just,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2023","I find that this purifier is a little difficult to judge, mostly because I have no way of telling how accurate it's sensors are. I am basically hoping that it is working the way it should be. I usually keep it on auto sensing, which is supposed to monitor the air levels, and turn on the purifier/fan when it picks up particulates in the air. Maybe it's due to where I have it in my living room, but after a few weeks of using it I have only noticed it recognize something in the air and turn on a few times. There weren't really any instruction on the best places to keep it for the best results so maybe that's a factor? Otherwise, it works well as room fan. It has 10 levels of fan strength, and even at the highest level it isn't too loud. It can oscillate almost 360 degrees around and has different modes that you can set if needed, including a night mode and tracking mode where you can see past particulate levels. It also is remote controlled for easy adjusting. Being a Dyson product, it is fairly expensive so whether or not it's worth it will be up to you. As a purifier, it's probably better to have than nothing at all so I'm going to continue to use it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Stoney,"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2023","This thing is really cool (no pun intended). The airflow was slightly weaker than a regular fan, but the purification was pretty awesome. After just a few hours of running in my den, I could tell a difference in the air quality.
The noise level was on par, if not slightly lower than most other fans this size. The remote is super convenient, and the oscillation is smooth and silent. I was so impressed by the purification, that I went and tried it in my teenage son's room... I was shocked that it put a dent in the funky smell after a few hours of running.
Here's my issue with this thing - THE COST.
While everything I stated is awesome, I still can't see spending this much money on a purifier when there are FAR less expensive options out there. Not to even mention the cost of replacement filters!
Are Dyson products super cool and well-made? - YES.
Can you get the same results from a cheaper product? - YES.
Bottom line- If you have the money to spend, you won't be disappointed in this unit. But if you are tight on funds, look elsewhere.",4.0 out of 5 stars
TanH,"Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2023","This thing is much bigger than I expected, it's like 3 feet tall. Despite its large size, the airflow it generates is surprisingly lacking. It doesn't even cool the air, it just acts as a weak fan. My much smaller Vornado fan has better airflow than this, and you still need to use the AC on hot summer days.
I have to leave this Dyson on at least 8/10 power with the oscillation on to feel any sort of comfort. Unlike the original TP01, this TP10 can actually rotate and oscillate almost a complete 360 degrees. There is also no wifi connectivity, so you have to use the provided remote to adjust oscillation settings.
The good thing is this purifies the air with its hepa filter and is much quieter than a Vornado. On max 10/10 power, it just sounds like my laptop whirring while playing a game. In terms of cooling efficacy, I still think it's much better to have a Vornado and just get a separate air purifier. The cost of those 2 items combined is much cheaper than this Dyson. You'll also have much stronger air circulation as long as you don't mind the loud fan noise.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Wamazon!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2023","I like that this is relatively quiet in full operation. Of course it has the ""cool"" factor (pun intended) with the bladeless design but at just under $500 at time of this review, this really should be a perfect, intuitive machine that impresses in every way.
The main complaint that I have is with oscillation. It feels really over-engineered. And I want to be able to lock the fan direction in one place using the remote. Not possible. It should just go two directions and keep it simple and user friendly! I have yet to get the oscillation working properly via the remote. It just doesn't accept the input.
Next in the setup process you are told to install the Dyson app. So I expected this to include some basic functionality to use my phone as a remote. Nope. It it just a glorified registration app with some basic documentation.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Looks like no other fan and I have to say it works quite well.

I appreciate the safety features. For instance if it does gets ""bumped"" while in oscillate mode, it will stop moving back and forth so that the motor won't die.

mr. opinionated,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2024","If I had to say one negative thing about this fan it would be that even at its highest speed the airflow does not really hit you like a standard bladed fan. If you are directly in front of it, you will get a substantial breeze however you have to be fairly close to really feel it. I am just used to be being blasted directly with a wave of air especially after coming in from doing outdoor chores. This being said there are advantages we have found. As the fan can rotate up to 350 degrees, it can cover a larger area than a standard fan. It feels as if it keeps the entire room cooler from being able to circulate more of the air versus just one swatch of it
You can choose from stationary to rotating 45, 90, 180 or 350 degrees. We use 45 degrees as that shifts nicely back and forth between my wife and I. The room even feels cooler in the morning than with our standard floor fan.
The unit has two nice sized HEPA filters at the base. I have not had a chance to play with all the features and want the fan mostly for cooling however with cats it is nice to have to keep dander down. I will have to research the longevity of the filters and replacement cost. We do have the unit sitting above the floor on a hard surface which will hopefully lessen what it pulls in to the filters. We will let the vacuum cleaner's filter take care of the carpet.
We really like this fan as it is quiet and blade-less. Even though it is tall, it takes up little space in the room. We look forward to year round use as even if we do not want the fan blowing, the unit can be switched to an air cleaning only mode to keep allergens down. When it cools down, we will be more apt to use the built in air monitoring system which is really nice.
The remote holds steady on the top of the fan using magnets. Thinking on it, a backlit button feature on the remote would be welcome. All functions must be controlled through the remote as the unit itself only has an on/off button. The display on the fan is smaller but still very legible and displays quite a bit of information that I still must learn all the ins and outs of.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Christopher Kouzios,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2024","Back in 2020 at the onset of the pandemic, we bought a Dyson TP07. We have been using that for the last four years with absolutely no errors or problems. The only thing that’s somewhat frustrating is having to spend a lot of money on replacement filters, however I have found some of the offbrands that are less expensive. Do the job just as well. When I saw this new Dyson HEPA filter I thought why not. We needed another one for the other side of our house as we have guests routinely stay here and the knock off, no name-brand air cleaners we have scattered around the house just don’t do anywhere near as good of a job as our Dyson. We have robotic vacuums that vacuum and mop the house every single day, we have high efficiency HVAC, we have air cleaners, and we clean the house on a routine basis. That said you can’t quite get everything and I’ve found these Dysons do an amazing job. There have been times when we open the doors or windows during the cooler season just for a little while to get some fresh air. The Dyson will immediately begin to adjust if the air quality is not pristine. I have also seen the Dyson automatically adjust itself when “Someone” burn’s something in the oven. It correctly senses the air quality and will adjust its speed. It’s fantastic. I also like the volume of air flow when we turn the unit all the way up. The one thing I was concerned about was it being obnoxiously loud or having yet another display on in the middle of the night, however, it adjusted itself to night mode so it’s barely a whisper and it shut its display off. I realize that a $500 air cleaner is not in everyone’s budget however I can say with certainty that this unit is worth every penny.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Brandon,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2024","my only real complaint is that the remote controls everything, there is nothing but a power button on the fan itself.
- Noise is on the lowest setting is it running? to the max setting were it is quieter then a normal fan but u can clearly hear it running. But it moves a LOT of Air on max and u most likely wont need it that high.
- The meat of this fan is clearly the Air purifier, It has a auto mode that boosts the fan when it detects dirt or heavy dust. but otherwise auto is just 1 or 2 speed and that's it.
- Price these things are very overpriced for what they actually do and that is move air thu a carbon filter and send the clean air out at you. But it dos this thing VERY well and is both cool to look at and doubles as a big fan.
So here is the rub, These things are basically big Air purifiers. So when I ask do you need something like this NO, it makes much more sense for most people to just buy a Air Purifier if you need something filtering the air... But it is very cool to look at, and is both a Big fan and Big Air purifier. That said it performs cleaning your air and moving it quickly extremely well.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Ryan,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2024","This Dyson fan is impressive! The fan can detect a variety of impurities in the air of whichever room you place it in which is particularly unique compared to the other air purifier we have. There was minimal assembly required - the only component to attach was the filter and outer cover. The remote functionality is straightforward. We have yet to try out the different functions or auto mode settings but overall the performance is great! The fan is quite large so if you’re looking for something that doesn’t stand out this may not be the best option, however the sleek design and white color allows it to blend for the most part into a well decorated room. The price tag is a bit steep for such a simple appliance or home item, I would definitely recommend looking at this in person first before buying.",5.0 out of 5 stars
C. Fleming,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2024","This is a great tower fan. It is Super quiet, looks & works great. I got it to replace a old tower fan that we have had for years that this year just really bugged me - how ugly and loud it was. After looking thru the listings for new, remote tower fans we decided to try this one. I am so happy with it. Dyson is famous for it's aesthetic and quality so I had high expectations and I was very happy with it. It is really sleek and modern looking with nice silver top & sides. It is really slim but still extremely powerful & really quiet. The controls on the top are touch and simple to operate. The remote works from across the room (+20 feet). I love that it has a magnet space that holds the remote. It comes with two air purifier sets - which you can switch out based on your needs at the time. They are also washable which is great. We live by the beach in sunny So Cal and do not have air conditioning. 85% of the year this is fine - just open up the windows and let mother nature's AC do her work (wind) but some days are just sweltering and that is where fans come into it. I have high hopes that this one will work great for us this summer.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Zoe,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2024","I like almost everything about this modern fan air purifier combo. On the lower settings, it is virtually silent. On the higher settings, the noise is much less than other fans that move that mush air. The air flow is gentle while effective. I like its looks, like an art piece as much as a fan. The air purifier can be set on auto, to come on when needed. This is a feature I have been wanting for a long time. Putting the filters on is a snap. The first one went on super easy. I found the laying the fan on its side made the other one easy to snap into place. If I were to ask for an improvement, it would be to make the magnet holding the remote to a the top a wee bit stronger. This is not enough to influence a buying decision, but it would be the icing on the cake. Overall, I love this fan/purifier.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JT,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2024","I love my Dyson vacuum so had high expectations for this fan. It's definitely larger than I expected it to be, but in a good way. It stands up nice and tall and I love the remote control and the various settings (night time, timer, rotating on/off, fan level, etc). the fan is also very quiet which is nice. i have another tower fan that is considerably noisier. i did have some trouble getting the bottom pieces to latch on correctly without fear of it breaking, but once i got it, it fits quite nice and is overall easy to put together and set up. highly recommend this fan!!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Saraneth,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2024","> Dyson Purifier Cool TP4B Purifying Fan (~$550)
The Good: Looks great, works great. Can operate at very low noise, and can also move a lot of air at higher noise levels. At higher levels, the noise is not mechanical sounding and there is no whining sound, just wind blowing. Clears up stale air quickly with activated charcoal filters. Set-up is straightforward and easy to do. Filters are easy to replace. Excellent design, fit and finish, and aesthetics. Can operate without directed air blowing at you (basically, cleans and circulates air up instead of out horizontally).
The Bad: Fairly expensive. Not easily operated from the base, you must use the remote.
This is a very high quality product, and it has been operating flawlessly, above my expectations. But this kind of quality is not inexpensive.
Hope this review was helpful!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Mark,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2024","This dyson fan arrived and the only thing needed was the filters, the covers, and the power cord. I was impressed at the build quality of this dyson but I do want to note that I had trouble getting the filter cover to stay in place. I believe it had something to do with the carbon filter not being installed all the way and would not allow the cover to click into place. Once the carbon filter was fully inserted then the cover clicked right in. The remote is easy to operate the fan and the instructions make it clear what buttons control what functions. This fan also has an air quality display and is perfect if you are making sure your air is not affecting your health.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Mi Cael,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2023","This product was packaged in a very premium fashion and upon opening it, it was already assembled and ready to use! All that needed to be done to start using it was to take off the plastic around the fan and off the controller. Upon starting the Purifier, I noticed the live monitor of air quality was almost touching the yellow indicator. After running for 30 minutes, it had been brought down to low green!
That's absolutely incredible! This is quite impressive to me as the living room is not small, it probably covers a 20x20 ft area. I tried putting the fan in a room upstairs that's a little bigger than the living room and the live air quality went from medium green to low green in about 20 minutes with the 8 fan setting.
Not only is this a great purifier, but it's a powerful fan while being completely safe! You can stick your hand right through the center no problem. Out of curiosity, I put a vacuum container with some dust still in it and opened it near the purifier and sure enough the purifier shot up to high yellow and quickly descended back down to low green within 25 seconds.
I'm just amazed with the quality and functionality of this purifier. This is absolutely worth the money, especially if you have asthma. My only gripe is that the fan isn't as heavy and premium feeling as I thought it would be, but it's also a positive as it's really light to take around. Another thing is that the power cord could be a little longer, but those are just nit-picky things. Overall, this purifier is amazing! I will be looking out to buy another one. 100% recommended!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Moreover, the ability to adjust the direction, speed, night mode, and access extra information through the downloadable app is highly appreciated.

Kevin Calfy,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2023",Amazing combo unit from a very innovative company. Always loved Dyson. My parents got a Dyson vacuum like 10 years ago or better and still works like it’s new. Great quality and that’s the same with this. So easy to use and very well built. App is nice but really I like how it cleans the air and circulates it throughout a big area. We don’t have a big house so this one unit takes care of our house by itself. Helped us not run our air conditioning nearly as much either. The fan really does cool a room down quite well despite it just being a fan and air purifier. Air is definitely fresher and very quiet running. Not to heavy either. Has good weight to it meaning you feel the quality but it’s not an overwhelming amount of weight. Amazing product like I said.👍🏻,5.0 out of 5 stars
Helpful Reviews,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2023","- This brand name basically sells itself. It is every thing they claim about it. Super quiet even at higher speeds (10 speed levels) and super efficient.
- I don’t know why these are so tall. They have shorter ones. And the air intake and filter are just in the bottom portion. The whole upper portion is just the air output. However, I would say this is a medium size compared to the original ones.
- You can find a comparison page on their website that will help you determine the differences between models. As well as all the specs of course, so I’m not going to try and list those.
- Easy to set up and use straight out of the box.
- The screen is only about 1” and what is displayed on it is even smaller, plus it is located only a foot off the floor, so you’ll need to get down to the floor to read what it says.
- On the tower itself there is only a power button. So make sure you don’t loose the remote or you won’t be able to do anything with the controls.
- Padded circles on base to protect surface.
- The filters are a little pricey but only need changing once a year on average.
- S/N - It does not come in an amazon box, so there is nothing to conceal the contents as the product box is not at all circumspect. So you may wish to use locker pickup.",5.0 out of 5 stars
DIY’er,"Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2023","This Dyson fan is soooo quiet you don’t know it’s on until you feel for the fan. Yes you can hear it when you really crank it up, but the Dyson at 10 is nothing compared to my Honeywell on medium. I hate noise and have to keep my air purifiers on low because of it. This Dyson air purifier/fan is whisper quiet! Also, even though this isn’t an AC but is a fan the room does get cooler and the kitties are now camped out in front of it. You can even feel it across the room, but it’s not obnoxious blowing things everywhere like most fans are, it’s a nice subtle breeze. There’s some really cool features where it will monitor the air quality and particle size. It also has a display of how much life is left on the filter and just doesn’t surprise you with a change it light. I totally love this thing and have wanted one forever! If you watch their videos you will see how it circulates the air in the rooms….and it’s true you can tell the air is moving and is cleaner!",5.0 out of 5 stars
TreatYoSelf,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2023","This fan has reduced my office temperature by about 5 degrees on its lowest setting, which makes a big difference when I’m running a bunch of server and networking equipment that generates substantial heat.
I can now work comfortably in there for hours and the room remains cool, even with the door shut. My office is upstairs during the ridiculous heat of a southern summer.
That little difference in temperature means I no longer am sweating just sitting in the room with my setup running. The installed ceiling fan is only able to move air around. This fan actually cools the room down.
its easy to set and control. The remote is extra nice because I can even change it while in a meeting at my desk without getting up if it ever got too cold or too hot.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2023","This is a nice, large fan from Dyson. It’s noticeably better than my older Dyson fan in every possible way. The price is still hard to stomach even with all the features but if money isn’t an issue, few fans will come close to this one while also purifying the air. This thing moves a lot of air and actually allows me to turn up my thermostat a bit because the air is moving so much better. The remote is small and simple as it should be. This thing has a lot of nice features that most fans don’t offer. This things blows hard but is gently on allergies and you just need to change the filter instead of cleaning all the dust off the unit like other fans.",5.0 out of 5 stars

William Sung,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2023","The dyson TP10 continues a tradition of beautifully crafted dyson fans that perform many different operations into a singular package. Out of the box everything comes fully assemebled just unpack it from the box and plop the magnetic remote to the top of the fan. Plug it in and you are ready to go. The fan itself outputs a good amount of air especially at around 4-6 feet away it seems the concentrated airflow helps to fully output arount this range.
The screen is very bright and clear so anytime you change the settings or output you can easily see where you are. Most of the settings are pretty self explanatory. It looks super cool when the fan goes 350 degrees where it almost spins all the way around while it is oscilating.
MY time with the dyson I never saw the PMi go from green which is good the air filters around the house are doing their job. Very happy with this product alhtough the price is always the kicker with these things.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I have it in my living room which is next to my kitchen- when I cook the purifier automatically sets itself on a higher mode to filter out the particles caused by the cooking. It’s pretty crazy how it operates itself and adjusts as needed.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Joel Gallegos,"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2023","I couldent be more happy with this Dyson Air Purifier. It looks super modern and very clean. One of my favorite things about this machine is that the display actually reads out numerically the current particulate in the air. It's very accurate. When I filmed this there was smoke outside hence the reading in the 30's. Today it's down to 3. All of my other purifiers just have three colored lights to indicate Good. Moderate, Bad. I love having the actual # showing. The machine is almost silent when it's on a low setting and the turning mechanism is silent too. If you turn it up all the way it does make some noise but less than a standard fan of equivalent throughput. I really love this purifier and it's now the fanciest one I own. You really can't go wrong with this unit.",5.0 out of 5 stars
