dragonlord,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2024","The dehumidifier has been a fantastic addition to my basement. It efficiently covers up to 3000 square feet, maintaining a comfortable humidity level with ease. It states it can go more, but that was the most I could test The auto humidity control is a standout feature, allowing the device to adjust its operation based on the room's needs, which has been great for energy efficiency.

The included drain hose and 2.0-gallon bucket offer flexible options for continuous drainage or manual emptying. I especially appreciate the WiFi connectivity, which allows me to monitor and control the dehumidifier remotely. This has made managing the humidity levels in my basement much more convenient.
While the dehumidifier is a bit large, this is expected for a unit capable of handling such a vast area. It runs relatively quietly and doesn't disrupt the household, which is a significant plus. A downside is making sure you get it leveled for the drain plug as I did have some problems getting just right so it would properly drain.
I believe this is a powerful and user-friendly product for decently large spaces. Its efficient performance, coupled with smart features, makes it a highly recommended choice for anyone needing reliable humidity control.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Matthew,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024","I have quite a few govee products, including various lighting, cooking, and heating/air related ones. So when it came time to replace my dehumidifier, I was excited to give the govee one a try.
Unfortunately when I received the dehumidifier, I could tell something wasn't right. It wasn't collecting any moisture and the condenser would make a loud thunking grind type noise when it turned on and off. So I reached out to Govee, and after a bit of support trying to identify and resolve the issue, Govee customer support agreed that a new product was necessary. They sent a new dehumidifier and it worked perfectly after I set it up, no chunky grinding sound with the condensy and literal buckets of water collected as it dehumidifies. It's a great product, the smart features are useful and I have it hooked up with a drainage hose to a separate condensate pump-- works like a dream
This is only the second time I needed Govee customer support with the over 20 products I own now, and both times I found the support to be helpful, patient, and thorough.
I give this 5 stars even though the first one ended up being broken, because the customer support is top notch and the replacement has been working great!",5.0 out of 5 stars
D. Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2023","This arrived in perfect condition and quickly. I unboxed it and left it in an upright position for 24 hours BEFORE plugging it in to prevent compressor damage and extend the service life of the unit, as you should do with any product that has a compressor, to allow the oil to resettle back into the compressor from the lines due to movement during transit.
It connected quickly to my Android smartphone via their app, available for free from the Play Store and integrated seamlessly with my Alexa ecosystem, which is robust to say the least. Easily turned on, off, raised and lowered the fan speed via voice, which is primarily what drove me to purchase this product. As a bonus, I had a small Govee remote sensor for temperature and humidity that paired with the unit to provide remote sensing capabilities, which was very handy when trying to keep a large space properly dehumidified.
The app is easy to use and customer service is handled through the app, which is VERY nice and super convenient. I thought I had an issue with the compressor not turning on and off but via messaging through the chat in the app, they were able to see the log of the machine's components and determine it was my misunderstanding of how the Auto function worked.
The unit itself works well to remove excess humidity from our home. With the unit on high and the relative humidity being 60%, it fills the tank in around 10 hours, making our home feel more comfortable at 74F and 52% RH than at 72F and 60% RH. It does emit heat though, as is the case with any dehumidifier, so mitigating that is simply a case of having the fan on our central AC unit come on for 15 minutes every hour to help move the dehumidified air and warmer air out of the room. We keep the unit in the living room, our largest room in our 1700 sqft. living space and it definitely helps keep the entire space more comfortable, again using the central air fan only function to move air around the entire space.
The water tank is one of the largest I could find at 2 gallons. I didn't want to hang a hose out of the window to automatically drain the unit, but I did try out the auto drain function and it does work really well to pump the water out without the use of the integrated water tank, a nice feature for sure, especially if you have a floor drain or put the unit in close proximity of the window. The unit is easy to maintain - a washable filter screen on the back of the unit makes keeping the coils clean and the unit in top working condition a breeze.
We are very happy with this purchase. We've had it up and running for about a month now and have already noticed shorter run times on the central AC due to not needing to crank the temperature down to get the 'stickiness' out of the air. We live in the 'deep south' on the coast and high humidity is just a way of life. This helps the house feel much more comfortable and that's important to us.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Placeholder,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2024","Short version: Great appliance, highly efficient, easy integration with the Govee app, extensive amount of control through app, high capacity 2 gal tank that’s easy to empty or connect to garden hose or use provided adapter to use drain tube provided (or go to Lowes/Home Depot to get longer tube and avoid ugly garden hose in the house), not overly loud - can’t tell it’s on when the A/C is running, makes it far more comfortable and takes strain off the A/C during extreme temps & high humidity.
Long Version:
Originally fell in love with Govee LED lights and grew to trust the brand more over the years through various warranty replacements and honestly outstanding customer service through any issue/concern.
I’ll admit, I was semi skeptical when they began venturing into various home appliances.
The app is great and works flawlessly with every Govee product I own (Many lights, Hygrometer/Thermometers, Space Heater and now Dehumidifer).
The dehumidifier is extremely efficient, I can track my energy usage through my smart meter and it typically pulls about 800-850 watts on high and roughly 780 watts with fan on low. For comparison - my central air pulls 2,400 watts.
I love the ability to pair any of my Hygrometers to control the humidity in any one particular area and set it to maintain whatever set point you select within the app. Also, when paired with a Hygrometer and connected to WiFi, you have more visibility/control into your environment remotely in the app, as it allows you to check the humidity/temp from anywhere instead of only within Bluetooth range.
On high, it removes a LOT of moisture relatively quickly. I live in a 1,200 sqft apartment and leave it by my master bath which pumps out the most humidity from my scalding showers lol. Within about 30-45mins, the humidity drops from 82% to 50% and provides peace of mind knowing it’s preventing mold in poorly ventilated areas.
It’s a great assistance to the A/C during extremely hot & humid days as well, and prevented my coils from freezing up during a recent severe heatwave. Also, to be able to open the windows on cooler, but humid nights/days and run the dehumidifier instead of the A/C, using a fraction of the energy is very nice and provides a bit of versatility as an alternative to “overcooling” to dehimidify.
My one complaint and only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the way the “maintain” feature works when you want to maintain a particular threshold instead of running it 24/7.
As the humidity gets closer to the desired set point, the unit decreases the fan speed to low once it’s about 3% away from its target. From a logical prospective, the fan is the cheapest component of the unit to operate as the condenser is not variable and therefore either on 100% or off.
Once the fan speed decreases, it takes notably longer to reach the target set point vs allowing it to run on high continuously until the target is reached, which ultimately decreases the overall efficiency.
If Govee updated the firmware to “maintain” the threshold by running the fan on high continuously until the target is reached, I would immediately update this to 5 stars.
Aside from that, I have zero complaints and plan to purchase another unit for my parents if the price is right on Prime Day.",4.0 out of 5 stars
jsgraydon,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024","This summer has been brutally hot and humid, but this dehumidifier has been great. It is highly efficient, even in a poorly insulated cottage on the shoreline. It is easy to empty, sends notifications when it needs emptying, and has a few other smart features that improve quality of life. My two complaints: it is a little loud and the air it emits is warmer than other dehumidifiers I have used. Still, I would recommend it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
SW2,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2024","Was looking for a dehumidifier with a good size bucket when I came across this. I have quite a few govee devices that I am pleased with. This was priced right and fit my criteria. It works very well. It has 3 different fan speeds but I usually just leave it on low. Fan noise is a bit loud at medium and high. Bucket fills in about 10hrs. Comes with a short hose if you wanna run it to a drain. App works very well. You can turn off/on, set timers, adjust fan, see humidity level, etc. There is even a graph that shows your humidity level history, as well as temperature. I have been running this pretty much nonstop for the last few months. Haven't had a single issue.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Are you tired of your basement feeling like a damp dungeon straight out of a medieval horror movie? Do you find yourself wondering if creatures of the deep are lurking in the shadows? Fear not, for the GoveeLife Smart Dehumidifier has arrived to save the day (and your sanity)!
First of all, let’s talk size. This dehumidifier is a beast – but in a good way! Covering up to 4,500 square feet, it’s like having a tiny superhero stationed in your basement, constantly battling humidity villains. It’s so efficient that I half expect it to don a cape and start calling itself “Captain Dry.”
The auto humidity control is a game-changer. No more guessing games or fiddling with settings – this dehumidifier is smarter than my high school science teacher. It knows exactly what your basement needs and adjusts itself accordingly. I swear, it’s like it’s reading my mind (or at least my moisture levels).
The drain hose and 2.0-gallon bucket are a match made in heaven. Whether you’re a hose person or a bucket enthusiast, this dehumidifier has got you covered. Personally, I’ve never been so excited to watch water drain away. It’s like a weirdly satisfying magic trick every time.
And the WiFi feature? Absolute genius. I can now control my dehumidifier from my phone while lounging on the couch, sipping a margarita, and pretending I’m not a grown adult obsessed with humidity levels. It’s the pinnacle of modern convenience.
Energy Star Most Efficient? More like “Energy Star Most Awesome.” This thing works tirelessly, day and night, without making a dent in my electric bill. I’m convinced it runs on good vibes and determination.
In conclusion, the GoveeLife Smart Dehumidifier is not just a device – it’s a basement’s best friend. It’s reliable, efficient, and surprisingly entertaining. If your basement needs a hero, look no further. Five stars and a standing ovation from me and my now-dry basement!",5.0 out of 5 stars
MJ85,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2024","I really do love this dehumidifier. We recently moved to a new place on the first floor and were having humidity problems. After buying a dud online I hunkered down and did a ton of energy star research on the top dehumidifiers of 2024.. Landed ob Gasbye (?) and Duracomfort. 1 was wifi enabled, the other was not. Once i got hooked on wifi/app enabled features I found Govee. Not on a 2024 best buy list but 2023. Im good with that!. The specs in the amazon add matched perfect;y with tested spec on the Energy Star site unlike most Chinese brands . (theyd say 22 or 50 pints a day and turns out its 1-3.. 99% of these are false marketing, you cant trust amazon , they wont verify or take them down. I even poated negative reviews with all the inaccurate specs directly from Energy Stars website showing consumers how badly they were being lied to but Amazon removed them. they want to get paid, they dont care how..... and thats how you become a 200billionaire... i digress) Govee was legit. I tested this thing out and it cranks!. it removes 50+ pints a day as advertised. Its hard to keep up with it. The app and features are great. I love having charts to monitor the humidity over time. youre gonna get everything you want in a dehumidifier here for a better price than the competition. the ONLY con is the noise. On med or high this thing is loud. it drowns everything. even on low is pretty loud. Dont expect to put this in a bedroom while you sleep. Even on low it sounds like the loudest fan so im removing 1 star for that. I also dont know how long this device lasts. Ill update over time. But again, it works phenomenal, just have to be ready for some noise",4.0 out of 5 stars
Danielle Sachok,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024",This was my second dehumidifier I purchased. The first one didn't work in my space at all. This is a heavy duty dehumidifier. I feel it doesn't make much noise and sounds like as if you have a fan blowing. This dehumidifier works! It quickly lowered my humidity in my basement from as high as 84% down to 30%. You can easily move it around as it has wheels. My finished basement is split into 3 separate rooms so I haven't used the hose and drain feature. The bucket fills up daily. It is easy to remove but the handle feels extremely weak when the bucket is filled and I have to carry it from the bottom. This is not ideal as it fills up to the top and the cover does not completely cover the bucket so I have spilled water on the way to the laundry room sink. The app and smart phones features are great because I can check the temperature and humidity from anywhere in the house.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Anna Franklin,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2024","Designed with thoughtful features like a tank that's sealed on top and easy to remove and empty while avoiding spillage. It's quiet and powerful as well, getting humidity down from ~70% to ~55% in a ~300 sq ft space in roughly an hour.
Connectivity with remote Govee hygrometer is easy and helps machine to have a more accurate reading of humidity by not limiting to its internal sensor and thus a small radius around the unit itself. App is easy to use, higly customizable, and tracks data in easy-to-digest reports.
I wish automatic mode (in which machine runs until a preset humidity level is reached) could be run on low or medium fan settings, so that I could leave it run in my bedroom at night when sleeping. Hoping this feature will be added in a future software update.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Tempting Reviews,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2024","EDIT: With the Pelonis' help the Govee can now get down to 46-47. The problem is it has to go through a defrost cycle at points, which means it won't be running, and if your basement gets humid in seconds, you're toast. There's also an over heat shutoff (which the Pelonis doesn't need because it exhausts the hot air as it runs, which contributes to its efficiency).
Bottom line, I would STRONGLY recommend not relying on this alone. It's not strong enough to handle humid situations alone and even if it manages, the overheat and defrost cycles will cause it to fall right back behind.
The sellers left behind a Pelonis dehumidifier (not properly connected). I got it fully running, and it has been able to maintain 45-50 relative humidity fairly well without going to the high setting. I'm of the opinion that the hot air it blows is the key to its performance.
I wanted to try the GoveeLife for the ability to monitor and adjust without having to go downstairs, and I already have a bunch of Govee devices.
The GoveeLife looks nice, but struggled to get the humidity down from 60 to 50 even on the max or Auto settings, hovering instead around the 54-56 range. We're in cold season; and the dew point is quite a bit higher than usual, but I was surprised to see it struggle given the basement is not that large. Online sources indicate that the in-built hygrometer may not be calibrated properly, and may be misreading the humidity; in my experience it's not too far off from the Pelonis, so I don't believe it to be a calibration issue. I think it's relying too much on just regular air movement and not heating of the air in conjuction with air movement.
For now, I have the Pelonis in an opposing corner set to a lower level to try and help the GoveeLife get caught up at least. As I type this, it's down to 52 -53 and slowly dropping; so I strongly question the 4500 sq ft claims (the Pelonis is about 15 feet away and running on the lowest setting).",3.0 out of 5 stars

Not good, and is above the ""safe"" levels for mold, etc. Enter this device. We set it up in the basement and routed the included hose to the same drain the AC uses. This machine has dropped the entire house's humidity by 10% in a week. It now hovers around 52%. Although the temperature has remained the same, it feels much cooler due to the lowered humidity.

Shannon,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2024",I first bought a dehumidifier for a basement because it was crazy damp and we had a serious mold issue but it was only a half gallon tank. I decided to fork over the money to get this one because we needed a larger tank because we had to empty the other one at least twice a day because it would automatically shut off so who knows if we would have had to empty it even more. This one gives you the option to either use the draining hose or the tank Within the dehumidifier itself and we needed this larger tank because we just did not have an adequate place to drain it to take care of the damp issue in our basement. I love this dehumidifier because it is so easy to empty the tank we really struggled putting the smaller tank in the other dehumidifier and I can do this one with ease. The other feature I really like is that it has a little handle to pick it up once you slide it out from the bottom and it is very secure and takes about 60 seconds to slide it out of there dump it and slide it back in and keep it running! As far as noise it sounds like a fan running so it isn't terribly Loud by any means and it works so incredibly well that I would purchase this again and highly recommend it. Right now we've only had it about 1 week and we know we have a serious moisture issue and it is taking to gallons of water out in a 24-hour period and we can tell a seriously huge difference. It's easy to set up has a decently long cord and I like that it is on Wheels so we can move it around with ease. Highly recommend if you have moisture issues in your basement.

Customer 146735,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2024","The dehumidifier unit works pretty well. I have been able to get 1,000 square feet down to 42% even when outside is over 90%. I did have some issues with the product. First, this uses the new refrigerant, the one which could potentially explode in your house should it leak. There was no warning on the product page that it uses the new refrigerant, I purchased the unit this year because I thought it was using the old refrigerant which isn't flammable. Second, the hose which was included was too small a diameter. There is a nozzle for a garden hose attachment which is better than a simple hose as the garden hose can be tightened and won't be easily pulled out. Finally, the app which controls the unit is a general ""Govee"" app, designed to work with a lot of Govee products. As such it requires a lot more permissions than an IOT app should have. Such as exact location, which just should never be required for any application that isn't navigation related. Perhaps it might be required for other products, but I'm not using those products so it should be allowed to be shutoff. Also, located nearby devices. This device is wifi only, not bluetooth. It should not require this permission on an ongoing basis. Unless you want to discover other nearby devices in my home, which again, shouldn't be required for this specific product.

Okay, so now that you know never to buy Frigidaire, let’s review Govee. I must say I was swayed by the Amazon coupon reducing the price but I also liked the Wi-Fi feature to monitor humidity and even change the humidity setting remotely. I love that feature. The Govee app also provides a chart graph to view humidity levels over time. I can also turn it on and off through the remote and link it to Google Home.

Dave,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2024","It’s big. For me, that’s good. It pulls a ton of water. It filled a five gallon bucket overnight in a damp basement. It overflowed into my sump pit so not sure how much it actually pulled.
This beast lives in an out of state airbnb rental so I wanted something I could control remotely and it checks that box. Been running six weeks and perfect performance so far.
My only complaint is the app is limiting in a few ways. You can run lo/med/hi or auto. Auto sets a setPoint and maintains the humidity. Low/med/hi just runs with no setPoint. So if I want to keep it on low fan and target 45%, I can’t. I Can keep fan low and it will do whatever it does forever on low (which may be much drier than 45% or it May never dry to 45%). But if I target 45% on automatic, it may ramp the fan to high or medium or low as needed. High fan disturbs the people on the first floor as it’s LOUD and the basement ceiling is not insulated.
So it works , but the interface isn’t quite what I wanted. Seems a bit of an oversight to not be able to lock it on low fan and shut it off at a target RH%.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Kumar Home,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2024","The Govee Smart Dehumidifier has been a solid addition to our house. Placed in the basement it easily covers over 4000 sq. ft. well. It efficiently keeps the area comfortable without the air feeling too dry or too humid maintaining in a very comfortable range set in the app which auto adjusted based on the current temperature for max comfort. The smart features are incredibly useful; controlling it remotely via the app has been a breeze, and pairing it with Google Home App adds a touch of unparalled convenience. The auto humidity control is reliable, and the app notifications for a full water tank are a nice touch. The 2-gallon bucket is easy to manage, but the included drain hose is a lifesaver for continuous draining. It’s energy-efficient too, with the 2023 Energy Star certification ensuring lower electricity bills. The only minor downside is the somewhat smaller hose length though this can be replaced easily if needed and is a monior inconvience. The performance more than makes up for it.

Chung Chang,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2024","3 months with no issues. App works 100% stable and connects every time. Bonus -- can adjust humidity by 1% increments in app. Humidifier control panel only allows 5% increment adjustments. App can set multiple schedules at different humidity on Auto. I set it to low 40% on Auto and it cycles on/off all day as follows: compressor + high fan -> compressor + low fan -> no compressor + low fan -> off. Only con is loud fan as most commented, but it dehumidifies really well. Keeps whole house in mid-40% humidity here in humid southeast Texas summer. Fan noise is smooth, not annoying. At night running in ensuite bathroom, fan sounds more like rain outside and doesn't wake me up. Probably can't sleep if setup in same room. Drains directly into bath tub with hose. Bucket remains bone dry so would never grow mold or mildew. Pretty much zero maintenance except for app's occasional reminder to clean filter.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Ray Ray,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2024","This is my third dehumidifier and first from Govee and the Govee dehumidifier is a lot better than the other two units from other brands. The Honeywell one lasted a long time and another brand (starts with a M) lasted only a year. First, the positives: it works well, the controls are intuitive and it is very easy to operate and drain. I would give it 5 stars but I have two concerning issues after using it for 2-3 weeks now. One is that the unit feels a lot warmer than my previous dehumidifiers after a few hours of continuous runtime. The temperature varies but there been times where it feels a little too hot and I would stop it and let it rest for a bit. The unit is in my basement so it is very cool down there in the summer so I docked a star for that. It can't be good for the lifespan of the machine if it continues to run so warm. Then for the life of me, I can't find the connector plug for the hose. Either it was not packed in the box originally or it may have fallen off when I was unpacking the machine. I can't find the plug so I can't use it with the hose that was provided for draining. Not sure if I can buy the connector separately as I do want to use the hose draining eventually.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Deniz,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2024","I recently purchased the GoveeLife Smart Dehumidifier for my basement, and I must say, it's been extremely effective in removing moisture from the air. It covers the advertised 4,500 sq.ft area efficiently, making the space more comfortable and free from dampness. The auto humidity control feature is fantastic, and being Energy Star certified for efficiency is a definite plus.
However, there is one significant downside that I've encountered. When removing the water bucket to empty it, the unit continues to drip water, leading to spills inside the machine and on my floors. This requires additional cleanup with a towel each time, which is quite inconvenient and a bit disappointing given the overall quality of the dehumidifier.
Aside from this issue, the device performs remarkably well. The WiFi connectivity for remote control and the automatic moisture adjustment system are user-friendly and add a lot of conveniences. It's just unfortunate that the water bucket design undermines the dehumidifier's otherwise excellent performance.
Despite its flaw, I would still recommend this product for its primary function of dehumidifying, but with the caveat of the leak issue when emptying the bucket. Hopefully, this can be improved in future models.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2024","Works great, app control is seamless, got my apartment humidity under control very quickly. Haven't seen a meaningful increase in energy use according to my utility company's plots, so that's a win. In ""Low"" mode it's pretty quiet, but in auto/setpoint mode it's fairly loud. I'd like to see them have the option to run the auto/setpoint mode with a way to prioritize the lowest settings possible. In my apartment I need it in my kitchen (most central place) but it's still pretty okay noise-wise. As others have said, probably about the same sound level as having a window AC unit kick on for 20 minutes every so often. I selected this model because of the app control and fairly large water tank, since I'm not able to use a direct draining hose in my unit. I empty about 1/2 tank (1 gallon) daily, so it's definitely doing its job.
At this point I've bought a number of Govee smart home products and been extremely impressed, they all seem to be well made and easy to use and look about as nice as anything else in their price range.",4.0 out of 5 stars

*Govee sent another unit that drains, it's been operating about two weeks now. So I'm glad they did that. They didn't offer any explanation as to why the first unit didn't drain. Without taking them both apart, I wouldn't be able to guess as to why.*",4.0 out of 5 stars

While the dehumidifier emits a strong airflow, some users might find it a bit loud, though personally, I find it akin to a smooth, strong breeze. In just 24 hours, it significantly reduced the humidity in a large living room from a very high 84% to a comfortable 40%. Additionally, it efficiently dried wet laundry in just a few hours.

Dingli,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2023","I recently purchased the GoveeLife Smart Dehumidifier for my large basement, and it has truly transformed the environment down there. Our basement is around 4,500 sq.ft, and managing humidity has always been a challenge. With this dehumidifier, we no longer have to worry about it.
The auto humidity control feature is a game-changer. It constantly monitors the moisture levels and adjusts itself to maintain the ideal humidity, which not only helps prevent mold and mildew but also creates a much more comfortable atmosphere.
The 2.0-gallon bucket is spacious enough to collect a significant amount of moisture before needing to be emptied, but the real magic is the included drain hose. We've connected it to a nearby floor drain, and now we don't have to worry about emptying the bucket at all – it's a true set-and-forget solution.
Setting it up on our WiFi network was straightforward, and I love being able to check and control the dehumidifier remotely through the GoveeLife app. It's convenient, especially when we're away from home.
This dehumidifier is impressively energy-efficient, and the fact that it's Energy Star certified is a bonus. It keeps our basement dry without racking up a hefty electricity bill.
In conclusion, the GoveeLife Smart Dehumidifier has made a significant difference in our basement's environment. It's efficient, user-friendly, and works perfectly in a large space. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to maintain a comfortable and dry atmosphere in their basement.

Mark S.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2024","While the device is a bit loud, it is not annoying. It is not much louder than a box fan in high. With that con out of the way I can mention the great things about this appliance.
After following all instructions and you turn the dehumidifier on for the first time and get it setup in your Govee app, you will be able to notice a significant difference in the humidity levels in the room you have it setup in. After the first night of use, when I woke up the next morning, the tank was about 3/4 full. That was from running overnight and because of how much moisture this thing pulled out of the air I was able to have an amazing nights sleep because of how comfortable it made the air.
I now keep it on auto and comfort mode so that it takes all the guesswork out of what levels to set it at. This thing is so impressive that I will be purchasing another one.
In case anyone is wondering, Govee will say that the H7151 dehumidifier will not sync with the H5160 smart sync air quality sensor, but it does in fact sync together just fine. I have my H7151 dehumidifier synced with my H5160 smart sync sensor in my room along with the H7133 heater and the H7126 air purifier.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Emptied it and let it go again. Ever since that point the notifications have come promptly, so that first time was an anomaly. The only thing I could wish for is a tank level indicator within the app, as you only get a notice when it's full. If the machine is on a different floor (upstairs, basement) you have to go check it manually. The noise level is that of an average fan.

Marcus,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2024","I had originally ordered the smaller version of Govee's dehumidifier, but I read more of the comments on it and decided to get the 2 gallon tank. I needed the bigger tank because I don't have a drain in my living room where I wanted it.
I live in Florida where its been 70-100% humidity on some hot days. As soon as I'd come inside, I would feel the wetness in the air. Allergies had also been super reactive, which is weird because I never get allergies. I ended up getting this, along with a Govee Air purifier.
Pros: Big tank
Voice control with smart home hubs
Auto mode
3-speed variable fan (quiet running on 1)
Sends notifications to phone when full
App shows graphs/charts/warnings/messages in real time
larger 2 gallon tank allows less emptying
Takes water out of air that can carry harmful bacteria and allergens
Cons
Really hard to clean tank/maintain...

My only complaint is that even at the lowest fan speed the airflow is still very strong. If you hope to place it somewhere in a living area let it quietly do its job - forget about it.

J. K. Bowman,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2024","First, it's a Govee. I own several Govee products and all of them have exceeded my expectations. When it came time to shop for a dehumidifier and I learned that GoveeLife offered two models that interested me I didn't hesitate to look here first.
I went with the larger model and I couldn't be more pleased. The smart features give me a true set it and forget it experience. It monitors ambient temperature and self adjusts itself. How handy is that! The unit comes with a very generous reservoir. There's even a smart option that reduces the number of times the compressor starts/stops. That will definitely increase life expectancy.
It operates powerfully, flawlessly, and (at least for me) quietly. I don't have my unit sitting close to the couch or in a small room. I have it in a large open room and placed far away from my seat. As a result, I actually find the sound of the unit kind of soothing. It isn't loud to me at all. If the unit was little closer, however, I don't know. It's a matter of personal taste, I guess. And distance.
Finally, I should comment on looks. I'm no interior designer, but if you want an ""attractive"" dehumidifier this one is simply stunning. The lines are clean and the finish is perfect.

Bought this in July 2023. Used it for a few months before winter. It filled up a bucket a few times, so I installed the hose. After that, the hose always seemed dry. I tried using it today in June 2024 and it isn't producing any water. I decided to pull the housing off since I can't return it anymore. I'm running it with no housing and sure enough, there is no water being produced. It's currently 61% humidity in the room and I set it to 30% as a test. I've watched one drip fall into the channel that leads to the drain/tank. The coils aren't that cold. It's still a very clean unit. No clogs.

JB,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2023","First things first: This dehumidifier took my 600 sq ft 3 foot tall slab crawlspace from 75% RH to 50% RH in under an hour. In super humid weather, it’d kick on once an hour or so to keep things at 50%. Since the weather went cold, it hasn’t come on at all.
In auto mode, it powers on when the humidity gets over 3% of what you have it set to, runs until it’s 5% under your setting, then shuts off.
The wireless setup and app are absolutely flawless. Honestly: it just works! Top scores for the app and wireless functionality. You can control every function from the app.
The energy use was actually NOT impacting my electric bill in a noticeable way, even with it kicking on hourly during the humid summer months. This was a very nice surprise.
I have it draining via the gravity hose into a floor drain. It works perfectly. I cannot comment on the water reservoir capacity.
The wheels make it easy to move around, but are sturdy enough to stay in place and not shift.
That is the good… the bad? This thing is LOUD. Like window air conditioner loud. I believe it would be an issue for those who want this in a living area.

Ray,"Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2024","We got the 4500 sq ft model for our basement which had a pretty constant 73 percent humidity level, this unit after 4 days has by far exceeded our expectations. The app that comes with it looks great and allows you to adjust it in several different ways. If you see it spinning at the top the fan is on. If it's not spinning the fan is off. Great feature. We hooked a garden hose to it to the drain in the floor so it continuously drains. The auto defrost is a definite plus. I can't speak to anything over 2000 SQ ft but I believe it would hit it's maximum target of 4500",5.0 out of 5 stars

Kimberly Conerly,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","I currently live in a rental home that is poorly insulated. In spite of my attempts to seal windows and doors, the humidity runs anywhere between 75% and 85%. I've only used it for 3 days, but it has proven to be very effective and fast at lowering the humidity. Th humidity level is now running in the high 50's - low 60's percentage range. No issues with leaking, it does exactly what it says and cuts off and will not come back on until the tank is emptied. It's not noisy at all, it's the equivalent of any household floor stand. It's has clean appearance, is compact and blends well with the decor. Highly recommend this dehumidifier.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Tyler,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023","I have tried other dehumidifying products before (like those things filled with beads you get at the dollar store) but finally decided to get a full on electric dehumidifying unit.
Felt the price was right on this one and went for it.
And I will tell you, especially with the insane summer we have been having, this product is a lifesaver.
I live in one of the most miserably humid parts of the US so AC is critical to living here. Every summer even with use leaving the AC at 80 during the day we still had power bills approaching $500 and we'd be utterly miserable during our work day as the humidity would build because the AC wasn't running much.
With this, keeping the house at 80 degrees is so much more comfortable as it helps clear the humidity that builds up from me being in a small space for my work day.
I know that might be too extreme for some of you but I think if you get this product try leaving your house at 77 or 78 and it'll feel so much better than you would expect.
And the real kicker is that I added this new appliance that runs for 8-10 hours a day but it actually has SAVED money on my electricity bill.
The reason for that is my AC is not having to work nearly as hard because it is receiving far less humid air at the intake. My power bill this previous month was $380 and the same month last year it was around $460.
This product will have paid for itself by the time cooler temps hit in late fall.
Really cannot highly recommend this unit enough.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Aunt B,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2024",This works ok. That is really as far as I will go with it. The hose that came with it was super short. I had to get a regular hose to attach to the back. It sits in an unfinished basement at my house and runs all the time. I’m not sure it actually reads the humidity level correctly. I have a separate detector as well and it is always off. It is pretty noisy. I wouldn’t want to have it somewhere I was trying to sleep or be around all the time. It’s kind of finicky as well. It has gone into defrosting mode several times since I’ve had it.,3.0 out of 5 stars
Colleen,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2023","I bought a house a while ago and the basement is damp. Like the drywall was getting soggy. Tools are rusting in the garage. Didn't know what to do.
Enter the govee dehumidifier. Got two- fast shipping, good packaging, super easy to set up. Phenomenal app.
My basement has a humidity level of over 75%. Set this guy up and within less than 8 hours it is a nice 32-35%. It isnt even loud. I am so thrilled i buy another for a workroom.
The second one has an issue. It won't recognize the bucket/thinks the bucket is full. I try a few things. Google it. Finally reach out to govee. After less than a week of troubleshooting (responsive feedback in a good frame of time) they send out a replacement. The new one works like a charm.
I ended up buying a third for my garage. I love these guys. Love that I can check them from anywhere- work, bed, making breakfast. 1 is set up to drain via tube but the other two use the built in bucket. I love the feature that sends my phone an alert when the bucket is full. If that feature didn't exist i would have to go check every day multiple times. Saves me a lot of time.
Going to set up the other 2 to drain automatically and then hopefully live knowing my basement is not a humid mess all summer.

Mitch W,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2023","I absolutely love this thing, except... it comes with a hose connector and 1ish foot hose. So I purchased a longer hose to use with the connector. It won't drain. Contacted customer service and they tell me a longer hose won't work. My opinion, don't include a hose connector if you can't swap out the hose. Just include a connected short hose, then I'll have to use a garden hose or such. Or atleast make that clear. Instead I spent another $25 dollars on a hose that is garbage now, and I don't want to be wasteful. Now I have to buy a garden hose, and HOPE that it will work. My confidence isn't high and I don't want to be down more money because of bad recommendations. Again, if you aren't using the hose, this thing is amazing.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Stephen Stifano,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2024","I purchased this dehumidifier in July, and was impressed with its operation. By the beginning of October, the unit wasn't collecting any water and the humidity level in my home kept rising. I contacted Govee Customer support through their app, and after troubleshooting didn't work, they sent me a replacement in October. The replacement unit worked very well - until mid-May, the first time the weather got more humid. Once again, this unit stopped collecting water and removing humidity. So, I contacted Govee again - and this time, after the same troubleshooting process, I was told that because they'd replaced the unit once, they couldn't help. Instead they offered a 10% refund ($24.00.) When I pointed out that I was now without $216 and a dehumidifier, they upped the refund offer to 20% ($48.00.) When I followed up to ask about the 12-month warranty, Govee customer service stopped responding through their app.
In summary: There's apparently design flaw in this unit which causes it to fail within a few months, since I'm 2 for 2 with units having this issue. Unfortunately, the second time, Govee washed their hands of me and ignored their warranty. If this is how the company treats its customers, I'd suggest you spend your money elsewhere. I'm highly disappointed, and sure do wish I had my money back.
EDIT: Govee finally agreed to send me a replacement. Assuming it gets here, I’m at least grateful that they’re standing by their product, even if this unit has issues.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Amber Morales,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2024","I wanted to love this, because we have govee all through the house, so I wanted to add this to the list of integrations. I ordered one NEW one, and it arrived with a used Frigidaire unit in a govee box. This was supposed to be new,
I ordered a replacement. It pulls a lot of water out of the air in our 1500 sf finished basement. The problem is, it released it right back into the environment. The bucket leaks. I thought we would have better luck with the hose. No, it leaks worse. I tried 3 different hoses. They all leaked, including plastic, brass and a regular brand new garden hose. I tried the plastic adapter they include with the unit. Nope. The nib was not good, and it was canted so you couldn't get a good seal Obviously, you didn't want your dehumidifier spilling water all over your floors
This would be so much better off they incorporated a pump with a thinner continuous drain. I suppose that would leak too. Bad execution. Great software but horrible crap parts on the unit",1.0 out of 5 stars
jmacks,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2024","This is my 3rd GoVee H7151 dehumidifier.
Have several properties and use dehumidifiers in all of them… have always used Frigidaire and more recently Home Labs.
Really like the Wi-Fi feature to be able to monitor temp and humidity remotely so decided to try the GoVee unit.
The first two have worked flawlessly so far, but this one has been very noisy from the day I plugged it in to the point you can’t really watch TV or sleep if you’re in the vicinity.
It has a metallic vibration that sounds like a compressor problem so past noise, really concerned about durability?
I thought it being a defective unit, that GoVee would replace it, but after a phone call and several emails over the course of days they sent me a video of a unit from their showroom saying the noise was acceptable not even acknowledging the noisy compressor!!
I have two other GoVee units, so know how they should sound.
Very disappointed with GoVee customer service in not standing behind their product.
Should have read the reviews on this unit better as it appears noise has been a problem with these units.
I’m hoping Amazon customer service will do something about this defective unit.

Jeff B.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2024","Unit was packed like new, I do not believe it's used. Left upright for 24 hours after delivery, plugged it in, added it to my other Govee products via the app, set desired humidity level and was hoping to be in business except the fan never turned on. The compressor turned on and the unit got very warm very quickly, but it never turned on and never pulled water out of the air and into the bucket. 1 star for packaging and ease of adding it to the Govee app/Google Home, but that's where the features I could use end. Amazon can't directly replace because inventory is fluctuating, so I'm guessing my issue isn't unheard of. Was offered a solution via Amazon customer chat, but hoping Govee remedies the situation first. Reached out to Govee support via the app and hoping for a quick replacement. I did find that by holding the power and fan buttons (Smart Dehumidifier Max) down together for 5 seconds, you can reset the unit to factory. This did not help, nor did removing it from the app and re-adding it. Pretty disappointed because I know that Govee's lighting products are great.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Brian Sterling,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024","The only reason we're buying a dehumidifier is to cut down on the heat and humidity, right? Put this in a 600 sq ft bedroom, and came back 2 hours later. The temperature in the room had gone from 75 degrees to EIGHTY-FIVE degrees, while only reducing the humidity from 55% to 50%. It pumps out HOT air at a significant rate. Has to crush your house AC and electric bill. Tried putting it in our garage to see if it was usable anywhere in the house, same thing, garage went from 77 degrees to 86 degrees.
I will say, the app and interface are nice, and it did fill the tank in a matter of hours, so it was pulling water out of the air, but I'm not sure why this product is even a thing if it raises the temperature so badly. Makes any room not livable.",1.0 out of 5 stars

So the company opted to refund us instead of sending us another replacement. Ended up costing me $10 for the junk truck to pick them up. There’s a reason why Govee is not selling these on their website. Sadly, they’re selling these pieces of junk. They end up breaking down within a few months on Amazon, knowing that they are junk. To change a sensor on this dehumidifier, the Freon has to be replaced as well.

This dehumidifier works fast and great! It is not all that quiet but that is fine because it's in my basement. It has pulled so much moisture out of the air, it's crazy! I love the smart connection and the humidity control and speed control!

Now the tower won't seal with the base and instantly starts leaking when the base fills up with water. The whole fkin 7 liters leaked out when I tried to start using it again. And their 4l version is absolute garbage as I bought one of those as well. That thing gives you error messages the base isn't connected properly and shuts itself Off. It would take me DAYS to adjust it every 15-30 minutes so it would turn back on... to find just the right angle and it would run fine. Until the moment you needed to clean it and you get to start all over again.

Joseph Martini,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2023","I have put together a smart home and this dehumidifier was tempting for that very reason. Setup and integration was very easy. I even purchased the hygrometer to pair with the unit and all seemed great. I waited the recommended settling time to turn it on. The positive: it really does get the moisture out of the air and lowers the humidity. It has a large tank and it's impressive when dumping it out 1 to 2 times per day depending on humidity and how hard you run it. The app works great at remote controlling and monitoring as well. It even works with Alexa.
That's where the fairytale ends :( The biggest downside which trumps all the positive is that this units compressor is way too loud!! So loud the kids ask to turn it off when watching TV and that's with the fan on level one. I asked if the compressor was supposed to be that loud on Amazon, but nobody including Govee responded. I'm really disappointed because I wanted to integrate this into my smart home setup. My mother in law has a 4,000 SQF non-smart dehumidifier and it's very quiet.

Dylan,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2024","This is a competitively priced dehumidifier with a good app to go along with it! The automatic setting is particularly effective in bringing down the ambient humidity levels. When used with in the low/medium/high settings, however, I found that the fans will turn on, but the compressor/evaporator will remain inactive 50% of the time; thus having no impact on humidity regardless of how long the unit runs for. The low setting is quite acceptable from a volume standpoint. High/medium/auto is around 55-58 decibels which isn't too bad, but it is certainly noticeable if you're in the same room. Also it would be nice if the auto setting could use the low fan speed on the app. Perhaps an update would be able to fix this.

We live in South Florida so I ordered this product to help the ac during the summer high humidity. I choose this because we already have Govee products and we can connect it to the thermometers.
Pros
It worked and eliminated 2 bucket under 24 hours.
Very easy to use the application and set up the mashine. I connected to the thermometer that we use in the living room
-Very laud. Especially during the night. But furing the day we can't be around it. Disturbing laud.
Maybe it's perfect in a big basement or big 3000 sqf house far from the living area but not in a small one. If it turns on you wake up.
-I used the Auto function for 1 week. It's creating extra heat. (2-3F up) That means it's heating up the house and gives the ac extra during the already crazy summer heat. The only way to use if I set up ""Low"" vents so the other function just unnecessary. Result: the power consumption was very high in both way so I don't see any benefits of this equipment.

App OMI is fine, only nit is that it does not tell you the water level, only when you max out. The app also logs the daily, weekly humidity management which is a nice +.
My only disappointment is that if using the self drain feature, the run to the sump has to be short - maybe 1.5 meters max. I’m trying to run about 7-8 meters via a garden hose and there’s not enough head to get the water out. If it can’t drain the water it just backs up into the reservoir. I’m trying to get around that by placing the unit on a table to get some additional head.

Bart D,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2023","This is a great dehumidifier. We have this on our main floor and a h0me in our basement. They are both great, but for the money, this one is loaded. The notifications for full tank were a life saver. I would say it is fairly loud. We had close to TV in living room and always have to increase the volume when running.
- Wifi feature and notifications are AWESOME
- Def dehumidifies and does it fairly quick
- Smart Adjustment feature is nice and usually results in less run time
- Govee app is a bit immature. Would like to see that improved. Feels like a circus app or something. Hard to explain
- Not the quietest, so leave out of main rooms",5.0 out of 5 stars
kindle fire user,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2023",Product arrived in good condition and on time. Packaging was sturdy and substantial enough to keep unit from being damaged. So far unit is working well. So happy to find a dehumidifier that would pair with WiFi. Only glitch that I had connecting it with the app was the fact that it only works with a 2.4GHz network and I was running 5GHz. They at least do mention this in the instructions. I had to get my internet provider involved to help me split the signal on the modem. Was glad to be able to do that and everything else in the home is still working good but it was definitely time consuming to get through this. Other than that I really like the unit thus far. I am using the continuous draining feature and was able to use the hose that came with it. It’s really short but I have my unit sitting next to a utility sink on a shelf so the length of the hose was not an issue. Hope this unit has a long life. We shall see.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Mandy,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2024","I was skeptical at first because I didn’t see a bunch of reviews, but this machine really is amazing! Our basement gets a lot of moisture in it and that causes the whole house to smell very musty. I put this machine down there and it didn’t take long for the smell to go away and it’s also very handy that I can turn it on and off from my phone with the Bluetooth feature. We have been using it for a few weeks now so I just hope it keeps up and lasts for a while. Worth the money in my opinion.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JC,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2023","I've been through four dehumidifiers for my basement so far. First purchase was an off brand. It worked great but unfortunately would never auto-off. I returned and went with a higher quality Fridegare dehumidifier. It worked great for exactly a year then was defective. I replaced with another under warranty and exactly the same issue a year later. I decided to go with a refurbished Hisense. This works well but won't keep an accurate humidity reading and would run more often than not. Here comes the Govee.
I hooked it up to my WIFI and was able to easily set my humidity level. I can even link with my other Govee humidity readers for more consistent readings. Running great so far and only about 50% less then my other one while keeping my humidity at a decent level. For my basement I keep at 55.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Terri21,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2023","It has been a great buy, a bit noisy but definitely worth the money. It keeps the basement dry, helps with air circulation (the fan probably is what causes the excessive noise) and when I hang clothes in the basement to dry, it does a great job in drying them quickly. It replaced essentially the dryer, by consuming less energy and keeping the basement dry too. Before I spent more money to dry clothes with the dryer and had humid basement. now with this item I can dry both the basement and the clothes at the same time!",5.0 out of 5 stars

M. Huarng,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024","Prior to this, I have a few Govee heaters that I integrated into Home Assistant. I needed some dehumidification in my basement and my Midea dehumidifier died after less than a year and less than a summer season. This was easy to setup and I connected my existing hose for continuous draining mode so I don't have to empty into a bucket. Setup was very easy through the app and able to bring the humidity down quickly. Appreciate the charts for trends and integrated into Home Assistant through the govee mqtt integration via HACS. Otherwise for longevity will see how long it lasts and will update my review accordingly.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Victor R. Volkman,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2024","Exceeded all my expectations. The wifi connection was super easy because of the Bluetooth handoff. The programming is so easy, easier than my dumb Nest thermostat system for sure. All my buys will be Goveee going forward",5.0 out of 5 stars
