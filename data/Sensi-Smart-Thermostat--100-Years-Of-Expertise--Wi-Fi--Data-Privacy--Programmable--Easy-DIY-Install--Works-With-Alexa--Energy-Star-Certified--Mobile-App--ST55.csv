Mel,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019","I was looking for a smart thermostat without breaking the bank and without the need for any fancy features like self learning based on your habits for example. Got a good deal on the Sensi and decided to try it out. I downloaded the app before purchasing and was able to check my existing wiring to see if the Sensi was compatible for my system. The app is simple and goes through the all the necessary steps for set up. You will need the C wire for this thermostat.

Once I confirmed compatibility, and after delivery, following the instructions on the app took me through the process of removing the old thermostat and installing the Sensi. It was a very easy and logical process which even a novice at home improvement can follow. The only slight hitch in setting up the system was ensuring that the wire connection was secure - a couple of the wires came loose after I thought I had screwed them in. Really not a big deal but I gently tugged on the wires to ensure that they were not loose. The Sensi thermostat attaches to The wall by clipping into the wall plate that is provided. Luckily for me the old wall plate holes were in the right spot for the new Sensi wall plate. Before clipping the thermostat on ensure that the wires are flush with the wall as instructed by the app.

Connecting to WiFi was fairly easy and it was done through the app on my iPhone. The thermostat is only compatible with 2G WiFi so you have to make sure your phone is connected to the 2G network while going through this part of the setup if you have a dual band router (you can switch your phone back to the 5G network after if you wish). WiFi connection was made quickly although the thermostat did take 30 or so seconds to be fully responsive to my phone after I thought the connection was completed (I initially thought I needed to go through a troubleshooting process but did not need to complete that process).

Once fully connected you can easily adjust temperatures in the app, set up schedules and use a variety of options e.g. display humidity etc. There is also a geofencing option if you wish to use that. I set up my iPhone to be able to use Siri to adjust temperatures. You’ll need to set up your iPhone Home app for that. Once again the app runs you through all the steps to do that. I also set up my wife’s phone for her to have the feature that allows her to use Siri. Initial attempts to set her Home app to connect with the thermostat using Siri were unsuccessful until I realized that I could simply share my iPhone Home app settings with hers (just had to make sure to switch to the shared home app profile and not the original default one on her phone). If you do not wish to use Siri you can simply use the controls in the Sensi app and do not have to go though the Home app set up.

I’ve had the thermostat for a week now and I love it. The thermostat is very responsive to changes made within the Sensi app or when using Siri (usually within 1-2 seconds). I also like that I can view ‘Usage’ within the app to see how long the furnace has been active. The app will also allow you to check to see if you are eligible for rebates based on energy savings programs for your area.

Of course if you need to change app settings on the thermostat itself it is very easy to do so. There is a feature in the app that allows you to lock the wall display and only be able to change settings, temps etc through the app if you do not want people to change temps or settings through the wall display.

Overall a great thermostat. Easy setup. Easy to use. Great features. Very responsive when using your phone. 5 stars plus!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Brandi,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2020","We've had this thermostat a month and I really like it so far. It makes me think our old thermostat wasn't actually working for a long time before it started setting itself to 85°. Since it wasn't even programmable, I knew it had to go and if I was going to upgrade I may as well go with something just a bit more...modern than a set-temp-and-it-stays-unless-you-change-it thermostat. I'm going to do pros and cons below. I do want to say, I took my old thermostat off the wall first, wrote down all the wire colors and the letter each was connected to on a piece of paper. The app removes the need for pen and paper. I just used my pen and paper to place the flags mentioned below on the correct wires.

Pros:
1. This thing is super easy to install. Open the box and there are instructions for you to download the Sensi app. Once the app is downloaded it has you choose which letter slots you have wires connected to (R, RH, C, E, OB, etc.). The app then tells you how to use the flags they provide to label the wires. For example I had a wire that went into a slot labeled ""R"", but Sensi only had ""RH"" and ""RC"" (I think it was RC), so the app told me which R my wire needed to go in. Not having any electrical wiring experience, the app was SUPER helpful. It even had you take a picture of your wiring to save to your phone, just in case.

2. The piece that attaches to the wall has a built in level. I am super annoyed when things aren't straight on walls, so this right here, was awesome.

3. The app is really easy to set up. I just have a daytime and nighttime cycle, but I could set up all kinds of things super easily. Vacation modes, turning the AC up when I leave the house... It was great. It even walked me through how to sync the app with my Google assistant and the Samsung Smart Things app, which I didn't end up continuing to use. (See cons #1)

4. The report that tells you how long your AC is running is really helpful as well, especially since we had issues last year with it not being able to keep up. We have better insulation and updated windows and it's nice to see they are working, even when it's 99° with a heat index at 112°. (See cons #2)

5. I like that you can do things like temp and humidity offsets, have the AC turn on to help maintain proper humidity levels (we live in Florida, so this is a big thing for me), change the cycle rate (ended up choosing this one over another brand because people had issues with not being able to adjust the cycle rate on that one), and easily turn heat boost on or off. (See cons #3)

Cons:
1. It doesn't work with Bixby. This is something I don't really understand, but I'm guessing they assume if you're gonna use Bixby you use Smart Things? But I can just use Google for that instead.

2. The recent usage section only shows how long the AC ran that day, not which times it ran or how long at a time it ran. It would be nice to see how long the AC was running at a time, especially in the afternoon when it gets really hot. I have not yet gotten a monthly report since I got the thermostat mid-June and it's now mid-July. Interested to see what the monthly report looks like at the end of the month.

3. Sometimes I had to change settings a couple times before they ""stuck"". I found after changing a setting I needed to wait a few seconds before returning to the settings menu and that helped.

4. Shortly after I got the thermostat the AC drain line clogged. This resulted in my app/thermostat constantly saying cooling was on, but the AC wasn't running. My usage for that day was like 21hrs, but I know it wasn't actually on for the majority of that. Not really a huge issue, but you won't have an accurate reading for that day.

Summary:
Overall, this is a really amazing unit and I have been really glad to have it. It was seriously a breeze to instakl and set up and functions well. I do wish I could connect it to Bixby without using Smart Things and I do wish I had a more detailed daily usage report, but those are very small inconveniences. I normally keep our house at 78° during the day and 77° at night and sometimes that feels cold. I would often feel hot before and wondered if our AC was not working correctly, but it would seem it was actually the thermostat. Very happy with this purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Mister M,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2021","This Sensi thermostat is waaaaaaaaaaay better than Honeywell. The Honeywell software and their mentality is completely OUT OF WACK and their thermostats are pure garbage and it will damage your equipment. The Honeywell Cycle rate is set to about .5+/- so my furnace now in the winter has been running and running nonstop and my furnace was not getting any rest. That is a very bad thing for our heating and A/C system, not to mention the gas and electricity bill. I called Honeywell tech support and they told me that ALL their thermostats have this fixed setting and there is nothing in the menu for us to change that option. Something is really wrong with this Honeywell company and this cycle rate setting is simply inappropriate.

I just installed my new Emerson Smart Sensei and even the WI-FI connectivity process went very smoothly and I successfully connected my new thermostat. The Sensi app takes you thru the entire process fairly quickly and is very easy I have no idea what other people are having problems with. Note that I already knew which cables to connect so if you don't know that's a different story. The Honeywell thermostat on the other hand was a nightmare to install thru the app and it simply doesn't work so I had to go to my desktop PC and finish the process there. Really annoying.

And guess what I found out? The Sensi app itself has the options for me to change the Cycle rates to either SLOW, MEDIUM or FAST that was awesome I could not believe it!!! :-) Sensi was so smart by not putting this option in a hidden menu. Honeywell Engineers and marketing department simply don't know what they are doing. I'm looking forward in seeing how my new Sensi thermostat will perform tonight and I'm sure it won't disappoint. This device looks really great on the wall as well. The Honeywell WI-FI cost me $79 on sale and this Sensi costs more but is TOTALLY worth it!

The only thing I didn't like is that a day before purchasing this device I contacted Sensi tech support and took one entire hour to pick up the phone and someone from the Philippines picked up the phone eventually. This is not acceptable. Other than that I completely recommend this thermostat.

UPDATE: This Emerson Sensi Smart thermostat is definitely a superior product. Only while running it in one day you can see and hear the difference. I set the cycle rate to SLOW and boy what a difference! The thermostat outputs the heat in a very smooth way and when the it reaches the set temperature it stops for several minutes and it DEFINITELY does not restart in 30 seconds like the Honeywell ones. I have no idea what problems others are having that complain saying this thermostat doesn't work but I can tell you that is not the case. The software and hardware is really well made and nice looking as well. I prefer this Sensi to those ugly round looking ""high tech"" and over priced thermostats.",5.0 out of 5 stars
music on vinyl,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2019","Very happy with multiple Sensi wi-fi smart thermostat installations. Well implemented app and easy to follow directions for various types of applications. If you don’t have a “C” wire, it’s relatively easy to add one. You need a 24 volt plug in transformer (about $14 on Prime), and some thermostat wiring. The transformer and 2 wire thermostat wire are independent from your furnace and other thermostat wiring. You just connect one end of the two wires to the transformer, and the other end of the two wires to the correct terminals on the thermostat, and plug the transformer into a traditional electrical outlet. Your existing thermostat wiring just gets transferred to the matching terminal markings on the Sensi. Great flexibility with settings and programming with the user friendly app. Controlling and monitoring your temperature and thermostat from anywhere remotely is very handy. Great way to jump into the smart house scene.

Edit 1/26/2020

I think I may have discovered the reason so many people are having issues with their Sensi installs and the constant Wi-Fi connection problems.
I have four Sensi smart thermostats that I've installed over the course of about a year. The first three installs were very straightforward. Those units have all performed perfectly from the day I installed them. Not a single dropped Internet connection or any other issues. The Sensi mobile app is great, and provides amazing control over programming and controlling the thermostats. I have purchased eight of the Sensi thermostats, but have only installed half of them so far. Most of the units I've purchased have been returns that I've bought for about half price online. Most of them have been registered previously with Sensi. It isn't difficult to have them unregistered through an email request that the app prompts you to do. The two caveats are that you will not have remote access or be able to complete the setup of the thermostat until you are able to register it to your account. The thermostat will still function locally like a traditional thermostat, so that's good. The other problem is that  Emerson / Sensi is painfully slow processing requests to unregister thermostats. Count on at least two weeks. You will have to return to the location of the thermostat to finish registering the unit once Emerson gives you the confirmation they unregistered your thermostat. This is the price of buying a returned unit at half price.
The fourth Sensi install has been difficult. I revisited the Amazon listing for the Sensi thermostats. I was hoping to find some answers to my install problems from some of the reviews on Amazon. I was quite surprised on the number of newer negative reviews. I originally chose the Sensi because of the positive reviews online and on Amazon.
I was having a couple of different issues with the install of my fourth Sensi. Each of my installs were unique as they were for different types of heating and cooling units. Most of my installs were for heat only, including the fourth one. The fourth install was for a Modine warehouse style heater. This required 4 wires. Red heat (Rh), White (W/E), Common (C), and Fan (G). I tested the C (common) with a multi-meter. and I was getting right around 26 volts (correct voltage). Testing is done with the Red lead to Rh and the Black lead to C. The C wire completes the connection and provides constant power to the thermostat to power the Wi-Fi Internet connection. I've seen some comments about not needing a C wire for the Sensi. This may be true, but you will eat through batteries if you rely on them to keep power for the Wi-Fi connection. Technically, you do need a C wire for reliable remote access.
My issues included constant dropping of the Wi-Fi and inconsistent operation of the heater and blower / fan. I did check all of the setup parameters for type of heating unit, etc through the app. Everything was set correctly. The Wi-Fi network that this Sensi is connected to is super stable, and has two other Sensi thermostats that maintain reliable connections through Wi-Fi. The issue with the fan I was having is that unless I switched the setting for fan to ""on"", the heat would not kick on. The correct setting on the thermostat for the fan would be ""auto"". When set to ""on"", the fan stays on even when the unit is not heating. If I set my fan setting for ""auto"", the heater would not kick on.
I was fairly confident I had my wiring correct at both the thermostat and at the transformer on the heater side. It's harder to be certain on the transformer / heater side, because the terminal markings are not consistent from manufacturer to manufacturer. I was lucky enough to find a photo online of the terminal markings and what they represented for my exact Modine unit with the same transformer. I was starting to think that this Sensi unit was defective (like many others do based on negative reviews). I did do some wire swapping, but always ended up back where I started regarding the wiring arrangement. Voltages were all reading accurately at the thermostat. I had the face of the unit on and off from the back plate / wall mount many times. On one occasion, while guiding the thermostat back onto the wall mount, I was applying some upward pressure and heard some electrical clicking at the heater as though it was about to kick on. That was my ""Aha"" moment. The pins that coincide with the thermostat wiring on the main unit / face plate and the related pin openings on the wall mount were not making a good connection. They briefly made a decent connection when I put some increased pressure on the thermostat / face plate. I was able to recreate this heater clicking reaction by pushing on the thermostat. I wasn't certain exactly where the connection was failing (which wire or pin), but I tried a couple of things, and they seemed to have fixed my issues. The first is that I shimmed the back plate away from the wall with a small strip of cardboard behind each end of the back plate and the wall. This would allow the thermostat face plate a little more travel on the wall mount side (deeper seating of the pins). The second thing I did was to go over each thermostat wire where they connect to the back plate / wall mount and reinserted them and made sure that the screws that hold each wire in were very tightly drawn down on each wire. This fixed the fan issue (I was able to set the fan to ""auto"" and have it turn on and off with the heater). This also fixed the Wi-Fi dropping issue. I'm still waiting for Emerson / Sensi to unregister this particular thermostat, and I will revise my review with an update once I have remote access and can confirm these fixes have remained stable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jim Healy,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2024","The reviews conflict as t whether or not this unit requires a ""C"" wire (Common wire). As stated in the product literature, in my installation, a ""C"" wire WAS NOT required.

Installation to replace a previous thermostat was easy; took all of 15 minutes. WiFi access will be helpful in my installation, and it works well with the app. The app is just a remote interface that's identical to the unit face itself.

A couple of days after installation, I got a warning that the temperature of the room was more than 5 degrees above the set temp. The A/C was running, but not keeping up. Traced that to a clogged air filter, but I appreciated the warning message.

Yes, I recommend this unit for price point and function.",5.0 out of 5 stars
M. Yates,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2022","I moved to the East coast last December. We have a six-zone boiler heating system with baseboard heaters throughout 4,200 sq. ft., on three floors (not bragging, just trying to give an idea of the size and complexity of the system). With six old-school manual thermostats spread throughout the house, it was nearly impossible to evenly regulate the heat during the cold winter, so some rooms were very cold and others too warm. I found myself constantly going up and down stairs to monitor temperatures and make sure I wasn't wasting heat or keeping areas too cold that would affect other zones.

My boiler was installed in 2007, so it isn't very old and it's very efficient. However, it's a two-wire system with no C-wire, so the fact that 99.9% of ""smart"" thermostats on the market require a C-wire to operate was very frustrating.

I stumbled across the Emerson ST55 and saw in the description that it could work either with or without a C-wire, so I called Emerson tech support to make sure before I plunked down hundreds of dollars on six thermostats that might not work. Tech support confirmed my fears that it would not work without a C-wire despite the Amazon description, so I kept hunting.

Fortunately I found a YouTube review of the ST55 and the owner said he had been successfully using it with the same kind of two-wire system that I have for over two years. So I figured I'd buy one and see if it worked. Worst case, I'd send it back for a refund.

The instructions inside the box clearly state that it will not work without a C-wire, but I ignored them and kept going. With only two wires it was a breeze to install. I put in the batteries, snapped it into the wall plate, downloaded the app, created an account and was ready for testing in about 15 minutes.

I'm not sure if it's just my system or all boilers, but I didn't realize it doesn't turn on instantly when the thermostat temperature is raised above the existing temperature. So when I first tested it, I was bummed that it didn't work. But as I walked downstairs to the boiler, it was running! So I did some more testing, and found that there's about a 20-25 second delay between increasing the temp and the boiler kicking in.

Granted it's only been a couple months since I got it, but I've played with it plenty and it's working great. Instead of a C-wire, the thermostat is powered by two AA batteries. The guy in the video said he's been using the same regular alkaline batteries for two years and they're still at 90% charge capacity, which is awesome. But I figure that even if I have to replace batteries every year, 12 AA batteries is a helluva lot cheaper than paying an electrician to rewire all six zones!

On top of the six heat zones, I also have two central AC units. Thankfully those have C-wires, but I'm going to replace those thermostats with the Emerson ST55 also so that I'll have full control of all heating and cooling from one simple-to-use app. With any luck it'll go on sale on Prime Day so that I can save some money! :-)

I can't speak to the Alexa integration as I don't use that functionality. But plenty of other reviewers have said it works fine.

I appreciate Emerson's thoughtfulness in adding a built-in level to the back plate. I'm a stickler about things being mounted straight, so it was nice to not have to break out a level to make sure I didn't mount it crooked.

As for aesthetics, the ST55 is nice. It's not too large to look obnoxious, but it has a good-sized display. And I'm not sure if it's just because I'm running it on battery, but the back light doesn't stay on constantly, so it doesn't light up a dark room at night (not too important in common areas, but important if you've got a thermostat in a bedroom).

So, to make a long story short, don't believe Emerson. This thing really does work on a two-wire boiler heat system with no need for a C-wire!",5.0 out of 5 stars
James W.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2020","(Long, but I hope worth the read) Overall, I am extremely happy with the Emerson Sensi smart thermostat. For me it was a pretty easy project, but it is important that you know what type of cooling/heating system you have prior to attempting the installation. Although the basic installation is made very simple using the Sensi app, there were some very important things not covered. I suggest you check out how to configure your Sensi on their site (Configuring Thermostat | Sensi US (emerson.com)). I’m a pretty good DIYer, but have very little experience with AC/heating systems. I was 99% sure I had a heat pump setup, but I called a local AC technician I know to confirm and am glad I did. Having installed a few smart thermostats, to include this one, he not only confirmed I had a heat pump, he also informed me I would have to go into the system settings on the thermostat and change the outside setting from ‘AC1’ to ‘HP1’. This was confirmed when I checked out the Sensi website. Armed with this information, installation went without a hitch and I was up and running in no time.
Pros:
- Easy to install, if you have a little DIY experience, all the information needed concerning your AC/Heating system and gather the additional information before starting.
- Very easy to connect to WiFi and integrate with Google Home. Connected to my WiFi with in seconds following the instructions; when I opened my Google Home app, there was an icon to add Sensi, clicked on it and moved the thermostat to the appropriate room. I have not experienced any drop-offs or loss of the WiFi, even when I turned off my WiFi for a few hours, removed the batters or installed old, weak batteries as tests; in every case, the thermostat remained connected or automatically connected right back up in seconds with no need to go through the WiFi setup operations again.
- The Sensi app, in addition to walking you through the installation, allows you to set up various cooling/heating programs to run automatically, as well as change other settings. Once added to Google Home, you can switch programs (cool, heat, auto), turn it on/off and set the temp. You can also use voice commands through Google to do this as well.
- The ability to adjust the thermostat to compensate for temperature offsets. In my case, where my thermostat is located the temp registers about 3 degrees off from what it is in our master bedroom or living room. I simply adjusted the offset in the Sensi app to compensate for this and now our bedroom and living room remain closer to the set temp then they have in the past.
- It can be operated manually by those less tech savvy. The controls on the face plate look and operate like those on our old ‘conventional’ one. I also like that you can lock out the manual operation from the app so that no one else can mess with the settings; like during the holidays when you have family members over who feel they can change the settings without asking .. lol.
- Being able to adjust the system cycling rates. There are three settings (short, medium, and long) that can be set independently for heat, heat aux and cooling. I don’t mind having my temps vary a degree before the system cycles back on, so I have all mine set to long; during the summer, I may switch cooling to short to see how much of a difference it makes.

Con: I only have one and it is the reason for my 4 rating. The instructions, at least those in the box, should include information on the additional settings that may need to be needed depending on the AC/heating system you have. At a minimum, they should inform you that you may need to make additional setting changes and where to find the instructions online.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Richard,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2018","Purchased this model based on the good reviews and the no requirement for a c-wire. Decided to replace my 17-year old RobertShaw thermostat (t-stat) because I wanted remote capability. I was hesitant to touch A/C wiring whereas I had no experience with A/C wiring. The A/C company wanted $90.00 to install it, but I decided to do it myself since it was just a 4-wire system. (no c-wire). It took me just 15 min to remove the old, and then install/wire up the new t-stat. That's how easy it was. Was able connect the t-stat to my 2Ghz wifi network and used the Sensi app on my mobile. Everything worked just fine. No issues at all with wifi setup and using the app. It works exactly as designed.
You can make t-stats adjustments either by wifi or LTE on your mobile. No delay in signal. My wifi has never lost signal and has stayed up now for 1 week.

The t-stat itself (on wall) has very few settings. Just has temp control, fan/auto/heat/cool and wifi settings. All other settings are done via your mobile. There is also a light switch at the top of the t-stat that when pressed, stays on for 10 seconds, then turns off. BTW: The t-stat light is always off until you press any button. LCD screen is very easy to read with or without the light.

One of my requirements for a t-stat was to have a differential as to how much longer a unit will run once it hits its set temp. This model does not have a adjustable value, but does have a ""cycle rate"" of slow/medium/fast. I set mine to slow to keep it from turning on/off too many times. From the measurements I have taken with a infrared thermometer, the ""slow"" cycle has a differential of 0.7 degrees. This seems to be inline with what Emerson says (actually, they say within 1 degree).

Important note: If your home loses internet access, you will NOT be able to control the t-stat, even when you are at home on your local intranet. Some systems still let you access your devices via the local intranet, but this t-stat require cloud access 24x7.
Now, in case your t-stat screen is locked, and you lose internet connection, you have no way to do any changes on the wall unit since the screen is locked and your mobile is the only way to unlock it. In this case, Emerson has a key sequence you can press on the wall unit to unlock the display. (btw: the screen lock is a feature that you enable on the t-stat to prevent people from making changes on the wall unit)

Small issues:
The light switch at the top of the t-stat is hard to find and press. I never hit it on the first attempt. Always have to feel around at the top and press hard.

There is one problem I constantly hit. I goto my Sensi app and change any setting (temp, lock/unlock screen). The Sensi app accepts the setting changes, so you think all is good. However, when I look at the t-stat on the wall, no changes occurred (see attached picture). This has happened numerous times each day since I have had it. Called support and they are not aware of any issues. In each failure, my wifi signal is up - no problems with wifi.
After a few days of this happening, I see the problem. It does not appear to be the t-stat, but rather the Sensi app itself. It somehow is hung up, but gives the appearance that it is operating. If I kill the app, and restart it, the sync up to the t-stat is working again. Each time that the app behaves this way, I just kill and restart it. Works every time. So, each time I use the app to make a setting change, i just kill the app and restart when I need it.

The accuracy of the t-stat is pretty accurate (within 0.5 degrees of my infrared thermometer)

Overall, love the product. I can easily control my t-stats from my mobile or directly from the wall. Makes life very easy now. BTW: Works great with Google Assistant. I use my Android phone to adjust temperature settings (i.e. Hey Google: Set the temperature to 70 degrees"")

Update: 12/10/18:
Product has worked flawlessly. No issues at all with wifi connectivity. Never had a dropped connection. Both wifi and 4G LTE connections always connect just fine. When making thermostat changes on your cell phone (wifi or 4G LTE), changes take effect within a couple seconds. Also, the problem mentioned above regarding the app freezing when your cell gets out of sleep mode, this has been fixed a while ago in an updated Sensi app. All around, everything works great. Love this product - makes it very convenient to remotely control your AC.

Update: 3/1/2020
Everything has worked flawless. Still have original Energizer AA batteries (full bars). Never had any LTE/Wifi connectivity issues.

Update: 4/2/2021: Not a single problem. Works flawlessly.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jim & Renae,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2019","We wanted a new thermostat for several reasons. The old Honeywell was working fine but it had several deficiencies. First, it was too easy for our grandson to change the settings. And the display was hard to read unless you stooped right in front of it. And the programming was a nuisance.

Searching for a thermostat with screen lockout we discovered that none of the good ole Honeywell residential thermostats have this feature. So we moved-on to almost-as-good - almost-as-old Emerson which has this feature on most of their residential products. Out utility company offers a $25 rebate on programmable thermostats and a $100 rebate on WiFi thermostats. With a Prime Day price of $75 this thermostat is basically free. However we were concerned by all the complaints about setup and network problems. So here is what we found.

The good -

1) Excellent manual controls and screen visibility, copied from the refined design of the legacy Emerson line. Most other WiFi thermostats have too much screen clutter in the attempt to eliminate buttons. Old-fashioned buttons really are better for the most common functions even if they don't look stylish.

2) You can control almost anything you want from your smart phone - after you complete setup.

3) You can configure this thermostat to work with almost any kind of HVAC system.

4) You have plenty of flexibility to create multiple programs with as many or as few schedule steps as you wish. For example you can have separate schedules for when you are home, when you are gone temporarily, when you are gone for months at a time. Some reviewers have complained about the difficulty of programming your schedule. Maybe Sensi have improved the app, but I found it reasonably easy to program, given the flexibility.

The bad -

1) The WiFi setup is very finicky. Were I not an engineer with many years of experience with communications equipment I might well have floundered. Common security features in WiFi routers can defeat your efforts. I would note that I recently installed a smart sprinkler controller that is completely programmed from my smart phone and has full remote access capability. WiFi setup was a breeze. I did not have to touch my WiFi router configuration at all. Sensi could do a lot better.

2) The manuals. Yes Sensi, some people do read manuals. Once you get past the simpleton stuff yours are rather poor. ""See the App"" (which has limited help on some topics) is not a good answer. Things like a list of the menu options and what they do - would be very helpful. The other Emerson thermostats have good manuals - so should yours.

3) Don't bother to call Sensi tech support. You will spend a lot of time on-hold and you might never actually talk to a human. And the support web site was almost as slow. The information is there but you have to be a pro to understand the more detailed stuff. Sensi needs to beef-up their tech support and/or produce a good tutorial on how to connect to a WiFi network. And if they had to write a good tutorial, they might improve their software to make things easier for their customers.

4) I found it necessary to change almost every default setting. Many of the complaints about the performance of this thermostat, arise from not bothering to check every last setting in the app. Better defaults would result in fewer complaints. This problem is confounded by lack of a list of menus and options in the user manuals. If you do not browse carefully through the app, you might miss the setting that you find most annoying.

5) You can control virtually everything else but not the fan schedule. A simple ""Fan On or Auto"" check box in each schedule step would be great.

The gory details -

If you have read this far, you might want to benefit from some of my experience setting-up this device for my network.

1) First let me explain my network setup. Basically my network has a less-trusted domain and a more-trusted domain. In the less-trusted domain sit my smart TVs, Game controllers, a laser printer that anyone can use, VoIP and media gateways, smart home sprinkler and thermostat controllers, etc. In the more-trusted domain sit my server, laptops, a color laser printer, and a very few other devices.

2) Between my cable modem and my less-trusted domain sits a simple but bullet-proof Ubiquity firewall router/switch. Hanging-off the Ubiquity switch in the less-trusted domain, are a VoIP gateway, a WiFi router/switch, a printer and a guest Ethernet port.

3) The WiFi router/switch serves as a second firewall between the less-trusted and the more-trusted domains. The WiFi hub has both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz channels, with separate private and guest access, for a total of 4 SSIDs. The router steers the guest SSIDs to the less-trusted domain and the private SSIDs to the more-trusted domain. The private and guest SSIDs have different WiFi access codes (passwords) so both domains are ""secure"" (in the WiFi sense).

4) By default the guest WiFi clients cannot see each other on the less-trusted domain. This is a common security feature in WiFi routers that support guest access. And it is one of the features that trips-up installation of the Sensi thermostat, but not my smart sprinkler controller.

5) Observing the network interaction between the Sensi app on my smart phone, the Sensi thermostat on the wall, and my WiFi router, at some times the app and the thermostat are operating point-to-point over the WiFi and sometime via the router. So-far so-good. This is expected behavior. However some of the router traffic uses LAN (Layer 2) addresses and some uses IP (Layer 3) addresses. This mixture can mess things up if the network is not configured exactly as the Sensi software developers expected.

6) Sensi should test with other common network configurations. As I mentioned my brand X sprinkler controller does not suffer from these peculiarities. If Sensi invested more money on software engineering and testing with different network configurations they could save a bundle on support costs and customer returns.

My recommendations -

1) Configure your smart phone to use the same WiFi SSID that you want to use for your Sensi thermostat.

2) Be sure this SSID is only available for 2.4 GHz.

3) Go through your router settings to ensure that every WiFi client of this SSID has unrestricted (LAN as well as IP) access to every other client of this SSID.

4) Run the Sensi app through the complete installation and registration process.

5) After everything is working you can restore your normal network configuration in your router and smart phone. Do not change the SSID for the thermostat.

6) If you need to change the SSID for the thermostat later, go back to start. Reset your thermostat and reconfigure your network. Rinse thoroughly and repeat as often as necessary.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jennie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024","Could only connect wifi once. Got a new wifi router for home and tried to set Sensi thermostat using the sames steps as I did before. However, this time around, the Sensi app would not go to next screen once my phone connected to Sensi's wifi. Did many of the troubleshooting steps as researched (instatlled brand new battery for thermostat, ""rebooted"" thermostat, restarted phone, changed phone's wifi settings, etc.) but to no avail. Now, the thermostat is now just a dumb thermo. Had good potential. If app issue gets fixed, this would be a 5 star.

UPDATE: I was able to reconnect the Sensi thermostat. In my original negative post, I tried reconnecting to new home wifi using a different account email address and a different phone. I eventually discovered that if I log in with the app on the original set-up phone and email address, the app would work. Only thing I would have liked is if Sensi would put a warning to use original email address for account login and phone. I recently read this as a potential fix in one of the Amazon's reviews (I hadn't seen this fix in my earlier research). With the app now working and me being able to check on the temperature setting remotely, this thermostat is an easy 5 stars. The additional options in the app such as setting offsets, cycle rates, a/c protection, et. are just great! I have no c-wire so I use a battery, but it is also great that Sensi provides on their website how to wire for a c-wire (without c-wire adapter) by using a jumper but they provide how to install a c-wire adapter so this thermostat give folks few options. I have central a/c and propane gas heater with no c-wire and the Sensi works for my configuration. I will eventually try to wire using a jumper to set-up a ""mock"" c-wire.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Our Lennox system is quite old & only 4 of 8 wires matched the Sensi unit. We called tech support & spoke with Rose who was fantastic. We emailed a pic of our setup to her. She asked that we hold for approx 5-7min. We had to take the panel off of the air handler to look for additional wiring, which didn’t help much. After we clarified that the black wire on our Lennox thermostat was labeled R, not B, Rose was able to confirm what our new wiring arrangement should be.

First in dumb mode the thermostat works quite nicely, wifi setup - not so much. The mini-setup guide is not very informative and no trouble shooting recommendations. Called tech support around 1:45 pm EDT and waited 49 minutes to recorded tips, no one answered. Customer support SHOULD publish hours phones are manned and SHOULD have a call back feature added to their customer service number. My HVAC home contractor uses one and he only covers two counties.

There were help/tips available on several parts of the vendors website, but you had to be diligent when looking. Bottom line, I performed all available troubleshooting steps with no success in connecting to SENSI XXXXX network. Ran setup process fron Sensi app more than 30 times over three hours without success.

Dave,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2024","I like the style of the thermostat, and how it looks on the wall. It works really well here in the Southeast Texas humid climate by displaying the humidity on the screen along with the temperature. The Sensi app is easy and straightforward. Whenever the humidity drops below a preset level, I am alerted and can remotely turn on my system. Additionally, you can lock out the front controls and only control the system from the app, which is useful when kids turn the temp all the way down. For the temperature range, this can be set to prevent someone from turning the A/C below a certain point or the heat up to the maximum. For the price, I would definitely recommend this thermostat.

It can also integrate with Alexa and other home automation apps.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Jose & Marcia,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024","We had issues installing our Sensi overseas. We have had to call and wait for Sensi Emerson support. We got lucky during 1st set of 4 Sensi Emerson devices. Got through and support overrode zip code issue. But we found one device was defective... So, we bought another Sensi and same problem with setup in same overseas location.

Here's my letter to Sensi.

Hello Sensi Support, We have purchased and installed at least 10 Emerson Sensi Model# ST55 in my various properties. The installation in USA is easy. But the overseas or international is difficult. Due to needing a specific zip code / location, we have been forced to call Sensi technical support number.

Sensi Emerson Support

Unfortunately, this requires a long distance phone call where we must hold on the phone line until someone actually responds.  There is no way to leave a message.

We recently purchased 4 Sensi devices.  The devices were setup with nice Sensi Emerson support. The Sensi support person was able to override Sensi's zipcode limitation for the Las Terrenas in Dominican Republic. The allocated zip code is 32000.

Unfortunately, one device was defective immediately and never could sync temperature of room. It was way off.  So, we bought a replacement Sensi. Now, we need help again to set up the 4th Sensi device.

My requests are as follows:
(1) Can the zip code 32000 be made permanent in Sensi system?
(2) Can someone call or email me back from technical support / setup support?
(3) Am I able to get a refund on my defective Sensi?

Note that I have championed your Sensi Emerson product to others. I have continued to do so regardless if my recent setback. But, I would like some help for my issue. 

I would prefer to give 5 stars!

AliThom,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2023","I had a digital, but not smart, thermostat for my old oil furnace. I took a gamble and decided to buy this and hope I had the C-wire I needed.

When I got this thermostat and tried to install it, I ran into some snags. I had the extra wire that I could use as a C-wire coming out the hole where the thermostat would go, but because I had two wires twisted together in my basement, it didn't go all the way to the furnace. I went out, got a new thermostat wire, got that all threaded through the wall and around my beams in the basement...only to discover that my furnace did not have the ""C"" terminal to connect to.

At this point I called customer service and they were helpful. They told me I would need an external adapter, and I got this one: https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07L4DN5R2?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details

While I waited for that to arrive, I had to put my old thermostat back on. When the adapter came, I was able to pull it through the wall so I could plug it in the basement. I connected the positive wire (striped) to the C and the negative to the RC terminals in the thermostat, and the old wires matching where they were before. I also had to snip the jump wire on the faceplate as instructed by the customer service person. That all worked great! As soon as I set my desired temperature, my furnace started right up.

Connecting to the Wifi, I got two failed attempt messages, but I just kept hitting ""try again."" On the third try, it connected. So I would just say keep trying!

I found the app pretty intuitive.

The only thing I would have liked is a step-by-step manual, printed. All the instructions are in the app and one of the steps, you were supposed to click which wires your old thermostat had. If you didn't select ""C"" you can't continue. I would have liked to look ahead a little bit and know all the steps before I started, then just review them as I went.

I like this one because it DOES have physical push buttons on the thermostat, so if you want guests to be able to adjust it, they can do so without the app. But the app control lets me do it easily and check on things when I am away from home. I also like how the temperature numbers are really big, and it displays both the current temp AND what it is set to, in addition to the time. The app also tells you the humidity level!

In the app you can set a schedule, adjust the temperature manually, or even use a geofencing option that automatically turns the heat down 3 degrees when you are not home (based on location of your phone). It will also alert you (if you want) to possible problems with your HVAC system based on extreme highs/lows. You can also see what the current temp is, both inside your house AND the outside temp in your city, and whether or not your furnace is currently running. This was critical for me as I have an old furnace that sometimes wimps out, and I wanted to be able to check the temp when I am away from home for extended periods in case there is an issue.

There is also a ""usage"" tracker but that shows daily data and I'm still on day 1 so I don't have data to display.

All in all, while I had some frustration with the set-up due to having to wait extra for the adapter wire, it was worth it!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Lari Anne Mazzitello,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2023","This is a must buy!! This was super easy to install!!

Note: I think you are supposed to set up the app FIRST and THEN install the device!! But it worked just fine. I think it would have walked you thru the installation if we set up the app before installing the device.

We removed the old thermostat’s cover plate then held up this thermostat w/o the cover plate. Then we took a quick pic of the old thermostat’s wiring with this thermostat’s inner panel. We removed the wiring in the order of this thermostat’s wiring diagram, too to bottom and removed the old plate. When we slipped this thermostat over the wires, they were all aligned an in order. Easy peasy to insert each one in order, top to bottom or bottom to top. Press down the wires, pop on the cover plate.

Then we had to download the app, Sensi, and go thru the process to create a profile, select the wires inside our thermostat, and then zip thru the set up.

So later, we were messing around with the app, setting up the schedules for when to cool/heat and at what temperatures to change and when. The app interface was SO VERY EASY!! It allows you to copy previous schedules or to create new based on existing schedules. It was really intuitive how to schedules and click thru everything. You can set schedules for when you only have heat on. And you can set schedules for when you only have the A/C on. AND you can set other schedules for when you have it on auto and it switches between heat and cool.

Additionally, you can set any type of schedule combo for the week. So if you work from home, set a 7 day schedule. If you work M-F, set a 5 day schedule and weekend schedule. If you work 4-10s, easily set one schedule for your work week and a second for your 3-day weekend! Best yet! If you are a fireman or nurse and work a couple days on and a few days off , set up a schedule or two, call one long week and one short week or call it MTFSa/WThSu to show which days you are at work/home. I have never had one where I could schedule each day independently and was so easy to make multiple schedules. I can create one schedule for the days I work/am home, and then create a copy of that and just swap the days that I’m at work/home without having to schedule each and every day all over again. This is the easiest interface EVER!! ( I know my explanation doesn’t do it justice, but it is nice. I’m about to schedule another one for when I work nights.

Easy to set up and install, had this up and running in 10 mins including wi-fi connect. Follow the instructions by down loading the app first and go through the steps. Shut your furnace off at your breaker box otherwise you will blow a fuse and need to replace it in the furnace. I do not use Apple Home Kit but you can if you want as part of the set up. Pretty basic cheap thermostat. Looks good, flat, snug against wall, secure, does not protrude like others. Only about 1” from wall. Back lit auto off after about 15 seconds. Light button on top to turn on manually. Blends in with wall (neutral or white) pretty good. Back plate is optional for $7. You probably don’t need it with this one. App is easy to use, simple, vanilla.
Cons:
Temp buttons (up / down arrows) are not soft quiet click / touch. They are a little too loud, like a really cheap on off wall switch. Wish they had used soft touch and not loud “snap or click” when you press the arrows. There is no way to set the thermostat to “Auto” temp mode except through the app only. No touch screen on this model, just keep in mind for less than $95 what you are getting, a glorified cheap piece of plastic made in China that requires a California Prop 65 cancer label warning and that has pretty basic vanilla functions and aesthics. No comparason to the Google Nest Learning model or the Ecobee 4 premium model. With this one you are getting what you pay for. There is no justification for griping and complaining.

zarchitect,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2019","I research everything (probably over-extensively) before I buy - especially a gadget. I know I wanted more control over temperature (in and out of the house) - that was primary without spending a 2nd mortgage to set a temperature.

At the end, it came down to the hockey-puck or this one (hockey-puck being the ubiquitous Nest). EcoBee and Honeywell also had ones and looked compelling - each one with features that were eyebrow raising. But at the end, I just needed a way to keep tabs of the temperature while away. I didn't need a weather report (my phone does that), a high-rez touch screen (it's a thermostat - not a TV), nor for it to be so smart that it turns into HAL (Space Odyssey reference in case you needed to know). All the competitors did that and more - the hockey puck apparently the worst of the bunch as to stalking you to see how many breaths you put out to offset it by .004 degrees (or something like that). AND - in an age where we're now monitored 24/7 by Alexa, Google, Siri and the smart toaster and microwave - listening to our every word so they can sell our every secrets and desires to evil marketers for a billion dollars so they could target spam us when we're the most vulnerable and end up with 55 gallons of ice cream, a Euro-massager, and a pet iguana at 3am on a Wednesday hand delivered by a chippery Amazon Prime delivery guy in a rented U-Haul van stuffed to the gill with the hopes and nightmares of other unsuspecting souls.

Anyway - privacy was a concern so I really didn't want Alexa or anything with a microphone. If I really wanted to talk to a wall, I'll go to the mirror and start singing - at least I have an audience of one that way... If our house has a microphone embedded in everything and we start blurting out commands indiscriminately to meet our over-entitled needs like bi-polar lunatics - when will it stop? We'll end up vegetables sitting on the couch not lifting a finger eating our 55 gallons of ice cream... AHA! I knew it!

I digress - it's a thermostat. I don't have a consistent schedule so I can't have it create one magically - it can't read my mind... yet. And some days I like it cooler than others - what then? Will I have a verbal fight with the hockey puck? It would win - it's too smart for me!

So I needed something that was a step up from the ol' knob and tube dial form the days of Kojak and have the ability to see / control this thing from 2000 miles away as I worry that I left something on (Bonus - I can make the other house-occupants suffer remotely if they do me wrong). I can also check on whether they set the temperature down to -50 thinking that it'll it cool off faster and they leave the house / windows open. Maybe I do need a yelling hockey puck...

Oh - Emerson. In the past Emerson was known as the bane of the electronics world - breaking down on day 91 on a 90-day warranty gadget. The epitome of planned-obsolescence! I'm giving it another chance - maybe they grey up a little. If I see polar bears roaming my living room eating my ice scream when I come home, I won't be happy - stay tuned on that...

Oh - before I go - also needed it to be dumb enough that if something failed (because it always does at the most inopportune time) - it won't freak out. AKA - some of the devices needed a 24/7 WiFi connection Why does one gadget need to depend on another for survival? So if my WiFi goes out then I die of heatstroke?

For all you readers out there - buy it for what you want to get out of it but don't be sold on things that truly don't matter in your daily lives for at the end of the day, it's just a thermostat - not a hyper-augmented inner core balancing module.",4.0 out of 5 stars

DNA,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2020","I am so happy I bought this. I got a new AC and I wanted something more hi tech than the thermostat that it came with. I also didn’t want to spend $200 on a Nest. I just wanted something simple that was programmable but also worked with Alexa. This is it! I actually did my research and found this was better than the equivalent Honeywell thermostat.
1. If you have both central air/Heat you do not need a C-wire. I live in a condo and they were having problems with the c-wire so I told them to just install it without it, and it still works perfectly. It does have AA batteries that I will have to change eventually but that’s fine.
2. I love that it works with Alexa. I like it colder at night so I set up a routine, I tell Alexa “Good Night” and she shuts off my lights and turns the air down to my desired temp.
3. This thing has GeoFencing! I thought I would need to program it for weekdays but this is even better. Every time I take my phone 3 miles away, it automatically raises the temp 3 degrees and then lowers it again when I’m back within a 3 mile range. So if I’m just walking my dog or running an errand in the neighborhood it won’t adjust unnecessarily and only does it when I’m gone for longer periods.
4. Also has programmable schedules for those who choose this. I just use Alexa and Geofencing so I don’t even have to use this feature.
5. I think it’s prettier than the Honeywell and the Nest. I like that it’s white and has a white glow on the screen so it looks better on the wall. The Honeywell has a green light apparently.
6. Optional Humidity control. You can set it to a certain humidity percentage and it will overcool a couple of degrees to reach your humidity level. I loved this at first but it didn’t work for me because it was doing it even when I was away and I would rather it just keep the temperature that I wanted instead. But this is a great feature if that is important to you.
7. 100% control with the Sensi app. I can adjust my temp from my bed, from work, from my car, while on vacation . It’s amazing. I honestly have not even had to touch the actual thermostat since it was installed. And the fact that you can have Alexa control it and tell you the temp inside and outside is awesome.
8. All of these features are optional. You can turn them on and off in the app and cater the system to your family’s needs. Oh and do you have kids or a pesky family member that keeps changing the temp? You can actually lock the buttons on the actual unit from the app and use only the app.

This does not have room sensors and it will not learn your schedule or figure out what room you are in or anything like the Nest or other thermostats do. But if you are like me and live in a small space then those features aren’t necessary and with the Geofencing, even if my schedule fluctuates, it will still only adjust if I’m 3 miles away no matter what my schedule is.

Overall I say this is so worth the price. I should have bought this a long time ago. I am very happy at the moment but I will come back and update the review if anything changes.",5.0 out of 5 stars

S. Hoffman,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2024","There are many smart thermostats available these days with decent reviews. I looked at several and sifted through those reviews.
The reason I chose the Sensi thermostat is because it blended familiar old style buttons and display screen with new high tech smart thermostat capabilities. We have a vacation home that outside temperatures can vary from 5 degrees during the winter to 95 degrees during the summer. We have had the Sensi thermostat installed for over a year and adjust the temperature prior to our arrival and can monitor the indoor temperature of the house from 200 miles away via wifi.
It has worked flawlessly and decided to install an additional one in our primary residence this year. Highly recommended!",5.0 out of 5 stars

The device comes with the initials of the colors of the wires though. I think taking a photo of the previous connections is a good practice before unplugging the cables from the old device. I've been using the thermostat for about three weeks now and it always connects immediately from wherever I am.",5.0 out of 5 stars
MD and AZ,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2022","I have two Sensi thermostats, one for our primary home in MD and one for a second home in AZ. Our HVAC in AZ is conventional forced air system, so the set up was straightforward and pretty seamless - it took a few tries to get it to connect to Wi-Fi but once it finally took we were good to go. Fortified by my success I charged ahead with installing one at the MD house, which was built in 1928 and has two separate systems - the original hot water radiators for heat and a separate forced air AC system. Again the set up was straightforward - I followed the prompts on the app and still had to try several times to get it to connect to Wi-Fi but eventually it did and all seemed well. One aspect of the set up that was fraught with peril was that the set up prompts directed me cut the built in C wire on the Sensi. This seemed a very final move so before I did it I did some googling to try to educate myself on what the C wire is for and essentially determined that because I have two totally separate systems that don’t talk to each other, I don’t need a C wire. So I cut the wire and all seemed operational.

When I turned the heat on I noticed that I didn’t hear the characteristic whistle of the radiators getting going and that the boiler was not kicking on. I then discovered that the forced air was blowing, even though the thermostat was in “heat” mode. Then, when I put it in “cool” mode and cranked up the setting, the furnace would kick on. In a slight panic I reviewed the photo I took of my old thermostat wiring and saw that it was the same configuration as what the Sensi app had walked me through, so I knew that wasn’t the issue. Based on the negative reviews I had read, I didn’t have much hope that the Sensi help page would actually be helpful, but I found an FAQ along the lines of “ why isn’t my heat turning on”. It suggested that I needed to configure my thermostat to talk to my system, and walked me through changing the default settings on the thermostat itself to work with my specific system configuration. And - success!!! The heat kicked on in “heat” mode and the AC kicked on in “cool” mode and it was squared away.

So my main takeaways are that you have to stick with it and perhaps do some troubleshooting, but this is good affordable smart thermostat solution. I really like that it looks like a regular thermostat, meaning minimal wall patching of the area around it, and the app seems to work well and be pretty intuitive. And - MD gave me a $75 rebate so it was even cheaper (incomprehensibly AZ does not offer a rebate.)

So - I recommend!",4.0 out of 5 stars

Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2023","Wanted to upgrade the thermostat unit but my wiring didn't include the c-wire which removes many other options from the table. Luckily the ST55 doesn't require it (and instead uses batteries). The ST55 is actually Emerson's lower tier smart thermostat, and doesn't have a lot of the bells and whistles of their higher end units. The design is also much more traditional, as opposed to the higher end units, which basically are entirely screen, no buttons. But I like having the buttons and didn't neccessarily want to mount somthing that looked like a smart phone on the wall.

The installation was very straight forward and the included bubble level made mounting it horizontally level quite easy. The app guides you through install and as long as you know what your wires are, you shouldn't have any problem.

Using it is very straight foward. Basic functionality is all supported like setting a temperature and setting a schedule. If you generally just want to do the most basic of tasks then this thermostat will definitely suffice. The information is all displayed on the screen. The screen displays both time and humidity, but alternates it - so if you want to know the humidity and it currently displays time, just wait a few second and it will switch. The associated application is also pretty useful and lets you see and control the unit from your smart phone. If you register an account you also can get notifications - for example, when the humidity is above 70% you'll get an email (at which point you can turn on the dehumidifier or AC). I personally haven't had any issues with it after a few months of use, so as far as I can tell, this unit is completely reliable - it does what I need it to do, no more and no less.

The higher end models will also obviously have all the same functionality along with even more advanced functionality I'm guessing, but if you don't really want something super fancy and like the traditional appearence of this unit, then this will be more than adaquate. Also if you don't have the C-wire then you simply won't have too many options anyway. If however you really want even more smart features and want something more futuristic, then well a higher-end model might suit you more.",5.0 out of 5 stars
DH,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2024","Would have been a nice unit but I need to return it. All of my Wi-Fi access points in my house are set up for WPA3 only, as even WPA2/3 transitional is not secure. Rufus AI generated answer incorrectly said this product supports WPA3, which it absolutely does not. Tried on a temporary WPA2 network and it connected right away. Then I did my usual ""will this work with the Internet down"", and the answer is a hard no, I could not even do a basic set temperature change with the Internet down. Strike two. Third strike is that the compatibility of this item with Home Assistant is pretty poor. There is a GitHub integration out there, but again it's not local control, it goes out to the Emerson / Copeland servers to execute commands. Strike three.

One pro for this item, though, is they did have phone support that helped talk through the wiring setup for this for my ancient geothermal heat pump. Rather DIY friendly, all things considered.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Korryn,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024","Works great. Easy to install myself following a YouTube video. Setting up to wifi was simplified as well. The programming works great and no issues with anything really, except the batteries it came with. The batteries lasted less than a year (10 months) and no longer worked even when the batteries showed 4 bars on the display. When this happens, you can no longer control the thermostat from the app or it goes offline and the wifi signal disappears or stops displaying on the top left corner of the screen.

I still recommend this thermostat and will try out other batteries, even though the Energizer batteries it came with are typically good batteries.

Tasty Bits,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2020","I own two of these units. One in a Commercial setting and one Residential. Overall decent product but it may not be the easiest install if you don’t prepare.

Pro: app is very informative, very configurable and granular.

Con: Temperature spread not configurable. Unit seems to be confused for the first 12 hrs after install or if you change the primary configuration with lots of short cycling of the system. Needs to just sit in an off or not actively heating/cooling for several hours prior to use.

Everything is setup to be user friendly. No physical manuals, install the phone app and it should walk you through everything step by step. 2.4ghz WiFi network support only. Problems arise if your system doesn’t have a Common (C or Blue) wire or if your system is wired in an unexpected manner. My Commercial system was connected using colors that the app configurator deemed “Invalid” yet clearly it worked with the old thermostat. I am not and HVAC tech but using the service manual for the old thermostat I reverse engineered what each wire was for and hooked up the Sensei appropriately.

Other manufacturers let you adjust the temperature spread in the advanced settings to limit and control short cycling of the system and adjust when it comes on usually by configuring a % or specific # of degrees. Emerson uses a generic approach called the “Cycle Rate” with 3 possible settings of Slow, Medium or Fast. Slow supposedly allowing the widest spread in temperature. In my experience this is all of a 1 degree spread but it looks and feels to be a 0 degree spread as the system will come on when the display and target temps match.

The advanced settings are not part of the initial app based setup. You need to download the real user manual to understand and modify the advanced settings as needed to match your system.

Prior to changing your thermostat out, it is best to document your equipment as best as you can and/or dig into the advanced menu of your existing thermostat if digital and document the settings there. It makes a difference of you have single or dual stage Cooling or heat, heat pump, reversing valve power orientation and backup electrical heat. You will need to configure all of that in the new thermostat.

One key step during install is turning on the WiFi network on the thermostat, disconnecting your phone from your regular WiFi and connecting to the thermostat to perform the config, then moving your phone or device back to the regular network to complete the configuration and testing. Also be aware that if your unit cannot connect to the WiFi you want or that it disconnects/drops a lot you are either trying to connect to a 5ghz network or the 2.4Ghz network is saturated with other nearby networks causing a weak signal or your WiFi router is too far away from the thermostat.

One last tip, many WiFi routers from internet providers or stores tout that they provide 2.4Ghz and one or two 5Ghz networks all in one single “Network”. While this is true and will give your computing devices the fastest speeds IOT devices like these thermostats only work on 2.4Ghz and will work absolutely flawless if split the 2.4 and 5 GHz networks giving the 2.4 its own SSID network name. Everything will still route through your main router so you can use the app on a phone connected to the 5Ghz to control your unit on the 2.4Ghz network.",4.0 out of 5 stars

El,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2023","Living in a house that hasn’t been updated since the 90’s means we were stuck without a common wire and with a vintage Honeywell basic thermometer, you know the ones, everyone has had one in their first crappy apartment lol.

When we first moved in we converted the downstairs thermostat to a nest and then when moving upstairs we realized the AC was from 1989 and needed to be rewired or replaced. I don’t like to replace things that are working great just to make them tech friendly so I started looking for options.

A local air conditioner dude quoted me $400 to install a nest thermostat with a common wire adapter. I thought that was fair but couldn’t afford it so I tried to do it myself and ran into issues with our ancient AC system’s power source. I gave up on ever having a smart thermostat that I could install myself for an affordable amount of money and we just adjusted it manually and consistently whenever it was hot.

However I got desperate during these Texas 110 degree days recently with my old AC thermostat popping on and off over and over so I started the search over. Determined not to spend $5000 on a whole new system cause yikes.

I found this one on Amazon after an extensive search and thought it’s too good to be true that it doesn’t need a common and it fits where the old 1990’s honeywells need updating.

I installed it so easily just like a normal thermostat, no wire jumping or skinning needed. No adapter on our dinosaur ac! I didn’t even have to open up the ac itself just the wall thermo. The app walked me through everything, and It took me about 45 mins total to connect it and calibrate it for the excess temperature issues we were having (our thermostat is in a hot spot in the room, you can adjust it just for these sorts of situations) within the first day we were seeing a change in the control of the temperature in these hot daytime hours!

A month later I am happy to say it’s working so well and our house is finally eco friendly with a lower bill during the summer. We haven’t had as many issues with our AC running all day and the app gives us a breakdown of energy usage and temperature. I only wish I had found this sooner because it solved a lot of our problems until we can officially replace our very old AC.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Just Josh,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2022","Installing this thermostat is very easy. Wire it up, setup the app, connect to it with the app, enter a code from the thermostat, and it connects to your wifi and is then available to view and configure in the app from anywhere.

At a basic level it works just like you’d expect any thermostat to work. You can control it right from the thermostat using the up/down arrows for the temperature. There are also buttons to set the heating or cooling mode (or turn it off), set the fan to on all the time or Auto, and to turn it on the programmed schedule mode. This thermostat also has a mode where it can automatically switch between heating and cooling as needed.

You can program the thermostat using the buttons on the unit itself, but it’s much easier to use the app to setup your schedule. You can setup various events throughout the day such as if you want it to be a certain temperature when you wake up, change when you are out for the day, change again when you’re back home, and change again for when you go to bed. In this sense it’s pretty much like any other programmable thermostat.

The app gives you a few nifty features (besides the expected ability to adjust it from anywhere… very convenient from bed):
- You can lock the physical buttons so only the app can control the thermostat. Perfect if you have issues with people adjusting the thermostat when they shouldn’t be.
- You can setup the fan to run a certain amount of time per hour to circulate the air in case the heating and cooling doesn’t need to run the fan much. This is a nice alternative for air circulation compared with just leaving the fan on all the time.
- You can use the app to tweak the “actual” temperature by plus or minus five degrees. This will change the room temperature display number and thus the behavior of the thermostat. This is convenient both for calibrating the thermostat if you want to set it to be exactly the same as another thermometer that you have, and also if you want to use it to set the temperature in another room that might be hotter or colder than the area where the thermostat is located.
- You can see the usage day by day on a graph. You can see how much the heat, air conditioning, and fan were on each day. Very convenient to see how your temperature settings impact the actual energy usage.

PT,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","Emerson did an amazing job with this product! I finally broke down and bought a wifi thermostat because I was tired of having to continually run over to my manual thermostat to adjust it. When going from summer to winter, or winter to spring, there are many days where you need heating on one day, and cooling the next... or heating during the morning... cooling during the day... and heating again during later that night. This makes the wifi thermostat the only logical choice.

My initial concern was the infamous ""c-wire,"" and whether that would be an issue, but Emerson has developed a system that is as foolproof as you can find. You download their app, and simply follow the step-by-step instructions, and voila! If necessary, you can go back a page or two, or you can go through the entire app a page at a time, to familiarize yourself, then go back to the first page and begin. I can't speak highly enough of their app and how well it is done. I only wish other companies would follow suit, and include such an easy to follow instruction app!

As to the thermostat itself, it is not too difficult to figure out, and I was most pleased with how quick and simple it was to setup the daily schedule. That was the one area where it was not as intuitive as it could have been, and a few extra instructions explaining it could have helped. But I still managed to figure it out in just a few minutes of trial & error, since the screen would tell me that I was doing it wrong, and would not let me go to the next step. But again... all in all, it was a surprisingly simple process from start to finish.

I was also pleased with how easy it was to setup the daily schedule. On my 7-day programmable manual thermostat, each day had to be set individually. On the Sensi, you can simply select select the days that you want programmed, and apply the temperature settings to that entire range of days. So rather than having to program 7 individual days, I simply set a schedule for 5 work days, and another schedule for my two days off.

The one thing I would caution everyone about is AA batteries! The batteries in the package were about 70% when I installed them into the thermostat. Fortunately, I keep plenty of rechargeable batteries on hand, so I was able to charge up a set. When I installed those, the battery meter showed a full 100%. I will monitor to see how long the batteries last, but with rechargeable batteries... it's actually no big deal one way or the other.

The unit works fine, and it took no time to install. The mounting bracket uses the exact same holes as the unit I was replacing, and you will probably need the super tiny philips head screwdriver and a pair of needle nosed pliers to push the copper wires back into the wall after you have them inserted & screwed down on the thermostat wall mount. If you leave them extending out, they will block you from being able to snap the face-plate onto the wall mount.

I highly recommend this unit. The cost is excellent... it works excellent... and installation was a breeze!

J. S. Keck,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2024","Added 2 of these last year to replace the ""dumb"" thermostats in our vacation home on Cape Cod. Nest and a lot of other Smart thermostats required a C-wire, which we didn't have. The Sensei units didn't need it, which was a main reason I ended up buying them. BUT, I'm really happy with the purchase now about 8 months later. We have to leave the heat on over the winter as the house is not set up to drain plumbing & winterize, etc. The Sensei units not only give me the current temps in the home, they show me the outside temp. The app also lets me see how much the heat has run for any given day, etc. When it's going to be colder than normal for a few days, it's easy to just open the app and dial up the heat a bit. Don't have to call a neighbor (or my brother in law) to have them go over and adjust the thermostats for us. Plus we got some $ back thru the Mass Save Energy program, so they where practically free. Installation was a little on the fussy side; they lost wifi connection a few times, but I think that's the fault of my Eero mesh system more than the thermostats. So far, they've been great and I can recommend them, especially if you have a remote location you want to monitor.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Bill,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2023","I have a house from the 60s so no C-Wire. We just have RH and W wires. Our furnace is gas with hot water baseboard heat so I think technically it's a boiler. I read others saying they didn't need a C-Wire so I figured I'd give it a try. The setup process makes you select your current wiring setup and if you pick RH and W it says it won't work. I just said I had a C-Wire even though I didn't. I was able to get it connected to Wi-Fi and it seemed good so I was going to wait and see how the batteries held out. Had an issue where the heat was on even though the thermostat wasn't asking for it. Found the thermostat was setup for an electric system so fixed those settings. Then noticed on my Taco control panel that the yellow light that indicates the thermostat is calling for heat was faintly illuminated. It was doing this even when the thermostat mode was set to off. So while it seemed like it may work, it's behaving strange due to the absence of the C-Wire so I'm not taking any chances. Put the old thermostat back and it is back to normal.

I have another one of these thermostats in the finished basement where I do have a C-Wire and it's great. The app is great and I like the usage reports that show how much time the thermostat spent asking for heat.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Ted Long,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2024","My utility company had a rebate of up to $125 for a self-installed smart thermostat. So, my overall cost was zero. Was simple to install and configure to work with my Amazon Echo. Using the separate app that gets installed on my android phone, allows me to easily set a schedule and/or temporarily set the temperature. The android installed app is so good it changes color while viewing if the (in my case) the heat is actually running.
Current temperature, at the thermostat, is pretty large and easily read. But temp setting is a bit small on the device, but still easy to read. Another useful feature is the current humidity level. With my forced hot air heat, the air dries out very quickly, so when the humidity level drops below 25%, I usually turn on a humidifier to add more moisture in the air. The humidity level, like the current setting. is pretty small on the device, but is also more easily read on the app.
Physical install, and app setup, took me less than 15 minutes, and Alexa setup just a few minutes more. The only thing that I would like to have that is missing is a physical button just to temporarily turn on the back light. But as my phone app works just fine, the lack of a back light only button, is really not an issue.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Fortunately, this has the same install footprint as the 13 year old Honeywell it replaced, so no worries. We bought two fresh batteries. Installation was great, very easy, took maybe 15 minutes. The wifi setup had no issues and the system is running as it should. For the price gamble, it was well worth it.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2024","I purchased this thermostat because the description for this product above states a ""C wire is not required for most installations"". I have an older home. I have two wires for the thermostat. I have an oil furnace and no a/c. At first, the thermostat worked really well. One day, I lost WiFi for just a minute, and the thermostat turned on the heat, and it would not turn it off until I took the thermostat out. I figured it was just a fluke and then it happened again when the temps were 94 degrees outside. I had to take the thermostat out again. I contacted tech support, who informed me that a C wire is required (despite the description saying it is not) and informed me that I could have a C wire run. Why would I do that? First, it is very difficult to find a tradesperson in my area, and it can take months to get one to your home if you do. Second, why would I pay additional money when I specifically sought out a thermostat that did not require a C wire?

This is what tech support emailed me: ""A common wire (“C” wire) is required on heat-only systems for both Sensi models. Without a “C” wire installed, the Wi-Fi connection will be intermittent to preserve battery power.""

This does not explain why the thermostat would crank the heat each time it loses WiFi.

Stan Zielinski,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023","This is NOT a smart device by any means! There is no ability to set stop and start cycles only on. This means you must program to have a designated time for the vac unit to come on and then program another time for it have a different temperature. There is NO stop/ start in the software at all. In the case of heating my house, I wanted the HVAC to come on at 5AM and heat to 70. At 9 AM I wanted the HVAC to no longer operate util 5PM. You cannot do this function, you must program another start cycle at 9AM for a lower temperature. Also, there is NO way to eliminate your fan from coming on. My HVAC unit is in my attic above my master bedroom. I don't want it coming on at night when I sleep. SORRY, no can do. In frustration I tried cancelling the schedule for one night. Nope, once it's in the program you can't eliminate the fan from coming on. The best you get is 10% in an hour. My old analog thermostat with a time clock had more brains than this P.O.S.

The menus and pictures to re-wire were pretty decent. As far as Alexa and a smart home device. I prefer to keep things basic and I do not like having eyes and ears into my life from outside sources collecting data. What I eat, drink, wear, when and how is nobody's business.

Dr. K,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2020","My main hang up in buying this way how the install would go. I was replacing an anolog unit and fortunately the install was super easy. Took me about 10 minutes (it says 30 min install) and the step by step instructions on the app made it super easy and straight forward. The unit phone app control is absolutely awesome. I work in an office 3 out of 7 days but if I didn't keep the AC on at least 70 in the summer, it would get super warm in the afternoon, like close to 80. Now I can schedule it at 83 degrees on the days I'm not there. On the days I work, the AC starts to turn on and lower at 3am (72 degrees), then lower more at 6 am (65°), so when I get there at 9am it's a cold 65 degrees. Then thought the day, with Oklahoma 100+ degree day summers, it will only get to about 72-75 degrees (even when set at 65) in the afternoon. I'm going to save a considerable amount of money and I will have more all day comfort when I'm there. Other cool features are the auto humidity and auto fan control. If it gets above a certain user set humidity level (60% for me) the AC will kick on to bring it back down, no matter the temp. Also you can set the fan to run by itself to circulate air for a certain percent of the day (25% of an hour is how I set it,). Has more features than I imagined or probably Even need, but I'll take them. This unit even tells you the local temp and high and low of the day and gives you a daily and monthly usage statistic and graph. You can use the app to check for local energy company rebates. Really cool and I should have bought it years ago. Don't let the installation scare you. It was much easier than I thought. ""YOU CAN DO IT?” (with the voice used in Adam Sandler movies).

Update 10/4/1/2022
The thermostat is now eating the 2 AA batteries completely, from 100% to zero, in one day and the thermostat literally heats up. Its says it's 79 in a 68 degree room because the actual thermostat itself is putting out so much heat and eating batteries. I've tried about every brand of battery now and the same thing happens about 10x now. It will go dead with brand new batteries in a day or day and a half and disconnect. Also I've checked the entirety of the rest of the system and every thing is fine, other than the thermostat I disconnected it and let it sit for days with no battery and it still does the same thing when back in the wall with batteries. I've also tried the thermostats with the wifi off and it made no difference. It is noticably putting off heat and the temperature reading reflects that. Of coarse it's exactly a couple months after the one year warranty. I purchased in June 2021.....watch out. I'm going to contact Emerson but I'm not hopefull.",1.0 out of 5 stars

The unit took over three weeks to arrive, then about two more weeks for me to get to install. Upon installation, the unit was clearly displaying the incorrect temperature and wouldn't acclimate to the actual room temperature. We called customer support, who confirmed the thermostat was defective.

They then proceeded to tell us that even though the unit was clearly defective, that they WOULD NOT ISSUE A REFUND BECAUSE IT WAS PURCHASED THROUGH AMAZON.

Even though we purchased the unit directly through their company storefront on Amazon, they refused the replace the defective unit because ""we didn't order directly through their website"".

Erlvis,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2024","Bought four of these highly-rated Sensi thermostats a year ago. Worked great at first but over time, my thermostats show as offline in the Sensi randomly and for the last few months, almost constantly.

And they might show offline for hours, then suddenly they start working. See attached. Note the time/date stamp. Different units appear online then go offline as quickly as a minute or two.

It's not a WiFi signal issue. All four have five bars of WiFi signal strength and our WiFi usage is light to begin with.

Opened a support ticket with Emerson. After two weeks, I got an email from them basically saying ""we might've fixed it so if you are still having a problem, please open a new support ticket."" Huh? That's how you support a customer using four of your products yet none of them are reliably online?

S. Allen,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2018","Back on March 21, 2018 I purchased two Sensi ST55 thermostats. Both were installed and worked fine. One was installed upstairs and the second was installed downstairs. Around September 20, 2018 the Downstairs unit lost connectivity and went offline. I tried resetting the router but it would not connect to my SSID. I purchased a new router and the problem persisted. I called Sensi for troubleshooting. They blamed the new router for the connectivity issue and suggested that I go back to my old router or try different settings on the new router, ignoring that there was another unit that reconnected fine. I performed those steps as directed but the thermostat would not pick up my SSID. I could see I was not going to get far with technical support. On September 26, 2018, I purchased another ST55 thermostat from Amazon. It immediately came online and has been working fine since. I returned the old one to Amazon as defective. A few days before November 26, 2018, I contacted technical support again this time regarding the Upstairs ST55. This unit had gone rogue and was calling for heat even when turned off. To eliminate a possible wiring problem I switched the Upstairs ST55 with the Downstairs ST55. The trouble followed the thermostat downstairs. Sensi opened Case 00302944. They emailed me requesting all the information that I had already supplied but without pictures. I called tech support and we went through another round of troubleshooting. This time tech support concluded that the unit was defective. A few days later I received a replacement. For the past two weeks everything was working fine with the Upstairs ST55, until last night. Last night my wife woke up in a sweat. The upstairs thermostat was calling for heat again. It was 83 degrees Fahrenheit and the heat was still on. The thermostat was set to 62 degrees Fahrenheit. She woke me up and I turned the thermostat off and checked to see if the circulator on the boiler was still running. It was. I pulled the thermostat from the wall and opened the windows to cool the house down. I also pulled the batteries from the thermostat and let it sit there until the morning. I reconnected the thermostat to the wall and everything is fine for now. I have to ask; how much longer will it take before this thermostat will try to cook my family again? I have lost all faith in Sensi's products and have very little faith in their technical support.

Frostbyte,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2021","I cant believe all the 5 star reviews. These people must live in a cold climate , or where the heat doesn't reach 105+ outdoors. If I could give a zero star, I would. This thing constantly short cycles for one thing. On a hot day, this thing goes on then off every 5 to 7 minutes. That is one good way to wear out a 10 thousand dollar a/c unit very fast. No a/c should cycle every 5 to 8 minutes. 5 minutes of run times doesnt even give the system a chance to blow out the humidity and cool the house.

My old dumb thermostat that is 20 years old still works fine, and cycles every 15 to 20 minutes depending on temp. Tech support is impossible to get a hold of, you have to go through amazon

I contacted tech support, they ran a check of my usage and the technician was very rude and basically called me a liar saying that my unit didn't kick on and off every 5 minutes, and they make them do this to make people comfortable. I was outraged! Like I am going to lie about this?????? I used every setting and method possible for this piece of trash and no matter what, it still short cycled, unless I set my room temp at 88 degrees....then whats the point of having an ac or thermostat! . Other people experience the same thing that live in my climate. If its 75 to 80 degrees, it might work fine for you. But beware, if you are in a hot area, DONT BUY!

Amazon was nice enough to me and apologized for Sensi's complete rudeness and professionalism. They refunded my money even though it was past the return period. They even told me that tech should lose his job for his behavior. I sent this pos back. I will never ever deal or buy from this company again, and you couldn't give me one for free. My 10 thousand dollar air unit is far more important than to have something like this wear it out.

P. Tyndall,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2021","I've had this thermostat almost a full year, and while it appears much better than my previous Honeywell units, this one has a major flaw: It overworks my heat pump! Let me explain.

This thermostat replaced a simple Honeywell model that worked well with the unit, but I wanted remote control via app features. Let me say, the Sensi app is great! I began noticing my HVAC unit only running a few minutes and turning off, only to repeat this almost 8-10 times an hour. That's WAY too much cycling for a heat pump that cycled a third of that with the older thermostat. No problem! I found a cycle rate setting in the app. Sadly, that setting in the app doesn't do anything to improve the cycle rate issue. It does seem to change the temperature readings on the display (have no idea what that's about). So, this tstat has come down off my wall.

I've had a ticket in with Technical Support for over two weeks and heard nothing. So, it's safe to say I do NOT recommend this tstat for heat pump use. Stay away. Disappointed, because if this ""cycle rate"" feature in the app actually worked, this would be an awesome tstat. But, like most stuff made today...

UPDATE: August 7, 2021

Sensi ""Support"" responded to my detailed description in the ticket about the thermostat/app's cycle setting not working. Their response? Step by step instructions on changing the cycle setting in the app!...the very thing that does NOT work! I would say their technical support is the worst, but there are a lots of companies like them, these days. PLEASE. Whatever you do, pick a different brand thermostat. If you have this thermostat on a heat pump and you live in a warm climate, it's probably overworking your HVAC system. You've been warned.

UPDATE: August 18, 2021

Talked with Jason at technical support. He said the thermostat is probably working as it should and will cycle my unit too much. I explained my Honeywell did not cycle the unit as such. Both supposedly have the same temp differential. No recourse. Stuck with a paperweight. Again, you've been warned.",1.0 out of 5 stars
M Cocola,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2020","Decided on this thermostat to replace very basic unit at a house I recently purchased. I didn't want anything super fancy, just cycle control, wifi, etc. This seemed like it would work find and reviews were predominantly good...

Installed new wire from my boiler so I could have the required common, mounted it up, conected to wifi easily, everything seemed fine. Made a schedule (ap is super rudimentary so dont expect much), set cycle speed to slow as I have a high efficiency boiler, and thought we were off to the races. Well, sorta... in the basic sense that it turns the heat on and off...

The following is consistent across TWO separate Sensi thermostats. I returned the first one. SEE PICS that show these observations.

- When the thermostat sets a call for heat (65* in pic), within four minutes or so the ""room temp"" drops 2 or 3 degrees (down to 62* in pics). This is on the display ONLY of course, and all other measuring devices show an unchanged temperature.

- When baseboards heat the room, the Sensi displayed temp continues to lag all the other measurement devices by a few degrees. (Pics show as the temp climbs back up. 1 minute from 62-3, 2 minutes from 63-4, 2 minutes from 64-5, then 7 minutes from 65-66/Off??? Then 6 minutes from 66-69??? Makes no thermodynamic sense.)

- By the time the Sensi ""thinks"" it has reached the set point and cancels the heating call, it has already overshot by a few degrees in real life. (Photo of the wall shows the Sensi just turned off right at 66* but all other devices are high 67 to 68)

- With continued baseboard circulation the room temp rises. This is of course expected with hydronic heat, but because of the aforementioned nonsense, by the time all is said and done it is super hot in the room. (See pic max temp of 69*, reached 6 minutes after heat call ends)

Troubleshooting:
- Bought 2nd thermostat... same thing.
- Verified c-wire voltage and freq is within spec.
- Tried medium and fast cycles... same thing.
- Emailed Sensi twice... no answer.
- When thermostat just sits idle, the temp lines up with all other measurement devices... great.

So I'm pretty much done toying with this and will be sending the 2nd back. Good luck should you decide to purchase one!",1.0 out of 5 stars

TechN,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2019","I bought this because of the top reviews here in Amazon. But this turned out to be by far the worst purchase I have made this whole year of 2019! I have a gas furnace/outdoor AC. I replaced a 5 year old Honeywell non-smart non-programmable thermostat with this one. Installation was straight-forward with the app guidance. I carefully wired the thermostat following all instructions from the PDF manual from the Sensi website for my specific heating/cooling HVAC system and set the menu in the thermostat accordingly. When I set the temperature to 70 F and let it run when room temp was 67 F.  The thermostat did not stop the furnace at 70 F, and let the room heat above 75 F!! When I looked the thermostat display, it showed that the heating was stopped, but the furnace was running non-stop.

As per the support article online I tried to troubleshoot. Following the instruction, I removed the display front plate from the wall and the heater was turned off within 5 mins confirming there was nothing wrong with the wiring or any short on my home furnace wiring. I put the old Honeywell thermostat back and the furnace worked perfectly! It stopped right on time as soon as the set temperature was reached.
I wanted to like Sensi and gave another chance. I put the Sensi back and set up all menu as per detailed manual. Now only way I could let it run was in the auto setting. I put a temperature range of 67 F to 71 F. The thermostat will run the heater and temperature will go above 71 F and then the AC cooling will trigger switching off furnace and turning to cool mode. AC runs for a short while to bring temperature down and the HVAC system turns off when within teh set temperature range. This put a lot of load on the AC, turning it on and off. When I see the HVAC usage on app, I could see that the AC ran for about 30 mins a day when outdoor winter temperature in the midwest was around 30 F. 

I wrote to the online support webpage describing the problem. I got no response from them ever after a few days. I called them on their support phone number.

tkrjhw,"Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2018","As I described previously when you connect you are only connecting to an Emerson web page.Their server does the job of connecting to your thermostat. And you are at the mercy of Emerson keeping their web server operating. But they changed their web page in about Jan 2018 and now it rarely connects to my thermostat. I go days without being able to connect. Their only suggestion is to move my wifi antenna but it already has direct line of sight and is only about 10 feet away. It's not my wifi that is the problem. It was working fine until they changed their website. I have trouble connecting not only with my computer browser but also with the Android app.
Now in August 2018 they have changed the website yet again. My account has been erased. I had to create a new account. And it appears that the only way to connect is to pay a subscription of 1$ per month. I'm done. I'm taking it out and throwing it away. I will not buy another wifi thermostat from anyone unless it is a type that I can connect to directly via a TCP port and not go through their server. I am nothing short of furious.
This concept of forcing equipment to go through a website for connection and then the web sties close down rendering the equipment useless needs to be made illegal. There are several home camera systems my friends bought costing in excess of $1000 that are useless because of the same reason.

PREVIOUS review:
Works well. When you connect via a web browser you are actually not connecting directly to the thermostat but rather to an Emerson web site which in turn contacts your thermostat and creates a web page with the data. There is also an Android app. Both browser web page and Android app work reliably and operate quite identically which is good that I didn't have to learn how to operate but one GUI.
So far it seems Emerson did a good job at keeping the web page fairly vanilla, no tricks in the JavaScript (is there a javascript?) that causes it to only work in one flavor of browser like is so common in other wireless equipment.
The one thing that bothers me about equipment that depends on a manufacturers web site for it to work is the manufacturer may someday stop supporting the device.

Slagathor,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2021","Oh boy, let me tell you something. For 16 months, out Sensi worked great. Easy to use, kept temperature well, no problems. Then one day, I looked at the usage that and saw my heater had been on for 4.5 hours through the night, between midnight and 5:30 am. That struck me as odd, because our heating system would typically only run for about 2 hours total. Our second sensi, which controls the HVAC in our guest house, read the proper run time of 2 hours. I knew something was wrong. Long story short, after 4 weeks of fiddling with settings, offset temp, keeping track of times, temperatures, and everything else I could think of, I have come to the conclusion this thing has gone rogue. Interestingly enough, it keeps the temp in the house to the set point, mostly. Sometimes it does drop two degrees too low, says it's heating but isn't actually running. Eventually, it will engage the furnace and get the temp back up, but there no rhyme or reason to what kicks it on. I'll hear it click on, but nothing. Other times, it'll click on, run the fan for 2 min, turn off, but still say it's heating. We've checked wire connections, they're all good. Heater itself is fine. Don't have the problem during the day, only through the night and the coldest part of morning. Sometimes, I can get it to start working properly by popping the unit off the wall and putting it back, but sometimes that will only start the fan for a minute. I am flummoxed and frustrated and hope to goodness this rogue smart thermostat isn't screwing up my HVAC in the long run. I just ordered an Ecobee to replace it, because the temp of my home is important to me. After a week of research online, I have found a few complaints similar to mine. I won't even put myself through calling Emerson customer service, because I value my sanity and don't want to take my frustration out on some unsuspecting CS rep who is just reading from a script.

Lanner93,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2024","This product worked well for me for over a year. However, there has recently been an update to the software that now preferentially runs the auxiliary heat source (in my case, the electric heat pump) over primary (gas furnace).

The product’s settings do not allow you to specify when you want your auxiliary power source to kick in (or if you want to use it at all). There is a “boost” setting that turns all heating stages when there is a three degree difference in current temperature verses desired temperature. However, disabling this has resulted in an increase in the auxiliary heat source usage. (See screenshot of usage - it is in the negative degrees Fahrenheit where I live- the red is the auxiliary heat source and orange primary. I disabled the boost feature on the 12th). In my case, the additional usage of the auxiliary power source has increased my electrical bill by over $100 a month (heat pump inefficient in such cold conditions + much more expensive for me to heat with electricity than gas).

I’ve reached out multiple times to customer service about this issue, but I’ve only received nonsense replies (not remotely addressing the issue I’m facing). The customer service agents either don’t understand their product or do not read their messages thoroughly.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Guy,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2020","I have to say that at first this thing was great. I bought it two years ago and it worked flawlessly for two years and had it kept working it would've earned 5 stars.

The problem with this thing is that I think either the software is faulty or they did some updates that really screwed up how it works. The settings used to be straight forward and following the manual got the setup done no problem. However, recently, the setup menu became horrendous, I can't even figure out how to change the wifi password from the menu. That's bad design.

The next issue is that this thing turns my fan on non-stop. After the temperature is met, the fan turns off then is immediately turned back on, this goes on for hours I thought maybe it was the humidity setting or I accidentally put my fan to 'on' instead of 'auto' but that wasn't it. After working for 2 years it just recently decided to do this.

How do I know it's this unit and not my centra AC/Heat system? Well, because after I detached the head unit from my wall (you just pull the display off the wall) l, the fan finally stopped. Horrible. Absolutely horrible. If I hadn't heard the fan it might've kept running indefinitely, wearing out the motor and running up my electric costs. This is inexcusably bad. Negative stars for that.

My system is a bit older and doesn't have the C wire which what some are saying is causing some of these smart home units to run the fan non-stop, but I swear the system mounting kit described how to wire the system and it was supposed to be compatible.

Either way, this is horrendous. Do some research and stay way from this crap.

I almost made the mistake of installing this at my mother in law's, thank goodness they didn't want it. I would feel guilty if it broke their ac/heating and ran up their electric costs.

This was the 2nd unit I was working on, so I opened the 3rd thermostat and completed the installation with that one, no problems. Since then, I have been trying to get this thermostat exchanged through warranty with Emerson (I was not able to start installing them until after the return window with Amazon had closed). It takes the people at Sensi days and days to answer an email - sometimes I have to resend - and I have never had anyone answer the support line even after being on hold for 30 minutes or longer. When they do answer my emails, it is obvious they have not read my email or understand my problem, as they ask me irrelevant questions or offer solutions that have nothing to do with my issue.

Support told me it was bad and that I needed to put back my Honeywell until they could get me a replacement. After a few weeks they told me that it would be quicker for me to buy a replacement and they would reimburse as soon as they received the defective unit. The replacement worked fine and I drove 20 minutes to the Fedex store with my defective unit and the email from support with the Fedex shipping number.

I asked for the most economical shipping option and paid the $18.93 out of pocket to ship it to the attention of the person on the cancelled Fedex label. Sensi has not looked into why they cancelled that label but said that since they sent me the label they would not reimburse me for the shipping charge.

BigCrab,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2021","Updating this; I orginally gave this a 5 star review but after a couple days and on hold with support for an hour and a half I have to give it a 1 star and here is why:
it's easy to install however just so you know there are no instructions. so you install it and hope for the best but nope. my unit, (normal gas furnace with ac unit outside), was running for 30 seconds then shutting off. then back on for a while and off. repeatedly. well apparently there are setting for professionals only. you have to try google to use them. it came from the factory to be used with a 2 stage electric heat pump apparently. ok. so I now have it on gas and single stage. Now comes the big issue. the unit runs for a couple minutes and shuts off then back on in a few minutes. if you know about these you know it's the ""swing"". how low the temp goes before the unit kicks on. THERE IS NO SWING CONTROL. customer service said sensi is a ""TIGHT unit"". their words. and has a permanent swing built in of .5 degrees. this is incredibly inefficient. it fights to keep your room at EXACTLY the temp you set. it will increase your heating bill by 30% and think about the wear on your equipment!! it's going to burn it up much much faster. most swings are 1.5 to 2 degrees. warms up a house it cools down then warms back up. this maintains the same temp no matter the work. if you have money and dont mind then it might be perfect but for majority of users it's not practical whatsoever.

user,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2021","Buyer beware! If your HVAC system was working fine before you purchased this thermostat you likely received a faulty thermostat (or two) like I did that cannot activate both heat and cool.

I purchased the Sensi thermostat at first after installation everything seemed to be working fine (I only tested my heat so be sure to test BOTH zones right away). The heat worked fine on the thermostat but I found out there was an issue only after I tried to turn on my air conditioning a few weeks later. After double checking all of the wiring and settings, trying the O/B switch and resetting the thermostat hot air was still coming out. Wondering if maybe I received a defective thermostat I purchased a second smart thermostat from a separate retailer (to try and get a different batch of thermostats for sourcing etc.) and after a reinstall had the same issues.

Thinking there may have been a problem with my HVAC system I then paid to have a technician come out (from a SENSI partner company) and inspect my system. The technician started by looking at the thermostat wiring which was all in order. They then inspected my heat pump and HVAC system which was also all in order. The technician then came to the conclusion that I had indeed purchased a SECOND defective thermostat. To confirm this, the technician wired the system to activate the air conditioning and it indeed worked.

Finally on the third replacement thermostat I received a product that functions properly but if I had known it would have been this much of a headache and extra expense I would not have purchased this product to begin with. I have reached out to Emerson to reimburse me the cost of the HVAC tech I had to call, but I'm not holding my breath.

Gene,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2022","Update- August 2023. My heat is on. The thermostat is turned off, but the heat's on and my home is an oven. The best guess I have is that this thermostat charges the battery when the heat is on, and when the battery is low turns on the heat to charge itself. The same thing happened when I tried a Nest. So it doesn't need the C-wire, but be prepared to have the heat on in the Summer.

I'm updating my review. When I received the thermostat the installation stated that it wouldn't function without a C wire (despite the description). I called for help and I was told it wouldn't function without a C-wire. With a little push, they were able to tell me how to install it without a C wire, but stated the battery life would be horrible. I am dropping a star for the experience where I have to call for instructions while the app tells me I can't install it.
I have had it installed for 1 month at this time (Feb, 2023) and the battery still reads full. It has functioned well, and if you don't have a C wire seems the only way to go. I'll update when I have to replace the batteries.

1. No installation instructions but that’s OK. We can get those through the app online.
2. No card to tell us the code needed to activate the SMART capability. I paid an HVAC Tech to wait on hold for 10 minutes before we gave up

AmazonBuyer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2019","I have installed 15-20 thermostats over the last ~20 years so I'm not a newbie to this process. A thermostat install usually takes me 10-15 minutes if the wiring is already in place. In this situation, the wiring was in place (40 year old house so wiring wasn't that old). That said, I wasted 3.5 hours on this installation (along with troubleshooting) AND it still won't work.

The first challenge was connecting to my house wifi. My phone and the thermostat did not want to cooperate with the home wifi (the router is in the same room as the thermostat and my connection to other devices at that time was fine so I had a strong signal). Each time the connection would take, it would disconnect a few minutes later and I'd have to start from scratch entering multiple passwords into the app. Very frustrating.

I finally got the connection to stick for a while as I attempted to test the AC (as well as the heat). Nothing. I checked my circuit box to make sure the breakers were in the correct position...they were...went back to thermostat...nothing. I took the batteries out to force a reset...nothing. I unscrewed and screwed the wires...nothing. I checked the ""outdoor"" and ""indoor"" configuration settings and they were accurate. I even tried a couple modifications to the settings in case the device was wired incorrectly...nothing.

I finally gave up and reinstalled my old thermostat and the AC turned on immediately.

I expected this to take a bit longer than a typical installation due to the ""smart"" component (installing the app on the phone and connecting the device to the wifi), but 3.5 hours and still no functioning thermostat is not acceptable.

To top it off, I didn't attempt to install this thermostat until after the 30-day return period, so now I have a $100 reminder of my wasted time (and money).

Don't expect it to last longer than 3 years. It may, but if it doesn't you will get zero help from the company.

The thermostat was working fine, then one day I got an alert that the indoor temp was reading high. I checked and it was reading 80 when it was only 70 inside. I eventually determined the thermostat was running entirely off the internal batteries instead of the external C-wire power (even though the C-wire was still delivery power as confirmed via multimeter). This was generating a lot of heat since the wifi was running off the internal batteries as well. The extra heat was causing the room temperature reading to be too high. There had been no physical damage to the unit. It just sat there for 3 years, working fine, until one day it stopped working.

Strawberry Burrito,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2019","1 star for wasting my time with your advertising jargon.

I bought this thermostat because I was interested in having a unit that I could call with an API and essentially control the temperature of my house with my own code. From what I can tell this thermostat use to have an API that Emerson has since removed in order to make more money with subscription services to control multiple thermostats at once.

This thermostat is advertised as DIY, so I figured that was referring to the API and home automation control you would have over it, but it was just referring to the fact that you could install it yourself.... JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER THERMOSTAT! So really this is just some fancy advertising.

Also they do not even have a webpage that you can control your thermostat with you have to use the mobile app, or go up to the unit.

If you don't care about programming your thermostat and only want the added ability to control a thermostat from your phone over the internet this might be a good choice for you because it was reasonably priced and had an easy to use and nice looking interface.

I think the fact that Emerson had an API and then they removed it and started charging to control multiple thermostats at once is super shady and makes me not want to support there business.

I emailed Emerson about API access and they never responded.

Spent 30 minutes on hold with the customer support just to hear ""it sounds like it's trying to connect to a different band on your router than the downstairs one did"". O.k. Which band did the downstairs one connect to? ""There is no way to display that information. Just make sure your connecting to the same band."" But I have no way of knowing which one that was. Apparently it will connect with whichever wifi your phone is on. And it has to be 2.4ghz My phone is connected to the 2.4 on and the device is attempting to connect to the same but I still get the error message. I tried to connect to the other band just in case, and it doesn't even see the device.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Rich P,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2020","This thermostat had a very difficult installation with the wire terminals (you had to be perfect with the alignment or the thermostat would not screw in. The wifi connection for me is stable unlike with some other reviewers, but if you lose power or connection, you have to manually reconnect including password, and that would be extremely problematic if away from the home. As a traveler, this would be a problem.

There are three extremely frustrating things about this thermostat. This thermostat does not have circulating fan without a firmware update (which clears your entire setup information when you induce the update). The power settings between being powered by the furnace electrical terminal and my I had two interactions with customer support who certainly did not have any idea on how the device worked and coffee read from a script. I had an HVAC tech test the C-wire power (my neighbor), and the proper 30 V was supplied which made the switch from C wire power to battery inexplicable. There is no setting in the firmware to force the power option to only use the wiring and not the battery. Finally, everything about the customer service experience, particularly the technical support, ends in ""you need a professional HVAC technician to look at your connection"" which is not correct as the wiring and power are not in question, the firmware and the memory settings of the ST-55 are.

I will tolerate this for a week but will probably return in favor of another version for my power company's rebate.",1.0 out of 5 stars

So, I asked for a replacement. No, they can't do that, they first have to verify that someone else in my house was not manually changing the settings! I told them that the only person in the house was me. Still they needed verification. How I asked? They were going to have me ""lock out"" my thermostat so they could monitor it. How was I going to do that I asked? They would send me instructions on how to ""lock out"" the wall unit and then wait to see if the temperature changes.

Gerald Morlitz,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2018","I purchased 4 sensi wireless thermostats a couple of months ago. We live in the Northeast and will be away for the winter. I wanted to be able to monitor the house temperature.

The 4 thermostats were installed by a professional (the person who installed the gas fired hot water system 4 years ago) and controlled heat only. A/C is on separate thermostats.

The appeared to work, but over time the battery indicator showed reduced battery level. I contacted sensi and spoke to a sensi representative. He told me that when they remotely reviewed my connection, all thermostats were on battery power rather than house power. He told me that the thermostats require 20 to 30 volts to operate from house current and if they operate only on battery, the batteries will probably last from 3 to 6 months. When they have no battery power they are as effective as door stops. Obviously, that’s an unacceptable risk for me.

I got my voltmeter and checked the wiring. I’m getting 26 or 27 volts at the thermostat. I tried to contact sensi by both e-mail and phone and have received no response.

Since I no longer have time to make a change to the sensi thermostats and check them, I replaced the sensi thermostats with the Honeywell and Lux programmable thermostats that I previously used. I am not pleased with sensi service.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Grand Dad,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2021","April 2021:
I installed the thermostat myself. It was not difficult. The instructions were pretty clear. I tested the cooling and the heating after installing to make sure it worked. Then about two months later, the cooling quit working. I called an HVAC technician because I thought the air conditioner was low on gas. The suction line was not cold. The tech did a lot of troubleshooting and decided the thermostat was bad. He replaced it with a Honeywell and the cooling came back.. He said the problem was that the thermostat is supposed to put our a 24 volt signal to start the compressor and it was only putting out about 18 volts. So I spent $400 to found out my $100 thermostat had crapped out. Sensi tech service has been a joke. First they wanted copies of the photos of my old thermostat wiring. Surprise! I had it and sent it. No comment from them. They did not expect that. Then they said for me call and help troubleshoot. Troubleshoot what? The HVAC professional said it was bad and replaced it and the unit started working. They have a serious problem at Emerson.
November 2021 Update:

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2023","I loved this for the first 2 months of having this.

We bought it because we have a Duplex that shares a furnace. It initially worked wonderfully.

After 2 months it was continually “offline” in the APP.

Finally I deleted the device from the app and completely reinstalled it as a new device. (I had already tried to reconnect successfully several times, but that would last less than a day).

Then I had around 2-4 months of continuous successful control from my APP. Last week the “offline thermostat” started again. It also sometimes doesn’t say offline but shows that I CAN control it and nothing happens when I try.

AC,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2020","I've had three of these units running 3 HVAC units in the house for years with no problems. A few weeks ago, one of them dropped the wifi signal. I reset the unit, the router, the wifi, everything. It always reset, but kept dropping the wifi signal within the hour again.

I figured it was broken, so I bought this NEW unit to replace the old one. But... same thing. Keeps dropping the signal just like the other one. In other words, I can always make the unit reestablish the connection, but it doesn't last.

Keep in mind there are 2 other units in the house with zero problems that have been running properly for YEARS.

I bought a new Netgear Access Point, so there is a stronger 2.4G signal in the house. No luck.

Reconfigured the router by moving the channels to less ""busy"" channels. No luck.

Reserved the IP via the unit's MAC. No luck.

Reconfigured the router dozens of times with different protocols and settings to see if there was something the unit wasn't agreeing wit. No luck.

In short, the only thing that makes sense is the older unit went bad. And the new unit arrived not working.

Nothing else makes sense.

My husband has done electrical work in the past so it was very easy hooking the wires up especially with the app guidance. Get everything connected, turn on the ac and the furnace turns on, no way to turn it off unless you flip the breaker off. We knew we had everything wired correctly but called customer service and sent them all the pictures of our wiring he confirmed we had everything right and said he had no idea why it only turns on the furnace. Go through all theses steps to reset it and 45 mins later it starts working, got off the phone with the customer service since the ac seems to be fine now and try to connect the unit to WiFi with the app and it turns off the ac immediately and turns on the furnace but the app hadn’t even connected to the unit!! There was nothing telling the unit to turn on the furnace! And the display still said ‘cooling’ but was blowing hot air. So the conclusion seems to be that this thermostat will only work for ac if it isn’t on WiFi which is the whole point of having it. Such a piece of junk! We spent hours of frustration trying to make it work, I would not recommend to an enemy even.

Nolan H,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2020","This thing was on the list of BEST Wi-Fi thermostats. I wasn't going to pay $150 to $200 for a Nest or something like that. Got this to replace the thermostat that had to have been over 25yrs old from the previous homeowners (just bought the house a month ago).

I had to re-boot this thing 4 times so far & still having the same issue. Hooked it up the same way the previous one was set at, which it did not have issues & only had a HEAT or COOL selection. Here with the Sensi, ONLY Aux-Heat works & it very slowly moves the temperature up. The Heat selection turns on the AC.

Maybe I will change my review but for time being it is staying a 1*.

Also, the features are not great for night time usage. Since it doesn't have a touch screen, you need to touch a menu button to get the backlight to turn on, which means you then need to press the back button to get to the main page to see the temperature. Then the buttons don't light up so you need to just know where the up & down buttons are. I'd say this feature makes no sense b/c for a thermostat you'd think that waking up in the middle of the night & realizing it is colder than you expect is one of the more likely times you'll be frantically looking for your thermostat.

I thought my plumber was hustling me until I took the unit to my Big Box hardware store and we compared my amazon Sensi thermostat to the same item in the store! Sure enough my Sensi thermostat was missing a piece.

My Sensi thermostat arrived in a plain plastic envelope with no padding. The box was slightly crushed and there was no Saran Wrap, shrink wrap, cellophane on it like at Home Depot! I don’t know if it was new or used.

It came with 2 AA batteries, no mounting screws; My plumber had to use the old screws to mount the unit to the wall. As my plumber was installing it he believed that some screws were missing and some of my wires from my HVAC system could not be connected. He was correct and the unit was missing a small black piece with 3 screws. I know this because I asked my master plumber coworker to compare it to new out of the box units.

Brittany Frank,"Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2019","So, it was easy to install which was the only saving grace. After a while though, you have to re-install it over and over again. If not, you walk into an 80 degree home. I installed it end of June and started having issues with it in the beginning of August. I keep my home cool, because of where I live (it feels like the surface of the sun sometimes) — so its hottest is 76 and 70 at bedtime. But, because I live in Tampa, FL (lightning capital of the Western Hemisphere), I thought maybe it lost power or WiFi connection. But even with power and no loss in WiFi connection, I’d have to reset it — DAILY! Then it would take 2 hours to turn on. I even had my AC serviced — no help. The AC would NOT turn on, despite it being 83 and set at 74. I could drop it to 59 (lowest setting) still wouldn’t go on. Then I would turn off everything: HVAC, breaker AND reset the thermostat and it STILL wouldn’t start cooling when put back on. So, needless to say, despite the feature of Alexa integration, this is the WORST thermostat I’ve ever used and I have used wireless thermostats for the last 15 years.

Phillip Baxter,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024","There is so much I like about this thermostat.

Pros:
The setup is great, the easiest I’ve ever installed. The app is great, very well laid out and makes scheduling super easy. I think the thermostat actually looks good. I don’t want my thermostat to look like something out of a sci-fi movie. It’s really intuitive for anyone to change the settings on the thermostat.

Cons:
It’s a big one, it short cycles like crazy. It’s like the software programmers for this thermostat were trying to make the system run as many cycles per hour as possible. You can see from my pics, the system turned off at 5:03, then back on at 5:09, then back off again at 5:16. The temperature never changed the whole time. I have cycle settings set to “slow”. This is supposed to make it cycle the least, and have the longest runtime. Well it runs for 6-9 minutes, then it’s off for 5-7 minutes. I had this thermostat installed for a week, and this is how it ran the whole time. Rapid cycling like this leads to increased humidity, decreased efficiency, and decreased HVAC equipment life. It takes a good 3 minutes for your HVAC system to cool down to operating temperature after the system starts. That 3 minutes is essentially wasted energy, it doesn’t contribute to cooling your home. That’s why longer runtimes are better, they have a bigger percentage of their runtime spent actually cooling your home. Longer runtimes are better for your compressor too, the biggest stresses on the compressor are at startup. Reducing the number of startups of the compressor leads to longer compressor life. This thermostat does the opposite.

Solution suggestion for Sensi:
If the designers of this thermostat would just add a couple of user settings, this would be my favorite thermostat out there. They need to add a compressor minimum runtime setting that users can enable, they also need to add a temperature differential setting that would allow users to set the thermostat to not turn on the compressor until the temperature is above the setpoint by 1 degree, and not turn off the compressor until the temperature is below the setpoint by 1 degree. These 2 settings would fix the short cycling issue.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Y2i,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2024","An update: The issue with WiFi was related to our network setup: we use the same network name (SSID) for 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. After assigning a different name to 5 GHz band, the unit connected to WiFi and has not lost connections for 3 days in a row. For the customers who have WiFi connection problems, and there are many based on the reviews, please assign different names to 2.4 and 5 GHz bands, and connect your thermostat to 2.4 GHz band.

The first thermostat works well now and we were about to rise the rating from 1 to 5 stars when we ran into another issue with the second unit. When we installed it to control a split system (an outdoor heat pump and an indoor electric air handler), the unit burnt the fuse that supplies 24 V to the fan controller board. After installing the old thermostat and replacing the fuse we found out that only one LED out of the four on the board is blinking. The air handler fan is working, but the outdoor heat pump is not. We ordered a replacement board and are hoping that the board was the only thing that was damaged by this thermostat. Please be careful when you are connecting this thermostat to a split system and when O/B wires are involved.

----------------------------------
We bought this unit because of the excellent customer reviews. It was installed yesterday without the C wire. It connected to WiFi and we were able to set up a schedule. Everything worked fine, but then the unit disconnected from WiFi , and the app kept showing that the thermostat was offline.

Some reviewers said that without the C wire the unit will simply drain the battery when WiFi is used. Today I ran the C wire and removed the batteries. The unit connected to WiFi right away and stayed connected for a while. Then it disconnected again, and now the app says that the thermostat is offline and the WiFi signal strength is low. But my phone shows excellent signal strength because the router is only 5 feet away.

The unit controls the furnace as expected without WiFi, but we already had a no-WiFi thermostat and wanted to control the new thermostat remotely, so it does not serve the intended purpose, hence the low rating.

It can be warm out and stay at 65, but at some point as it cools down, it calls for heat while still displaying 65. Sensi on line support chat first said the differential is ""not adjustable, it would defeat the purpose being comfort"". The admitted it can adjusted and defended that the differential of 1.9 is half in either direction, but could never explain the math of 1.9 total being more that one that it should show 64 before calling for heat. Its either a rounding of tenths issue, it doesnt work, or it is not actualy adjusting to a 1.9 differential.

The thermostat is okay. I wish there was a way to dim the backlighting. I like that the app warns you of an issue.

However I wish that more settings could be handled in the app as opposed to on the physical thermostat so that if I am out of town and my internet at home goes down I can restore the thermostat to my chosen settings. I have a heat pump and after an internet outage, my thermometer reset to the setting that caused my heat pump to blow hot air instead of cold for about six hours. The app sent me a warning message to my phone which was nice but I could not do anything about at until I go home.
When I finally got home, my home was 88 degrees! My cats were miserable. Fortunately I was able to reset the setting. But if I had been out of town, I would not have been able to do so.

Note that the batteries are supposed to prevent changes to the settings, but that did not occur. I tested my batteries with my multimeter tool, and they were fine.

One thing that would solve this problem is if there was actually a physical switch in the thermostat for setting the heat pump.

Masternav,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2023","I wanted to replace a manual thermostat for my gas fireplace with a smart device, because we've accidentally left it on at night too many times. Every other smart thermostat I've looked at requires a C-wire, and the product information indicates that it isn't required. HOWEVER, the setup app will not progress if the user doesn't indicate that they have a C-wire. Reading the reviews, I found that the thermostat should actually work with only a two wire installation. I connected the wires to the same terminals that were in use for the old thermostat, and everything worked. The next hurdle was connecting the new smart thermostat to my Wi-Fi. An 8 digit PIN is required, and the directions state that it's on the back of the [already installed] thermostat and again on a pamphlet included with the package. The pamphlet PIN didn't work, so I had to take the thermostat off the wall. Sure enough, it had a different PIN than the paperwork had. Once I reinstalled on the wall and used the ACTUAL PIN from the back of the thermostat, everything connected. But the wifi connection doesn't last and has to be completed nearly every time it's accessed--useless as a smart device.

So why 2 stars instead of 1?
1. Looks nice.
2. Turns the AC on and Off
3. Has setting to have just the fan run a % every hour.

Now the bad-
1. Support is horrible. Had wifi connection issues during setup and was on hold for close to 30 minutes. Had a couple more issues during this time and on hold just as long every time and got the same tech every time. Only one support agent employed here or what? ( Had a different brand prior and their support always answered within a few minutes).

2. Temperature swing/ cycle rate - During peak hours the thermostat was cutting on and off 6-7 times per hour. Basically it would run for 10 minutes and shut off for 10 minutes over and over. This draws more power and will decrease the longevity of your ac due to increased wear and tear. It is better for the unit to remain on longer than do what this thermostat causes it to do. Another issue with this is that by only running 10 minutes or less at a time it doesn't allow enough time for the AC to draw the humidity out of the home. Here in Florida this is an absolute must. They have a setting called Cool or Heat cycle rate. The settings are Slow, Medium, Fast. Supposedly these are supposed to allow a swing within 1.9 degrees but setting to each made no real difference. I did seem to notice that while on fast the AC was on for less but still came on 10 minutes after shutting off which now increased the amount of times it was cycling on and off, UGH.
Ideally the unit if set to 74 should cool to 72.5 and then kick back on at 75.5. My dumb $25 Walmart thermostat is capable of this but the smart $100 isn't?

3. Scheduling is kinda strange. Took a bit to get used to and then found that if you added a new setting to the day group (a set time with the temp you want) it cannot be deleted. So while playing with it I now have 8 different times in the day that I have to set temps for even though the 4 in the middle are to remain the same.

4. Support is horrible. Yes I know this was number one but it is worth mentioning again. Emailed the company over a week ago about the cycle rate issue and to date I only have the auto reply that my email was received and I would be contacted shortly.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Tolerable issues. But the thermostat ""wore out"" after six years. In its fifth season, the thermostat wouldn't keep the heating stove on. If one overrode the programming for the current time, the stove would come on for up to a minute and then turn off. Ugh, probably an issue with the thermopile as the pilot light was still on. However overriding the temperature again would bring the heating stove on for another minute before the stove shut down again.

Bought another non-Emerson thermostat and no more issues with the stove. As stove worked with new thermostat, the fault lay with the thermostat.

J. Robinson,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2017","I really like the idea of smart home products. Unfortunately I've had so many issues connecting this thermostat to my Wi-Fi that I've been forced to use it as a dumb device. Let me start off by saying that I've worked in IT for about 10 years and by day-to-day job is designing, configuring and installing wireless networks. So I feel like I have a little knowledge in this area. I currently have a couple of TP-Link smart plugs and an Orbit smart sprinkler system controller which all connected to my wireless network without issue. This thermostat is an exception to this and I have wasted several hours and contacted Emerson support multiple times in an attempt to get it to connect. When I was finally able to get the thermostat to connect to my network it was more by luck than anything else. I didn't do anything differently compared to my several dozen other attempts. It just happened to work that time.

Things were great for about 2 weeks until the battery indicator went from showing fully charged one morning to almost dead by the afternoon and the Wi-Fi had disconnected.

At this point I'm not sure if I have the heart to spend hours trying to get it to reconnect. Based on the many positive reviews for this device I'm left to wonder if I have a defective unit or if there's something specifically about my network that it doesn't like.

Kevin Fitzpatrick,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2019","While 99.9% of this product works and I thought the installation was a chore but reasonable and well supported, for me a fatal flaw persists after nearly three weeks of use. The Sensi-Alexa integration fails on a frequent basis and has to be reset. While others may not be as annoyed with a problem like this, the attached excerpt from the case correspondence with Emersion details my thinking for taking a hard line. I will will revise this review with a 4-5 rating if Emerson solves the problem before my patience expires and I replace the product.

I reported the initial problem of Sensi losing its Alexa integration on 1/4/19, Case number 00316555 was created.

After watching the issues over the last 2+ weeks it is clear what the problem is. Sensi simply loses its account linking in the overnight hours with Alexa 3-4 times a week, not every day. The Sensi service, as managed by its app, has never failed. The issue simply seems to be the integration with Amazon’s service. It is easy to resolve and Alexa tells you what to do, simple disable and then re-enable the skill, a process that re-links the accounts.

While this is only issue I have with Sensi, it is fatal. I will replace this product with a competitive device that does not have this bug. I will give it some time since it does appear to be a correctable software issue at the cloud level. I will not put up with it indefinitely. I will manage my smart home with Alexa (or google depending on whoever first allows mass customization of the Wake word) and any compatible skill/service must interoperate flawlessly with these assistants. I will not have the time I saved from implementing automation to be stolen back from me by persistent administration tasks caused by correctable bugs.

As an ancillary note, when I first reported this issue some discussion was had about the problem relating to/caused by the use Alexa routines. This is not the case, I have tested this extensively. Addressing a thermostat action via routine never causes the integration of the accounts to break. My routines run daily, it does not fail every day. I forced routines to run thermostat actions while I was not sleeping, so I could watch the actions in real time. The integration never failed during these tests.

Mel,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019","I was looking for a smart thermostat without breaking the bank and without the need for any fancy features like self learning based on your habits for example. Got a good deal on the Sensi and decided to try it out. I downloaded the app before purchasing and was able to check my existing wiring to see if the Sensi was compatible for my system. The app is simple and goes through the all the necessary steps for set up. You will need the C wire for this thermostat.

Once I confirmed compatibility, and after delivery, following the instructions on the app took me through the process of removing the old thermostat and installing the Sensi. It was a very easy and logical process which even a novice at home improvement can follow. The only slight hitch in setting up the system was ensuring that the wire connection was secure - a couple of the wires came loose after I thought I had screwed them in. Really not a big deal but I gently tugged on the wires to ensure that they were not loose. The Sensi thermostat attaches to The wall by clipping into the wall plate that is provided. Luckily for me the old wall plate holes were in the right spot for the new Sensi wall plate. Before clipping the thermostat on ensure that the wires are flush with the wall as instructed by the app.

Connecting to WiFi was fairly easy and it was done through the app on my iPhone. The thermostat is only compatible with 2G WiFi so you have to make sure your phone is connected to the 2G network while going through this part of the setup if you have a dual band router (you can switch your phone back to the 5G network after if you wish). WiFi connection was made quickly although the thermostat did take 30 or so seconds to be fully responsive to my phone after I thought the connection was completed (I initially thought I needed to go through a troubleshooting process but did not need to complete that process).

Once fully connected you can easily adjust temperatures in the app, set up schedules and use a variety of options e.g. display humidity etc. There is also a geofencing option if you wish to use that. I set up my iPhone to be able to use Siri to adjust temperatures. You’ll need to set up your iPhone Home app for that. Once again the app runs you through all the steps to do that. I also set up my wife’s phone for her to have the feature that allows her to use Siri. Initial attempts to set her Home app to connect with the thermostat using Siri were unsuccessful until I realized that I could simply share my iPhone Home app settings with hers (just had to make sure to switch to the shared home app profile and not the original default one on her phone). If you do not wish to use Siri you can simply use the controls in the Sensi app and do not have to go though the Home app set up.

I’ve had the thermostat for a week now and I love it. The thermostat is very responsive to changes made within the Sensi app or when using Siri (usually within 1-2 seconds). I also like that I can view ‘Usage’ within the app to see how long the furnace has been active. The app will also allow you to check to see if you are eligible for rebates based on energy savings programs for your area.

Of course if you need to change app settings on the thermostat itself it is very easy to do so. There is a feature in the app that allows you to lock the wall display and only be able to change settings, temps etc through the app if you do not want people to change temps or settings through the wall display.

Overall a great thermostat. Easy setup. Easy to use. Great features. Very responsive when using your phone. 5 stars plus!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Brandi,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2020","We've had this thermostat a month and I really like it so far. It makes me think our old thermostat wasn't actually working for a long time before it started setting itself to 85°. Since it wasn't even programmable, I knew it had to go and if I was going to upgrade I may as well go with something just a bit more...modern than a set-temp-and-it-stays-unless-you-change-it thermostat. I'm going to do pros and cons below. I do want to say, I took my old thermostat off the wall first, wrote down all the wire colors and the letter each was connected to on a piece of paper. The app removes the need for pen and paper. I just used my pen and paper to place the flags mentioned below on the correct wires.

Pros:
1. This thing is super easy to install. Open the box and there are instructions for you to download the Sensi app. Once the app is downloaded it has you choose which letter slots you have wires connected to (R, RH, C, E, OB, etc.). The app then tells you how to use the flags they provide to label the wires. For example I had a wire that went into a slot labeled ""R"", but Sensi only had ""RH"" and ""RC"" (I think it was RC), so the app told me which R my wire needed to go in. Not having any electrical wiring experience, the app was SUPER helpful. It even had you take a picture of your wiring to save to your phone, just in case.

2. The piece that attaches to the wall has a built in level. I am super annoyed when things aren't straight on walls, so this right here, was awesome.

3. The app is really easy to set up. I just have a daytime and nighttime cycle, but I could set up all kinds of things super easily. Vacation modes, turning the AC up when I leave the house... It was great. It even walked me through how to sync the app with my Google assistant and the Samsung Smart Things app, which I didn't end up continuing to use. (See cons #1)

4. The report that tells you how long your AC is running is really helpful as well, especially since we had issues last year with it not being able to keep up. We have better insulation and updated windows and it's nice to see they are working, even when it's 99° with a heat index at 112°. (See cons #2)

5. I like that you can do things like temp and humidity offsets, have the AC turn on to help maintain proper humidity levels (we live in Florida, so this is a big thing for me), change the cycle rate (ended up choosing this one over another brand because people had issues with not being able to adjust the cycle rate on that one), and easily turn heat boost on or off. (See cons #3)

Cons:
1. It doesn't work with Bixby. This is something I don't really understand, but I'm guessing they assume if you're gonna use Bixby you use Smart Things? But I can just use Google for that instead.

2. The recent usage section only shows how long the AC ran that day, not which times it ran or how long at a time it ran. It would be nice to see how long the AC was running at a time, especially in the afternoon when it gets really hot. I have not yet gotten a monthly report since I got the thermostat mid-June and it's now mid-July. Interested to see what the monthly report looks like at the end of the month.

3. Sometimes I had to change settings a couple times before they ""stuck"". I found after changing a setting I needed to wait a few seconds before returning to the settings menu and that helped.

4. Shortly after I got the thermostat the AC drain line clogged. This resulted in my app/thermostat constantly saying cooling was on, but the AC wasn't running. My usage for that day was like 21hrs, but I know it wasn't actually on for the majority of that. Not really a huge issue, but you won't have an accurate reading for that day.

Summary:
Overall, this is a really amazing unit and I have been really glad to have it. It was seriously a breeze to instakl and set up and functions well. I do wish I could connect it to Bixby without using Smart Things and I do wish I had a more detailed daily usage report, but those are very small inconveniences. I normally keep our house at 78° during the day and 77° at night and sometimes that feels cold. I would often feel hot before and wondered if our AC was not working correctly, but it would seem it was actually the thermostat. Very happy with this purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Mister M,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2021","This Sensi thermostat is waaaaaaaaaaay better than Honeywell. The Honeywell software and their mentality is completely OUT OF WACK and their thermostats are pure garbage and it will damage your equipment. The Honeywell Cycle rate is set to about .5+/- so my furnace now in the winter has been running and running nonstop and my furnace was not getting any rest. That is a very bad thing for our heating and A/C system, not to mention the gas and electricity bill. I called Honeywell tech support and they told me that ALL their thermostats have this fixed setting and there is nothing in the menu for us to change that option. Something is really wrong with this Honeywell company and this cycle rate setting is simply inappropriate.

I just installed my new Emerson Smart Sensei and even the WI-FI connectivity process went very smoothly and I successfully connected my new thermostat. The Sensi app takes you thru the entire process fairly quickly and is very easy I have no idea what other people are having problems with. Note that I already knew which cables to connect so if you don't know that's a different story. The Honeywell thermostat on the other hand was a nightmare to install thru the app and it simply doesn't work so I had to go to my desktop PC and finish the process there. Really annoying.

And guess what I found out? The Sensi app itself has the options for me to change the Cycle rates to either SLOW, MEDIUM or FAST that was awesome I could not believe it!!! :-) Sensi was so smart by not putting this option in a hidden menu. Honeywell Engineers and marketing department simply don't know what they are doing. I'm looking forward in seeing how my new Sensi thermostat will perform tonight and I'm sure it won't disappoint. This device looks really great on the wall as well. The Honeywell WI-FI cost me $79 on sale and this Sensi costs more but is TOTALLY worth it!

The only thing I didn't like is that a day before purchasing this device I contacted Sensi tech support and took one entire hour to pick up the phone and someone from the Philippines picked up the phone eventually. This is not acceptable. Other than that I completely recommend this thermostat.

UPDATE: This Emerson Sensi Smart thermostat is definitely a superior product. Only while running it in one day you can see and hear the difference. I set the cycle rate to SLOW and boy what a difference! The thermostat outputs the heat in a very smooth way and when the it reaches the set temperature it stops for several minutes and it DEFINITELY does not restart in 30 seconds like the Honeywell ones. I have no idea what problems others are having that complain saying this thermostat doesn't work but I can tell you that is not the case. The software and hardware is really well made and nice looking as well. I prefer this Sensi to those ugly round looking ""high tech"" and over priced thermostats.",5.0 out of 5 stars
music on vinyl,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2019","Very happy with multiple Sensi wi-fi smart thermostat installations. Well implemented app and easy to follow directions for various types of applications. If you don’t have a “C” wire, it’s relatively easy to add one. You need a 24 volt plug in transformer (about $14 on Prime), and some thermostat wiring. The transformer and 2 wire thermostat wire are independent from your furnace and other thermostat wiring. You just connect one end of the two wires to the transformer, and the other end of the two wires to the correct terminals on the thermostat, and plug the transformer into a traditional electrical outlet. Your existing thermostat wiring just gets transferred to the matching terminal markings on the Sensi. Great flexibility with settings and programming with the user friendly app. Controlling and monitoring your temperature and thermostat from anywhere remotely is very handy. Great way to jump into the smart house scene.

Edit 1/26/2020

I think I may have discovered the reason so many people are having issues with their Sensi installs and the constant Wi-Fi connection problems.
I have four Sensi smart thermostats that I've installed over the course of about a year. The first three installs were very straightforward. Those units have all performed perfectly from the day I installed them. Not a single dropped Internet connection or any other issues. The Sensi mobile app is great, and provides amazing control over programming and controlling the thermostats. I have purchased eight of the Sensi thermostats, but have only installed half of them so far. Most of the units I've purchased have been returns that I've bought for about half price online. Most of them have been registered previously with Sensi. It isn't difficult to have them unregistered through an email request that the app prompts you to do. The two caveats are that you will not have remote access or be able to complete the setup of the thermostat until you are able to register it to your account. The thermostat will still function locally like a traditional thermostat, so that's good. The other problem is that  Emerson / Sensi is painfully slow processing requests to unregister thermostats. Count on at least two weeks. You will have to return to the location of the thermostat to finish registering the unit once Emerson gives you the confirmation they unregistered your thermostat. This is the price of buying a returned unit at half price.
The fourth Sensi install has been difficult. I revisited the Amazon listing for the Sensi thermostats. I was hoping to find some answers to my install problems from some of the reviews on Amazon. I was quite surprised on the number of newer negative reviews. I originally chose the Sensi because of the positive reviews online and on Amazon.
I was having a couple of different issues with the install of my fourth Sensi. Each of my installs were unique as they were for different types of heating and cooling units. Most of my installs were for heat only, including the fourth one. The fourth install was for a Modine warehouse style heater. This required 4 wires. Red heat (Rh), White (W/E), Common (C), and Fan (G). I tested the C (common) with a multi-meter. and I was getting right around 26 volts (correct voltage). Testing is done with the Red lead to Rh and the Black lead to C. The C wire completes the connection and provides constant power to the thermostat to power the Wi-Fi Internet connection. I've seen some comments about not needing a C wire for the Sensi. This may be true, but you will eat through batteries if you rely on them to keep power for the Wi-Fi connection. Technically, you do need a C wire for reliable remote access.
My issues included constant dropping of the Wi-Fi and inconsistent operation of the heater and blower / fan. I did check all of the setup parameters for type of heating unit, etc through the app. Everything was set correctly. The Wi-Fi network that this Sensi is connected to is super stable, and has two other Sensi thermostats that maintain reliable connections through Wi-Fi. The issue with the fan I was having is that unless I switched the setting for fan to ""on"", the heat would not kick on. The correct setting on the thermostat for the fan would be ""auto"". When set to ""on"", the fan stays on even when the unit is not heating. If I set my fan setting for ""auto"", the heater would not kick on.
I was fairly confident I had my wiring correct at both the thermostat and at the transformer on the heater side. It's harder to be certain on the transformer / heater side, because the terminal markings are not consistent from manufacturer to manufacturer. I was lucky enough to find a photo online of the terminal markings and what they represented for my exact Modine unit with the same transformer. I was starting to think that this Sensi unit was defective (like many others do based on negative reviews). I did do some wire swapping, but always ended up back where I started regarding the wiring arrangement. Voltages were all reading accurately at the thermostat. I had the face of the unit on and off from the back plate / wall mount many times. On one occasion, while guiding the thermostat back onto the wall mount, I was applying some upward pressure and heard some electrical clicking at the heater as though it was about to kick on. That was my ""Aha"" moment. The pins that coincide with the thermostat wiring on the main unit / face plate and the related pin openings on the wall mount were not making a good connection. They briefly made a decent connection when I put some increased pressure on the thermostat / face plate. I was able to recreate this heater clicking reaction by pushing on the thermostat. I wasn't certain exactly where the connection was failing (which wire or pin), but I tried a couple of things, and they seemed to have fixed my issues. The first is that I shimmed the back plate away from the wall with a small strip of cardboard behind each end of the back plate and the wall. This would allow the thermostat face plate a little more travel on the wall mount side (deeper seating of the pins). The second thing I did was to go over each thermostat wire where they connect to the back plate / wall mount and reinserted them and made sure that the screws that hold each wire in were very tightly drawn down on each wire. This fixed the fan issue (I was able to set the fan to ""auto"" and have it turn on and off with the heater). This also fixed the Wi-Fi dropping issue. I'm still waiting for Emerson / Sensi to unregister this particular thermostat, and I will revise my review with an update once I have remote access and can confirm these fixes have remained stable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jim Healy,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2024","The reviews conflict as t whether or not this unit requires a ""C"" wire (Common wire). As stated in the product literature, in my installation, a ""C"" wire WAS NOT required.

Installation to replace a previous thermostat was easy; took all of 15 minutes. WiFi access will be helpful in my installation, and it works well with the app. The app is just a remote interface that's identical to the unit face itself.

A couple of days after installation, I got a warning that the temperature of the room was more than 5 degrees above the set temp. The A/C was running, but not keeping up. Traced that to a clogged air filter, but I appreciated the warning message.

Yes, I recommend this unit for price point and function.",5.0 out of 5 stars
M. Yates,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2022","I moved to the East coast last December. We have a six-zone boiler heating system with baseboard heaters throughout 4,200 sq. ft., on three floors (not bragging, just trying to give an idea of the size and complexity of the system). With six old-school manual thermostats spread throughout the house, it was nearly impossible to evenly regulate the heat during the cold winter, so some rooms were very cold and others too warm. I found myself constantly going up and down stairs to monitor temperatures and make sure I wasn't wasting heat or keeping areas too cold that would affect other zones.

My boiler was installed in 2007, so it isn't very old and it's very efficient. However, it's a two-wire system with no C-wire, so the fact that 99.9% of ""smart"" thermostats on the market require a C-wire to operate was very frustrating.

I stumbled across the Emerson ST55 and saw in the description that it could work either with or without a C-wire, so I called Emerson tech support to make sure before I plunked down hundreds of dollars on six thermostats that might not work. Tech support confirmed my fears that it would not work without a C-wire despite the Amazon description, so I kept hunting.

Fortunately I found a YouTube review of the ST55 and the owner said he had been successfully using it with the same kind of two-wire system that I have for over two years. So I figured I'd buy one and see if it worked. Worst case, I'd send it back for a refund.

The instructions inside the box clearly state that it will not work without a C-wire, but I ignored them and kept going. With only two wires it was a breeze to install. I put in the batteries, snapped it into the wall plate, downloaded the app, created an account and was ready for testing in about 15 minutes.

I'm not sure if it's just my system or all boilers, but I didn't realize it doesn't turn on instantly when the thermostat temperature is raised above the existing temperature. So when I first tested it, I was bummed that it didn't work. But as I walked downstairs to the boiler, it was running! So I did some more testing, and found that there's about a 20-25 second delay between increasing the temp and the boiler kicking in.

Granted it's only been a couple months since I got it, but I've played with it plenty and it's working great. Instead of a C-wire, the thermostat is powered by two AA batteries. The guy in the video said he's been using the same regular alkaline batteries for two years and they're still at 90% charge capacity, which is awesome. But I figure that even if I have to replace batteries every year, 12 AA batteries is a helluva lot cheaper than paying an electrician to rewire all six zones!

On top of the six heat zones, I also have two central AC units. Thankfully those have C-wires, but I'm going to replace those thermostats with the Emerson ST55 also so that I'll have full control of all heating and cooling from one simple-to-use app. With any luck it'll go on sale on Prime Day so that I can save some money! :-)

I can't speak to the Alexa integration as I don't use that functionality. But plenty of other reviewers have said it works fine.

I appreciate Emerson's thoughtfulness in adding a built-in level to the back plate. I'm a stickler about things being mounted straight, so it was nice to not have to break out a level to make sure I didn't mount it crooked.

As for aesthetics, the ST55 is nice. It's not too large to look obnoxious, but it has a good-sized display. And I'm not sure if it's just because I'm running it on battery, but the back light doesn't stay on constantly, so it doesn't light up a dark room at night (not too important in common areas, but important if you've got a thermostat in a bedroom).

So, to make a long story short, don't believe Emerson. This thing really does work on a two-wire boiler heat system with no need for a C-wire!",5.0 out of 5 stars
James W.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2020","(Long, but I hope worth the read) Overall, I am extremely happy with the Emerson Sensi smart thermostat. For me it was a pretty easy project, but it is important that you know what type of cooling/heating system you have prior to attempting the installation. Although the basic installation is made very simple using the Sensi app, there were some very important things not covered. I suggest you check out how to configure your Sensi on their site (Configuring Thermostat | Sensi US (emerson.com)). I’m a pretty good DIYer, but have very little experience with AC/heating systems. I was 99% sure I had a heat pump setup, but I called a local AC technician I know to confirm and am glad I did. Having installed a few smart thermostats, to include this one, he not only confirmed I had a heat pump, he also informed me I would have to go into the system settings on the thermostat and change the outside setting from ‘AC1’ to ‘HP1’. This was confirmed when I checked out the Sensi website. Armed with this information, installation went without a hitch and I was up and running in no time.
Pros:
- Easy to install, if you have a little DIY experience, all the information needed concerning your AC/Heating system and gather the additional information before starting.
- Very easy to connect to WiFi and integrate with Google Home. Connected to my WiFi with in seconds following the instructions; when I opened my Google Home app, there was an icon to add Sensi, clicked on it and moved the thermostat to the appropriate room. I have not experienced any drop-offs or loss of the WiFi, even when I turned off my WiFi for a few hours, removed the batters or installed old, weak batteries as tests; in every case, the thermostat remained connected or automatically connected right back up in seconds with no need to go through the WiFi setup operations again.
- The Sensi app, in addition to walking you through the installation, allows you to set up various cooling/heating programs to run automatically, as well as change other settings. Once added to Google Home, you can switch programs (cool, heat, auto), turn it on/off and set the temp. You can also use voice commands through Google to do this as well.
- The ability to adjust the thermostat to compensate for temperature offsets. In my case, where my thermostat is located the temp registers about 3 degrees off from what it is in our master bedroom or living room. I simply adjusted the offset in the Sensi app to compensate for this and now our bedroom and living room remain closer to the set temp then they have in the past.
- It can be operated manually by those less tech savvy. The controls on the face plate look and operate like those on our old ‘conventional’ one. I also like that you can lock out the manual operation from the app so that no one else can mess with the settings; like during the holidays when you have family members over who feel they can change the settings without asking .. lol.
- Being able to adjust the system cycling rates. There are three settings (short, medium, and long) that can be set independently for heat, heat aux and cooling. I don’t mind having my temps vary a degree before the system cycles back on, so I have all mine set to long; during the summer, I may switch cooling to short to see how much of a difference it makes.

Con: I only have one and it is the reason for my 4 rating. The instructions, at least those in the box, should include information on the additional settings that may need to be needed depending on the AC/heating system you have. At a minimum, they should inform you that you may need to make additional setting changes and where to find the instructions online.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Richard,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2018","Purchased this model based on the good reviews and the no requirement for a c-wire. Decided to replace my 17-year old RobertShaw thermostat (t-stat) because I wanted remote capability. I was hesitant to touch A/C wiring whereas I had no experience with A/C wiring. The A/C company wanted $90.00 to install it, but I decided to do it myself since it was just a 4-wire system. (no c-wire). It took me just 15 min to remove the old, and then install/wire up the new t-stat. That's how easy it was. Was able connect the t-stat to my 2Ghz wifi network and used the Sensi app on my mobile. Everything worked just fine. No issues at all with wifi setup and using the app. It works exactly as designed.
You can make t-stats adjustments either by wifi or LTE on your mobile. No delay in signal. My wifi has never lost signal and has stayed up now for 1 week.

The t-stat itself (on wall) has very few settings. Just has temp control, fan/auto/heat/cool and wifi settings. All other settings are done via your mobile. There is also a light switch at the top of the t-stat that when pressed, stays on for 10 seconds, then turns off. BTW: The t-stat light is always off until you press any button. LCD screen is very easy to read with or without the light.

One of my requirements for a t-stat was to have a differential as to how much longer a unit will run once it hits its set temp. This model does not have a adjustable value, but does have a ""cycle rate"" of slow/medium/fast. I set mine to slow to keep it from turning on/off too many times. From the measurements I have taken with a infrared thermometer, the ""slow"" cycle has a differential of 0.7 degrees. This seems to be inline with what Emerson says (actually, they say within 1 degree).

Important note: If your home loses internet access, you will NOT be able to control the t-stat, even when you are at home on your local intranet. Some systems still let you access your devices via the local intranet, but this t-stat require cloud access 24x7.
Now, in case your t-stat screen is locked, and you lose internet connection, you have no way to do any changes on the wall unit since the screen is locked and your mobile is the only way to unlock it. In this case, Emerson has a key sequence you can press on the wall unit to unlock the display. (btw: the screen lock is a feature that you enable on the t-stat to prevent people from making changes on the wall unit)

Small issues:
The light switch at the top of the t-stat is hard to find and press. I never hit it on the first attempt. Always have to feel around at the top and press hard.

There is one problem I constantly hit. I goto my Sensi app and change any setting (temp, lock/unlock screen). The Sensi app accepts the setting changes, so you think all is good. However, when I look at the t-stat on the wall, no changes occurred (see attached picture). This has happened numerous times each day since I have had it. Called support and they are not aware of any issues. In each failure, my wifi signal is up - no problems with wifi.
After a few days of this happening, I see the problem. It does not appear to be the t-stat, but rather the Sensi app itself. It somehow is hung up, but gives the appearance that it is operating. If I kill the app, and restart it, the sync up to the t-stat is working again. Each time that the app behaves this way, I just kill and restart it. Works every time. So, each time I use the app to make a setting change, i just kill the app and restart when I need it.

The accuracy of the t-stat is pretty accurate (within 0.5 degrees of my infrared thermometer)

Overall, love the product. I can easily control my t-stats from my mobile or directly from the wall. Makes life very easy now. BTW: Works great with Google Assistant. I use my Android phone to adjust temperature settings (i.e. Hey Google: Set the temperature to 70 degrees"")

Update: 12/10/18:
Product has worked flawlessly. No issues at all with wifi connectivity. Never had a dropped connection. Both wifi and 4G LTE connections always connect just fine. When making thermostat changes on your cell phone (wifi or 4G LTE), changes take effect within a couple seconds. Also, the problem mentioned above regarding the app freezing when your cell gets out of sleep mode, this has been fixed a while ago in an updated Sensi app. All around, everything works great. Love this product - makes it very convenient to remotely control your AC.

Update: 3/1/2020
Everything has worked flawless. Still have original Energizer AA batteries (full bars). Never had any LTE/Wifi connectivity issues.

Update: 4/2/2021: Not a single problem. Works flawlessly.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jim & Renae,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2019","We wanted a new thermostat for several reasons. The old Honeywell was working fine but it had several deficiencies. First, it was too easy for our grandson to change the settings. And the display was hard to read unless you stooped right in front of it. And the programming was a nuisance.

Searching for a thermostat with screen lockout we discovered that none of the good ole Honeywell residential thermostats have this feature. So we moved-on to almost-as-good - almost-as-old Emerson which has this feature on most of their residential products. Out utility company offers a $25 rebate on programmable thermostats and a $100 rebate on WiFi thermostats. With a Prime Day price of $75 this thermostat is basically free. However we were concerned by all the complaints about setup and network problems. So here is what we found.

The good -

1) Excellent manual controls and screen visibility, copied from the refined design of the legacy Emerson line. Most other WiFi thermostats have too much screen clutter in the attempt to eliminate buttons. Old-fashioned buttons really are better for the most common functions even if they don't look stylish.

2) You can control almost anything you want from your smart phone - after you complete setup.

3) You can configure this thermostat to work with almost any kind of HVAC system.

4) You have plenty of flexibility to create multiple programs with as many or as few schedule steps as you wish. For example you can have separate schedules for when you are home, when you are gone temporarily, when you are gone for months at a time. Some reviewers have complained about the difficulty of programming your schedule. Maybe Sensi have improved the app, but I found it reasonably easy to program, given the flexibility.

The bad -

1) The WiFi setup is very finicky. Were I not an engineer with many years of experience with communications equipment I might well have floundered. Common security features in WiFi routers can defeat your efforts. I would note that I recently installed a smart sprinkler controller that is completely programmed from my smart phone and has full remote access capability. WiFi setup was a breeze. I did not have to touch my WiFi router configuration at all. Sensi could do a lot better.

2) The manuals. Yes Sensi, some people do read manuals. Once you get past the simpleton stuff yours are rather poor. ""See the App"" (which has limited help on some topics) is not a good answer. Things like a list of the menu options and what they do - would be very helpful. The other Emerson thermostats have good manuals - so should yours.

3) Don't bother to call Sensi tech support. You will spend a lot of time on-hold and you might never actually talk to a human. And the support web site was almost as slow. The information is there but you have to be a pro to understand the more detailed stuff. Sensi needs to beef-up their tech support and/or produce a good tutorial on how to connect to a WiFi network. And if they had to write a good tutorial, they might improve their software to make things easier for their customers.

4) I found it necessary to change almost every default setting. Many of the complaints about the performance of this thermostat, arise from not bothering to check every last setting in the app. Better defaults would result in fewer complaints. This problem is confounded by lack of a list of menus and options in the user manuals. If you do not browse carefully through the app, you might miss the setting that you find most annoying.

5) You can control virtually everything else but not the fan schedule. A simple ""Fan On or Auto"" check box in each schedule step would be great.

The gory details -

If you have read this far, you might want to benefit from some of my experience setting-up this device for my network.

1) First let me explain my network setup. Basically my network has a less-trusted domain and a more-trusted domain. In the less-trusted domain sit my smart TVs, Game controllers, a laser printer that anyone can use, VoIP and media gateways, smart home sprinkler and thermostat controllers, etc. In the more-trusted domain sit my server, laptops, a color laser printer, and a very few other devices.

2) Between my cable modem and my less-trusted domain sits a simple but bullet-proof Ubiquity firewall router/switch. Hanging-off the Ubiquity switch in the less-trusted domain, are a VoIP gateway, a WiFi router/switch, a printer and a guest Ethernet port.

3) The WiFi router/switch serves as a second firewall between the less-trusted and the more-trusted domains. The WiFi hub has both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz channels, with separate private and guest access, for a total of 4 SSIDs. The router steers the guest SSIDs to the less-trusted domain and the private SSIDs to the more-trusted domain. The private and guest SSIDs have different WiFi access codes (passwords) so both domains are ""secure"" (in the WiFi sense).

4) By default the guest WiFi clients cannot see each other on the less-trusted domain. This is a common security feature in WiFi routers that support guest access. And it is one of the features that trips-up installation of the Sensi thermostat, but not my smart sprinkler controller.

5) Observing the network interaction between the Sensi app on my smart phone, the Sensi thermostat on the wall, and my WiFi router, at some times the app and the thermostat are operating point-to-point over the WiFi and sometime via the router. So-far so-good. This is expected behavior. However some of the router traffic uses LAN (Layer 2) addresses and some uses IP (Layer 3) addresses. This mixture can mess things up if the network is not configured exactly as the Sensi software developers expected.

6) Sensi should test with other common network configurations. As I mentioned my brand X sprinkler controller does not suffer from these peculiarities. If Sensi invested more money on software engineering and testing with different network configurations they could save a bundle on support costs and customer returns.

My recommendations -

1) Configure your smart phone to use the same WiFi SSID that you want to use for your Sensi thermostat.

2) Be sure this SSID is only available for 2.4 GHz.

3) Go through your router settings to ensure that every WiFi client of this SSID has unrestricted (LAN as well as IP) access to every other client of this SSID.

4) Run the Sensi app through the complete installation and registration process.

5) After everything is working you can restore your normal network configuration in your router and smart phone. Do not change the SSID for the thermostat.

6) If you need to change the SSID for the thermostat later, go back to start. Reset your thermostat and reconfigure your network. Rinse thoroughly and repeat as often as necessary.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jennie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024","Could only connect wifi once. Got a new wifi router for home and tried to set Sensi thermostat using the sames steps as I did before. However, this time around, the Sensi app would not go to next screen once my phone connected to Sensi's wifi. Did many of the troubleshooting steps as researched (instatlled brand new battery for thermostat, ""rebooted"" thermostat, restarted phone, changed phone's wifi settings, etc.) but to no avail. Now, the thermostat is now just a dumb thermo. Had good potential. If app issue gets fixed, this would be a 5 star.

UPDATE: I was able to reconnect the Sensi thermostat. In my original negative post, I tried reconnecting to new home wifi using a different account email address and a different phone. I eventually discovered that if I log in with the app on the original set-up phone and email address, the app would work. Only thing I would have liked is if Sensi would put a warning to use original email address for account login and phone. I recently read this as a potential fix in one of the Amazon's reviews (I hadn't seen this fix in my earlier research). With the app now working and me being able to check on the temperature setting remotely, this thermostat is an easy 5 stars. The additional options in the app such as setting offsets, cycle rates, a/c protection, et. are just great! I have no c-wire so I use a battery, but it is also great that Sensi provides on their website how to wire for a c-wire (without c-wire adapter) by using a jumper but they provide how to install a c-wire adapter so this thermostat give folks few options. I have central a/c and propane gas heater with no c-wire and the Sensi works for my configuration. I will eventually try to wire using a jumper to set-up a ""mock"" c-wire.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Our Lennox system is quite old & only 4 of 8 wires matched the Sensi unit. We called tech support & spoke with Rose who was fantastic. We emailed a pic of our setup to her. She asked that we hold for approx 5-7min. We had to take the panel off of the air handler to look for additional wiring, which didn’t help much. After we clarified that the black wire on our Lennox thermostat was labeled R, not B, Rose was able to confirm what our new wiring arrangement should be. She also helped us reprogram our Sensi thermostat for the new wiring configuration. At that point, the rest was a piece of cake. We were very impressed with the level of knowledge & support provided.

First in dumb mode the thermostat works quite nicely, wifi setup - not so much. The mini-setup guide is not very informative and no trouble shooting recommendations. Called tech support around 1:45 pm EDT and waited 49 minutes to recorded tips, no one answered. Customer support SHOULD publish hours phones are manned and SHOULD have a call back feature added to their customer service number. My HVAC home contractor uses one and he only covers two counties.

There were help/tips available on several parts of the vendors website, but you had to be diligent when looking. Bottom line, I performed all available troubleshooting steps with no success in connecting to SENSI XXXXX network. Ran setup process fron Sensi app more than 30 times over three hours without success.

Dave,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2024","I like the style of the thermostat, and how it looks on the wall. It works really well here in the Southeast Texas humid climate by displaying the humidity on the screen along with the temperature. The Sensi app is easy and straightforward. Whenever the humidity drops below a preset level, I am alerted and can remotely turn on my system. Additionally, you can lock out the front controls and only control the system from the app, which is useful when kids turn the temp all the way down. For the temperature range, this can be set to prevent someone from turning the A/C below a certain point or the heat up to the maximum. For the price, I would definitely recommend this thermostat.

It can also integrate with Alexa and other home automation apps.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Jose & Marcia,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024","We had issues installing our Sensi overseas. We have had to call and wait for Sensi Emerson support. We got lucky during 1st set of 4 Sensi Emerson devices. Got through and support overrode zip code issue. But we found one device was defective... So, we bought another Sensi and same problem with setup in same overseas location.

Here's my letter to Sensi.

Hello Sensi Support, We have purchased and installed at least 10 Emerson Sensi Model# ST55 in my various properties. The installation in USA is easy. But the overseas or international is difficult. Due to needing a specific zip code / location, we have been forced to call Sensi technical support number.

Sensi Emerson Support

Unfortunately, this requires a long distance phone call where we must hold on the phone line until someone actually responds.  There is no way to leave a message.

We recently purchased 4 Sensi devices.  The devices were setup with nice Sensi Emerson support. The Sensi support person was able to override Sensi's zipcode limitation for the Las Terrenas in Dominican Republic. The allocated zip code is 32000.

Unfortunately, one device was defective immediately and never could sync temperature of room. It was way off.  So, we bought a replacement Sensi. Now, we need help again to set up the 4th Sensi device.

My requests are as follows:
(1) Can the zip code 32000 be made permanent in Sensi system?
(2) Can someone call or email me back from technical support / setup support?
(3) Am I able to get a refund on my defective Sensi?

Note that I have championed your Sensi Emerson product to others. I have continued to do so regardless if my recent setback. But, I would like some help for my issue. 

I would prefer to give 5 stars!

AliThom,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2023","I had a digital, but not smart, thermostat for my old oil furnace. I took a gamble and decided to buy this and hope I had the C-wire I needed.

When I got this thermostat and tried to install it, I ran into some snags. I had the extra wire that I could use as a C-wire coming out the hole where the thermostat would go, but because I had two wires twisted together in my basement, it didn't go all the way to the furnace. I went out, got a new thermostat wire, got that all threaded through the wall and around my beams in the basement...only to discover that my furnace did not have the ""C"" terminal to connect to.

At this point I called customer service and they were helpful. They told me I would need an external adapter, and I got this one: https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07L4DN5R2?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details

While I waited for that to arrive, I had to put my old thermostat back on. When the adapter came, I was able to pull it through the wall so I could plug it in the basement. I connected the positive wire (striped) to the C and the negative to the RC terminals in the thermostat, and the old wires matching where they were before. I also had to snip the jump wire on the faceplate as instructed by the customer service person. That all worked great! As soon as I set my desired temperature, my furnace started right up.

Connecting to the Wifi, I got two failed attempt messages, but I just kept hitting ""try again."" On the third try, it connected. So I would just say keep trying!

I found the app pretty intuitive.

The only thing I would have liked is a step-by-step manual, printed. All the instructions are in the app and one of the steps, you were supposed to click which wires your old thermostat had. If you didn't select ""C"" you can't continue. I would have liked to look ahead a little bit and know all the steps before I started, then just review them as I went.

I like this one because it DOES have physical push buttons on the thermostat, so if you want guests to be able to adjust it, they can do so without the app. But the app control lets me do it easily and check on things when I am away from home. I also like how the temperature numbers are really big, and it displays both the current temp AND what it is set to, in addition to the time. The app also tells you the humidity level!

In the app you can set a schedule, adjust the temperature manually, or even use a geofencing option that automatically turns the heat down 3 degrees when you are not home (based on location of your phone). It will also alert you (if you want) to possible problems with your HVAC system based on extreme highs/lows. You can also see what the current temp is, both inside your house AND the outside temp in your city, and whether or not your furnace is currently running. This was critical for me as I have an old furnace that sometimes wimps out, and I wanted to be able to check the temp when I am away from home for extended periods in case there is an issue.

There is also a ""usage"" tracker but that shows daily data and I'm still on day 1 so I don't have data to display.

All in all, while I had some frustration with the set-up due to having to wait extra for the adapter wire, it was worth it!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Lari Anne Mazzitello,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2023","This is a must buy!! This was super easy to install!!

Note: I think you are supposed to set up the app FIRST and THEN install the device!! But it worked just fine. I think it would have walked you thru the installation if we set up the app before installing the device.

We removed the old thermostat’s cover plate then held up this thermostat w/o the cover plate. Then we took a quick pic of the old thermostat’s wiring with this thermostat’s inner panel. We removed the wiring in the order of this thermostat’s wiring diagram, too to bottom and removed the old plate. When we slipped this thermostat over the wires, they were all aligned an in order. Easy peasy to insert each one in order, top to bottom or bottom to top. Press down the wires, pop on the cover plate.

Then we had to download the app, Sensi, and go thru the process to create a profile, select the wires inside our thermostat, and then zip thru the set up.

So later, we were messing around with the app, setting up the schedules for when to cool/heat and at what temperatures to change and when. The app interface was SO VERY EASY!! It allows you to copy previous schedules or to create new based on existing schedules. It was really intuitive how to schedules and click thru everything. You can set schedules for when you only have heat on. And you can set schedules for when you only have the A/C on. AND you can set other schedules for when you have it on auto and it switches between heat and cool.

Additionally, you can set any type of schedule combo for the week. So if you work from home, set a 7 day schedule. If you work M-F, set a 5 day schedule and weekend schedule. If you work 4-10s, easily set one schedule for your work week and a second for your 3-day weekend! Best yet! If you are a fireman or nurse and work a couple days on and a few days off , set up a schedule or two, call one long week and one short week or call it MTFSa/WThSu to show which days you are at work/home. I have never had one where I could schedule each day independently and was so easy to make multiple schedules. I can create one schedule for the days I work/am home, and then create a copy of that and just swap the days that I’m at work/home without having to schedule each and every day all over again. This is the easiest interface EVER!! ( I know my explanation doesn’t do it justice, but it is nice. I’m about to schedule another one for when I work nights.

Easy to set up and install, had this up and running in 10 mins including wi-fi connect. Follow the instructions by down loading the app first and go through the steps. Shut your furnace off at your breaker box otherwise you will blow a fuse and need to replace it in the furnace. I do not use Apple Home Kit but you can if you want as part of the set up. Pretty basic cheap thermostat. Looks good, flat, snug against wall, secure, does not protrude like others. Only about 1” from wall. Back lit auto off after about 15 seconds. Light button on top to turn on manually. Blends in with wall (neutral or white) pretty good. Back plate is optional for $7. You probably don’t need it with this one. App is easy to use, simple, vanilla.
Cons:
Temp buttons (up / down arrows) are not soft quiet click / touch. They are a little too loud, like a really cheap on off wall switch. Wish they had used soft touch and not loud “snap or click” when you press the arrows. There is no way to set the thermostat to “Auto” temp mode except through the app only. No touch screen on this model, just keep in mind for less than $95 what you are getting, a glorified cheap piece of plastic made in China that requires a California Prop 65 cancer label warning and that has pretty basic vanilla functions and aesthics. No comparason to the Google Nest Learning model or the Ecobee 4 premium model. With this one you are getting what you pay for. There is no justification for griping and complaining.

zarchitect,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2019","I research everything (probably over-extensively) before I buy - especially a gadget. I know I wanted more control over temperature (in and out of the house) - that was primary without spending a 2nd mortgage to set a temperature.

At the end, it came down to the hockey-puck or this one (hockey-puck being the ubiquitous Nest). EcoBee and Honeywell also had ones and looked compelling - each one with features that were eyebrow raising. But at the end, I just needed a way to keep tabs of the temperature while away. I didn't need a weather report (my phone does that), a high-rez touch screen (it's a thermostat - not a TV), nor for it to be so smart that it turns into HAL (Space Odyssey reference in case you needed to know). All the competitors did that and more - the hockey puck apparently the worst of the bunch as to stalking you to see how many breaths you put out to offset it by .004 degrees (or something like that). AND - in an age where we're now monitored 24/7 by Alexa, Google, Siri and the smart toaster and microwave - listening to our every word so they can sell our every secrets and desires to evil marketers for a billion dollars so they could target spam us when we're the most vulnerable and end up with 55 gallons of ice cream, a Euro-massager, and a pet iguana at 3am on a Wednesday hand delivered by a chippery Amazon Prime delivery guy in a rented U-Haul van stuffed to the gill with the hopes and nightmares of other unsuspecting souls.

Anyway - privacy was a concern so I really didn't want Alexa or anything with a microphone. If I really wanted to talk to a wall, I'll go to the mirror and start singing - at least I have an audience of one that way... If our house has a microphone embedded in everything and we start blurting out commands indiscriminately to meet our over-entitled needs like bi-polar lunatics - when will it stop? We'll end up vegetables sitting on the couch not lifting a finger eating our 55 gallons of ice cream... AHA! I knew it!

I digress - it's a thermostat. I don't have a consistent schedule so I can't have it create one magically - it can't read my mind... yet. And some days I like it cooler than others - what then? Will I have a verbal fight with the hockey puck? It would win - it's too smart for me!

So I needed something that was a step up from the ol' knob and tube dial form the days of Kojak and have the ability to see / control this thing from 2000 miles away as I worry that I left something on (Bonus - I can make the other house-occupants suffer remotely if they do me wrong). I can also check on whether they set the temperature down to -50 thinking that it'll it cool off faster and they leave the house / windows open. Maybe I do need a yelling hockey puck...

Oh - Emerson. In the past Emerson was known as the bane of the electronics world - breaking down on day 91 on a 90-day warranty gadget. The epitome of planned-obsolescence! I'm giving it another chance - maybe they grey up a little. If I see polar bears roaming my living room eating my ice scream when I come home, I won't be happy - stay tuned on that...

Oh - before I go - also needed it to be dumb enough that if something failed (because it always does at the most inopportune time) - it won't freak out. AKA - some of the devices needed a 24/7 WiFi connection Why does one gadget need to depend on another for survival? So if my WiFi goes out then I die of heatstroke?

For all you readers out there - buy it for what you want to get out of it but don't be sold on things that truly don't matter in your daily lives for at the end of the day, it's just a thermostat - not a hyper-augmented inner core balancing module.",4.0 out of 5 stars

DNA,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2020","I am so happy I bought this. I got a new AC and I wanted something more hi tech than the thermostat that it came with. I also didn’t want to spend $200 on a Nest. I just wanted something simple that was programmable but also worked with Alexa. This is it! I actually did my research and found this was better than the equivalent Honeywell thermostat.
1. If you have both central air/Heat you do not need a C-wire. I live in a condo and they were having problems with the c-wire so I told them to just install it without it, and it still works perfectly. It does have AA batteries that I will have to change eventually but that’s fine.
2. I love that it works with Alexa. I like it colder at night so I set up a routine, I tell Alexa “Good Night” and she shuts off my lights and turns the air down to my desired temp.
3. This thing has GeoFencing! I thought I would need to program it for weekdays but this is even better. Every time I take my phone 3 miles away, it automatically raises the temp 3 degrees and then lowers it again when I’m back within a 3 mile range. So if I’m just walking my dog or running an errand in the neighborhood it won’t adjust unnecessarily and only does it when I’m gone for longer periods.
4. Also has programmable schedules for those who choose this. I just use Alexa and Geofencing so I don’t even have to use this feature.
5. I think it’s prettier than the Honeywell and the Nest. I like that it’s white and has a white glow on the screen so it looks better on the wall. The Honeywell has a green light apparently.
6. Optional Humidity control. You can set it to a certain humidity percentage and it will overcool a couple of degrees to reach your humidity level. I loved this at first but it didn’t work for me because it was doing it even when I was away and I would rather it just keep the temperature that I wanted instead. But this is a great feature if that is important to you.
7. 100% control with the Sensi app. I can adjust my temp from my bed, from work, from my car, while on vacation . It’s amazing. I honestly have not even had to touch the actual thermostat since it was installed. And the fact that you can have Alexa control it and tell you the temp inside and outside is awesome.
8. All of these features are optional. You can turn them on and off in the app and cater the system to your family’s needs. Oh and do you have kids or a pesky family member that keeps changing the temp? You can actually lock the buttons on the actual unit from the app and use only the app.

This does not have room sensors and it will not learn your schedule or figure out what room you are in or anything like the Nest or other thermostats do. But if you are like me and live in a small space then those features aren’t necessary and with the Geofencing, even if my schedule fluctuates, it will still only adjust if I’m 3 miles away no matter what my schedule is.

Overall I say this is so worth the price. I should have bought this a long time ago. I am very happy at the moment but I will come back and update the review if anything changes.",5.0 out of 5 stars

S. Hoffman,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2024","There are many smart thermostats available these days with decent reviews. I looked at several and sifted through those reviews.
The reason I chose the Sensi thermostat is because it blended familiar old style buttons and display screen with new high tech smart thermostat capabilities. We have a vacation home that outside temperatures can vary from 5 degrees during the winter to 95 degrees during the summer. We have had the Sensi thermostat installed for over a year and adjust the temperature prior to our arrival and can monitor the indoor temperature of the house from 200 miles away via wifi.
It has worked flawlessly and decided to install an additional one in our primary residence this year. Highly recommended!",5.0 out of 5 stars

MD and AZ,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2022","I have two Sensi thermostats, one for our primary home in MD and one for a second home in AZ. Our HVAC in AZ is conventional forced air system, so the set up was straightforward and pretty seamless - it took a few tries to get it to connect to Wi-Fi but once it finally took we were good to go. Fortified by my success I charged ahead with installing one at the MD house, which was built in 1928 and has two separate systems - the original hot water radiators for heat and a separate forced air AC system. Again the set up was straightforward - I followed the prompts on the app and still had to try several times to get it to connect to Wi-Fi but eventually it did and all seemed well. One aspect of the set up that was fraught with peril was that the set up prompts directed me cut the built in C wire on the Sensi. This seemed a very final move so before I did it I did some googling to try to educate myself on what the C wire is for and essentially determined that because I have two totally separate systems that don’t talk to each other, I don’t need a C wire. So I cut the wire and all seemed operational.

When I turned the heat on I noticed that I didn’t hear the characteristic whistle of the radiators getting going and that the boiler was not kicking on. I then discovered that the forced air was blowing, even though the thermostat was in “heat” mode. Then, when I put it in “cool” mode and cranked up the setting, the furnace would kick on. In a slight panic I reviewed the photo I took of my old thermostat wiring and saw that it was the same configuration as what the Sensi app had walked me through, so I knew that wasn’t the issue. Based on the negative reviews I had read, I didn’t have much hope that the Sensi help page would actually be helpful, but I found an FAQ along the lines of “ why isn’t my heat turning on”. It suggested that I needed to configure my thermostat to talk to my system, and walked me through changing the default settings on the thermostat itself to work with my specific system configuration. And - success!!! The heat kicked on in “heat” mode and the AC kicked on in “cool” mode and it was squared away.

So my main takeaways are that you have to stick with it and perhaps do some troubleshooting, but this is good affordable smart thermostat solution. I really like that it looks like a regular thermostat, meaning minimal wall patching of the area around it, and the app seems to work well and be pretty intuitive. And - MD gave me a $75 rebate so it was even cheaper (incomprehensibly AZ does not offer a rebate.)

So - I recommend!",4.0 out of 5 stars

Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2023","Wanted to upgrade the thermostat unit but my wiring didn't include the c-wire which removes many other options from the table. Luckily the ST55 doesn't require it (and instead uses batteries). The ST55 is actually Emerson's lower tier smart thermostat, and doesn't have a lot of the bells and whistles of their higher end units. The design is also much more traditional, as opposed to the higher end units, which basically are entirely screen, no buttons. But I like having the buttons and didn't neccessarily want to mount somthing that looked like a smart phone on the wall.

The installation was very straight forward and the included bubble level made mounting it horizontally level quite easy. The app guides you through install and as long as you know what your wires are, you shouldn't have any problem.

Using it is very straight foward. Basic functionality is all supported like setting a temperature and setting a schedule. If you generally just want to do the most basic of tasks then this thermostat will definitely suffice. The information is all displayed on the screen. The screen displays both time and humidity, but alternates it - so if you want to know the humidity and it currently displays time, just wait a few second and it will switch. The associated application is also pretty useful and lets you see and control the unit from your smart phone. If you register an account you also can get notifications - for example, when the humidity is above 70% you'll get an email (at which point you can turn on the dehumidifier or AC). I personally haven't had any issues with it after a few months of use, so as far as I can tell, this unit is completely reliable - it does what I need it to do, no more and no less.

The higher end models will also obviously have all the same functionality along with even more advanced functionality I'm guessing, but if you don't really want something super fancy and like the traditional appearence of this unit, then this will be more than adaquate. Also if you don't have the C-wire then you simply won't have too many options anyway. If however you really want even more smart features and want something more futuristic, then well a higher-end model might suit you more.",5.0 out of 5 stars
DH,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2024","Would have been a nice unit but I need to return it. All of my Wi-Fi access points in my house are set up for WPA3 only, as even WPA2/3 transitional is not secure. Rufus AI generated answer incorrectly said this product supports WPA3, which it absolutely does not. Tried on a temporary WPA2 network and it connected right away. Then I did my usual ""will this work with the Internet down"", and the answer is a hard no, I could not even do a basic set temperature change with the Internet down. Strike two. Third strike is that the compatibility of this item with Home Assistant is pretty poor. There is a GitHub integration out there, but again it's not local control, it goes out to the Emerson / Copeland servers to execute commands. Strike three.

One pro for this item, though, is they did have phone support that helped talk through the wiring setup for this for my ancient geothermal heat pump. Rather DIY friendly, all things considered.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Korryn,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024","Works great. Easy to install myself following a YouTube video. Setting up to wifi was simplified as well. The programming works great and no issues with anything really, except the batteries it came with. The batteries lasted less than a year (10 months) and no longer worked even when the batteries showed 4 bars on the display. When this happens, you can no longer control the thermostat from the app or it goes offline and the wifi signal disappears or stops displaying on the top left corner of the screen.

I still recommend this thermostat and will try out other batteries, even though the Energizer batteries it came with are typically good batteries.

Tasty Bits,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2020","I own two of these units. One in a Commercial setting and one Residential. Overall decent product but it may not be the easiest install if you don’t prepare.

Pro: app is very informative, very configurable and granular.

Con: Temperature spread not configurable. Unit seems to be confused for the first 12 hrs after install or if you change the primary configuration with lots of short cycling of the system. Needs to just sit in an off or not actively heating/cooling for several hours prior to use.

Everything is setup to be user friendly. No physical manuals, install the phone app and it should walk you through everything step by step. 2.4ghz WiFi network support only. Problems arise if your system doesn’t have a Common (C or Blue) wire or if your system is wired in an unexpected manner. My Commercial system was connected using colors that the app configurator deemed “Invalid” yet clearly it worked with the old thermostat. I am not and HVAC tech but using the service manual for the old thermostat I reverse engineered what each wire was for and hooked up the Sensei appropriately.

Other manufacturers let you adjust the temperature spread in the advanced settings to limit and control short cycling of the system and adjust when it comes on usually by configuring a % or specific # of degrees. Emerson uses a generic approach called the “Cycle Rate” with 3 possible settings of Slow, Medium or Fast. Slow supposedly allowing the widest spread in temperature. In my experience this is all of a 1 degree spread but it looks and feels to be a 0 degree spread as the system will come on when the display and target temps match.

The advanced settings are not part of the initial app based setup. You need to download the real user manual to understand and modify the advanced settings as needed to match your system.

Prior to changing your thermostat out, it is best to document your equipment as best as you can and/or dig into the advanced menu of your existing thermostat if digital and document the settings there. It makes a difference of you have single or dual stage Cooling or heat, heat pump, reversing valve power orientation and backup electrical heat. You will need to configure all of that in the new thermostat.

One key step during install is turning on the WiFi network on the thermostat, disconnecting your phone from your regular WiFi and connecting to the thermostat to perform the config, then moving your phone or device back to the regular network to complete the configuration and testing. Also be aware that if your unit cannot connect to the WiFi you want or that it disconnects/drops a lot you are either trying to connect to a 5ghz network or the 2.4Ghz network is saturated with other nearby networks causing a weak signal or your WiFi router is too far away from the thermostat.

One last tip, many WiFi routers from internet providers or stores tout that they provide 2.4Ghz and one or two 5Ghz networks all in one single “Network”. While this is true and will give your computing devices the fastest speeds IOT devices like these thermostats only work on 2.4Ghz and will work absolutely flawless if split the 2.4 and 5 GHz networks giving the 2.4 its own SSID network name. Everything will still route through your main router so you can use the app on a phone connected to the 5Ghz to control your unit on the 2.4Ghz network.",4.0 out of 5 stars

El,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2023","Living in a house that hasn’t been updated since the 90’s means we were stuck without a common wire and with a vintage Honeywell basic thermometer, you know the ones, everyone has had one in their first crappy apartment lol.

When we first moved in we converted the downstairs thermostat to a nest and then when moving upstairs we realized the AC was from 1989 and needed to be rewired or replaced. I don’t like to replace things that are working great just to make them tech friendly so I started looking for options.

A local air conditioner dude quoted me $400 to install a nest thermostat with a common wire adapter. I thought that was fair but couldn’t afford it so I tried to do it myself and ran into issues with our ancient AC system’s power source. I gave up on ever having a smart thermostat that I could install myself for an affordable amount of money and we just adjusted it manually and consistently whenever it was hot.

However I got desperate during these Texas 110 degree days recently with my old AC thermostat popping on and off over and over so I started the search over. Determined not to spend $5000 on a whole new system cause yikes.

I found this one on Amazon after an extensive search and thought it’s too good to be true that it doesn’t need a common and it fits where the old 1990’s honeywells need updating.

I installed it so easily just like a normal thermostat, no wire jumping or skinning needed. No adapter on our dinosaur ac! I didn’t even have to open up the ac itself just the wall thermo. The app walked me through everything, and It took me about 45 mins total to connect it and calibrate it for the excess temperature issues we were having (our thermostat is in a hot spot in the room, you can adjust it just for these sorts of situations) within the first day we were seeing a change in the control of the temperature in these hot daytime hours!

A month later I am happy to say it’s working so well and our house is finally eco friendly with a lower bill during the summer. We haven’t had as many issues with our AC running all day and the app gives us a breakdown of energy usage and temperature. I only wish I had found this sooner because it solved a lot of our problems until we can officially replace our very old AC.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Just Josh,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2022","Installing this thermostat is very easy. Wire it up, setup the app, connect to it with the app, enter a code from the thermostat, and it connects to your wifi and is then available to view and configure in the app from anywhere.

At a basic level it works just like you’d expect any thermostat to work. You can control it right from the thermostat using the up/down arrows for the temperature. There are also buttons to set the heating or cooling mode (or turn it off), set the fan to on all the time or Auto, and to turn it on the programmed schedule mode. This thermostat also has a mode where it can automatically switch between heating and cooling as needed.

You can program the thermostat using the buttons on the unit itself, but it’s much easier to use the app to setup your schedule. You can setup various events throughout the day such as if you want it to be a certain temperature when you wake up, change when you are out for the day, change again when you’re back home, and change again for when you go to bed. In this sense it’s pretty much like any other programmable thermostat.

The app gives you a few nifty features (besides the expected ability to adjust it from anywhere… very convenient from bed):
- You can lock the physical buttons so only the app can control the thermostat. Perfect if you have issues with people adjusting the thermostat when they shouldn’t be.
- You can setup the fan to run a certain amount of time per hour to circulate the air in case the heating and cooling doesn’t need to run the fan much. This is a nice alternative for air circulation compared with just leaving the fan on all the time.
- You can use the app to tweak the “actual” temperature by plus or minus five degrees. This will change the room temperature display number and thus the behavior of the thermostat. This is convenient both for calibrating the thermostat if you want to set it to be exactly the same as another thermometer that you have, and also if you want to use it to set the temperature in another room that might be hotter or colder than the area where the thermostat is located.
- You can see the usage day by day on a graph. You can see how much the heat, air conditioning, and fan were on each day. Very convenient to see how your temperature settings impact the actual energy usage.

PT,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","Emerson did an amazing job with this product! I finally broke down and bought a wifi thermostat because I was tired of having to continually run over to my manual thermostat to adjust it. When going from summer to winter, or winter to spring, there are many days where you need heating on one day, and cooling the next... or heating during the morning... cooling during the day... and heating again during later that night. This makes the wifi thermostat the only logical choice.

My initial concern was the infamous ""c-wire,"" and whether that would be an issue, but Emerson has developed a system that is as foolproof as you can find. You download their app, and simply follow the step-by-step instructions, and voila! If necessary, you can go back a page or two, or you can go through the entire app a page at a time, to familiarize yourself, then go back to the first page and begin. I can't speak highly enough of their app and how well it is done. I only wish other companies would follow suit, and include such an easy to follow instruction app!

As to the thermostat itself, it is not too difficult to figure out, and I was most pleased with how quick and simple it was to setup the daily schedule. That was the one area where it was not as intuitive as it could have been, and a few extra instructions explaining it could have helped. But I still managed to figure it out in just a few minutes of trial & error, since the screen would tell me that I was doing it wrong, and would not let me go to the next step. But again... all in all, it was a surprisingly simple process from start to finish.

I was also pleased with how easy it was to setup the daily schedule. On my 7-day programmable manual thermostat, each day had to be set individually. On the Sensi, you can simply select select the days that you want programmed, and apply the temperature settings to that entire range of days. So rather than having to program 7 individual days, I simply set a schedule for 5 work days, and another schedule for my two days off.

The one thing I would caution everyone about is AA batteries! The batteries in the package were about 70% when I installed them into the thermostat. Fortunately, I keep plenty of rechargeable batteries on hand, so I was able to charge up a set. When I installed those, the battery meter showed a full 100%. I will monitor to see how long the batteries last, but with rechargeable batteries... it's actually no big deal one way or the other.

The unit works fine, and it took no time to install. The mounting bracket uses the exact same holes as the unit I was replacing, and you will probably need the super tiny philips head screwdriver and a pair of needle nosed pliers to push the copper wires back into the wall after you have them inserted & screwed down on the thermostat wall mount. If you leave them extending out, they will block you from being able to snap the face-plate onto the wall mount.

I highly recommend this unit. The cost is excellent... it works excellent... and installation was a breeze!

BUT, I'm really happy with the purchase now about 8 months later. We have to leave the heat on over the winter as the house is not set up to drain plumbing & winterize, etc. The Sensei units not only give me the current temps in the home, they show me the outside temp. The app also lets me see how much the heat has run for any given day, etc. When it's going to be colder than normal for a few days, it's easy to just open the app and dial up the heat a bit. Don't have to call a neighbor (or my brother in law) to have them go over and adjust the thermostats for us. Plus we got some $ back thru the Mass Save Energy program, so they where practically free. Installation was a little on the fussy side; they lost wifi connection a few times, but I think that's the fault of my Eero mesh system more than the thermostats. So far, they've been great and I can recommend them, especially if you have a remote location you want to monitor.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Bill,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2023","I have a house from the 60s so no C-Wire. We just have RH and W wires. Our furnace is gas with hot water baseboard heat so I think technically it's a boiler. I read others saying they didn't need a C-Wire so I figured I'd give it a try. The setup process makes you select your current wiring setup and if you pick RH and W it says it won't work. I just said I had a C-Wire even though I didn't. I was able to get it connected to Wi-Fi and it seemed good so I was going to wait and see how the batteries held out. Had an issue where the heat was on even though the thermostat wasn't asking for it. Found the thermostat was setup for an electric system so fixed those settings. Then noticed on my Taco control panel that the yellow light that indicates the thermostat is calling for heat was faintly illuminated. It was doing this even when the thermostat mode was set to off. So while it seemed like it may work, it's behaving strange due to the absence of the C-Wire so I'm not taking any chances. Put the old thermostat back and it is back to normal.

I have another one of these thermostats in the finished basement where I do have a C-Wire and it's great. The app is great and I like the usage reports that show how much time the thermostat spent asking for heat.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Ted Long,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2024","My utility company had a rebate of up to $125 for a self-installed smart thermostat. So, my overall cost was zero. Was simple to install and configure to work with my Amazon Echo. Using the separate app that gets installed on my android phone, allows me to easily set a schedule and/or temporarily set the temperature. The android installed app is so good it changes color while viewing if the (in my case) the heat is actually running.
Current temperature, at the thermostat, is pretty large and easily read. But temp setting is a bit small on the device, but still easy to read. Another useful feature is the current humidity level. With my forced hot air heat, the air dries out very quickly, so when the humidity level drops below 25%, I usually turn on a humidifier to add more moisture in the air. The humidity level, like the current setting. is pretty small on the device, but is also more easily read on the app.
Physical install, and app setup, took me less than 15 minutes, and Alexa setup just a few minutes more. The only thing that I would like to have that is missing is a physical button just to temporarily turn on the back light. But as my phone app works just fine, the lack of a back light only button, is really not an issue.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Fortunately, this has the same install footprint as the 13 year old Honeywell it replaced, so no worries. We bought two fresh batteries. Installation was great, very easy, took maybe 15 minutes. The wifi setup had no issues and the system is running as it should. For the price gamble, it was well worth it.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2024","I purchased this thermostat because the description for this product above states a ""C wire is not required for most installations"". I have an older home. I have two wires for the thermostat. I have an oil furnace and no a/c. At first, the thermostat worked really well. One day, I lost WiFi for just a minute, and the thermostat turned on the heat, and it would not turn it off until I took the thermostat out. I figured it was just a fluke and then it happened again when the temps were 94 degrees outside. I had to take the thermostat out again. I contacted tech support, who informed me that a C wire is required (despite the description saying it is not) and informed me that I could have a C wire run. Why would I do that? First, it is very difficult to find a tradesperson in my area, and it can take months to get one to your home if you do. Second, why would I pay additional money when I specifically sought out a thermostat that did not require a C wire?

This is what tech support emailed me: ""A common wire (“C” wire) is required on heat-only systems for both Sensi models. Without a “C” wire installed, the Wi-Fi connection will be intermittent to preserve battery power.""

This does not explain why the thermostat would crank the heat each time it loses WiFi.

Stan Zielinski,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023","This is NOT a smart device by any means! There is no ability to set stop and start cycles only on. This means you must program to have a designated time for the vac unit to come on and then program another time for it have a different temperature. There is NO stop/ start in the software at all. In the case of heating my house, I wanted the HVAC to come on at 5AM and heat to 70. At 9 AM I wanted the HVAC to no longer operate util 5PM. You cannot do this function, you must program another start cycle at 9AM for a lower temperature. Also, there is NO way to eliminate your fan from coming on. My HVAC unit is in my attic above my master bedroom. I don't want it coming on at night when I sleep. SORRY, no can do. In frustration I tried cancelling the schedule for one night. Nope, once it's in the program you can't eliminate the fan from coming on. The best you get is 10% in an hour. My old analog thermostat with a time clock had more brains than this P.O.S.

The menus and pictures to re-wire were pretty decent. As far as Alexa and a smart home device. I prefer to keep things basic and I do not like having eyes and ears into my life from outside sources collecting data. What I eat, drink, wear, when and how is nobody's business.

Dr. K,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2020","My main hang up in buying this way how the install would go. I was replacing an anolog unit and fortunately the install was super easy. Took me about 10 minutes (it says 30 min install) and the step by step instructions on the app made it super easy and straight forward. The unit phone app control is absolutely awesome. I work in an office 3 out of 7 days but if I didn't keep the AC on at least 70 in the summer, it would get super warm in the afternoon, like close to 80. Now I can schedule it at 83 degrees on the days I'm not there. On the days I work, the AC starts to turn on and lower at 3am (72 degrees), then lower more at 6 am (65°), so when I get there at 9am it's a cold 65 degrees. Then thought the day, with Oklahoma 100+ degree day summers, it will only get to about 72-75 degrees (even when set at 65) in the afternoon. I'm going to save a considerable amount of money and I will have more all day comfort when I'm there. Other cool features are the auto humidity and auto fan control. If it gets above a certain user set humidity level (60% for me) the AC will kick on to bring it back down, no matter the temp. Also you can set the fan to run by itself to circulate air for a certain percent of the day (25% of an hour is how I set it,). Has more features than I imagined or probably Even need, but I'll take them. This unit even tells you the local temp and high and low of the day and gives you a daily and monthly usage statistic and graph. You can use the app to check for local energy company rebates. Really cool and I should have bought it years ago. Don't let the installation scare you. It was much easier than I thought. ""YOU CAN DO IT?” (with the voice used in Adam Sandler movies).

Update 10/4/1/2022
The thermostat is now eating the 2 AA batteries completely, from 100% to zero, in one day and the thermostat literally heats up. Its says it's 79 in a 68 degree room because the actual thermostat itself is putting out so much heat and eating batteries. I've tried about every brand of battery now and the same thing happens about 10x now. It will go dead with brand new batteries in a day or day and a half and disconnect. Also I've checked the entirety of the rest of the system and every thing is fine, other than the thermostat I disconnected it and let it sit for days with no battery and it still does the same thing when back in the wall with batteries. I've also tried the thermostats with the wifi off and it made no difference. It is noticably putting off heat and the temperature reading reflects that. Of coarse it's exactly a couple months after the one year warranty. I purchased in June 2021.....watch out. I'm going to contact Emerson but I'm not hopefull.",1.0 out of 5 stars

The unit took over three weeks to arrive, then about two more weeks for me to get to install. Upon installation, the unit was clearly displaying the incorrect temperature and wouldn't acclimate to the actual room temperature. We called customer support, who confirmed the thermostat was defective.

They then proceeded to tell us that even though the unit was clearly defective, that they WOULD NOT ISSUE A REFUND BECAUSE IT WAS PURCHASED THROUGH AMAZON.

Even though we purchased the unit directly through their company storefront on Amazon, they refused the replace the defective unit because ""we didn't order directly through their website"".

Erlvis,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2024","Bought four of these highly-rated Sensi thermostats a year ago. Worked great at first but over time, my thermostats show as offline in the Sensi randomly and for the last few months, almost constantly. This issue has gotten worse to the point now that it's not at all unusual for me to check my app only to find ALL FOUR of my thermostats offline. And they might show offline for hours, then suddenly they start working. See attached. Note the time/date stamp. Different units appear online then go offline as quickly as a minute or two.

It's not a WiFi signal issue. All four have five bars of WiFi signal strength and our WiFi usage is light to begin with.

Opened a support ticket with Emerson. After two weeks, I got an email from them basically saying ""we might've fixed it so if you are still having a problem, please open a new support ticket."" Huh? That's how you support a customer using four of your products yet none of them are reliably online?

S. Allen,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2018","Back on March 21, 2018 I purchased two Sensi ST55 thermostats. Both were installed and worked fine. One was installed upstairs and the second was installed downstairs. Around September 20, 2018 the Downstairs unit lost connectivity and went offline. I tried resetting the router but it would not connect to my SSID. I purchased a new router and the problem persisted. I called Sensi for troubleshooting. They blamed the new router for the connectivity issue and suggested that I go back to my old router or try different settings on the new router, ignoring that there was another unit that reconnected fine. I performed those steps as directed but the thermostat would not pick up my SSID. I could see I was not going to get far with technical support. On September 26, 2018, I purchased another ST55 thermostat from Amazon. It immediately came online and has been working fine since. I returned the old one to Amazon as defective. A few days before November 26, 2018, I contacted technical support again this time regarding the Upstairs ST55. This unit had gone rogue and was calling for heat even when turned off. To eliminate a possible wiring problem I switched the Upstairs ST55 with the Downstairs ST55. The trouble followed the thermostat downstairs. Sensi opened Case 00302944. They emailed me requesting all the information that I had already supplied but without pictures. I called tech support and we went through another round of troubleshooting. This time tech support concluded that the unit was defective. A few days later I received a replacement. For the past two weeks everything was working fine with the Upstairs ST55, until last night. Last night my wife woke up in a sweat. The upstairs thermostat was calling for heat again. It was 83 degrees Fahrenheit and the heat was still on. The thermostat was set to 62 degrees Fahrenheit. She woke me up and I turned the thermostat off and checked to see if the circulator on the boiler was still running. It was. I pulled the thermostat from the wall and opened the windows to cool the house down. I also pulled the batteries from the thermostat and let it sit there until the morning. I reconnected the thermostat to the wall and everything is fine for now. I have to ask; how much longer will it take before this thermostat will try to cook my family again? I have lost all faith in Sensi's products and have very little faith in their technical support.

Frostbyte,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2021","I cant believe all the 5 star reviews. These people must live in a cold climate , or where the heat doesn't reach 105+ outdoors. If I could give a zero star, I would. This thing constantly short cycles for one thing. On a hot day, this thing goes on then off every 5 to 7 minutes. That is one good way to wear out a 10 thousand dollar a/c unit very fast. No a/c should cycle every 5 to 8 minutes. 5 minutes of run times doesnt even give the system a chance to blow out the humidity and cool the house.

My old dumb thermostat that is 20 years old still works fine, and cycles every 15 to 20 minutes depending on temp. Tech support is impossible to get a hold of, you have to go through amazon

I contacted tech support, they ran a check of my usage and the technician was very rude and basically called me a liar saying that my unit didn't kick on and off every 5 minutes, and they make them do this to make people comfortable. I was outraged! Like I am going to lie about this?????? I used every setting and method possible for this piece of trash and no matter what, it still short cycled, unless I set my room temp at 88 degrees....then whats the point of having an ac or thermostat! . Other people experience the same thing that live in my climate. If its 75 to 80 degrees, it might work fine for you. But beware, if you are in a hot area, DONT BUY!

Amazon was nice enough to me and apologized for Sensi's complete rudeness and professionalism. They refunded my money even though it was past the return period. They even told me that tech should lose his job for his behavior. I sent this pos back. I will never ever deal or buy from this company again, and you couldn't give me one for free. My 10 thousand dollar air unit is far more important than to have something like this wear it out.

P. Tyndall,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2021","I've had this thermostat almost a full year, and while it appears much better than my previous Honeywell units, this one has a major flaw: It overworks my heat pump! Let me explain.

This thermostat replaced a simple Honeywell model that worked well with the unit, but I wanted remote control via app features. Let me say, the Sensi app is great! I began noticing my HVAC unit only running a few minutes and turning off, only to repeat this almost 8-10 times an hour. That's WAY too much cycling for a heat pump that cycled a third of that with the older thermostat. No problem! I found a cycle rate setting in the app. Sadly, that setting in the app doesn't do anything to improve the cycle rate issue. It does seem to change the temperature readings on the display (have no idea what that's about). So, this tstat has come down off my wall.

I've had a ticket in with Technical Support for over two weeks and heard nothing. So, it's safe to say I do NOT recommend this tstat for heat pump use. Stay away. Disappointed, because if this ""cycle rate"" feature in the app actually worked, this would be an awesome tstat. But, like most stuff made today...

UPDATE: August 7, 2021

Sensi ""Support"" responded to my detailed description in the ticket about the thermostat/app's cycle setting not working. Their response? Step by step instructions on changing the cycle setting in the app!...the very thing that does NOT work! I would say their technical support is the worst, but there are a lots of companies like them, these days. PLEASE. Whatever you do, pick a different brand thermostat. If you have this thermostat on a heat pump and you live in a warm climate, it's probably overworking your HVAC system. You've been warned.

UPDATE: August 18, 2021

Talked with Jason at technical support. He said the thermostat is probably working as it should and will cycle my unit too much. I explained my Honeywell did not cycle the unit as such. Both supposedly have the same temp differential. No recourse. Stuck with a paperweight. Again, you've been warned.",1.0 out of 5 stars
M Cocola,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2020","Decided on this thermostat to replace very basic unit at a house I recently purchased. I didn't want anything super fancy, just cycle control, wifi, etc. This seemed like it would work find and reviews were predominantly good...

Installed new wire from my boiler so I could have the required common, mounted it up, conected to wifi easily, everything seemed fine. Made a schedule (ap is super rudimentary so dont expect much), set cycle speed to slow as I have a high efficiency boiler, and thought we were off to the races. Well, sorta... in the basic sense that it turns the heat on and off...

The following is consistent across TWO separate Sensi thermostats. I returned the first one. SEE PICS that show these observations.

- When the thermostat sets a call for heat (65* in pic), within four minutes or so the ""room temp"" drops 2 or 3 degrees (down to 62* in pics). This is on the display ONLY of course, and all other measuring devices show an unchanged temperature.

- When baseboards heat the room, the Sensi displayed temp continues to lag all the other measurement devices by a few degrees. (Pics show as the temp climbs back up. 1 minute from 62-3, 2 minutes from 63-4, 2 minutes from 64-5, then 7 minutes from 65-66/Off??? Then 6 minutes from 66-69??? Makes no thermodynamic sense.)

- By the time the Sensi ""thinks"" it has reached the set point and cancels the heating call, it has already overshot by a few degrees in real life. (Photo of the wall shows the Sensi just turned off right at 66* but all other devices are high 67 to 68)

- With continued baseboard circulation the room temp rises. This is of course expected with hydronic heat, but because of the aforementioned nonsense, by the time all is said and done it is super hot in the room. (See pic max temp of 69*, reached 6 minutes after heat call ends)

Troubleshooting:
- Bought 2nd thermostat... same thing.
- Verified c-wire voltage and freq is within spec.
- Tried medium and fast cycles... same thing.
- Emailed Sensi twice... no answer.
- When thermostat just sits idle, the temp lines up with all other measurement devices... great.

So I'm pretty much done toying with this and will be sending the 2nd back. Good luck should you decide to purchase one!",1.0 out of 5 stars

TechN,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2019","I bought this because of the top reviews here in Amazon. But this turned out to be by far the worst purchase I have made this whole year of 2019! I have a gas furnace/outdoor AC. I replaced a 5 year old Honeywell non-smart non-programmable thermostat with this one. Installation was straight-forward with the app guidance. I carefully wired the thermostat following all instructions from the PDF manual from the Sensi website for my specific heating/cooling HVAC system and set the menu in the thermostat accordingly. When I set the temperature to 70 F and let it run when room temp was 67 F.  The thermostat did not stop the furnace at 70 F, and let the room heat above 75 F!! When I looked the thermostat display, it showed that the heating was stopped, but the furnace was running non-stop.

As per the support article online I tried to troubleshoot. Following the instruction, I removed the display front plate from the wall and the heater was turned off within 5 mins confirming there was nothing wrong with the wiring or any short on my home furnace wiring. I put the old Honeywell thermostat back and the furnace worked perfectly! It stopped right on time as soon as the set temperature was reached.
I wanted to like Sensi and gave another chance. I put the Sensi back and set up all menu as per detailed manual. Now only way I could let it run was in the auto setting. I put a temperature range of 67 F to 71 F. The thermostat will run the heater and temperature will go above 71 F and then the AC cooling will trigger switching off furnace and turning to cool mode. AC runs for a short while to bring temperature down and the HVAC system turns off when within teh set temperature range. This put a lot of load on the AC, turning it on and off. When I see the HVAC usage on app, I could see that the AC ran for about 30 mins a day when outdoor winter temperature in the midwest was around 30 F. 

I wrote to the online support webpage describing the problem. I got no response from them ever after a few days. I called them on their support phone number.

tkrjhw,"Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2018","As I described previously when you connect you are only connecting to an Emerson web page.Their server does the job of connecting to your thermostat. And you are at the mercy of Emerson keeping their web server operating. But they changed their web page in about Jan 2018 and now it rarely connects to my thermostat. I go days without being able to connect. Their only suggestion is to move my wifi antenna but it already has direct line of sight and is only about 10 feet away. It's not my wifi that is the problem. It was working fine until they changed their website. I have trouble connecting not only with my computer browser but also with the Android app.
Now in August 2018 they have changed the website yet again. My account has been erased. I had to create a new account. And it appears that the only way to connect is to pay a subscription of 1$ per month. I'm done. I'm taking it out and throwing it away. I will not buy another wifi thermostat from anyone unless it is a type that I can connect to directly via a TCP port and not go through their server. I am nothing short of furious.
This concept of forcing equipment to go through a website for connection and then the web sties close down rendering the equipment useless needs to be made illegal. There are several home camera systems my friends bought costing in excess of $1000 that are useless because of the same reason.

PREVIOUS review:
Works well. When you connect via a web browser you are actually not connecting directly to the thermostat but rather to an Emerson web site which in turn contacts your thermostat and creates a web page with the data. There is also an Android app. Both browser web page and Android app work reliably and operate quite identically which is good that I didn't have to learn how to operate but one GUI.
So far it seems Emerson did a good job at keeping the web page fairly vanilla, no tricks in the JavaScript (is there a javascript?) that causes it to only work in one flavor of browser like is so common in other wireless equipment.
The one thing that bothers me about equipment that depends on a manufacturers web site for it to work is the manufacturer may someday stop supporting the device. Emerson is a big company so I expect them to stay around and support this device for a couple of decades. I guess in twenty years I'll be willing to purchase a new one that no longer uses WiFi but rather communicates via sub space relay.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Slagathor,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2021","Oh boy, let me tell you something. For 16 months, out Sensi worked great. Easy to use, kept temperature well, no problems. Then one day, I looked at the usage that and saw my heater had been on for 4.5 hours through the night, between midnight and 5:30 am. That struck me as odd, because our heating system would typically only run for about 2 hours total. Our second sensi, which controls the HVAC in our guest house, read the proper run time of 2 hours. I knew something was wrong. Long story short, after 4 weeks of fiddling with settings, offset temp, keeping track of times, temperatures, and everything else I could think of, I have come to the conclusion this thing has gone rogue. Interestingly enough, it keeps the temp in the house to the set point, mostly. Sometimes it does drop two degrees too low, says it's heating but isn't actually running. Eventually, it will engage the furnace and get the temp back up, but there no rhyme or reason to what kicks it on. I'll hear it click on, but nothing. Other times, it'll click on, run the fan for 2 min, turn off, but still say it's heating. We've checked wire connections, they're all good. Heater itself is fine. Don't have the problem during the day, only through the night and the coldest part of morning. Sometimes, I can get it to start working properly by popping the unit off the wall and putting it back, but sometimes that will only start the fan for a minute. I am flummoxed and frustrated and hope to goodness this rogue smart thermostat isn't screwing up my HVAC in the long run. I just ordered an Ecobee to replace it, because the temp of my home is important to me. After a week of research online, I have found a few complaints similar to mine. I won't even put myself through calling Emerson customer service, because I value my sanity and don't want to take my frustration out on some unsuspecting CS rep who is just reading from a script.

Lanner93,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2024","This product worked well for me for over a year. However, there has recently been an update to the software that now preferentially runs the auxiliary heat source (in my case, the electric heat pump) over primary (gas furnace).

The product’s settings do not allow you to specify when you want your auxiliary power source to kick in (or if you want to use it at all). There is a “boost” setting that turns all heating stages when there is a three degree difference in current temperature verses desired temperature. However, disabling this has resulted in an increase in the auxiliary heat source usage. (See screenshot of usage - it is in the negative degrees Fahrenheit where I live- the red is the auxiliary heat source and orange primary. I disabled the boost feature on the 12th). In my case, the additional usage of the auxiliary power source has increased my electrical bill by over $100 a month (heat pump inefficient in such cold conditions + much more expensive for me to heat with electricity than gas).

I’ve reached out multiple times to customer service about this issue, but I’ve only received nonsense replies (not remotely addressing the issue I’m facing). The customer service agents either don’t understand their product or do not read their messages thoroughly.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Guy,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2020","I have to say that at first this thing was great. I bought it two years ago and it worked flawlessly for two years and had it kept working it would've earned 5 stars.

The problem with this thing is that I think either the software is faulty or they did some updates that really screwed up how it works. The settings used to be straight forward and following the manual got the setup done no problem. However, recently, the setup menu became horrendous, I can't even figure out how to change the wifi password from the menu. That's bad design.

The next issue is that this thing turns my fan on non-stop. After the temperature is met, the fan turns off then is immediately turned back on, this goes on for hours I thought maybe it was the humidity setting or I accidentally put my fan to 'on' instead of 'auto' but that wasn't it. After working for 2 years it just recently decided to do this.

How do I know it's this unit and not my centra AC/Heat system? Well, because after I detached the head unit from my wall (you just pull the display off the wall) l, the fan finally stopped. Horrible. Absolutely horrible. If I hadn't heard the fan it might've kept running indefinitely, wearing out the motor and running up my electric costs. This is inexcusably bad. Negative stars for that.

My system is a bit older and doesn't have the C wire which what some are saying is causing some of these smart home units to run the fan non-stop, but I swear the system mounting kit described how to wire the system and it was supposed to be compatible.

Either way, this is horrendous. Do some research and stay way from this crap.

I almost made the mistake of installing this at my mother in law's, thank goodness they didn't want it. I would feel guilty if it broke their ac/heating and ran up their electric costs.

This was the 2nd unit I was working on, so I opened the 3rd thermostat and completed the installation with that one, no problems. Since then, I have been trying to get this thermostat exchanged through warranty with Emerson (I was not able to start installing them until after the return window with Amazon had closed). It takes the people at Sensi days and days to answer an email - sometimes I have to resend - and I have never had anyone answer the support line even after being on hold for 30 minutes or longer. When they do answer my emails, it is obvious they have not read my email or understand my problem, as they ask me irrelevant questions or offer solutions that have nothing to do with my issue. Finally, they told me to just call the help line where, of course, there is no answer. I just need to exchange this under warranty!

After a few weeks they told me that it would be quicker for me to buy a replacement and they would reimburse as soon as they received the defective unit. The replacement worked fine and I drove 20 minutes to the Fedex store with my defective unit and the email from support with the Fedex shipping number.

I asked for the most economical shipping option and paid the $18.93 out of pocket to ship it to the attention of the person on the cancelled Fedex label. Sensi has not looked into why they cancelled that label but said that since they sent me the label they would not reimburse me for the shipping charge.

BigCrab,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2021","Updating this; I orginally gave this a 5 star review but after a couple days and on hold with support for an hour and a half I have to give it a 1 star and here is why:
it's easy to install however just so you know there are no instructions. so you install it and hope for the best but nope. my unit, (normal gas furnace with ac unit outside), was running for 30 seconds then shutting off. then back on for a while and off. repeatedly. well apparently there are setting for professionals only. you have to try google to use them. it came from the factory to be used with a 2 stage electric heat pump apparently. ok. so I now have it on gas and single stage. Now comes the big issue. the unit runs for a couple minutes and shuts off then back on in a few minutes. if you know about these you know it's the ""swing"". how low the temp goes before the unit kicks on. THERE IS NO SWING CONTROL. customer service said sensi is a ""TIGHT unit"". their words. and has a permanent swing built in of .5 degrees. this is incredibly inefficient. it fights to keep your room at EXACTLY the temp you set. it will increase your heating bill by 30% and think about the wear on your equipment!! it's going to burn it up much much faster. most swings are 1.5 to 2 degrees. warms up a house it cools down then warms back up. this maintains the same temp no matter the work. if you have money and dont mind then it might be perfect but for majority of users it's not practical whatsoever.

user,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2021","Buyer beware! If your HVAC system was working fine before you purchased this thermostat you likely received a faulty thermostat (or two) like I did that cannot activate both heat and cool.

I purchased the Sensi thermostat at first after installation everything seemed to be working fine (I only tested my heat so be sure to test BOTH zones right away). The heat worked fine on the thermostat but I found out there was an issue only after I tried to turn on my air conditioning a few weeks later. After double checking all of the wiring and settings, trying the O/B switch and resetting the thermostat hot air was still coming out. Wondering if maybe I received a defective thermostat I purchased a second smart thermostat from a separate retailer (to try and get a different batch of thermostats for sourcing etc.) and after a reinstall had the same issues.

Thinking there may have been a problem with my HVAC system I then paid to have a technician come out (from a SENSI partner company) and inspect my system. The technician started by looking at the thermostat wiring which was all in order. They then inspected my heat pump and HVAC system which was also all in order. The technician then came to the conclusion that I had indeed purchased a SECOND defective thermostat. To confirm this, the technician wired the system to activate the air conditioning and it indeed worked.

Finally on the third replacement thermostat I received a product that functions properly but if I had known it would have been this much of a headache and extra expense I would not have purchased this product to begin with. I have reached out to Emerson to reimburse me the cost of the HVAC tech I had to call, but I'm not holding my breath.

Gene,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2022","Update- August 2023. My heat is on. The thermostat is turned off, but the heat's on and my home is an oven. The best guess I have is that this thermostat charges the battery when the heat is on, and when the battery is low turns on the heat to charge itself. The same thing happened when I tried a Nest. So it doesn't need the C-wire, but be prepared to have the heat on in the Summer.

I'm updating my review. When I received the thermostat the installation stated that it wouldn't function without a C wire (despite the description). I called for help and I was told it wouldn't function without a C-wire. With a little push, they were able to tell me how to install it without a C wire, but stated the battery life would be horrible. I am dropping a star for the experience where I have to call for instructions while the app tells me I can't install it.
I have had it installed for 1 month at this time (Feb, 2023) and the battery still reads full. It has functioned well, and if you don't have a C wire seems the only way to go. I'll update when I have to replace the batteries.

When I moved, I wanted another one found it used very good condition on Amazon
1. No installation instructions but that’s OK. We can get those through the app online.
2. No card to tell us the code needed to activate the SMART capability. I paid an HVAC Tech to wait on hold for 10 minutes before we gave up
3. The real kicker is that the thermostat registered 53 degrees in my house which was actually 72 degrees
SOLUTION
The tech ran out to a local HVAC supply house and got a new Emerson smart thermostat. Had no issues installing that thermostat.

The lights all turned on, but the touch screen was completely frozen/inoperable, and also could not be operated through the app. I slept in 98 degree weather for 2 nights because of this. I called Amazon to send me a refund, but they made me drive to UPS and return the item prior to getting a new thermostat. Next, I ordered the non-touch screen Sensi thermostat, brand new for $100.

AmazonBuyer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2019","I have installed 15-20 thermostats over the last ~20 years so I'm not a newbie to this process. A thermostat install usually takes me 10-15 minutes if the wiring is already in place. In this situation, the wiring was in place (40 year old house so wiring wasn't that old). That said, I wasted 3.5 hours on this installation (along with troubleshooting) AND it still won't work.

The first challenge was connecting to my house wifi. My phone and the thermostat did not want to cooperate with the home wifi (the router is in the same room as the thermostat and my connection to other devices at that time was fine so I had a strong signal). Each time the connection would take, it would disconnect a few minutes later and I'd have to start from scratch entering multiple passwords into the app. Very frustrating.

I finally got the connection to stick for a while as I attempted to test the AC (as well as the heat). Nothing. I checked my circuit box to make sure the breakers were in the correct position...they were...went back to thermostat...nothing. I took the batteries out to force a reset...nothing. I unscrewed and screwed the wires...nothing. I checked the ""outdoor"" and ""indoor"" configuration settings and they were accurate. I even tried a couple modifications to the settings in case the device was wired incorrectly...nothing.

I finally gave up and reinstalled my old thermostat and the AC turned on immediately.

I expected this to take a bit longer than a typical installation due to the ""smart"" component (installing the app on the phone and connecting the device to the wifi), but 3.5 hours and still no functioning thermostat is not acceptable.

To top it off, I didn't attempt to install this thermostat until after the 30-day return period, so now I have a $100 reminder of my wasted time (and money).

Matthew Bass,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2023","This was a good thermostat and worked as expected. We paid $200 for it just over 3 years ago.

Don't expect it to last longer than 3 years. It may, but if it doesn't you will get zero help from the company.

The thermostat was working fine, then one day I got an alert that the indoor temp was reading high. I checked and it was reading 80 when it was only 70 inside. I eventually determined the thermostat was running entirely off the internal batteries instead of the external C-wire power (even though the C-wire was still delivery power as confirmed via multimeter). This was generating a lot of heat since the wifi was running off the internal batteries as well. The extra heat was causing the room temperature reading to be too high. There had been no physical damage to the unit. It just sat there for 3 years, working fine, until one day it stopped working.

Strawberry Burrito,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2019","1 star for wasting my time with your advertising jargon.

I bought this thermostat because I was interested in having a unit that I could call with an API and essentially control the temperature of my house with my own code. From what I can tell this thermostat use to have an API that Emerson has since removed in order to make more money with subscription services to control multiple thermostats at once.

This thermostat is advertised as DIY, so I figured that was referring to the API and home automation control you would have over it, but it was just referring to the fact that you could install it yourself.... JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER THERMOSTAT! So really this is just some fancy advertising.

Also they do not even have a webpage that you can control your thermostat with you have to use the mobile app, or go up to the unit.

If you don't care about programming your thermostat and only want the added ability to control a thermostat from your phone over the internet this might be a good choice for you because it was reasonably priced and had an easy to use and nice looking interface.

I think the fact that Emerson had an API and then they removed it and started charging to control multiple thermostats at once is super shady and makes me not want to support there business.

I emailed Emerson about API access and they never responded.

Rich P,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2020","This thermostat had a very difficult installation with the wire terminals (you had to be perfect with the alignment or the thermostat would not screw in. The wifi connection for me is stable unlike with some other reviewers, but if you lose power or connection, you have to manually reconnect including password, and that would be extremely problematic if away from the home. As a traveler, this would be a problem.

There are three extremely frustrating things about this thermostat. This thermostat does not have circulating fan without a firmware update (which clears your entire setup information when you induce the update). The power settings between being powered by the furnace electrical terminal and my I had two interactions with customer support who certainly did not have any idea on how the device worked and coffee read from a script. I had an HVAC tech test the C-wire power (my neighbor), and the proper 30 V was supplied which made the switch from C wire power to battery inexplicable. There is no setting in the firmware to force the power option to only use the wiring and not the battery. Finally, everything about the customer service experience, particularly the technical support, ends in ""you need a professional HVAC technician to look at your connection"" which is not correct as the wiring and power are not in question, the firmware and the memory settings of the ST-55 are.

I will tolerate this for a week but will probably return in favor of another version for my power company's rebate.",1.0 out of 5 stars

There is no Hold feature and the ""Schedule"" feature is turned off, so not knowing what else I could do I called customer service, explained the issue, and they verified that the thermostat was changing temperatures. So, I asked for a replacement. No, they can't do that, they first have to verify that someone else in my house was not manually changing the settings! I told them that the only person in the house was me. Still they needed verification. How I asked? They were going to have me ""lock out"" my thermostat so they could monitor it. How was I going to do that I asked? They would send me instructions on how to ""lock out"" the wall unit and then wait to see if the temperature changes.
What a hassle, what a policy and as of this writing the thermostat still changes temperature and I never got the ""lock out"" instructions. Now I learned that there is a recall on this model.

Gerald Morlitz,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2018","I purchased 4 sensi wireless thermostats a couple of months ago. We live in the Northeast and will be away for the winter. I wanted to be able to monitor the house temperature.

The 4 thermostats were installed by a professional (the person who installed the gas fired hot water system 4 years ago) and controlled heat only. A/C is on separate thermostats.

The appeared to work, but over time the battery indicator showed reduced battery level. I contacted sensi and spoke to a sensi representative. He told me that when they remotely reviewed my connection, all thermostats were on battery power rather than house power. He told me that the thermostats require 20 to 30 volts to operate from house current and if they operate only on battery, the batteries will probably last from 3 to 6 months. When they have no battery power they are as effective as door stops. Obviously, that’s an unacceptable risk for me.

I got my voltmeter and checked the wiring. I’m getting 26 or 27 volts at the thermostat. I tried to contact sensi by both e-mail and phone and have received no response.

Since I no longer have time to make a change to the sensi thermostats and check them, I replaced the sensi thermostats with the Honeywell and Lux programmable thermostats that I previously used. I am not pleased with sensi service.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Grand Dad,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2021","April 2021:
I installed the thermostat myself. It was not difficult. The instructions were pretty clear. I tested the cooling and the heating after installing to make sure it worked. Then about two months later, the cooling quit working. I called an HVAC technician because I thought the air conditioner was low on gas. The suction line was not cold. The tech did a lot of troubleshooting and decided the thermostat was bad. He replaced it with a Honeywell and the cooling came back.. He said the problem was that the thermostat is supposed to put our a 24 volt signal to start the compressor and it was only putting out about 18 volts. So I spent $400 to found out my $100 thermostat had crapped out. Sensi tech service has been a joke. First they wanted copies of the photos of my old thermostat wiring. Surprise! I had it and sent it. No comment from them. They did not expect that. Then they said for me call and help troubleshoot. Troubleshoot what? The HVAC professional said it was bad and replaced it and the unit started working. They have a serious problem at Emerson.
November 2021 Update:

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2023","I loved this for the first 2 months of having this.

We bought it because we have a Duplex that shares a furnace. It initially worked wonderfully.

After 2 months it was continually “offline” in the APP.

Finally I deleted the device from the app and completely reinstalled it as a new device. (I had already tried to reconnect successfully several times, but that would last less than a day).

Then I had around 2-4 months of continuous successful control from my APP. Last week the “offline thermostat” started again. It also sometimes doesn’t say offline but shows that I CAN control it and nothing happens when I try.

AC,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2020","I've had three of these units running 3 HVAC units in the house for years with no problems. A few weeks ago, one of them dropped the wifi signal. I reset the unit, the router, the wifi, everything. It always reset, but kept dropping the wifi signal within the hour again.

I figured it was broken, so I bought this NEW unit to replace the old one. But... same thing. Keeps dropping the signal just like the other one. In other words, I can always make the unit reestablish the connection, but it doesn't last.

Keep in mind there are 2 other units in the house with zero problems that have been running properly for YEARS.

I bought a new Netgear Access Point, so there is a stronger 2.4G signal in the house. No luck.

Reconfigured the router by moving the channels to less ""busy"" channels. No luck.

Reserved the IP via the unit's MAC. No luck.

Reconfigured the router dozens of times with different protocols and settings to see if there was something the unit wasn't agreeing wit. No luck.

In short, the only thing that makes sense is the older unit went bad. And the new unit arrived not working.

Nothing else makes sense.

Melissa,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2020","We had the worst experience with this awful thermostat. My husband has done electrical work in the past so it was very easy hooking the wires up especially with the app guidance. Get everything connected, turn on the ac and the furnace turns on, no way to turn it off unless you flip the breaker off. We knew we had everything wired correctly but called customer service and sent them all the pictures of our wiring he confirmed we had everything right and said he had no idea why it only turns on the furnace. Go through all theses steps to reset it and 45 mins later it starts working, got off the phone with the customer service since the ac seems to be fine now and try to connect the unit to WiFi with the app and it turns off the ac immediately and turns on the furnace but the app hadn’t even connected to the unit!! There was nothing telling the unit to turn on the furnace! And the display still said ‘cooling’ but was blowing hot air. So the conclusion seems to be that this thermostat will only work for ac if it isn’t on WiFi which is the whole point of having it. Such a piece of junk!

Nolan H,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2020","This thing was on the list of BEST Wi-Fi thermostats. I wasn't going to pay $150 to $200 for a Nest or something like that. Got this to replace the thermostat that had to have been over 25yrs old from the previous homeowners (just bought the house a month ago).

I had to re-boot this thing 4 times so far & still having the same issue. Hooked it up the same way the previous one was set at, which it did not have issues & only had a HEAT or COOL selection. Here with the Sensi, ONLY Aux-Heat works & it very slowly moves the temperature up. The Heat selection turns on the AC.

Maybe I will change my review but for time being it is staying a 1*.

Also, the features are not great for night time usage. Since it doesn't have a touch screen, you need to touch a menu button to get the backlight to turn on, which means you then need to press the back button to get to the main page to see the temperature. Then the buttons don't light up so you need to just know where the up & down buttons are. I'd say this feature makes no sense b/c for a thermostat you'd think that waking up in the middle of the night & realizing it is colder than you expect is one of the more likely times you'll be frantically looking for your thermostat.

There are two major problems with this thermostat. One, the batteries die weekly. I've had to change the batteries in the thermostat at least 4 times since I have installed it. The second problem is that it constantly disconnects from my wifi so I am unable to use the schedule option, or control it from my phone until I get back home to reconnect it. This is very inconvenient because it is currently 115 degrees where I live and when it disconnects and I get home from work my house is sitting at almost 100 degrees.

I thought my plumber was hustling me until I took the unit to my Big Box hardware store and we compared my amazon Sensi thermostat to the same item in the store! Sure enough my Sensi thermostat was missing a piece.

My Sensi thermostat arrived in a plain plastic envelope with no padding. The box was slightly crushed and there was no Saran Wrap, shrink wrap, cellophane on it like at Home Depot! I don’t know if it was new or used.

It came with 2 AA batteries, no mounting screws; My plumber had to use the old screws to mount the unit to the wall. As my plumber was installing it he believed that some screws were missing and some of my wires from my HVAC system could not be connected. He was correct and the unit was missing a small black piece with 3 screws. I know this because I asked my master plumber coworker to compare it to new out of the box units.

Anyway, the unit was installed and would only work on cool not heat. I don’t know if I got a lemon but I may just try the eccobee or nest!

Brittany Frank,"Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2019","So, it was easy to install which was the only saving grace. After a while though, you have to re-install it over and over again. If not, you walk into an 80 degree home. I installed it end of June and started having issues with it in the beginning of August. I keep my home cool, because of where I live (it feels like the surface of the sun sometimes) — so its hottest is 76 and 70 at bedtime. But, because I live in Tampa, FL (lightning capital of the Western Hemisphere), I thought maybe it lost power or WiFi connection. But even with power and no loss in WiFi connection, I’d have to reset it — DAILY! Then it would take 2 hours to turn on. I even had my AC serviced — no help. The AC would NOT turn on, despite it being 83 and set at 74. I could drop it to 59 (lowest setting) still wouldn’t go on. Then I would turn off everything: HVAC, breaker AND reset the thermostat and it STILL wouldn’t start cooling when put back on. So, needless to say, despite the feature of Alexa integration, this is the WORST thermostat I’ve ever used and I have used wireless thermostats for the last 15 years.

If you condo tower central system goes offline, this thermostat has a mind of its own. Resets itself, turns on a schedule that was never built. Turns on heat randomly or ac when it wants. If you aren’t watching it continuously, you won’t know. It burns through batteries monthly so if you aren’t there then you need someone to change them or have no view as to what is happening.

Phillip Baxter,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024","There is so much I like about this thermostat.

Pros:
The setup is great, the easiest I’ve ever installed. The app is great, very well laid out and makes scheduling super easy. I think the thermostat actually looks good. I don’t want my thermostat to look like something out of a sci-fi movie. It’s really intuitive for anyone to change the settings on the thermostat.

Cons:
It’s a big one, it short cycles like crazy. It’s like the software programmers for this thermostat were trying to make the system run as many cycles per hour as possible. You can see from my pics, the system turned off at 5:03, then back on at 5:09, then back off again at 5:16. The temperature never changed the whole time. I have cycle settings set to “slow”. This is supposed to make it cycle the least, and have the longest runtime. Well it runs for 6-9 minutes, then it’s off for 5-7 minutes. I had this thermostat installed for a week, and this is how it ran the whole time. Rapid cycling like this leads to increased humidity, decreased efficiency, and decreased HVAC equipment life. It takes a good 3 minutes for your HVAC system to cool down to operating temperature after the system starts. That 3 minutes is essentially wasted energy, it doesn’t contribute to cooling your home. That’s why longer runtimes are better, they have a bigger percentage of their runtime spent actually cooling your home. Longer runtimes are better for your compressor too, the biggest stresses on the compressor are at startup. Reducing the number of startups of the compressor leads to longer compressor life. This thermostat does the opposite.

Solution suggestion for Sensi:
If the designers of this thermostat would just add a couple of user settings, this would be my favorite thermostat out there. They need to add a compressor minimum runtime setting that users can enable, they also need to add a temperature differential setting that would allow users to set the thermostat to not turn on the compressor until the temperature is above the setpoint by 1 degree, and not turn off the compressor until the temperature is below the setpoint by 1 degree. These 2 settings would fix the short cycling issue.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Y2i,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2024","An update: The issue with WiFi was related to our network setup: we use the same network name (SSID) for 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. After assigning a different name to 5 GHz band, the unit connected to WiFi and has not lost connections for 3 days in a row. For the customers who have WiFi connection problems, and there are many based on the reviews, please assign different names to 2.4 and 5 GHz bands, and connect your thermostat to 2.4 GHz band.

The first thermostat works well now and we were about to rise the rating from 1 to 5 stars when we ran into another issue with the second unit. When we installed it to control a split system (an outdoor heat pump and an indoor electric air handler), the unit burnt the fuse that supplies 24 V to the fan controller board. After installing the old thermostat and replacing the fuse we found out that only one LED out of the four on the board is blinking. The air handler fan is working, but the outdoor heat pump is not. We ordered a replacement board and are hoping that the board was the only thing that was damaged by this thermostat. Please be careful when you are connecting this thermostat to a split system and when O/B wires are involved.

----------------------------------
We bought this unit because of the excellent customer reviews. It was installed yesterday without the C wire. It connected to WiFi and we were able to set up a schedule. Everything worked fine, but then the unit disconnected from WiFi , and the app kept showing that the thermostat was offline.

Some reviewers said that without the C wire the unit will simply drain the battery when WiFi is used. Today I ran the C wire and removed the batteries. The unit connected to WiFi right away and stayed connected for a while. Then it disconnected again, and now the app says that the thermostat is offline and the WiFi signal strength is low. But my phone shows excellent signal strength because the router is only 5 feet away.

The unit controls the furnace as expected without WiFi, but we already had a no-WiFi thermostat and wanted to control the new thermostat remotely, so it does not serve the intended purpose, hence the low rating. We ordered another unit, still based on the excellent reviews, may be our first unit is defected.",2.0 out of 5 stars

This setting is only accesable using the app, it cannot be found, verified or adjusted on the unit itself. Due to operating in tenths of a degree, my furnace never leaves the setpoint of 65. It can be warm out and stay at 65, but at some point as it cools down, it calls for heat while still displaying 65. Sensi on line support chat first said the differential is ""not adjustable, it would defeat the purpose being comfort"". The admitted it can adjusted and defended that the differential of 1.9 is half in either direction, but could never explain the math of 1.9 total being more that one that it should show 64 before calling for heat. Its either a rounding of tenths issue, it doesnt work, or it is not actualy adjusting to a 1.9 differential.

The thermostat is okay. I wish there was a way to dim the backlighting. I like that the app warns you of an issue.

However I wish that more settings could be handled in the app as opposed to on the physical thermostat so that if I am out of town and my internet at home goes down I can restore the thermostat to my chosen settings. I have a heat pump and after an internet outage, my thermometer reset to the setting that caused my heat pump to blow hot air instead of cold for about six hours. The app sent me a warning message to my phone which was nice but I could not do anything about at until I go home.
When I finally got home, my home was 88 degrees! My cats were miserable. Fortunately I was able to reset the setting. But if I had been out of town, I would not have been able to do so.

Note that the batteries are supposed to prevent changes to the settings, but that did not occur. I tested my batteries with my multimeter tool, and they were fine.

One thing that would solve this problem is if there was actually a physical switch in the thermostat for setting the heat pump. Other thermostats have this switch which guarantees that nothing can change it other than your physical hand. Power and internet outages can't change it!",2.0 out of 5 stars

Masternav,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2023","I wanted to replace a manual thermostat for my gas fireplace with a smart device, because we've accidentally left it on at night too many times. Every other smart thermostat I've looked at requires a C-wire, and the product information indicates that it isn't required. HOWEVER, the setup app will not progress if the user doesn't indicate that they have a C-wire. Reading the reviews, I found that the thermostat should actually work with only a two wire installation. I connected the wires to the same terminals that were in use for the old thermostat, and everything worked. The next hurdle was connecting the new smart thermostat to my Wi-Fi. An 8 digit PIN is required, and the directions state that it's on the back of the [already installed] thermostat and again on a pamphlet included with the package. The pamphlet PIN didn't work, so I had to take the thermostat off the wall. Sure enough, it had a different PIN than the paperwork had. Once I reinstalled on the wall and used the ACTUAL PIN from the back of the thermostat, everything connected. But the wifi connection doesn't last and has to be completed nearly every time it's accessed--useless as a smart device. Bottom line, the product is ok as a programmable thermostat only, and the instructions are contradictory, inaccurate, and confusing.

How about you let me decide how many batteries I want to go through and not make the choice for me? It had been working fine for a wile (certainly more than the 2 hour limit the online help says) without the C wire so the manufacturer must have pushed out an update or something that changed this.

JC,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2020","If you read through some of the 5 star reviews and even skim through them you will quickly see how suspiciously long and bloated they are - kinda like advertisements.

So why 2 stars instead of 1?
1. Looks nice.
2. Turns the AC on and Off
3. Has setting to have just the fan run a % every hour.

Now the bad-
1. Support is horrible. Had wifi connection issues during setup and was on hold for close to 30 minutes. Had a couple more issues during this time and on hold just as long every time and got the same tech every time. Only one support agent employed here or what? ( Had a different brand prior and their support always answered within a few minutes).

2. Temperature swing/ cycle rate - During peak hours the thermostat was cutting on and off 6-7 times per hour. Basically it would run for 10 minutes and shut off for 10 minutes over and over. This draws more power and will decrease the longevity of your ac due to increased wear and tear. It is better for the unit to remain on longer than do what this thermostat causes it to do. Another issue with this is that by only running 10 minutes or less at a time it doesn't allow enough time for the AC to draw the humidity out of the home. Here in Florida this is an absolute must. They have a setting called Cool or Heat cycle rate. The settings are Slow, Medium, Fast. Supposedly these are supposed to allow a swing within 1.9 degrees but setting to each made no real difference. I did seem to notice that while on fast the AC was on for less but still came on 10 minutes after shutting off which now increased the amount of times it was cycling on and off, UGH.
Ideally the unit if set to 74 should cool to 72.5 and then kick back on at 75.5. My dumb $25 Walmart thermostat is capable of this but the smart $100 isn't?

3. Scheduling is kinda strange. Took a bit to get used to and then found that if you added a new setting to the day group (a set time with the temp you want) it cannot be deleted. So while playing with it I now have 8 different times in the day that I have to set temps for even though the 4 in the middle are to remain the same.

4. Support is horrible. Yes I know this was number one but it is worth mentioning again. Emailed the company over a week ago about the cycle rate issue and to date I only have the auto reply that my email was received and I would be contacted shortly.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Tolerable issues. But the thermostat ""wore out"" after six years. In its fifth season, the thermostat wouldn't keep the heating stove on. If one overrode the programming for the current time, the stove would come on for up to a minute and then turn off. Ugh, probably an issue with the thermopile as the pilot light was still on. However overriding the temperature again would bring the heating stove on for another minute before the stove shut down again.

Bought another non-Emerson thermostat and no more issues with the stove. As stove worked with new thermostat, the fault lay with the thermostat.

J. Robinson,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2017","I really like the idea of smart home products. Unfortunately I've had so many issues connecting this thermostat to my Wi-Fi that I've been forced to use it as a dumb device. Let me start off by saying that I've worked in IT for about 10 years and by day-to-day job is designing, configuring and installing wireless networks. So I feel like I have a little knowledge in this area. I currently have a couple of TP-Link smart plugs and an Orbit smart sprinkler system controller which all connected to my wireless network without issue. This thermostat is an exception to this and I have wasted several hours and contacted Emerson support multiple times in an attempt to get it to connect. When I was finally able to get the thermostat to connect to my network it was more by luck than anything else. I didn't do anything differently compared to my several dozen other attempts. It just happened to work that time.

Things were great for about 2 weeks until the battery indicator went from showing fully charged one morning to almost dead by the afternoon and the Wi-Fi had disconnected.

At this point I'm not sure if I have the heart to spend hours trying to get it to reconnect. Based on the many positive reviews for this device I'm left to wonder if I have a defective unit or if there's something specifically about my network that it doesn't like.

Kevin Fitzpatrick,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2019","While 99.9% of this product works and I thought the installation was a chore but reasonable and well supported, for me a fatal flaw persists after nearly three weeks of use. The Sensi-Alexa integration fails on a frequent basis and has to be reset. While others may not be as annoyed with a problem like this, the attached excerpt from the case correspondence with Emersion details my thinking for taking a hard line. I will will revise this review with a 4-5 rating if Emerson solves the problem before my patience expires and I replace the product.

I reported the initial problem of Sensi losing its Alexa integration on 1/4/19, Case number 00316555 was created.

After watching the issues over the last 2+ weeks it is clear what the problem is. Sensi simply loses its account linking in the overnight hours with Alexa 3-4 times a week, not every day. The Sensi service, as managed by its app, has never failed. The issue simply seems to be the integration with Amazon’s service. It is easy to resolve and Alexa tells you what to do, simple disable and then re-enable the skill, a process that re-links the accounts.

While this is only issue I have with Sensi, it is fatal. I will replace this product with a competitive device that does not have this bug. I will give it some time since it does appear to be a correctable software issue at the cloud level. I will not put up with it indefinitely. I will manage my smart home with Alexa (or google depending on whoever first allows mass customization of the Wake word) and any compatible skill/service must interoperate flawlessly with these assistants. I will not have the time I saved from implementing automation to be stolen back from me by persistent administration tasks caused by correctable bugs.

As an ancillary note, when I first reported this issue some discussion was had about the problem relating to/caused by the use Alexa routines. This is not the case, I have tested this extensively. Addressing a thermostat action via routine never causes the integration of the accounts to break. My routines run daily, it does not fail every day. I forced routines to run thermostat actions while I was not sleeping, so I could watch the actions in real time. The integration never failed during these tests.

Speedy,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2019","As far as thermostats go, this one is about as basic as a ""smart"" thermostat gets. You can change the the temperature via wifi, set a schedule, etc. If you can get it set up that is, which for me was a byzantine process.

You're dependent upon the app for setup, and the app forces you though a slow step-by-step process which is designed for the less-tech-savvy. It asks for a lot of information, so hopefully you're comfortable giving Sensi/Emmerson your home address and phone number, because you won't get far in the setup without ponying up all that. And unfortunately, if anything's not right, or you get disconnected at any point during the setup, you have to start the whole process over again. It saves nothing. Not your wifi password, not the PIN number from the thermostat, it all has to be entered again manually. I'd memorized the 8 digit code on the back of my unit by the time I'd gone through that process a dozen times.

I eventually got on the phone with tech support, and after 20 minutes on hold, spoke with a friendly woman in India who informed me that my thermostat needed a firmware update. Okay. There was no indication of that on the thermostat or the app, so I'm not sure how I could have known that, but apparently that was the source of the problem. Everything was sorted out by the time I was off the call, but the setup process felt more like a game of ""Chutes and Ladders"" as many times as I was sent back to the beginning of the process, and seemed like the lengthy support phone call was an absolutely mandatory part of the process, in my case at least.

I shouldn't have to call you during a 9-5 hr schedule or get in a chat line in the same schedule. That's straight outta 2004, cmon, you can be better than that. The necessary android app hangs upon configuring th Sensi to use my 2.4ghz network. It will hang for 10 minutes, and then fail.

It's a functioning thermostat but I wasted money for the smart home feature at this point, since I can't get it to work, and badly designed customer service functionality keeps me from being able to talk with support when I'm home. I'm seeing other reviews saying it isn't compatible with certain routers. That shouldn't even be a problem. 802.11ac access points work with 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac standards and have 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands standard. I have a Netgear AC1750 which is a highly compatible and huge market share router AP combo unit.

S. Furst,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2022","I really wanted to like this thermostat. And for the first year, I did. I just need a simple WiFi thermostat that will allow me to turn up the heat at a remote cabin. I don't want something that ""anticipates"" my heating and cooling requirements, nor do I need geofencing, and I don't care about Alexa integration. This thermostat seemed to fit the bill.

The problem is that there seems to be an intermittent communication failure between Sensi's servers and the thermostat. I can adjust the temperature using the app while literally standing in front of the thermostat, using the same WiFi network, and nothing happens. The thermostat shows the WiFi symbol, but the set temperature never changes. The only clue that it is not communicating if you're not in front of the thermostat is that the app display never turns orange, symbolizing that the thermostat is calling for heat.

Sensi support has been worthless -- they don't answer Emails and you can sit on the phone forever. I even purchased a second Sensi thermostat thinking that the first one (which had worked so reliably for the first year) had died. Nope, same problem.

Naitch,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2022","First of all this did not work for me. I do not recommend it for use on a 4 wire system. You will need the common or 5th wire. Otherwise, your compressor will keep trying to start up and get worn out quickly. Sensi tech support told me this problem is called power stealing or power sharing. I was looking for a three to five degree differential or set point and this thermostat cannot do that. It has a 1° set point. The thermostat makes my system cycle seven times per hour. It keeps us up at night. I was told by HVAC contractors that this is very hard on the equipment. The only way to avoid that is to use a thermostat with a three degree differential or set point. I could not find one. My old Robert Shaw did this but it was not a smart thermostat. Make sure you have the C wire (5th wire).
UPDATE: I RAN A FIFTH WIRE AND GOT EVERYTHING RUNNING SMOOTHLY EXCEPT THE FREQUENT CYCLE TIMES. I'VE TALKED TO SENSI TECH SUPPORT SEVERAL TIMES AND THEY SAID THE THERMOSTAT WAS MADE FOR OCCUPANT COMFORT NOT EQUIPMENT LONGITIVITY.

1. The iOS setup didn’t work well. Took five tries and had to abandon the HomeKit approach. Ironically once I did that the Sensi app setup finished, and then HomeKit would work as well.
2. The app should allow for a scheduling option that is overridden automatically by geofencing (with a variable radius). The fact that you can choose schedule or geofencing but not both is ... quite an oversight. That is a really fundamental feature and y’all missed it!
3. No report of usage? Really?
4. Please allow for a manual temperature differential for those that want the control the slow/medium/fast setting doesn’t seem particularly helpful.
5. Some have mentioned that “the Sensi app isn’t so great but hey you can use Wink/HomeKit.” HomeKit for thermostats is featureless. Wink on the other hand is incomplete and unreliable for me so far. I would imagine that my sentiments match most in that I would much rather have a thermostat that got basic scheduling with geofencing right and a report of how much I am using it then almost half-decent wink and HomeKit integration. who cares that I can choose among three apps (that don’t play nice together afaict) when none of them seem to do something as basic as detect that I’m back within range and should kick the air conditioner back on?

I landed on this as it was on a list or three for best DIY smart house thermostat, the Amazon reviews looked within my range of acceptability and it seemed to tick my immediate boxes and my boxes for future growth. I just moved, my AC just died, they were going to charge me roughly the same for a standard Honeywell or something and ..... I wanted to grow my smart home in my new home.

I have now lived here several months and started to build out my smart home. This device has had an API rumored by its support as ""coming"" for over four years and its primary integration beyond its own app is via Wink which started charging a 5 buck a month fee for any meaningful feature.

I hope they release an API but I find myself looking at a more basic front end with better integration capabilities into my home automation system.

Also based on my experiences... the guy who posted the multiple measurements and how this artificially simulates the temp I believe to be right on and challenged to cool my FL home after a new system was installed through a FL summer.

Have been using our previous Sensi for over 3 years and it has only hung a couple of times. Hope the newer version works just as well.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I was told that ""we are aware of the connection issues,as some will connect and others won't.""He also said the ""C"" wire is NOT required-but if you don't have it,even with brand new batteries your gonna be re-booting your system like crazy trying to get even the ""SENSI Network"" to show on your tablet or phone.

I was on a loop hold for what seemed like hours. I hung up and sent an internet inquiry. I had the thermostat removed and switched to the old one which I had kept. Meanwhile I saw that the thermostat was reading Celsius and not Fahrenheit. After looking at videos and doing some research I finally managed to somehow get it to read in Fahrenheit. I still had an issue where I set the thermostat to a particular reading and it almost always cools 2 degrees cooler than the setting.

If you don't have a common wire, DO NOT PURCHASE, especially if your thermostat is most likely mounted in a location that makes running a spare wire difficult or impossible.

We got lucky during 1st set of 4 Sensi Emerson devices. Got through and support overrode zip code issue. But we found one device was defective... So, we bought another Sensi and same problem with setup in same overseas location.

Here's my letter to Sensi.

Hello Sensi Support, We have purchased and installed at least 10 Emerson Sensi Model# ST55 in my various properties. The installation in USA is easy. But the overseas or international is difficult. Due to needing a specific zip code / location, we have been forced to call Sensi technical support number.

Sensi Emerson Support

Unfortunately, this requires a long distance phone call where we must hold on the phone line until someone actually responds.  There is no way to leave a message.

We recently purchased 4 Sensi devices.  The devices were setup with nice Sensi Emerson support. The Sensi support person was able to override Sensi's zipcode limitation for the Las Terrenas in Dominican Republic. The allocated zip code is 32000.

Unfortunately, one device was defective immediately and never could sync temperature of room. It was way off.  So, we bought a replacement Sensi. Now, we need help again to set up the 4th Sensi device.

My requests are as follows:
(1) Can the zip code 32000 be made permanent in Sensi system?
(2) Can someone call or email me back from technical support / setup support?
(3) Am I able to get a refund on my defective Sensi?

Note that I have championed your Sensi Emerson product to others. I have continued to do so regardless if my recent setback. But, I would like some help for my issue.

James W Wood,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2023","We travel a lot and are often away during cold winter months. I have customarily set our standard thermostat to 45 degrees on leaving the house. When we return during winter, we immediately reset the thermostat to 70. However, it takes nearly 24 hours for the slow climb from 45 to 70, so we huddle around portable electric heaters till the temperature's tolerable.
I thought that I'd be able to use this Sensi thermostat to start the temperature climb remotely a day before arriving. Device setup was necessarily a little involved, but the directions were completely adequate. After setup, I tested various functions using the app on my iPhone as well as using the buttons on the device. Everything worked as I expected, so I didn't mess with the device or its iPhone app further. However, the night before the morning that we were to scheduled to leave on another extended trip, I noticed that the house was getting awfully hot. I checked the Sensi thermostat and it was set for 69 (just where I had set it days before), but the actual temperature reading was 81. I tried turning off ""heat"" on the device, but the heat system stayed activated. I tried changing the thermostat setting to lower values --- again the heating system stayed on. I tried connecting to the device with my iPhone, but it would no longer connect.
As you'd expect, I removed the Sensi ""smart"" thermostat and reinstalled the ""no smarts"" old-school Honeywell bimetallic strip thermostat. It still worked fine, so I set it for 45 and we left on our trip. It's unacceptable for a smart thermostat to go rogue. Kind of like the computer named ""Hal"" in the movie 2001. I'll probably play with this Sensi smart thermostat whenever we return to the house again, but I'll never trust any ""smart"" thermostat again. I think using a smart thermostat is OK as long as you can checkup on your house daily, but my use case would require independent backup systems to automatically disable the ""smart"" thermostat if/when it goes rogue.

She is the other woman in our house, so sometimes she won't listen. My husband says it's my Southern accent because when I say, Alexa, turn the thermostat up 3 degrees. She tells me she can only turn it up to 92. My husband thinks she assumes I am saying ""thirty"". Southern aside. This unit was going along okay, and I was minding my own business when three days ago, ya know in the middle of SUMMER, I thought it was getting warmer and warmer in the apartment. We are used to this as our downstairs neighbor has made a pact with the devil to keep her heat on year-round to 100. So we are used to having to keep our AC going even in winter to keep from passing out. Long about lunchtime, it was getting to be about 84 in the apt. This is way past what I keep it at so after having an argument with ""the other women"" to keep turning the unit down and nothing was changing I went and pulled up the app. The app showed my unit was supposed to be down to 62 by this point and was ""cooling"" but it was 82 in the apt. I went and checked the unit and the same thing was happening. I left it run like this overnight and it was running the fan but not the AC. My husband says I think it's the thermostat.

So, he took this one off and put the original one back on the one I hate.

So, in my opinion, something is not right with the unit but so far there is something MORE wrong with how such a large company is treating a customer having an issue. Dear Emmerson, if you are reading this, you might want to go read your Google, Instagram, Facebook, and website reviews next. Because until I hear back you, I will leave a review about this issue daily. I did not spend 100.00 on a unit to be left in the middle of a battle between the Southern Summer heat and the neighbor who produces enough heat to put the sun to shame!

It's easy enough to install. So my husband tells me. It was easy to connect to our Alexa and our Alexa show. It has a good temperature variant that others don't have. The app is easy to use and set up schedules. WHEN IT WORKS",3.0 out of 5 stars

Dan K,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2018","Third Update: 09/26/18
Moved rating up to three stars. Replaced batteries with the Engerizer Lithiums. Unit has not been dropping offline like it was previously. Still showing full charge after two months. As long as the unit is working I am more than happy to replace the batteries every few months if needed.

Second Update on 07/25/18:
Boy is this unit frustrating!!! Spent a couple hours messing with the thermostat and calling support. Finally talked to a tech that was informative. It comes down to this to reconnect the wifi:
1. Check battery level icon. If showing three or less bars you need to replace batteries.
2. Pull unit off of wall, take out batteries, wait a minute and replace batteries.
During this time record the 8 digit code on the back. It is 3 numbers, a dash, 2 numbers, a dash, and 3 numbers. You will need this code later. Reinstall unit back on wall.
3. Make sure your phone is connected to the 2.4 wifi and not the 5.0 wifi on your home internet. It will not work on the 5.0 wifi system.
4. Turn off the cellphone data portion on your phone. It will sense this and not work properly.
5. Open the sensi app and press the ""+"" icon in the upper right of screen. Select the correct picture of your unit. Select ""on the wall"".
6. On the thermostat press ""menu"" button and then ""next"" button.
7. Follow the prompts on the sensi app on your phone.
8. You will also need the password for your home internet.
9. Hopefully, cross your fingers, this will bring your wifi connection back online.
10. After everything is done and hopefully working, turn your mobile phone data back on. You can also now reconnect to your home wifi 5G data if preferred.

The tech explained to me that you need to have a ""C"" wire hooked up and powered for everything to work properly. Without it you will see some wifi connection issues since it is using a lot of power from the batteries. So if the battery level is three bars or less you will have problems.
My solution: I will buy some Energizer Lithium batteries and replace them every few months when I see 3 - 4 bars.

I will raise my rating to 2 stars since it is now working again. But, you have to jump through a bunch of hoops to keep it working.

Update 07/25/18:
Been using for 5 months. The wifi drops offline every once in awhile. So, unable to set a schedule or control the unit wirelessly. This time the wifi would not come up at all. Tried resetting the unit a few times and keep getting errors. Unable to set up wireless so unable to change the schedule. Now it is just like a regular unprogrammable thermostat.
So, I called support. He told me that the wireless will malfunction if there is no ""C"" wire. So, it will not work without a ""C"" wire!!! Downgrading my rating from 5 stars to 1 star!!!

Bought this unit because of the ""C"" wire issue. Mine had a c wire but it was not powered. Go figure! Tried a couple of the Honeywell units, they did not work at all. Was looking at nest and a few others but decided on this one since it definitely worked for others.

They unit was easy to install and straight forward to setup. The app works well. The display on the unit is easy to understand and use for less tech savy people (my wife). May not look fancy on the wall like some others though. Highly recommend and would buy again!",3.0 out of 5 stars

Tron Carter,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2018","I tried to get this thermometer to work for the entire month I had it, but ultimately had to return it because it was just too unreliable.

When I first received the unit in early April '18, I wanted to try it out right away. Ultimately I was going to install a new furnace and a/c in a few weeks, but wanted to see how this thing worked, so I hooked it up to the soon-to-be-repaced furnace. That furnace didn't have a ""C"" wire, but no problem, the unit says it will work without one. My router is about 12 feet away in the same room as the thermostat. Right away wifi would be up for 30 seconds or so, and then disappear for 30 seconds or so, up, down, up down. At this point, since I couldn't stay connected to it for long enough to set a schedule on the app, I set it for manual mode. When I woke up the next day, the manual set point had changed from 63 to 70 for no apparent reason. I emailed tech support and they said they were having server issues and it should be straightened out shortly. I left it in manual mode for the next few days and wifi seemed to straighten itself out and it would stay connected. I wanted the backlight to stay on all the time, but the only way to do this, according to tech support, is to add a ""C"" wire. He also added that a ""C"" wire will ""definitely improve wifi range/strength"" (for all of you having wifi problems). I added the ""C"" wire and it did make the backlight stay on (when I set it in the app). The next thing I noticed is that when I added the ""C"" wire, the current room temp shifted to be off by 4 degrees. Remove the ""C"" wire and it goes back. Without the ""C"" wire I didn't need to use the ""offset"" feature of the app, but with a ""C"" wire I needed to set it to -4. This worked for about a day and then mysteriously the app set itself back to 0 degrees offset. I was tired of messing with it at this point, but was just about to pull out the old furnace and install the new one, so I wasn't going to spend any more time troubleshooting something that might go away with the old furnace. New furnace installed, same problem. It has forgotten the offset 3 times in 2 weeks. One of those times I noticed shortly after a brief power outage, but I don't know if it was related to the temp offset being reset.

3 stars because most of it works well and I think the app is easy to use, but I wouldn't buy it again and can't really recommend it. If it can't keep its settings, it's useless.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Nicolas D. Gyma,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2019","Like many of you looking for smart integration devices for you home, I chose to upgrade my thermostat and chose this device because of its price point and reviews. Be warned though as it is not as straight forward it claims to be.

1) This device will not work over WiFi on batteries alone, you NEED to connect it to a C wire that is powered from your heating/cooling system.

2) If you have separate heating and cooling systems, you need to dig into the advanced installers guide to figure out where to source your C wire from. There is a couple wiring diagrams in there that should show you how to wire it up based on your configuration. Then you have to actually figure out how to make the connection. For me, I have a gas fired furnace in the basement and an A/C unit in the attic. Two separate thermostat wires come into where the old thermostat was placed. I first chose to utilize the heating systems 24V output for the C wire because it was easier for me to install. Even though I measured 24V at the thermostat location itself on that wire, it still dropped WiFi because it went into power save mode for some reason. I then tried wiring it to the A/C handler, based on the wiring diagram I found showing it as such after much frustration and digging. It is now working in that configuration. So if you have a setup like this, source the C wire from the A/C unit, not the heating unit.

Who knows if this will hold true once cooling season is over and heating season begins. I also changed the batteries when doing this, so it might be that the batteries are still strong enough to hold the WiFi on. Only time will tell.

Technical support is very hard to get a hold of and limited in their helpfulness. All they said was I needed a C wire, even though the description for this device right here on amazon it says it will work without one. THAT IS NOT TRUE! It will work as a regular thermostat with just a battery, but who buys this expensive device for that purpose?

Overall its great when it works, integrates with your Alexa devices, and is easy to use. Just be prepared to go through some trouble on the install.",3.0 out of 5 stars
GrafZeppelin127,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2020","I bought two of these, as I have separate thermostats for A.C. and heat. The first one works fine, and stays connected to WiFi. The second one works too, but annoyingly tends to drop the WiFi signal at random times, usually right when I try to control it through Alexa or the phone app. It typically reconnects on its own a minute or two later. They're both connected to the same network, same router, and are mounted a few feet away from each other; the one -closer- to the router is the one with the problem. Both show batteries full. I'm thinking the second one must be defective; will try Sensi tech support before I return/exchange it.

UPDATE: OK, I think I see what's going on here. Both thermostats are running on batteries only, with no ""C"" wire, on separate heat (RH and W/E wires) and A/C (RC, G and Y) systems. The heat thermostat will drop the WiFi signal when it's ""busy,"" i.e., heating the house, i.e., set to a higher temperature than the Room Temperature readout; once the house is heated to the set temperature, at some point thereafter, it will reconnect on its own. Meaning, if I get home at 10pm and turn on the heat, when I go to bed the thermostat will show no WiFi signal but by the time I get up in morning it'll be back. I need a few more days to confirm this pattern without resetting the thermostat.

Because it's winter I haven't used the A/C thermostat yet except to check that it works (i.e., turns the compressor and blower on and off), I don't know if the same pattern will hold when summer rolls around; it hasn't dropped WiFi signal yet but that may only be because it's not ""busy"" as described above. Nevertheless, as long as I can turn the heat or A/C on remotely before I get home, and turn it off by voice when I leave the house or remotely if I forget to do that -- which is the only reason I felt the need to get a smart thermostat -- I may be able to live with it like this.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Mohamad A.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2021","The first one I bought would not register, technical support on the phone was of no help, and just kept repeating instructions as if they were reading a script. The call dropped (cell phone on my side) and they never called back. I tried emailing them, and they took 6 days to respond. By then, I had given up on making the first one work, and contacted Amazon for replacement, which arrived promptly, and worked from the first time without any issues.

The thermostat is very easy to install and use. The button layout and function are very logical. It keeps the temperature very constant in the house so no issues there. It works with a common (blue) wire or batteries.

The two flaws I found, which to some could be deal breakers are:

1) Schedule setup from the thermostat is quite tedious. You are much better off using the app to set it up. If you don't have the app, you need to download some instructions from somewhere because none is provided with the thermostat.

2) The alarm thresholds are fixed. So if you want to be informed once the temperature in your house for example, drops below 55, you won't be able to do that. The ""low temp"", ""high temp"", ""no heat"", and ""no cool"" notifications are not user adjustable.

Area for improvement? Besides fixing the above, It would be nice if it came with a light sensor that turned on the backlight display automatically in the dark, or if motion is sensed nearby for devices that have the common wire and can afford the power consumption, but that is not a big deal.",3.0 out of 5 stars
kdeinhouston,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2020","Bought two from Amazon ""Used Like New"" a week or so apart.
I'd read reviews where some users were having WiFi problems because they didn't have a 'common' wire connection (Emerson says you can manage without one in most installations). I didn't want to take chances so I installed it using one of the 'Add a Wire Kits' available that multiplexes two signal onto one wire, freeing up a wire that is used to provide a 'C' connection. Once installed you have a slick looking thermostat that works just like any other modern thermostat. To get remote access and control, as well as get access to certain critical tuning settings you must activate the WiFi. To do this you create a free account on Emerson's Sensi Network and register your thermostat. This process is super easy using your smartphone.
Thermostat #1 installed and was connected via WiFi to the Emerson Sensi server without a problem. It's working great and is integrated with Alexa. We love it!
Thermostat #2 was an even easier install as I had a 'C' wire available. With the thermostat installed I proceeded to connect the WIFi and register it with the Sensi network. That when I found out it was already registered to the original person who then decided to return it to Amazon. No big deal the prerecorded tech support messages say... ""Send us a photo of the MAC address label on the back of the thermostat and we'll Unregister it"".
That's why the Sensi tech support team get TWO STARS... I'm sure they are probably working from home during this pandemic but they are AWOL as far as I'm concerned.

James Blackburn,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2019","I purchased this as a replacement for a standard Honeywell programmable thermostat. I really like the look of the Sensi as it’s not overly modern and matches the original white thermostat and room. Setup went fine, although I could see how someone a little less patient or tech savvy could get lost. With that said it seems like there is plenty of technical support availible online for this model.

The good: Looks traditional, good tech support, great display, shows humidity, app is fairly user friendly.

The bad: The main reason I purchased this thermostat was due to the geofencing feature. I have an unpredictable schedule and so setting a heating program doesn’t work well. Often I leave the house and forget to turn down the heat, or i’m home and the heat turns down on its own. The geofencing seemed like a perfect solution to ensure this was automatically taken care of. Unfortunately the Sensi geofencing feature is only beta and really doesn’t offer the necessary options to be practical. Currently if you want geofencing you’re limited to it turning down the temp by 3deg when you leave a 5 mile radius. That’s not very much turn down, which should be adjustable, and if you work within 5 miles it’ll never work. Also if you choose geofencing you can’t use the program schedule so if you want it to turn down overnight you’re stuck doing that manually. When you come home it should be able to swap over to a schedule and continue like a programmable thermostat.

How to make it better: Improve the geofencing so the temperature turndown is adjustable, the distance is adjustable and that it can be combined with a programmed schedule so when you return home it goes back to its normal run sequence. Making these seemingly minor app changes and you’ll have a five star thermostat.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Trying to set up the tstat without a cellphone running their precious app is very hard because of the lack of paper documentation or online (internet) web documents. Then, when the HVAC professional arrives, who wants to sell you another product instead, Emerson causes YOUR labor bill to run up while they play the same tune in your ear waiting for ""priority"" tech support for an HVAC professional. A joke. Their tech line was no faster than a regular customer pushing customer option so the tech left before getting answers from anyone about a setup involving heat pump and propane heater combo, etc. It was unclear how Sensi was telling when to switch from heat pump to propane since it will not permit an external sensor and Emerson still doesn't allow or sell its own external sensor with this t'stat. Still unclear so guess we'll see how next freeze is handled, from hundreds of miles away,unable to step in if this t'stat doesn't handle things properly. My review years promoted this same t'stat.

Craig,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2019","Generally a reasonable thermostat and wifi interface is ok, though wi-fi connectivity is somewhat flakey (mostly connected but not always). Had problems getting it to connect to Wi-fi initially. An hour on the phone with support resolved it, but never got it to be controlled by voice command using Google Home (not a big deal for me). Biggest gripe is that it doesn't adapt to heating rate to be up to temperature in time. If you turn on ""Early Start"", it's supposed to reach a set temperature at the time that you set. The problem is that it doesn't keep track of the heating rate, and my furnace must take longer to heat than its hard-coded algorithm, so it was never up to the set temperature in time when it was cold out. It would be far better if it recognized that the house isn't heating up as fast as the hard-coded rate and adapted the next day to start to heat earlier, or give you an option to set a parameter to adjust relative to the rate of heating for each house, but it doesn't. It just starts heating with stage one 8 minutes early for each degree that it has to rise, and switches to stage two 30 minutes before the set time. That might work for some houses but isn't a good match for mine. They should improve the software and provide an update to either the thermostat or Android app to tweak the ""Early Start"" setting.

I'd give it a 5 star, except that within less than a month of ordering the item, Amazon dropped the price. I don't know if that happened within a day or a week. Today it's 26 days after ordering and the price is lower than what I paid by about $15 after tax. Seeing a price drop and having no way to recover the difference is worth one star to me.

Right now.... I have installed several from Honwywell (for home and friends) without this issue.

When it works, it's a nice Wifi thermostat. The app is easy to use, and setup was pretty painless and straight-forward. Seemed to accurately keep the temperature set and I really had no complaints about it.

Now our thermostat on the second floor, bought 15 months ago, won't connect to Wifi any longer. No worries, I'll just reach out to their customer service, which is advertised as being available ""7 days a week."" That was 4 days ago.

Person,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2018","I liked the fact that it has buttons as a backup (and a battery backup), but:
1. The Alexa and Google skills are dangerous. Commands to either are liable to put the thermostat on Auto mode, and whatever temp it has becomes a mid-point for both the cool and heat set-points. For example, ""set the thermostat to 75"" will switch the unit to Auto sometimes and set the cool point to 84 and the heat point to 67 or something like that. I've had it decide to turn on the heat in the middle of July because it jacked the heat set point (again, Auto mode) to 76 when I gave the command to set the thermostat to 76. Very buggy, since I don't want to ever have it on Auto (for this reason).

2. The app and Web site are not friendly to screen reading software like Voiceover or NVDA. Buttons are unlabelled, the About screen is unreadable, and a blind user cannot identify what the temperature set point is. Control by HomeKit works fairly well, but the controls are difficult to adjust because the slider is very sensitive (Auto mode, again, is pretty unusable in the Home app).",3.0 out of 5 stars
L Duffy,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2021","We’ve had these thermostats for almost two years. It’s a mixed bag in my opinion.
The location feature never worked for us because our address is not available in google maps. So that was a bummer.
The app works pretty well. If you make a change it registers immediately. The schedules are pretty easy to set up.
One of the biggest selling points for us was the keypad lockout. Our young kids were always fiddling with our old thermostats and this was a great solution. EXCEPT... the Sensi tends to go offline from WiFi a lot. Every time the batteries get less than halfway used up, every time the WiFi hiccups. And when it’s offline, you can’t turn off the keypad lock. So you’re locked out. The online instructions for reconnecting a lost connection rely on the keypad lock being off. There is no simple override to the keypad lock and that is a HUGE issue for that feature.

Sephronia,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2020","I like everything about this product EXCEPT that there is a major design flaw. Others have mentioned this. The temperature differential (the difference between when your furnace turns on and shuts back off) is FAR too small. Even on the ""slow cycle"" setting (largest differential), the temperature differential is just +/- 0.2 degrees F. The PROOF: Look at the attached plot where my daytime set temp is 68F and nighttime 67F. (OK, I am a data nerd. I have a calibrated sensor sitting on top of the thermostat logging data continuously to my phone.) This is a REAL problem with high efficiency furnaces (which most are now) because their efficiency is greatly reduced when the furnace cycles on and off in quick succession. In the plot, you will see that the furnace turns on and off 22 times a day when the outdoor temp is 35-45 degrees F! This is far too often.

So a quick reset/reinstall and its back in service. Fast/easy enough to do (especially the 2nd, 3rd time etc), but nevertheless a thermostat is not something I want to be thinking about frequently.

music on vinyl,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2019","Very happy with multiple Sensi wi-fi smart thermostat installations. Well implemented app and easy to follow directions for various types of applications. If you don’t have a “C” wire, it’s relatively easy to add one. You need a 24 volt plug in transformer (about $14 on Prime), and some thermostat wiring. The transformer and 2 wire thermostat wire are independent from your furnace and other thermostat wiring. You just connect one end of the two wires to the transformer, and the other end of the two wires to the correct terminals on the thermostat, and plug the transformer into a traditional electrical outlet. Your existing thermostat wiring just gets transferred to the matching terminal markings on the Sensi. Great flexibility with settings and programming with the user friendly app. Controlling and monitoring your temperature and thermostat from anywhere remotely is very handy. Great way to jump into the smart house scene.

Edit 1/26/2020

I think I may have discovered the reason so many people are having issues with their Sensi installs and the constant Wi-Fi connection problems.
I have four Sensi smart thermostats that I've installed over the course of about a year. The first three installs were very straightforward. Those units have all performed perfectly from the day I installed them. Not a single dropped Internet connection or any other issues. The Sensi mobile app is great, and provides amazing control over programming and controlling the thermostats. I have purchased eight of the Sensi thermostats, but have only installed half of them so far. Most of the units I've purchased have been returns that I've bought for about half price online. Most of them have been registered previously with Sensi. It isn't difficult to have them unregistered through an email request that the app prompts you to do. The two caveats are that you will not have remote access or be able to complete the setup of the thermostat until you are able to register it to your account. The thermostat will still function locally like a traditional thermostat, so that's good. The other problem is that  Emerson / Sensi is painfully slow processing requests to unregister thermostats. Count on at least two weeks. You will have to return to the location of the thermostat to finish registering the unit once Emerson gives you the confirmation they unregistered your thermostat. This is the price of buying a returned unit at half price.
The fourth Sensi install has been difficult. I revisited the Amazon listing for the Sensi thermostats. I was hoping to find some answers to my install problems from some of the reviews on Amazon. I was quite surprised on the number of newer negative reviews. I originally chose the Sensi because of the positive reviews online and on Amazon.
I was having a couple of different issues with the install of my fourth Sensi. Each of my installs were unique as they were for different types of heating and cooling units. Most of my installs were for heat only, including the fourth one. The fourth install was for a Modine warehouse style heater. This required 4 wires. Red heat (Rh), White (W/E), Common (C), and Fan (G). I tested the C (common) with a multi-meter. and I was getting right around 26 volts (correct voltage). Testing is done with the Red lead to Rh and the Black lead to C. The C wire completes the connection and provides constant power to the thermostat to power the Wi-Fi Internet connection. I've seen some comments about not needing a C wire for the Sensi. This may be true, but you will eat through batteries if you rely on them to keep power for the Wi-Fi connection. Technically, you do need a C wire for reliable remote access.
My issues included constant dropping of the Wi-Fi and inconsistent operation of the heater and blower / fan. I did check all of the setup parameters for type of heating unit, etc through the app. Everything was set correctly. The Wi-Fi network that this Sensi is connected to is super stable, and has two other Sensi thermostats that maintain reliable connections through Wi-Fi. The issue with the fan I was having is that unless I switched the setting for fan to ""on"", the heat would not kick on. The correct setting on the thermostat for the fan would be ""auto"". When set to ""on"", the fan stays on even when the unit is not heating. If I set my fan setting for ""auto"", the heater would not kick on.
I was fairly confident I had my wiring correct at both the thermostat and at the transformer on the heater side. It's harder to be certain on the transformer / heater side, because the terminal markings are not consistent from manufacturer to manufacturer. I was lucky enough to find a photo online of the terminal markings and what they represented for my exact Modine unit with the same transformer. I was starting to think that this Sensi unit was defective (like many others do based on negative reviews). I did do some wire swapping, but always ended up back where I started regarding the wiring arrangement. Voltages were all reading accurately at the thermostat. I had the face of the unit on and off from the back plate / wall mount many times. On one occasion, while guiding the thermostat back onto the wall mount, I was applying some upward pressure and heard some electrical clicking at the heater as though it was about to kick on. That was my ""Aha"" moment. The pins that coincide with the thermostat wiring on the main unit / face plate and the related pin openings on the wall mount were not making a good connection. They briefly made a decent connection when I put some increased pressure on the thermostat / face plate. I was able to recreate this heater clicking reaction by pushing on the thermostat. I wasn't certain exactly where the connection was failing (which wire or pin), but I tried a couple of things, and they seemed to have fixed my issues. The first is that I shimmed the back plate away from the wall with a small strip of cardboard behind each end of the back plate and the wall. This would allow the thermostat face plate a little more travel on the wall mount side (deeper seating of the pins). The second thing I did was to go over each thermostat wire where they connect to the back plate / wall mount and reinserted them and made sure that the screws that hold each wire in were very tightly drawn down on each wire. This fixed the fan issue (I was able to set the fan to ""auto"" and have it turn on and off with the heater). This also fixed the Wi-Fi dropping issue. I'm still waiting for Emerson / Sensi to unregister this particular thermostat, and I will revise my review with an update once I have remote access and can confirm these fixes have remained stable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Richard,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2018","Purchased this model based on the good reviews and the no requirement for a c-wire. Decided to replace my 17-year old RobertShaw thermostat (t-stat) because I wanted remote capability. I was hesitant to touch A/C wiring whereas I had no experience with A/C wiring. The A/C company wanted $90.00 to install it, but I decided to do it myself since it was just a 4-wire system. (no c-wire). It took me just 15 min to remove the old, and then install/wire up the new t-stat. That's how easy it was. Was able connect the t-stat to my 2Ghz wifi network and used the Sensi app on my mobile. Everything worked just fine. No issues at all with wifi setup and using the app. It works exactly as designed.
You can make t-stats adjustments either by wifi or LTE on your mobile. No delay in signal. My wifi has never lost signal and has stayed up now for 1 week.

The t-stat itself (on wall) has very few settings. Just has temp control, fan/auto/heat/cool and wifi settings. All other settings are done via your mobile. There is also a light switch at the top of the t-stat that when pressed, stays on for 10 seconds, then turns off. BTW: The t-stat light is always off until you press any button. LCD screen is very easy to read with or without the light.

One of my requirements for a t-stat was to have a differential as to how much longer a unit will run once it hits its set temp. This model does not have a adjustable value, but does have a ""cycle rate"" of slow/medium/fast. I set mine to slow to keep it from turning on/off too many times. From the measurements I have taken with a infrared thermometer, the ""slow"" cycle has a differential of 0.7 degrees. This seems to be inline with what Emerson says (actually, they say within 1 degree).

Important note: If your home loses internet access, you will NOT be able to control the t-stat, even when you are at home on your local intranet. Some systems still let you access your devices via the local intranet, but this t-stat require cloud access 24x7.
Now, in case your t-stat screen is locked, and you lose internet connection, you have no way to do any changes on the wall unit since the screen is locked and your mobile is the only way to unlock it. In this case, Emerson has a key sequence you can press on the wall unit to unlock the display. (btw: the screen lock is a feature that you enable on the t-stat to prevent people from making changes on the wall unit)

Small issues:
The light switch at the top of the t-stat is hard to find and press. I never hit it on the first attempt. Always have to feel around at the top and press hard.

There is one problem I constantly hit. I goto my Sensi app and change any setting (temp, lock/unlock screen). The Sensi app accepts the setting changes, so you think all is good. However, when I look at the t-stat on the wall, no changes occurred (see attached picture). This has happened numerous times each day since I have had it. Called support and they are not aware of any issues. In each failure, my wifi signal is up - no problems with wifi.
After a few days of this happening, I see the problem. It does not appear to be the t-stat, but rather the Sensi app itself. It somehow is hung up, but gives the appearance that it is operating. If I kill the app, and restart it, the sync up to the t-stat is working again. Each time that the app behaves this way, I just kill and restart it. Works every time. So, each time I use the app to make a setting change, i just kill the app and restart when I need it.

The accuracy of the t-stat is pretty accurate (within 0.5 degrees of my infrared thermometer)

Overall, love the product. I can easily control my t-stats from my mobile or directly from the wall. Makes life very easy now. BTW: Works great with Google Assistant. I use my Android phone to adjust temperature settings (i.e. Hey Google: Set the temperature to 70 degrees"")

Update: 12/10/18:
Product has worked flawlessly. No issues at all with wifi connectivity. Never had a dropped connection. Both wifi and 4G LTE connections always connect just fine. When making thermostat changes on your cell phone (wifi or 4G LTE), changes take effect within a couple seconds. Also, the problem mentioned above regarding the app freezing when your cell gets out of sleep mode, this has been fixed a while ago in an updated Sensi app. All around, everything works great. Love this product - makes it very convenient to remotely control your AC.

Update: 3/1/2020
Everything has worked flawless. Still have original Energizer AA batteries (full bars). Never had any LTE/Wifi connectivity issues.

Update: 4/2/2021: Not a single problem. Works flawlessly.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jim & Renae,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2019","We wanted a new thermostat for several reasons. The old Honeywell was working fine but it had several deficiencies. First, it was too easy for our grandson to change the settings. And the display was hard to read unless you stooped right in front of it. And the programming was a nuisance.

Searching for a thermostat with screen lockout we discovered that none of the good ole Honeywell residential thermostats have this feature. So we moved-on to almost-as-good - almost-as-old Emerson which has this feature on most of their residential products. Out utility company offers a $25 rebate on programmable thermostats and a $100 rebate on WiFi thermostats. With a Prime Day price of $75 this thermostat is basically free. However we were concerned by all the complaints about setup and network problems. So here is what we found.

The good -

1) Excellent manual controls and screen visibility, copied from the refined design of the legacy Emerson line. Most other WiFi thermostats have too much screen clutter in the attempt to eliminate buttons. Old-fashioned buttons really are better for the most common functions even if they don't look stylish.

2) You can control almost anything you want from your smart phone - after you complete setup.

3) You can configure this thermostat to work with almost any kind of HVAC system.

4) You have plenty of flexibility to create multiple programs with as many or as few schedule steps as you wish. For example you can have separate schedules for when you are home, when you are gone temporarily, when you are gone for months at a time. Some reviewers have complained about the difficulty of programming your schedule. Maybe Sensi have improved the app, but I found it reasonably easy to program, given the flexibility.

The bad -

1) The WiFi setup is very finicky. Were I not an engineer with many years of experience with communications equipment I might well have floundered. Common security features in WiFi routers can defeat your efforts. I would note that I recently installed a smart sprinkler controller that is completely programmed from my smart phone and has full remote access capability. WiFi setup was a breeze. I did not have to touch my WiFi router configuration at all. Sensi could do a lot better.

2) The manuals. Yes Sensi, some people do read manuals. Once you get past the simpleton stuff yours are rather poor. ""See the App"" (which has limited help on some topics) is not a good answer. Things like a list of the menu options and what they do - would be very helpful. The other Emerson thermostats have good manuals - so should yours.

3) Don't bother to call Sensi tech support. You will spend a lot of time on-hold and you might never actually talk to a human. And the support web site was almost as slow. The information is there but you have to be a pro to understand the more detailed stuff. Sensi needs to beef-up their tech support and/or produce a good tutorial on how to connect to a WiFi network. And if they had to write a good tutorial, they might improve their software to make things easier for their customers.

4) I found it necessary to change almost every default setting. Many of the complaints about the performance of this thermostat, arise from not bothering to check every last setting in the app. Better defaults would result in fewer complaints. This problem is confounded by lack of a list of menus and options in the user manuals. If you do not browse carefully through the app, you might miss the setting that you find most annoying.

5) You can control virtually everything else but not the fan schedule. A simple ""Fan On or Auto"" check box in each schedule step would be great.

The gory details -

If you have read this far, you might want to benefit from some of my experience setting-up this device for my network.

1) First let me explain my network setup. Basically my network has a less-trusted domain and a more-trusted domain. In the less-trusted domain sit my smart TVs, Game controllers, a laser printer that anyone can use, VoIP and media gateways, smart home sprinkler and thermostat controllers, etc. In the more-trusted domain sit my server, laptops, a color laser printer, and a very few other devices.

2) Between my cable modem and my less-trusted domain sits a simple but bullet-proof Ubiquity firewall router/switch. Hanging-off the Ubiquity switch in the less-trusted domain, are a VoIP gateway, a WiFi router/switch, a printer and a guest Ethernet port.

3) The WiFi router/switch serves as a second firewall between the less-trusted and the more-trusted domains. The WiFi hub has both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz channels, with separate private and guest access, for a total of 4 SSIDs. The router steers the guest SSIDs to the less-trusted domain and the private SSIDs to the more-trusted domain. The private and guest SSIDs have different WiFi access codes (passwords) so both domains are ""secure"" (in the WiFi sense).

4) By default the guest WiFi clients cannot see each other on the less-trusted domain. This is a common security feature in WiFi routers that support guest access. And it is one of the features that trips-up installation of the Sensi thermostat, but not my smart sprinkler controller.

5) Observing the network interaction between the Sensi app on my smart phone, the Sensi thermostat on the wall, and my WiFi router, at some times the app and the thermostat are operating point-to-point over the WiFi and sometime via the router. So-far so-good. This is expected behavior. However some of the router traffic uses LAN (Layer 2) addresses and some uses IP (Layer 3) addresses. This mixture can mess things up if the network is not configured exactly as the Sensi software developers expected.

6) Sensi should test with other common network configurations. As I mentioned my brand X sprinkler controller does not suffer from these peculiarities. If Sensi invested more money on software engineering and testing with different network configurations they could save a bundle on support costs and customer returns.

My recommendations -

1) Configure your smart phone to use the same WiFi SSID that you want to use for your Sensi thermostat.

2) Be sure this SSID is only available for 2.4 GHz.

3) Go through your router settings to ensure that every WiFi client of this SSID has unrestricted (LAN as well as IP) access to every other client of this SSID.

4) Run the Sensi app through the complete installation and registration process.

5) After everything is working you can restore your normal network configuration in your router and smart phone. Do not change the SSID for the thermostat.

6) If you need to change the SSID for the thermostat later, go back to start. Reset your thermostat and reconfigure your network. Rinse thoroughly and repeat as often as necessary.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Spamazon,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2024","Pros:
Easy to set up and install, had this up and running in 10 mins including wi-fi connect. Follow the instructions by down loading the app first and go through the steps. Shut your furnace off at your breaker box otherwise you will blow a fuse and need to replace it in the furnace. I do not use Apple Home Kit but you can if you want as part of the set up. Pretty basic cheap thermostat. Looks good, flat, snug against wall, secure, does not protrude like others. Only about 1” from wall. Back lit auto off after about 15 seconds. Light button on top to turn on manually. Blends in with wall (neutral or white) pretty good. Back plate is optional for $7. You probably don’t need it with this one. App is easy to use, simple, vanilla.
Cons:
Temp buttons (up / down arrows) are not soft quiet click / touch. They are a little too loud, like a really cheap on off wall switch. Wish they had used soft touch and not loud “snap or click” when you press the arrows. There is no way to set the thermostat to “Auto” temp mode except through the app only. No touch screen on this model, just keep in mind for less than $95 what you are getting, a glorified cheap piece of plastic made in China that requires a California Prop 65 cancer label warning and that has pretty basic vanilla functions and aesthics. No comparason to the Google Nest Learning model or the Ecobee 4 premium model. With this one you are getting what you pay for. There is no justification for griping and complaining. Can’t say I didn’t warn you. No frills, no bells and whistles. Just a vanilla thermostat that works and looks pretty good on the wall.",4.0 out of 5 stars

zarchitect,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2019","I research everything (probably over-extensively) before I buy - especially a gadget. I know I wanted more control over temperature (in and out of the house) - that was primary without spending a 2nd mortgage to set a temperature.

At the end, it came down to the hockey-puck or this one (hockey-puck being the ubiquitous Nest). EcoBee and Honeywell also had ones and looked compelling - each one with features that were eyebrow raising. But at the end, I just needed a way to keep tabs of the temperature while away. I didn't need a weather report (my phone does that), a high-rez touch screen (it's a thermostat - not a TV), nor for it to be so smart that it turns into HAL (Space Odyssey reference in case you needed to know). All the competitors did that and more - the hockey puck apparently the worst of the bunch as to stalking you to see how many breaths you put out to offset it by .004 degrees (or something like that). AND - in an age where we're now monitored 24/7 by Alexa, Google, Siri and the smart toaster and microwave - listening to our every word so they can sell our every secrets and desires to evil marketers for a billion dollars so they could target spam us when we're the most vulnerable and end up with 55 gallons of ice cream, a Euro-massager, and a pet iguana at 3am on a Wednesday hand delivered by a chippery Amazon Prime delivery guy in a rented U-Haul van stuffed to the gill with the hopes and nightmares of other unsuspecting souls.

Anyway - privacy was a concern so I really didn't want Alexa or anything with a microphone. If I really wanted to talk to a wall, I'll go to the mirror and start singing - at least I have an audience of one that way... If our house has a microphone embedded in everything and we start blurting out commands indiscriminately to meet our over-entitled needs like bi-polar lunatics - when will it stop? We'll end up vegetables sitting on the couch not lifting a finger eating our 55 gallons of ice cream... AHA! I knew it!

I digress - it's a thermostat. I don't have a consistent schedule so I can't have it create one magically - it can't read my mind... yet. And some days I like it cooler than others - what then? Will I have a verbal fight with the hockey puck? It would win - it's too smart for me!

So I needed something that was a step up from the ol' knob and tube dial form the days of Kojak and have the ability to see / control this thing from 2000 miles away as I worry that I left something on (Bonus - I can make the other house-occupants suffer remotely if they do me wrong). I can also check on whether they set the temperature down to -50 thinking that it'll it cool off faster and they leave the house / windows open. Maybe I do need a yelling hockey puck...

Oh - Emerson. In the past Emerson was known as the bane of the electronics world - breaking down on day 91 on a 90-day warranty gadget. The epitome of planned-obsolescence! I'm giving it another chance - maybe they grey up a little. If I see polar bears roaming my living room eating my ice scream when I come home, I won't be happy - stay tuned on that...

Oh - before I go - also needed it to be dumb enough that if something failed (because it always does at the most inopportune time) - it won't freak out. AKA - some of the devices needed a 24/7 WiFi connection Why does one gadget need to depend on another for survival? So if my WiFi goes out then I die of heatstroke?

For all you readers out there - buy it for what you want to get out of it but don't be sold on things that truly don't matter in your daily lives for at the end of the day, it's just a thermostat - not a hyper-augmented inner core balancing module.",4.0 out of 5 stars

MD and AZ,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2022","I have two Sensi thermostats, one for our primary home in MD and one for a second home in AZ. Our HVAC in AZ is conventional forced air system, so the set up was straightforward and pretty seamless - it took a few tries to get it to connect to Wi-Fi but once it finally took we were good to go. Fortified by my success I charged ahead with installing one at the MD house, which was built in 1928 and has two separate systems - the original hot water radiators for heat and a separate forced air AC system. Again the set up was straightforward - I followed the prompts on the app and still had to try several times to get it to connect to Wi-Fi but eventually it did and all seemed well. One aspect of the set up that was fraught with peril was that the set up prompts directed me cut the built in C wire on the Sensi. This seemed a very final move so before I did it I did some googling to try to educate myself on what the C wire is for and essentially determined that because I have two totally separate systems that don’t talk to each other, I don’t need a C wire. So I cut the wire and all seemed operational.

When I turned the heat on I noticed that I didn’t hear the characteristic whistle of the radiators getting going and that the boiler was not kicking on. I then discovered that the forced air was blowing, even though the thermostat was in “heat” mode. Then, when I put it in “cool” mode and cranked up the setting, the furnace would kick on. In a slight panic I reviewed the photo I took of my old thermostat wiring and saw that it was the same configuration as what the Sensi app had walked me through, so I knew that wasn’t the issue. Based on the negative reviews I had read, I didn’t have much hope that the Sensi help page would actually be helpful, but I found an FAQ along the lines of “ why isn’t my heat turning on”. It suggested that I needed to configure my thermostat to talk to my system, and walked me through changing the default settings on the thermostat itself to work with my specific system configuration. And - success!!! The heat kicked on in “heat” mode and the AC kicked on in “cool” mode and it was squared away.

So my main takeaways are that you have to stick with it and perhaps do some troubleshooting, but this is good affordable smart thermostat solution. I really like that it looks like a regular thermostat, meaning minimal wall patching of the area around it, and the app seems to work well and be pretty intuitive. And - MD gave me a $75 rebate so it was even cheaper (incomprehensibly AZ does not offer a rebate.)

So - I recommend!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Korryn,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024","Works great. Easy to install myself following a YouTube video. Setting up to wifi was simplified as well. The programming works great and no issues with anything really, except the batteries it came with. The batteries lasted less than a year (10 months) and no longer worked even when the batteries showed 4 bars on the display. When this happens, you can no longer control the thermostat from the app or it goes offline and the wifi signal disappears or stops displaying on the top left corner of the screen.

I still recommend this thermostat and will try out other batteries, even though the Energizer batteries it came with are typically good batteries.

Tasty Bits,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2020","I own two of these units. One in a Commercial setting and one Residential. Overall decent product but it may not be the easiest install if you don’t prepare.

Pro: app is very informative, very configurable and granular.

Con: Temperature spread not configurable. Unit seems to be confused for the first 12 hrs after install or if you change the primary configuration with lots of short cycling of the system. Needs to just sit in an off or not actively heating/cooling for several hours prior to use.

Everything is setup to be user friendly. No physical manuals, install the phone app and it should walk you through everything step by step. 2.4ghz WiFi network support only. Problems arise if your system doesn’t have a Common (C or Blue) wire or if your system is wired in an unexpected manner. My Commercial system was connected using colors that the app configurator deemed “Invalid” yet clearly it worked with the old thermostat. I am not and HVAC tech but using the service manual for the old thermostat I reverse engineered what each wire was for and hooked up the Sensei appropriately.

Other manufacturers let you adjust the temperature spread in the advanced settings to limit and control short cycling of the system and adjust when it comes on usually by configuring a % or specific # of degrees. Emerson uses a generic approach called the “Cycle Rate” with 3 possible settings of Slow, Medium or Fast. Slow supposedly allowing the widest spread in temperature. In my experience this is all of a 1 degree spread but it looks and feels to be a 0 degree spread as the system will come on when the display and target temps match.

The advanced settings are not part of the initial app based setup. You need to download the real user manual to understand and modify the advanced settings as needed to match your system.

Prior to changing your thermostat out, it is best to document your equipment as best as you can and/or dig into the advanced menu of your existing thermostat if digital and document the settings there. It makes a difference of you have single or dual stage Cooling or heat, heat pump, reversing valve power orientation and backup electrical heat. You will need to configure all of that in the new thermostat.

One key step during install is turning on the WiFi network on the thermostat, disconnecting your phone from your regular WiFi and connecting to the thermostat to perform the config, then moving your phone or device back to the regular network to complete the configuration and testing. Also be aware that if your unit cannot connect to the WiFi you want or that it disconnects/drops a lot you are either trying to connect to a 5ghz network or the 2.4Ghz network is saturated with other nearby networks causing a weak signal or your WiFi router is too far away from the thermostat.

One last tip, many WiFi routers from internet providers or stores tout that they provide 2.4Ghz and one or two 5Ghz networks all in one single “Network”. While this is true and will give your computing devices the fastest speeds IOT devices like these thermostats only work on 2.4Ghz and will work absolutely flawless if split the 2.4 and 5 GHz networks giving the 2.4 its own SSID network name. Everything will still route through your main router so you can use the app on a phone connected to the 5Ghz to control your unit on the 2.4Ghz network.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Bill,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2023","I have a house from the 60s so no C-Wire. We just have RH and W wires. Our furnace is gas with hot water baseboard heat so I think technically it's a boiler. I read others saying they didn't need a C-Wire so I figured I'd give it a try. The setup process makes you select your current wiring setup and if you pick RH and W it says it won't work. I just said I had a C-Wire even though I didn't. I was able to get it connected to Wi-Fi and it seemed good so I was going to wait and see how the batteries held out. Had an issue where the heat was on even though the thermostat wasn't asking for it. Found the thermostat was setup for an electric system so fixed those settings. Then noticed on my Taco control panel that the yellow light that indicates the thermostat is calling for heat was faintly illuminated. It was doing this even when the thermostat mode was set to off. So while it seemed like it may work, it's behaving strange due to the absence of the C-Wire so I'm not taking any chances. Put the old thermostat back and it is back to normal.

I have another one of these thermostats in the finished basement where I do have a C-Wire and it's great. The app is great and I like the usage reports that show how much time the thermostat spent asking for heat.",4.0 out of 5 stars

MattAT,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2022",I connected this up to a heating and air conditioning combined system very easily and I didn't need a c wire for it to work. That's the good. The bad is it took me twice as long to get the software to install because you have to make sure you're on a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi line to get anywhere. The instructions do say that but if you have both channels on your router and you default to the 5 gigahertz channel you're going to have problems. You will have to forget the connection on the 5 GHz channel so that it doesn't try to connect to that and defaults to the 2.4 GHz channel in order to get the software setup. Then you just follow the instructions on your phone and it will have you connect to the sensi device first which will always report there's no internet connection for Sensi which can be kind of confusing but you just ignore that warning and keep going. Then when you get into the internet connection itself you pick the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi channell as your connection. As long as that's the default Wi-Fi connection on your phone it should work but if you have a 5 GHz connection as your default it's not going to work and you will have to start all over. So if your router doesn't have a 2.4 GHz connection you're going to need to set up a separate channel for that. After I got the software installed which took me twice as long as setting up the device itself everything seems to work pretty good even with Alexa. Overall I'm happy with the device so far but I've only been using it a day now. I am happy that I didn't have to set up a c wire connection because that would have required adapter or running another wire between the thermostat and the heater.,4.0 out of 5 stars
BK,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2019","Our church installed 14 of these bad boys. With the volume we have and the budget we're on, we needed something ""lower end"".

I liked the installation:

Installation was simple and easy. The instructions in the app on how to install are simple and easy to follow. They give you stickers to label the wires as you take them off of the old thermostat base, but I found that they just get in the way. You should just well-document where the wires were before you took off the old base (pictures are your friend) and put them back on the same way. We didn't have a problem when we did this. Friendly tip (legal notice, I'm not a pro), RH and RC are jumped together. As long as you don't have a heat-only or cool-only system, RC and RH are interchangeable.

I like the application.

The application is pretty slick. Having 14 thermostats, it's very helpful to be able to see all of them at a glance by just scrolling through - to see if they're running, what they're set to, when they'll turn off, etc. It takes a little getting used to, but it does its duty and stays pretty minimalistic, which is beneficial if you have multiple thermostats.

I hate the schedules.

Setting up schedules was the most annoying part of this. For every minute spent installing and connecting the thermostats, we probably spent 2-4 minutes setting up schedules. The hardest part for me was dealing with so many. It is true they have a separate management console to streamline multi-thermostat systems. It looked neat, but it required you to pay a monthly subscription - at least $1/month/thermostat. Our church isn't big on subscriptions, and $130 a year was a little too much for something we could have put just a little effort into. The schedules allow you to have ""day"" groups, so you don't have to set up a schedule per day normally, but it would be very helpful if they had thermostat groups where you could set schedules on thermostats in the same area concurrently instead of having to set them on every single thermostat.

Public Service Announcements:
Make sure you have insulated wire pliers and a tiny flat-head screwdriver handy when installing. A drill with a Phillips head is very beneficial also.

Sometimes, the thermostats won't connect if they're far from your router. You can hack this problem by connecting the thermostat to wireless closer to the router and then walking the thermostat back to its final resting place.

One major hiccup...

The only reason I didn't give this item 4 stars was that, out of the 14 thermostats we ordered, one of them simply would not connect to wireless. We tried to connect it on 3 different devices and 2 different platforms (Android, iOS). Another thermostat farther away from the WAP connected without issue, but this one particular device would not. We had to request a replacement. One thing about it, the seller we bought from was superb about returns. I didn't have to speak to anyone and they give you a long time to get the broken one boxed up and sent back.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Cathy,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2021","UPDATE: We finally got it installed after encountering several issues with our phones not being able to connect to the app. It connected initially and we though everything was fine and went to bed. The heat never kicked on overnight and our apps were off line the next morning. My husband went snowboarding early that morning and I woke up to a 65 temperature house. I ended up changing the batteries which resolved the connectivity issue however the heater would not kick on. So make sure to check batteries if you install and can't connect to app. I had to call their customer service which helped me walk through troubleshooting. Turns out my husband did not fully connect the white wire so I did that and the heater still did not kick on. After all the troubleshooting was exhausted the customer service tech said he thought my husband may have touched the red and blue wires together (the wires coming out of the wall) - he said that would fry the fuse in the furnace. My husband did not turn off power to the furnace before installing the thermostat. It ended up being that problem so I recommend to definitely TURN OFF POWER TO THE FURNACE VIA THE FUSE BOX before installing the thermostat. Once my husband got home and was able to buy a new fuse for our furnace (its a common automobile fuse) at Auto Zone then we had heat. The app is okay - It is nice being able to control the heat from the app but I wish you could still set it from the actual thermostat.

Rudy O,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2022","We had a replacement heat pump, air and heat, unit installed by a contractor. We liked the Sensi thermostat. Our second unit was failing. We ordered another Sensi, hoping it was just the old thermostat which seemed to not be returning the temp correctly. I wired it in and it worked on our old unit. A short while later the unit failed so we had the same contractor come, and install a new heat pump for us. He used our same new sensi thermostat.
I found that I could get a rebate from our power company, but I had to register the Sensi. through the internet from the thermostat. I attempted to sign up the Sensi thermostat, and encountered connection problems. The WiFi kept dropping out. Then I checked the 3 month old batteries in the unit and they were dead. I replaced the batteries then our unit would not shut off. After some time I went back to check the installation, done by professionals. I found out, the way our system was wired, the system could not be controlled by the Sensi as a heat pump and intermittent problems was a symptom of not having a good Common connection. It was missing a C, Common wire. I checked the other unit and it was wired the same with the same intermittent connections. At this point it exhibited a new problem, it would never shut down the blower. We called the contractor and told him both installations seem to be miswired. They came out and put a jumper in, from the Y wire to the Y2*, and moved the wire from the Y2* connector to the C wire connector. After that both units were fine, the wifi connection was solid and I was able to apply for the rebate on both units. Alls well that ends well.

GeoJammy,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2019","Up front - I've only had the Sensi for two days. Installation was straightforward except for Apple Home Kit. The installation stalled three times waiting for Home Kit to validate or connect. It finally worked, and I have zero intention of using Home Kit. Strongly recommend that Sensi give users the option of using the (worthless to me) Home Kit. Function-wise it is great - I especially like the option of running the fan every hour. That's additional wear and tear on the fan, but has made a noticeable difference comfort-wise in the house. The app is user-friendly and offers all kinds of customization options. OK, caveat, I was irritated to find out that I cannot access usage data on a daily basis. You can access ""Current Runtime"" - but even that functionality does not work on my installation. My old (non-Wi-Fi) thermostat had real time usage data available with a couple of button pushes on the thermostat. What's the big deal, you say? If you are going on vacation, you will have no way to know, directly, how much your A/C has been running. Something could have failed and the thermostat would just keep the compressor and fan running, possibly burning something out or up in the process. Sure, you could look at your indoor temp and humidity and determine if something was amiss. That said, we went to the moon 50 years ago, and Emerson can't figure out a way to track real-time usage data and make it available? Overall, that is an irritant, but I am very happy with the thermostat - the ability to run the fan on an hourly basis will save us energy costs.

## Edited to Add: ## My comments about difficulty tracking usage data are just an irritant. We have used this several more days and we are very, very happy with it. The ability to run the fan every hour appears to have really reduced our full-AC energy usage. My negative comments about Current Runtime were also undeserved; that functionality works fine but it does take it a minute or so to start displaying data. This thermostat is a keeper!

## Added on June 21, 2019 ## After a couple of more days, I now have some real reservations about this thermostat. Twice today, it finished one A/C cycle then turned around and started another cycle within five minutes. This is much different than our old thermostat; but the old thermostat allowed me to set the swing value. This Emerson Sensi does not allow you to actually set the swing value itself - it allows Slow, Medium and Fast. I have double-checked the settings and it is set to ""Slow"" but it still cycles too quickly. If you've read this far, you probably know that fast, or short-cycling, can damage your A/C compressor. Restated, changing the cycle rate from Slow to Medium (I didn't try fast) does not increase A/C run time and decrease the number of cycles. Emerson - please fix this!!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Sarah M.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2023","So happy to find a smart thermostat that works for my home. I only have 4 wires, C, R, W, Y. I tried a few but they could only run my fan in testing mode for AC. Even one that let me set fan to always on didn't work. I nearly gave up. But then I found I can use one with battery and the C wire is now available for powering G. That worked!

The one reason I'm giving 4 stars is the cover is VERY easy to knock off slightly and since it has battery you don't notice the thermostat is off until it's getting warmer. So definitely be very careful when using the display. Also you'll need that 8 digit code for this every time so take a pic!

In addition, I've had to reconnect wifi twice in the first week. I'm hoping that won't keep recurring. Maybe it's due to my router or ISP having a brief blackout though. I will say the thermostat still ran without wifi so at least that didn't cause an issue.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Tavaris Lewis,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2020","All of its standard thermostat features work flawlessly. The smart features could use improvements. First off, the wifi connection depends on how expensive your internet router is. My thermostat connection used to drop every now and then and I had no smart functions like control by app or by Alexa. You have to use the push buttons on the stat. I fixed that issue by going into the settings on the app and changing the LED backlight setting to stay on all the time. Since i did that the wifi connection never dropped again and the LED display stays lit. Now the Alexa integration also needs improvement. Maybe it was a lack of effort to develop the skill but the skill sucks. You can't say common human commands like ""Alexa, turn on the A/C"" or ""Alexa, turn on the air conditioner"". She doesn't recognize those phrases. The only voice command you can use to turn on the A/C is ""Alexa, set the thermostat to cool"". You can also say ""Alexa, set thermostat to off or to heat or to _blank_ degrees"" and she can change the target temp setting, or the mode to cool, heat or off. You can also ask her what the thermostat temperature is and she'll tell you the target temp or ask her what the thermostat is set to and she'll tell you the current mode. To turn off the A/C you have to say ""Alexa, set thermostat to off"" in stead of telling her to turn off the A/C. So the voice commands are very specific. The skills lack of effort to develop shows even more when you try to set routines for Alexa to control the thermostat and discover the function does not work. There is little function to begin with but those little functions are unfunctional even after setting up the skill. The routine simply allows you to check a box that says ""temperature"" and then it shows a sliding scale for you to pick a temperature. No on or off choices no cooling mode or heating mode choices nothing. Its completely lacking. Ive created a routine where i checked the ""temperature"" box and chose a temperature. When the routine activated, the thermostat did absolutely nothing and yes it was connected to wifi. Alexa integration effort was not completed.",4.0 out of 5 stars
R. Berteig,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2019","When our previous thermostat died (installed sometime before 2008, so it had a good run) I wanted something I could install myself, would do the job well without fuss and bother, and would be just ""smart"" enough without trying to run my life. The latter point eliminated Nest and similar devices because they all attempt to nag you into complying with someone else's idea of how you should heat and cool your home.

I found this device met all my requirements, and since it was priced right, I took a chance. After ordering, I read more reviews from various DIY HVAC sites and found it was remarkably well liked for many of the same reasons that drove me to try it.

It has been on my wall now for a couple of months, and I really like it. It installed smoothly. The first step is to run their app, which then guides you through installation with a touch more hand-holding that I personally required, but it makes sure you do all the things and do them in a sensible order. A big help is the inclusion of a sheet of wire labels, making it easy to mark the wires as they come off the terminals of the old device. Obviously I didn't try installing it in any configurations other than the one required by my own HVAC system, but the app clearly would guide you into the specific steps required based on what you tell it about connections and what features your HVAC has.

The unit has battery power, and in principle can be used without a C wire, but that case would make you quite dependent on that battery and would consume that battery as you interact with it through WiFi or use the backlight. I have a C wire, so that isn't a concern here.

I've knocked off half a star (which sadly I have to round to a whole star) because it was not clear from the description whether I would need a trim plate to cover the entire footprint of my old device. In the end, I ordered the matching trim plate just in case. The base on this unit is smaller than many Emerson units from the past, so it turned out that the trim plate was a good idea.

For the DIY packaging, and the actual cost of manufacturing that plastic plate, Emerson could have just included it in the box and removed most concerns about covering holes in wall.

The WiFi setup was one of the least painful I've seen for an IoT device. It just worked.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Andy,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2021","My install was pretty straight forward and took less than 1 hour to install 2 units.
The app walks you through the process step by step. Still need to figure out a few of the settings on the app though. I found the scheduling slightly confusing. You can track usage through the app. Turn system on/off, set timers. Also an option for you to have the system turn off when you travel a few miles away from your house. Handy if you forget to do so when you are out.
Alexa integration is quick and easy.
Configuration for our system used a 4 wire set up. No C wire required.
RC with jumper (jumper pre installed), Y, G and W.
For reference our system is 17 years old ...
Electric AC
Natural Gas furnace
Dual zone
Single transformer
Auto/manual fan option
No humidifier

One issue I did have was with Emerson customer service. The down stair heater would come on by itself for no reason, and stay on until thermostat was removed. Could not figure it out. Voltage perfect, continuity perfect, tested both stats with meter, wiring good top to bottom on both stats. Switched stats and still had issues. Found the problem was a bad board on my honeywell zone system.
Anyway I contacted customer service before I found the bad board. Told them every single spec. on my system. Two weeks later they finally respond with ... sorry you are having issues, please tell us more about your system so we may assist you more. I just told them everything other than the color of shirt I was wearing.
But ... if you do run into problems I did find that the Emerson website is informative and may help you out with many technical issues. Just don't call, or write to them unless you like waiting around for help.
Other than customer service issues the stats work great since I discovered my faulty board.
Also check with your local utility company for energy rebates. My local offered a rebate on this model.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Gary Drury,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2019","This was actually a Christmas gift for someone special. My MOM, she has had a lot of health issues the past years. This gives her the ability to control the house temps without needing to get up. Though movement is good for her and all of us no doubt. But she is a fall risk, injuries when you are mature are more difficult to mend as they once were.

After downloading APP for android and iOS linking thermostat to Alexa wasn't entirely a smooth operation. You must set up and account for SENSI that was easy. I did find it much easier to setup on iOS than Android. But with both, linking through Alexa APP was the way to go. Take your time and be a little patience. It will work and its a good installation.

It took more time to set Sensi APP with Alexa APP than actual hardware install to operate the heating and cooling. I was disappointed that the BLUE light for display turns off and especially that it isn't much of a BLUE color. Very, very, very light blue. The full manual Emerson it replaces sported a pretty blue light which made a nice night light in the hallway if you needed to get up during those hours.

Be warn also, batteries drain rather swiftly setting up Wi-Fi. Once connected battery level remains pretty constant. I'm curious though -- how long the two AA batteries will last in a power outage. Will the thermostat retain its data if they die or save in memory? I saw nothing in the page manual. Time will tell and hopefully, should batteries fail and power resumes everything will set itself to last known state. Although fingers are crossed, I believe once batteries give up their life another setup will be required. If you know otherwise do share.

Orwell,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2018","Everything about this device, set-up and app is pretty good, but there are a few obvious shortcomings.

I have seen one of the more common complaints is that it loses its connection to the wifi sometimes. One thing that can help with this is if you can narrow the bandwidth on your router. Like a lot of home automation equipment this thermostat runs on the 2.5 GHz band. Many routers will have a setting where you can choose the bandwidth for that band (usually 20 MHz to 40 MHz IIRC). If you choose the smaller one you will get a stronger signal. Your data rate might be a little less, but your signal will be much stronger and that might alleviate some of the trouble people seem to be having. I had been having trouble with my phone getting on the wifi in parts of the house and when the thermostat had the same problem I decided to troubleshoot. Lowering the bandwidth fixed both problems in my particular case.

Another drawback is that there is no obvious way to remove schedules, or settings within schedules on the app. If you end up with too many set pts you will just have to enter the same temperature more than once as a workaround. And the display is not the same on every phone. The temperature setting dial is too narrow on one of my phones. So while none of these things are deal killers, but they profess a certain lack of polish and intuitiveness.

Another thing I dislike is that instead of being able to set how many degrees the thermostat will swing before turning on it instead has a short, medium, and long cycle setting which means you can't set a predetermined number of degrees that the thermostat should allow the temperature to fall or rise from the set pt before turning on the heating or cooling again.

The strong point is that the app leads you by the nose during installation so it is hard to make a mistake. Other than that, it works as it should and is fairly attractive for a non-touchscreen model. I just installed two of them in my house this weekend and they are working fine. I like this product very much despite a few problems that could be fixed with an app update, and all that remains to be seen is how it holds up over time.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Dan About,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2023","Forces you to register to use wifi! Unbelievable. Minus one star.

That said, now I can easily set a schedule over wifi. It's smart, but not too smart. Got it when the price was below $80 per thermostat.

Install is fiddly but simple. Wire strippers/cutters are good to have, but you really just need a small screwdriver to remove/install the wires, and a normal sized on to remove/affix to the wall. You may need to paint or do some work around the thermostat if the one you are replacing is smaller.

One issue during install is you may need to turn off advanced wifi features:

""“Smart Network Switch”, ""Avoid Poor Connections"", “Switch to mobile data” or any Intelligent Wi-Fi settings that may switch your phone’s Wi-Fi network automatically based on internet quality and disable them for the Sensi setup process. You can turn them back on after Sensi is connected to Wi-Fi.""

J. B. Fox,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2020","I ended up choosing this model after researching all of the most popular ""smart thermostats"" and this one being recommended by people I know. I was originally leaning towards the Google Nest but I didn't care for the extra features enough to justify the price difference.

I wanted the wifi features but didn't need a sleek and modern look. I like that the Sensi has a traditional thermostat look but I don't like that I can see the temperature from across a room. Sadly, this was a shortcoming in almost every model I looked at.

Installation was very straight forward. Instead of printed instructions, the installation instructions were in the app that you have to download first thing. It was different but easy to follow. I liked that it included stickers to label the wires so I didn't have to refer to a photo from my old thermostat setup.

The wifi connection didn't go smoothly at first. I kept getting a connection error when using the Android app. After following all of the troubleshooting steps in Emerson's support website I decided to try a different device before calling support. The rest of the setup worked smoothly on my Ipad and I liked that once connected it automatically shows on my Android phone.

Configuring the Alexa connection was quick and easy although I haven't used that feature yet.

Once I overcame the initial setup speed bumps, it has been performing as advertised. I like that it displays humidity. It was easy to configure a schedule and change settings from the app.

So far I am happy with my purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Vanheath,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2018","I’ve only been using this Thermostat for 2 weeks but so far so good. The installation is very easy, you just download the app and follow the step by step instructions, took about 20 mins.

The scheduling set up in the app was a little confusing at first but after playing with it a little I got it all set up just how I like it.

I have an iPhone and during set up the app said I can use Siri to adjust the temperature. I tested it out and noticed that I would tell Siri set temperature to 75, and the thermostat would change to 77. Every time I tried using Siri the actual temp set was 2-3 degrees off. I contacted Customer Support and they responded within 24 hrs and they told me it was a firmware issue which would automatically update shortly after the product was connected to the internet. I tested it again and it’s working correctly now.

Another thing I contacted customer support about that they responded quickly to, was the first night using the Sensi, I programmed the thermostat to change to 76 at 8pm. Around 7 my wife was feeling hot (we live in Arizona) and change the temp setting to 80. At 8:06 I went to the Thermostat to see if my programmed setting of 76 was running, but found that the thermostat was still showing 80 and said “temperature temporarily set to 80”. I asked customer support why the temp did not adjust as scheduled and they told me that a manual change will hold for 2 hours and won’t change until the next scheduled set point (which for me was at 7am the next day). So basically we can’t adjust the temp manually within 2 hours before the scheduled temp change. If we do change it we have to make sure to manually change it later on or program multiple set points so the schedule shows 76 at 8pm, 9pm, 10pm. Now that we know how this works, it’s not really an issue.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Janonymous,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2021","Overall, these have been good thermostats. I switched from Vivint thermostats, and these are much better. Very simple to install as well. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because they don't allow you to schedule the fan mode (On/Auto/Circulate) like you can with the temperature control (and even after contacting support, they don't seem to care about adding that feature to their app). Thankfully, there is a workaround by integrating with Samsung's SmartThings app, which has the capability to set a schedule and control the fan (unlike Alexa and Google which can only control the temperature at this time).

As for some of the other issues, I ran mine on batteries for a few months and did not experience any of the Wi-Fi connectivity problems mentioned in other reviews, but I did eventually run a C-wire so that I wouldn't have to worry about draining batteries. There are some other nice features of the app beyond standard thermostat control, such as tracking your daily/monthly usage, dehumidification, temperature calibration, cycle rate settings, and filter change reminders.

If you have a rent house or similar situation, it also has the ability to lock the buttons on the thermostat so that guests can't change the settings without the app and/or you can set temperature range limits.

Also be sure to check with your local utility company and see if you qualify for rebates. I bought 2 thermostats and was able to get a rebate for $75 each, so in the long run they cost me practically nothing.",4.0 out of 5 stars

It's getting progressively worse, won't stay connected more than an hour or so. I found out by accident that if I remove the unit from the wall mount and then remount it, it will automatically reconnect without having to go through the tedious phone app process, but it still means having to shut down my HVAC system while I'm doing it. It basically runs as a regular manual thermostat now, with no remote access. UPDATE: It has now been 5 days since I submitted a support request through the Sensi website and have yet to receive any response. The unit will now not connect to wifi at all. UPDATE: After extensive googling, I finally found a link to an Emerson page on troubleshooting connection issues. I had never seen it on the Emerson support site, although I thought I had thoroughly searched it. One of the suggested issues was low battery level. Since the unit had only been in service for 3 weeks, it never occurred to me that the batteries might already need replacing. (My old Honeywell would go for a year or longer.) I had used the batteries that came with the unit, perhaps they were old. I replaced them with some new Duracells, and now the thermostat is staying online, and seems to be working as intended.

Make Par,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2021","Product was easy to install except for two main issues:

1. The only wiring diagrams provided were via the Sensi App. It would be much easier to simply include a printed copy, rather than requiring the download of an app which was very minimalistic and was actually not correct about the ground wire requirement for my system. In my case with only heat being the thermostat's function, this thermostat will function correctly on battery power alone, but the app will INCORRECTLY not let you progress in the installation without one - so I ended up closing the app and installing without it. With so many varied systems out there, I feel a printed wiring diagram would be much more straightforward and involve less time.

2. The size of the screws in the wiring board are extremely small, and are surrounded by a plastic sleeve which will not allow the use of common or ""standard"" size screwdrivers. You will need a small diameter set of screwdrivers to be able to tighten the wires sufficiently into the control board.

Wireless setup through the Sensi app was simple and Alexa integration with Sensi also was simple. Verbal commands work great and it is simple to adjust Heat/Cool schedules. The addition of a humidity readout is nice as well. Construction of the unit seems very good and sturdy, which made it easy to mount on the wall.",4.0 out of 5 stars
DL,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2023","I had two Nest thermostats over the years and always had strange issues with them, maybe because I don't have a common wire. I also did not particularly like Nest's minimalist design. So, I decided to give Sensi a try and, so far, it's everything that I wanted from a smart thermostat -- a reliable (so far) unit and easy to read display with physical buttons for easy and quick adjustments of settings. Sensi's app is also quite good, though some settings are only accessible through the thermostat itself.

The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 starts is that it turns on/off my heating system far too frequently even though I selected the ""slow"" setting which is suppose to give it less frequent cycles. I really wish this issue would be addressed so the thermostat would allow a true 1-2 degree temperature variance to minimize cycling of the HVAC systems.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Brendan,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2018","UPDATE: The only feature I miss from my Nest thermostat is running time tracking. it's was pretty lame by tracking in 15 minute increments and only keeping the last 10 or 14 days of data but it was helpful to see. This should be added to the Sensi ASAP!

We've had a Nest thermostat for over 5 years. We used it in 2 different houses. It was bad at measuring the temperature accurately (+/- 2 degrees), it was a little difficult to program and most importantly, it has not means of adjusting how often the furnace/AC comes on and therefore how much the temperature swings. In both houses that meant setting it at 68 degrees had the temperature vary between 67 and 69 degrees making the house very uncomfortable. The heat would come on about once an hour, overheat the house and then stay off until you were cold.

This thermostat solves most of the problems that I had with the Nest. You can adjust the cycle rate on heating and cooling independently (Slow, Medium, Fast). It turns out medium was perfect for heating. The temperatures swings are hardly noticeable.

This is much more flexible to program. You can setup a ""Vacation"" program and use it when you go on vacation. You can also simply turn of schedule mode and simply set the temperature and it won't change. Good luck doing either of these with the Nest (who came up with Eco mode? How about ""Hold"" or just turn off the scheduling).

Unless you need your thermostat to program itself based on keeping an eye on you (I never used that with the Nest) this is a far better option.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I had a few wifi disconnects that I assumed were normal, so I gave it a chance. Then I couldn’t get it to reconnect after several hours of being down. I researched after not being able to figure it out with the self help guide and it’s not normal for the batteries to be half drained after only a few weeks like mine was (a good sign I probably don’t have a c-wire).

Kayla B,"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2019","I really like these thermostats. I didn’t want the machine learning Geogrid functionality and these are perfect.

They show humidity, allow you to control how long the fan runs each hour, breaks down how long the fan/heating/cooling is on each day and provides a weekly and monthly breakdown, has auto controls so I can set a max and min temperature and let it stay in bounds...which is great for people with multiple stories...the upstairs can really heat up on a warm day without notice.

One thing I did not like was the set up on one of my models. I bought 3...only one gave me fits...it required my phone to be hooked up to a 2.4 GHz router to connect through. I have google WiFi in my house and it auto selects between the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies based on the connected device. Since it was connecting to my phone it was connected to the 5 GHz frequency. I ended up having to shut down WiFi points so that the signal to the thermostat location/my phone was weak enough that the router utilized the 2.4 GHz network instead of the 5GHz network. This is a bit of a pain and took me about 2 hours to resolve. For reference the other two thermostats took about 10 minutes to change out.

I like that the app works seamlessly and integrates very well with the thermostat. With the app, I can control the fan settings, heat, temperature settings, etc.

The only downsides: 1. I needed to run a new cable to get it to work the way I wanted, 2. I would like to have a bigger temperature range when I’m not there so the furnace isn’t cycling on/off as much, 3.

The geofencing is also working properly to change the setting by 3 degrees (down when heat on, up when cool on) when I leave the house and go more than 3 miles away with my phone. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because it shouldn't be advertised as a smart thermostat that can be used without a C wire due to the WiFi connectivity problems.

Luke Thompson,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2020","Before my dad bought this, he was asking his friend to get up from the couch and adjust the thermostat every 20 or 30 minutes - not only did this improve his comfort but it saved a relationship. It was really easy to setup and works great with Alexa - my only complaint is the cycling is a little off so it seems to always be hotter (on too long) than what you set it for and then takes longer to kick back on. The result is that when using the same household temp as we’ve always used it tends to get stuffier/hotter before it turns off and then it seems to get chillier before it kicks on again - the temperature never seems to be stable, which was never an issue with our prior analog thermostat. Luckily its easy to ask Alexa to change the temp so it’s not a huge deal, it’s winter now and I think this issue will have less impact when using the AC instead of heater.

Mr. Zehnder,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2018","Highly enjoy the Emerson Sensi Wi-Fi Thermostate. The customizability of multiple weekly and daily schedules is excellent.

Initial setup: The Sensi app walks you through connecting your existing wires to the new thermostat through pictures. I was able to connect to wifi within seconds due to their code scan format. The schedule was easy to setup and similar to any smartphone calendar format.

Thoughts:
I have not used the Geofencing feature due to the 3-degree decrease in temperature when I'm away. I wish this was customizable as I generally switch the heat between 70 deg when home to 64 degrees when away/ sleeping. (Programmed Schedules and Geofencing do not yet work simultaneously.)

I also wish the early start feature would learn how long it takes for your house to heat to the desired temp. By default, early start begins to heat the house 15 minutes prior to the designated time. So if you want your house to be 70 degrees at a desired time, you will have to learn how long your house takes to warm up or cool down and adjust the schedule accordingly.

I do appreciate through advanced scheduling you're able to create schedules for both heating and cooling seasons so it simple as picking your desired schedule after initial setup.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Melanie D.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2019","I can’t believe I put this thing together by myself! I did it in about 28 minutes including removing the old thermostat and plate. I would not consider myself an electrically inclined person and it was pretty straight forward for me. The wires from my previous thermostat was already labeled so I think that saved me time. My old T-Stat itself rarely worked. I couldn't adjust the temperature so we suffered being too hot or too cold and I was over it. So I ordered this based off the reviews and I’m glad I did! I’m also not the most tech savvy person either but I can follow directions and I was able to connect everything and operate this Sensi from my phone! I didn’t want something so high tech I couldn’t figure out how to use it but I wanted something more updated than what I had and this thermostat is perfect the speed for me. I don’t plan on using the voice operated “Alexa” features, I’m not down with all that so this is great for me. If you’re on the fence with it... just get it!

Jack L.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2019","For the most part I really like this thermostat and am glad I didn't waste a bunch of extra money buying a Nest. Install was very easy. I've installed thermostats before, but I would say even a complete novice should be able to follow the step by step instructions in the app. The app is very easy to use and I had no problem connecting my phone to the thermostat, and the thermostat to my wifi.
Here is my lone complaint. Despite having battery backup, the wifi on the unit quits when the power goes out. So if the power goes out, I can't check on my house temp or receive email alerts telling me the temp is too low. I live in a cold climate where winter temps drop to -30 degrees, and I travel quite a bit in the winter. One of the main reasons I wanted a wifi thermostat is so I would be alerted to a furnace problem or power outage before my pipes froze in the winter. If it would at least send me an email alert telling me it's on battery backup before the wifi quit I would be happy.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Brian C.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2019",Thermostat was very easy to install and connect to WiFi. I am using in a shop with a heat only system. The only problem I had like others is that the WiFi would work fine for a few days and then would go on and offline constantly mostly offline. After research and testing found it was draining batteries very quickly causing the problem. If this is used in a home with both A/C and heating system should be fine as long as there is a connection to the C terminal. If not that is where the problem is because the thermostat needs constant power source to the C terminal to stay connected to a WiFi system. Another reviewer suggested using lithium batteries which did help but it seems to also drain the batteries quickly to power WiFi connection. I finally installed a 24 volt plug in adapter for the C terminal and it has worked flawlessly. Also a C terminal power can be run directly from the climate control system but in my case was simpler to use 24 volt plug. Would have been nice if included instructions spelled this out clearly.,4.0 out of 5 stars

I was able to make it look presentable and decided to set it up. It seemed to be working okay for about 3 hours. Then it lost its Wi-Fi connection.

Then I came across a web site that said that there can be problems with Wifi 802.11n .. so I had another wireless router (that I had also been testing with to no avail), dropped it down to 802.11ab and decrease the wireless router's power to 25% and all of the sudden it started working! It's worked ever since, no problems - even came back and connected after a long power outage.

So after all that, I have to say I'm pleased. It was a major pain to get it to connect to wifi but one of those two things did the trick. ... of course I'm too afraid to touch anything to eliminate which of the two changes made the difference.

The install was easy and came quickly but the battery issue is a problem. My home does not have a C-wire so I got this thermostat specifically because of the fact that it ran on batteries and does not need a C-wire. I have only had it for about two weeks and the battery is almost gone. I works great but constantly changing the batteries will be annoying and my schedule is a little more varied than most so the scheduling option (so that i do not need to use the app) wouldn't be as great for me. It was really nice to be able to login to the app and change the temperature before going home. So works great and if you do not need the Wi-Fi option definitely go for it.

Mike B,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2019","This is a great thermostat for a wide range of systems. The instructions for removing the old thermostat and installing the new one is great for any DIY-er or professional. DO NOT LOSE YOUR PIN CARD that comes with the thermostat. It is required to connect your thermostat to the app to program it.

My only problem with the thermostat is with the app schedule programming. To run a scheduled program, you create the schedule and set it as active. Unfortunately, the directions for deleting an unwanted schedule do not apply to the pre-programmed schedules. There is ""Heating Schedule"" and a ""Cooling Schedule"" pre-programmed that cannot be removed, even after several calls to tech support. Unfortunately, when my phone is restarted, the app sends a signal to the thermostat to use one of these pre-programmed schedules instead of the schedule we programmed for it. If we were able to delete these pre-programmed schedules, we do not believe it would be an issue any further.

The programming issue is annoying, but it is a good thermostat and operates perfectly when it is on the correct program schedule.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Mel,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019","I was looking for a smart thermostat without breaking the bank and without the need for any fancy features like self learning based on your habits for example. Got a good deal on the Sensi and decided to try it out. I downloaded the app before purchasing and was able to check my existing wiring to see if the Sensi was compatible for my system. The app is simple and goes through the all the necessary steps for set up. You will need the C wire for this thermostat.

Once I confirmed compatibility, and after delivery, following the instructions on the app took me through the process of removing the old thermostat and installing the Sensi. It was a very easy and logical process which even a novice at home improvement can follow. The only slight hitch in setting up the system was ensuring that the wire connection was secure - a couple of the wires came loose after I thought I had screwed them in. Really not a big deal but I gently tugged on the wires to ensure that they were not loose. The Sensi thermostat attaches to The wall by clipping into the wall plate that is provided. Luckily for me the old wall plate holes were in the right spot for the new Sensi wall plate. Before clipping the thermostat on ensure that the wires are flush with the wall as instructed by the app.

Connecting to WiFi was fairly easy and it was done through the app on my iPhone. The thermostat is only compatible with 2G WiFi so you have to make sure your phone is connected to the 2G network while going through this part of the setup if you have a dual band router (you can switch your phone back to the 5G network after if you wish). WiFi connection was made quickly although the thermostat did take 30 or so seconds to be fully responsive to my phone after I thought the connection was completed (I initially thought I needed to go through a troubleshooting process but did not need to complete that process).

Once fully connected you can easily adjust temperatures in the app, set up schedules and use a variety of options e.g. display humidity etc. There is also a geofencing option if you wish to use that. I set up my iPhone to be able to use Siri to adjust temperatures. You’ll need to set up your iPhone Home app for that. Once again the app runs you through all the steps to do that. I also set up my wife’s phone for her to have the feature that allows her to use Siri. Initial attempts to set her Home app to connect with the thermostat using Siri were unsuccessful until I realized that I could simply share my iPhone Home app settings with hers (just had to make sure to switch to the shared home app profile and not the original default one on her phone). If you do not wish to use Siri you can simply use the controls in the Sensi app and do not have to go though the Home app set up.

I’ve had the thermostat for a week now and I love it. The thermostat is very responsive to changes made within the Sensi app or when using Siri (usually within 1-2 seconds). I also like that I can view ‘Usage’ within the app to see how long the furnace has been active. The app will also allow you to check to see if you are eligible for rebates based on energy savings programs for your area.

Of course if you need to change app settings on the thermostat itself it is very easy to do so. There is a feature in the app that allows you to lock the wall display and only be able to change settings, temps etc through the app if you do not want people to change temps or settings through the wall display.

Overall a great thermostat. Easy setup. Easy to use. Great features. Very responsive when using your phone. 5 stars plus!!",5.0 out of 5 stars

I'm going to do pros and cons below. I do want to say, I took my old thermostat off the wall first, wrote down all the wire colors and the letter each was connected to on a piece of paper. The app removes the need for pen and paper. I just used my pen and paper to place the flags mentioned below on the correct wires.

Pros:
1. This thing is super easy to install. Open the box and there are instructions for you to download the Sensi app. Once the app is downloaded it has you choose which letter slots you have wires connected to (R, RH, C, E, OB, etc.). The app then tells you how to use the flags they provide to label the wires. For example I had a wire that went into a slot labeled ""R"", but Sensi only had ""RH"" and ""RC"" (I think it was RC), so the app told me which R my wire needed to go in. Not having any electrical wiring experience, the app was SUPER helpful. It even had you take a picture of your wiring to save to your phone, just in case.

2. The piece that attaches to the wall has a built in level. I am super annoyed when things aren't straight on walls, so this right here, was awesome.

3. The app is really easy to set up. I just have a daytime and nighttime cycle, but I could set up all kinds of things super easily. Vacation modes, turning the AC up when I leave the house... It was great. It even walked me through how to sync the app with my Google assistant and the Samsung Smart Things app, which I didn't end up continuing to use. (See cons #1)

4. The report that tells you how long your AC is running is really helpful as well, especially since we had issues last year with it not being able to keep up. We have better insulation and updated windows and it's nice to see they are working, even when it's 99° with a heat index at 112°. (See cons #2)

5. I like that you can do things like temp and humidity offsets, have the AC turn on to help maintain proper humidity levels (we live in Florida, so this is a big thing for me), change the cycle rate (ended up choosing this one over another brand because people had issues with not being able to adjust the cycle rate on that one), and easily turn heat boost on or off. (See cons #3)

Cons:
1. It doesn't work with Bixby. This is something I don't really understand, but I'm guessing they assume if you're gonna use Bixby you use Smart Things? But I can just use Google for that instead.

2. The recent usage section only shows how long the AC ran that day, not which times it ran or how long at a time it ran. It would be nice to see how long the AC was running at a time, especially in the afternoon when it gets really hot. I have not yet gotten a monthly report since I got the thermostat mid-June and it's now mid-July. Interested to see what the monthly report looks like at the end of the month.

3. Sometimes I had to change settings a couple times before they ""stuck"". I found after changing a setting I needed to wait a few seconds before returning to the settings menu and that helped.

4. Shortly after I got the thermostat the AC drain line clogged. This resulted in my app/thermostat constantly saying cooling was on, but the AC wasn't running. My usage for that day was like 21hrs, but I know it wasn't actually on for the majority of that. Not really a huge issue, but you won't have an accurate reading for that day.

Summary:
Overall, this is a really amazing unit and I have been really glad to have it. It was seriously a breeze to instakl and set up and functions well. I do wish I could connect it to Bixby without using Smart Things and I do wish I had a more detailed daily usage report, but those are very small inconveniences. I normally keep our house at 78° during the day and 77° at night and sometimes that feels cold. I would often feel hot before and wondered if our AC was not working correctly, but it would seem it was actually the thermostat. Very happy with this purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Mister M,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2021","This Sensi thermostat is waaaaaaaaaaay better than Honeywell. The Honeywell software and their mentality is completely OUT OF WACK and their thermostats are pure garbage and it will damage your equipment. The Honeywell Cycle rate is set to about .5+/- so my furnace now in the winter has been running and running nonstop and my furnace was not getting any rest. That is a very bad thing for our heating and A/C system, not to mention the gas and electricity bill. I called Honeywell tech support and they told me that ALL their thermostats have this fixed setting and there is nothing in the menu for us to change that option. Something is really wrong with this Honeywell company and this cycle rate setting is simply inappropriate.

I just installed my new Emerson Smart Sensei and even the WI-FI connectivity process went very smoothly and I successfully connected my new thermostat. The Sensi app takes you thru the entire process fairly quickly and is very easy I have no idea what other people are having problems with. Note that I already knew which cables to connect so if you don't know that's a different story. The Honeywell thermostat on the other hand was a nightmare to install thru the app and it simply doesn't work so I had to go to my desktop PC and finish the process there. Really annoying.

And guess what I found out? The Sensi app itself has the options for me to change the Cycle rates to either SLOW, MEDIUM or FAST that was awesome I could not believe it!!! :-) Sensi was so smart by not putting this option in a hidden menu. Honeywell Engineers and marketing department simply don't know what they are doing. I'm looking forward in seeing how my new Sensi thermostat will perform tonight and I'm sure it won't disappoint. This device looks really great on the wall as well. The Honeywell WI-FI cost me $79 on sale and this Sensi costs more but is TOTALLY worth it!

The only thing I didn't like is that a day before purchasing this device I contacted Sensi tech support and took one entire hour to pick up the phone and someone from the Philippines picked up the phone eventually. This is not acceptable. Other than that I completely recommend this thermostat.

UPDATE: This Emerson Sensi Smart thermostat is definitely a superior product. Only while running it in one day you can see and hear the difference. I set the cycle rate to SLOW and boy what a difference! The thermostat outputs the heat in a very smooth way and when the it reaches the set temperature it stops for several minutes and it DEFINITELY does not restart in 30 seconds like the Honeywell ones. I have no idea what problems others are having that complain saying this thermostat doesn't work but I can tell you that is not the case. The software and hardware is really well made and nice looking as well. I prefer this Sensi to those ugly round looking ""high tech"" and over priced thermostats.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jim Healy,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2024","The reviews conflict as t whether or not this unit requires a ""C"" wire (Common wire). As stated in the product literature, in my installation, a ""C"" wire WAS NOT required.

Installation to replace a previous thermostat was easy; took all of 15 minutes. WiFi access will be helpful in my installation, and it works well with the app. The app is just a remote interface that's identical to the unit face itself.

A couple of days after installation, I got a warning that the temperature of the room was more than 5 degrees above the set temp. The A/C was running, but not keeping up. Traced that to a clogged air filter, but I appreciated the warning message.

Yes, I recommend this unit for price point and function.",5.0 out of 5 stars
M. Yates,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2022","I moved to the East coast last December. We have a six-zone boiler heating system with baseboard heaters throughout 4,200 sq. ft., on three floors (not bragging, just trying to give an idea of the size and complexity of the system). With six old-school manual thermostats spread throughout the house, it was nearly impossible to evenly regulate the heat during the cold winter, so some rooms were very cold and others too warm. I found myself constantly going up and down stairs to monitor temperatures and make sure I wasn't wasting heat or keeping areas too cold that would affect other zones.

My boiler was installed in 2007, so it isn't very old and it's very efficient. However, it's a two-wire system with no C-wire, so the fact that 99.9% of ""smart"" thermostats on the market require a C-wire to operate was very frustrating.

I stumbled across the Emerson ST55 and saw in the description that it could work either with or without a C-wire, so I called Emerson tech support to make sure before I plunked down hundreds of dollars on six thermostats that might not work. Tech support confirmed my fears that it would not work without a C-wire despite the Amazon description, so I kept hunting.

Fortunately I found a YouTube review of the ST55 and the owner said he had been successfully using it with the same kind of two-wire system that I have for over two years. So I figured I'd buy one and see if it worked. Worst case, I'd send it back for a refund.

The instructions inside the box clearly state that it will not work without a C-wire, but I ignored them and kept going. With only two wires it was a breeze to install. I put in the batteries, snapped it into the wall plate, downloaded the app, created an account and was ready for testing in about 15 minutes.

I'm not sure if it's just my system or all boilers, but I didn't realize it doesn't turn on instantly when the thermostat temperature is raised above the existing temperature. So when I first tested it, I was bummed that it didn't work. But as I walked downstairs to the boiler, it was running! So I did some more testing, and found that there's about a 20-25 second delay between increasing the temp and the boiler kicking in.

Granted it's only been a couple months since I got it, but I've played with it plenty and it's working great. Instead of a C-wire, the thermostat is powered by two AA batteries. The guy in the video said he's been using the same regular alkaline batteries for two years and they're still at 90% charge capacity, which is awesome. But I figure that even if I have to replace batteries every year, 12 AA batteries is a helluva lot cheaper than paying an electrician to rewire all six zones!

On top of the six heat zones, I also have two central AC units. Thankfully those have C-wires, but I'm going to replace those thermostats with the Emerson ST55 also so that I'll have full control of all heating and cooling from one simple-to-use app. With any luck it'll go on sale on Prime Day so that I can save some money! :-)

I can't speak to the Alexa integration as I don't use that functionality. But plenty of other reviewers have said it works fine.

I appreciate Emerson's thoughtfulness in adding a built-in level to the back plate. I'm a stickler about things being mounted straight, so it was nice to not have to break out a level to make sure I didn't mount it crooked.

As for aesthetics, the ST55 is nice. It's not too large to look obnoxious, but it has a good-sized display. And I'm not sure if it's just because I'm running it on battery, but the back light doesn't stay on constantly, so it doesn't light up a dark room at night (not too important in common areas, but important if you've got a thermostat in a bedroom).

So, to make a long story short, don't believe Emerson. This thing really does work on a two-wire boiler heat system with no need for a C-wire!",5.0 out of 5 stars
James W.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2020","(Long, but I hope worth the read) Overall, I am extremely happy with the Emerson Sensi smart thermostat. For me it was a pretty easy project, but it is important that you know what type of cooling/heating system you have prior to attempting the installation. Although the basic installation is made very simple using the Sensi app, there were some very important things not covered. I suggest you check out how to configure your Sensi on their site (Configuring Thermostat | Sensi US (emerson.com)). I’m a pretty good DIYer, but have very little experience with AC/heating systems. I was 99% sure I had a heat pump setup, but I called a local AC technician I know to confirm and am glad I did. Having installed a few smart thermostats, to include this one, he not only confirmed I had a heat pump, he also informed me I would have to go into the system settings on the thermostat and change the outside setting from ‘AC1’ to ‘HP1’. This was confirmed when I checked out the Sensi website. Armed with this information, installation went without a hitch and I was up and running in no time.
Pros:
- Easy to install, if you have a little DIY experience, all the information needed concerning your AC/Heating system and gather the additional information before starting.
- Very easy to connect to WiFi and integrate with Google Home. Connected to my WiFi with in seconds following the instructions; when I opened my Google Home app, there was an icon to add Sensi, clicked on it and moved the thermostat to the appropriate room. I have not experienced any drop-offs or loss of the WiFi, even when I turned off my WiFi for a few hours, removed the batters or installed old, weak batteries as tests; in every case, the thermostat remained connected or automatically connected right back up in seconds with no need to go through the WiFi setup operations again.
- The Sensi app, in addition to walking you through the installation, allows you to set up various cooling/heating programs to run automatically, as well as change other settings. Once added to Google Home, you can switch programs (cool, heat, auto), turn it on/off and set the temp. You can also use voice commands through Google to do this as well.
- The ability to adjust the thermostat to compensate for temperature offsets. In my case, where my thermostat is located the temp registers about 3 degrees off from what it is in our master bedroom or living room. I simply adjusted the offset in the Sensi app to compensate for this and now our bedroom and living room remain closer to the set temp then they have in the past.
- It can be operated manually by those less tech savvy. The controls on the face plate look and operate like those on our old ‘conventional’ one. I also like that you can lock out the manual operation from the app so that no one else can mess with the settings; like during the holidays when you have family members over who feel they can change the settings without asking .. lol.
- Being able to adjust the system cycling rates. There are three settings (short, medium, and long) that can be set independently for heat, heat aux and cooling. I don’t mind having my temps vary a degree before the system cycles back on, so I have all mine set to long; during the summer, I may switch cooling to short to see how much of a difference it makes.

Con: I only have one and it is the reason for my 4 rating. The instructions, at least those in the box, should include information on the additional settings that may need to be needed depending on the AC/heating system you have. At a minimum, they should inform you that you may need to make additional setting changes and where to find the instructions online.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jennie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024","Could only connect wifi once. Got a new wifi router for home and tried to set Sensi thermostat using the sames steps as I did before. However, this time around, the Sensi app would not go to next screen once my phone connected to Sensi's wifi. Did many of the troubleshooting steps as researched (instatlled brand new battery for thermostat, ""rebooted"" thermostat, restarted phone, changed phone's wifi settings, etc.) but to no avail. Now, the thermostat is now just a dumb thermo. Had good potential. If app issue gets fixed, this would be a 5 star.

UPDATE: I was able to reconnect the Sensi thermostat. In my original negative post, I tried reconnecting to new home wifi using a different account email address and a different phone. I eventually discovered that if I log in with the app on the original set-up phone and email address, the app would work. Only thing I would have liked is if Sensi would put a warning to use original email address for account login and phone. I recently read this as a potential fix in one of the Amazon's reviews (I hadn't seen this fix in my earlier research). With the app now working and me being able to check on the temperature setting remotely, this thermostat is an easy 5 stars. The additional options in the app such as setting offsets, cycle rates, a/c protection, et. are just great! I have no c-wire so I use a battery, but it is also great that Sensi provides on their website how to wire for a c-wire (without c-wire adapter) by using a jumper but they provide how to install a c-wire adapter so this thermostat give folks few options. I have central a/c and propane gas heater with no c-wire and the Sensi works for my configuration. I will eventually try to wire using a jumper to set-up a ""mock"" c-wire.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Our Lennox system is quite old & only 4 of 8 wires matched the Sensi unit. We called tech support & spoke with Rose who was fantastic. We emailed a pic of our setup to her. She asked that we hold for approx 5-7min. We had to take the panel off of the air handler to look for additional wiring, which didn’t help much. After we clarified that the black wire on our Lennox thermostat was labeled R, not B, Rose was able to confirm what our new wiring arrangement should be. She also helped us reprogram our Sensi thermostat for the new wiring configuration. At that point, the rest was a piece of cake. We were very impressed with the level of knowledge & support provided.

Called tech support around 1:45 pm EDT and waited 49 minutes to recorded tips, no one answered. Customer support SHOULD publish hours phones are manned and SHOULD have a call back feature added to their customer service number. My HVAC home contractor uses one and he only covers two counties.

There were help/tips available on several parts of the vendors website, but you had to be diligent when looking. Bottom line, I performed all available troubleshooting steps with no success in connecting to SENSI XXXXX network.

Dave,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2024","I like the style of the thermostat, and how it looks on the wall. It works really well here in the Southeast Texas humid climate by displaying the humidity on the screen along with the temperature. The Sensi app is easy and straightforward. Whenever the humidity drops below a preset level, I am alerted and can remotely turn on my system. Additionally, you can lock out the front controls and only control the system from the app, which is useful when kids turn the temp all the way down. For the temperature range, this can be set to prevent someone from turning the A/C below a certain point or the heat up to the maximum. For the price, I would definitely recommend this thermostat.

It can also integrate with Alexa and other home automation apps.",5.0 out of 5 stars

AliThom,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2023","I had a digital, but not smart, thermostat for my old oil furnace. I took a gamble and decided to buy this and hope I had the C-wire I needed.

When I got this thermostat and tried to install it, I ran into some snags. I had the extra wire that I could use as a C-wire coming out the hole where the thermostat would go, but because I had two wires twisted together in my basement, it didn't go all the way to the furnace. I went out, got a new thermostat wire, got that all threaded through the wall and around my beams in the basement...only to discover that my furnace did not have the ""C"" terminal to connect to.

At this point I called customer service and they were helpful. They told me I would need an external adapter, and I got this one: https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07L4DN5R2?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details

While I waited for that to arrive, I had to put my old thermostat back on. When the adapter came, I was able to pull it through the wall so I could plug it in the basement. I connected the positive wire (striped) to the C and the negative to the RC terminals in the thermostat, and the old wires matching where they were before. I also had to snip the jump wire on the faceplate as instructed by the customer service person. That all worked great! As soon as I set my desired temperature, my furnace started right up.

Connecting to the Wifi, I got two failed attempt messages, but I just kept hitting ""try again."" On the third try, it connected. So I would just say keep trying!

I found the app pretty intuitive.

The only thing I would have liked is a step-by-step manual, printed. All the instructions are in the app and one of the steps, you were supposed to click which wires your old thermostat had. If you didn't select ""C"" you can't continue. I would have liked to look ahead a little bit and know all the steps before I started, then just review them as I went.

I like this one because it DOES have physical push buttons on the thermostat, so if you want guests to be able to adjust it, they can do so without the app. But the app control lets me do it easily and check on things when I am away from home. I also like how the temperature numbers are really big, and it displays both the current temp AND what it is set to, in addition to the time. The app also tells you the humidity level!

In the app you can set a schedule, adjust the temperature manually, or even use a geofencing option that automatically turns the heat down 3 degrees when you are not home (based on location of your phone). It will also alert you (if you want) to possible problems with your HVAC system based on extreme highs/lows. You can also see what the current temp is, both inside your house AND the outside temp in your city, and whether or not your furnace is currently running. This was critical for me as I have an old furnace that sometimes wimps out, and I wanted to be able to check the temp when I am away from home for extended periods in case there is an issue.

There is also a ""usage"" tracker but that shows daily data and I'm still on day 1 so I don't have data to display.

We removed the old thermostat’s cover plate then held up this thermostat w/o the cover plate. Then we took a quick pic of the old thermostat’s wiring with this thermostat’s inner panel. We removed the wiring in the order of this thermostat’s wiring diagram, too to bottom and removed the old plate. When we slipped this thermostat over the wires, they were all aligned an in order. Easy peasy to insert each one in order, top to bottom or bottom to top. Press down the wires, pop on the cover plate.

Then we had to download the app, Sensi, and go thru the process to create a profile, select the wires inside our thermostat, and then zip thru the set up.

So later, we were messing around with the app, setting up the schedules for when to cool/heat and at what temperatures to change and when. The app interface was SO VERY EASY!! It allows you to copy previous schedules or to create new based on existing schedules. It was really intuitive how to schedules and click thru everything. You can set schedules for when you only have heat on. And you can set schedules for when you only have the A/C on. AND you can set other schedules for when you have it on auto and it switches between heat and cool.

Additionally, you can set any type of schedule combo for the week. So if you work from home, set a 7 day schedule. If you work M-F, set a 5 day schedule and weekend schedule. If you work 4-10s, easily set one schedule for your work week and a second for your 3-day weekend! Best yet! If you are a fireman or nurse and work a couple days on and a few days off , set up a schedule or two, call one long week and one short week or call it MTFSa/WThSu to show which days you are at work/home. I have never had one where I could schedule each day independently and was so easy to make multiple schedules. I can create one schedule for the days I work/am home, and then create a copy of that and just swap the days that I’m at work/home without having to schedule each and every day all over again. This is the easiest interface EVER!! ( I know my explanation doesn’t do it justice, but it is nice. I’m about to schedule another one for when I work nights. Then I just toggle between them at work if I find out I need to pull a double shift

I hate new technology… but this was a dream… even for me!!

DNA,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2020","I am so happy I bought this. I got a new AC and I wanted something more hi tech than the thermostat that it came with. I also didn’t want to spend $200 on a Nest. I just wanted something simple that was programmable but also worked with Alexa. This is it! I actually did my research and found this was better than the equivalent Honeywell thermostat.
1. If you have both central air/Heat you do not need a C-wire. I live in a condo and they were having problems with the c-wire so I told them to just install it without it, and it still works perfectly. It does have AA batteries that I will have to change eventually but that’s fine.
2. I love that it works with Alexa. I like it colder at night so I set up a routine, I tell Alexa “Good Night” and she shuts off my lights and turns the air down to my desired temp.
3. This thing has GeoFencing! I thought I would need to program it for weekdays but this is even better. Every time I take my phone 3 miles away, it automatically raises the temp 3 degrees and then lowers it again when I’m back within a 3 mile range. So if I’m just walking my dog or running an errand in the neighborhood it won’t adjust unnecessarily and only does it when I’m gone for longer periods.
4. Also has programmable schedules for those who choose this. I just use Alexa and Geofencing so I don’t even have to use this feature.
5. I think it’s prettier than the Honeywell and the Nest. I like that it’s white and has a white glow on the screen so it looks better on the wall. The Honeywell has a green light apparently.
6. Optional Humidity control. You can set it to a certain humidity percentage and it will overcool a couple of degrees to reach your humidity level. I loved this at first but it didn’t work for me because it was doing it even when I was away and I would rather it just keep the temperature that I wanted instead. But this is a great feature if that is important to you.
7. 100% control with the Sensi app. I can adjust my temp from my bed, from work, from my car, while on vacation . It’s amazing. I honestly have not even had to touch the actual thermostat since it was installed. And the fact that you can have Alexa control it and tell you the temp inside and outside is awesome.
8. All of these features are optional. You can turn them on and off in the app and cater the system to your family’s needs. Oh and do you have kids or a pesky family member that keeps changing the temp? You can actually lock the buttons on the actual unit from the app and use only the app.

This does not have room sensors and it will not learn your schedule or figure out what room you are in or anything like the Nest or other thermostats do. But if you are like me and live in a small space then those features aren’t necessary and with the Geofencing, even if my schedule fluctuates, it will still only adjust if I’m 3 miles away no matter what my schedule is.

Overall I say this is so worth the price. I should have bought this a long time ago. I am very happy at the moment but I will come back and update the review if anything changes.",5.0 out of 5 stars

S. Hoffman,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2024","There are many smart thermostats available these days with decent reviews. I looked at several and sifted through those reviews.

We have a vacation home that outside temperatures can vary from 5 degrees during the winter to 95 degrees during the summer. We have had the Sensi thermostat installed for over a year and adjust the temperature prior to our arrival and can monitor the indoor temperature of the house from 200 miles away via wifi.

Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2023","Wanted to upgrade the thermostat unit but my wiring didn't include the c-wire which removes many other options from the table. Luckily the ST55 doesn't require it (and instead uses batteries). The ST55 is actually Emerson's lower tier smart thermostat, and doesn't have a lot of the bells and whistles of their higher end units. The design is also much more traditional, as opposed to the higher end units, which basically are entirely screen, no buttons. But I like having the buttons and didn't neccessarily want to mount somthing that looked like a smart phone on the wall.

The installation was very straight forward and the included bubble level made mounting it horizontally level quite easy. The app guides you through install and as long as you know what your wires are, you shouldn't have any problem.

Using it is very straight foward. Basic functionality is all supported like setting a temperature and setting a schedule. If you generally just want to do the most basic of tasks then this thermostat will definitely suffice. The information is all displayed on the screen. The screen displays both time and humidity, but alternates it - so if you want to know the humidity and it currently displays time, just wait a few second and it will switch. The associated application is also pretty useful and lets you see and control the unit from your smart phone. If you register an account you also can get notifications - for example, when the humidity is above 70% you'll get an email (at which point you can turn on the dehumidifier or AC). I personally haven't had any issues with it after a few months of use, so as far as I can tell, this unit is completely reliable - it does what I need it to do, no more and no less.

The higher end models will also obviously have all the same functionality along with even more advanced functionality I'm guessing, but if you don't really want something super fancy and like the traditional appearence of this unit, then this will be more than adaquate. Also if you don't have the C-wire then you simply won't have too many options anyway. If however you really want even more smart features and want something more futuristic, then well a higher-end model might suit you more.",5.0 out of 5 stars

El,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2023","Living in a house that hasn’t been updated since the 90’s means we were stuck without a common wire and with a vintage Honeywell basic thermometer, you know the ones, everyone has had one in their first crappy apartment lol.

When we first moved in we converted the downstairs thermostat to a nest and then when moving upstairs we realized the AC was from 1989 and needed to be rewired or replaced. I don’t like to replace things that are working great just to make them tech friendly so I started looking for options.

A local air conditioner dude quoted me $400 to install a nest thermostat with a common wire adapter. I thought that was fair but couldn’t afford it so I tried to do it myself and ran into issues with our ancient AC system’s power source. I gave up on ever having a smart thermostat that I could install myself for an affordable amount of money and we just adjusted it manually and consistently whenever it was hot.

However I got desperate during these Texas 110 degree days recently with my old AC thermostat popping on and off over and over so I started the search over. Determined not to spend $5000 on a whole new system cause yikes.

I found this one on Amazon after an extensive search and thought it’s too good to be true that it doesn’t need a common and it fits where the old 1990’s honeywells need updating.

I installed it so easily just like a normal thermostat, no wire jumping or skinning needed. No adapter on our dinosaur ac! I didn’t even have to open up the ac itself just the wall thermo. The app walked me through everything, and It took me about 45 mins total to connect it and calibrate it for the excess temperature issues we were having (our thermostat is in a hot spot in the room, you can adjust it just for these sorts of situations) within the first day we were seeing a change in the control of the temperature in these hot daytime hours!

A month later I am happy to say it’s working so well and our house is finally eco friendly with a lower bill during the summer. We haven’t had as many issues with our AC running all day and the app gives us a breakdown of energy usage and temperature. I only wish I had found this sooner because it solved a lot of our problems until we can officially replace our very old AC.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Just Josh,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2022","Installing this thermostat is very easy. Wire it up, setup the app, connect to it with the app, enter a code from the thermostat, and it connects to your wifi and is then available to view and configure in the app from anywhere.

At a basic level it works just like you’d expect any thermostat to work. You can control it right from the thermostat using the up/down arrows for the temperature. There are also buttons to set the heating or cooling mode (or turn it off), set the fan to on all the time or Auto, and to turn it on the programmed schedule mode. This thermostat also has a mode where it can automatically switch between heating and cooling as needed.

You can program the thermostat using the buttons on the unit itself, but it’s much easier to use the app to setup your schedule. You can setup various events throughout the day such as if you want it to be a certain temperature when you wake up, change when you are out for the day, change again when you’re back home, and change again for when you go to bed. In this sense it’s pretty much like any other programmable thermostat.

The app gives you a few nifty features (besides the expected ability to adjust it from anywhere… very convenient from bed):
- You can lock the physical buttons so only the app can control the thermostat. Perfect if you have issues with people adjusting the thermostat when they shouldn’t be.
- You can setup the fan to run a certain amount of time per hour to circulate the air in case the heating and cooling doesn’t need to run the fan much. This is a nice alternative for air circulation compared with just leaving the fan on all the time.
- You can use the app to tweak the “actual” temperature by plus or minus five degrees. This will change the room temperature display number and thus the behavior of the thermostat. This is convenient both for calibrating the thermostat if you want to set it to be exactly the same as another thermometer that you have, and also if you want to use it to set the temperature in another room that might be hotter or colder than the area where the thermostat is located.
- You can see the usage day by day on a graph. You can see how much the heat, air conditioning, and fan were on each day. Very convenient to see how your temperature settings impact the actual energy usage.

A great all around thermostat and a good alternative to “smarter” models if you don’t really care about the smart stuff but still want to be able to control your thermostat from an app.",5.0 out of 5 stars

PT,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","Emerson did an amazing job with this product! I finally broke down and bought a wifi thermostat because I was tired of having to continually run over to my manual thermostat to adjust it. When going from summer to winter, or winter to spring, there are many days where you need heating on one day, and cooling the next... or heating during the morning... cooling during the day... and heating again during later that night. This makes the wifi thermostat the only logical choice.

My initial concern was the infamous ""c-wire,"" and whether that would be an issue, but Emerson has developed a system that is as foolproof as you can find. You download their app, and simply follow the step-by-step instructions, and voila! If necessary, you can go back a page or two, or you can go through the entire app a page at a time, to familiarize yourself, then go back to the first page and begin. I can't speak highly enough of their app and how well it is done. I only wish other companies would follow suit, and include such an easy to follow instruction app!

As to the thermostat itself, it is not too difficult to figure out, and I was most pleased with how quick and simple it was to setup the daily schedule. That was the one area where it was not as intuitive as it could have been, and a few extra instructions explaining it could have helped. But I still managed to figure it out in just a few minutes of trial & error, since the screen would tell me that I was doing it wrong, and would not let me go to the next step. But again... all in all, it was a surprisingly simple process from start to finish.

I was also pleased with how easy it was to setup the daily schedule. On my 7-day programmable manual thermostat, each day had to be set individually. On the Sensi, you can simply select select the days that you want programmed, and apply the temperature settings to that entire range of days. So rather than having to program 7 individual days, I simply set a schedule for 5 work days, and another schedule for my two days off.

The one thing I would caution everyone about is AA batteries! The batteries in the package were about 70% when I installed them into the thermostat. Fortunately, I keep plenty of rechargeable batteries on hand, so I was able to charge up a set. When I installed those, the battery meter showed a full 100%. I will monitor to see how long the batteries last, but with rechargeable batteries... it's actually no big deal one way or the other.

The unit works fine, and it took no time to install. The mounting bracket uses the exact same holes as the unit I was replacing, and you will probably need the super tiny philips head screwdriver and a pair of needle nosed pliers to push the copper wires back into the wall after you have them inserted & screwed down on the thermostat wall mount. If you leave them extending out, they will block you from being able to snap the face-plate onto the wall mount.

I highly recommend this unit. The cost is excellent... it works excellent... and installation was a breeze!

BUT, I'm really happy with the purchase now about 8 months later. We have to leave the heat on over the winter as the house is not set up to drain plumbing & winterize, etc. The Sensei units not only give me the current temps in the home, they show me the outside temp. The app also lets me see how much the heat has run for any given day, etc. When it's going to be colder than normal for a few days, it's easy to just open the app and dial up the heat a bit. Don't have to call a neighbor (or my brother in law) to have them go over and adjust the thermostats for us. Plus we got some $ back thru the Mass Save Energy program, so they where practically free. Installation was a little on the fussy side; they lost wifi connection a few times, but I think that's the fault of my Eero mesh system more than the thermostats.

Ted Long,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2024","My utility company had a rebate of up to $125 for a self-installed smart thermostat. So, my overall cost was zero.

Using the separate app that gets installed on my android phone, allows me to easily set a schedule and/or temporarily set the temperature. The android installed app is so good it changes color while viewing if the (in my case) the heat is actually running.
Current temperature, at the thermostat, is pretty large and easily read. But temp setting is a bit small on the device, but still easy to read. Another useful feature is the current humidity level. With my forced hot air heat, the air dries out very quickly, so when the humidity level drops below 25%, I usually turn on a humidifier to add more moisture in the air. The humidity level, like the current setting. is pretty small on the device, but is also more easily read on the app.
Physical install, and app setup, took me less than 15 minutes, and Alexa setup just a few minutes more. The only thing that I would like to have that is missing is a physical button just to temporarily turn on the back light.

Consumer,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023","This is super easy to install - just make sure you install the app on your phone before removing your old thermostat. The app will walk you through every step quite clearly. I think even the least handy person in the world could install this. Comes with wire flags to mark your wires so you don't even have to bring your brain.

I bought this to replace a Honeywell that wasn't very old but suddenly started acting erratically, with temperature readings off by over 20 degrees. I didn't care to have a Smart thermostat, but I wanted one that could use either battery or hard-wired power and this one fit that criteria. It turns out that I really like having the ability to turn my HVAC on or off or change the temperature/schedule when I'm not at home. I also like that I can change the schedule without having to program it at the wall. My other thermostat had a touch screen so I could tap the screen to light it up. This one doesn't light up without pressing a button, which will either change something or open a menu (mildly annoying), but you also have the option to leave the display light on all the time. Personally for me it's easier to just look on my phone.

I'm using this with a heat pump that has back-up heat. So far I've only had the opportunity to test the AC but the ""aux heat"" option is showing on the display (it won't unless your system is wired correctly) so I feel certain it'll be fine. Temperature readings are accurate. It also displays humidity which I like since we leave the windows open a lot but don't want the humidity to get too high in the house. The best feature for me is that this thermostat can automatically turn on either heating or cooling for these shoulder seasons, with separate temperature criteria for each.

I'm not happy that I came to write this review after only having this briefly and the price has come down ten bucks... So I think it might be worth watching the price if you're in the market. I also got the wall plate to cover up where the sloppy former owners of my home slapped paint around the other thermostat in a mess.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Brandon,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2023","I previously had Emerson thermostats that look identical to these but with no programming or WiFi capability. I had always been happy with those and was hoping I wouldn’t even have to rewire and swap the mounting plate but that wasn’t case. That said, it was still an easy swap. The way the app walks you through the installation is genius. At first it seemed a little cheesy that I was telling the app which wires were present. But once I was all done and didn’t have to manually edit any settings to tell it what kind of unit I had (for emergency/aux heat), it became clear what that process was for.

Settings schedules and so forth is the app is straight forward and I love the usage data showing how much the unit was running each day. To be clear, this isn’t a learning t-stat that tries to figure out your patterns and adjust to save energy, which I didn’t want. My wife is retired so someone is almost always home and we have a rather inconsistent schedule for any given day.

The only nitpicks I have are lack of a filter change reminder and the “early start” feature. Early start is supposed to start the unit sooner that the scheduled time to reach the desired temp BY the scheduled time. There seems to be no intelligence at all here…just an arbitrary set amount of time to start early, like maybe 15min. As a result, it’s unlikely that early start is going to reach the target temp by the set scheduled time if it’s off may more than a degree or two. I guess I thought there may be some learning that went on with that feature but that’s not the case.

Overall, I’d highly recommend these as a quality programming Wi-Fi connected thermostat at a reasonable price and not over-featured.",5.0 out of 5 stars
BJ,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2023","Title: A Smart Thermostat that Delivers on Its Promises

I recently upgraded to the Emerson Sensi WiFi Smart Thermostat from an old Honeywell thermostat, and the difference has been night and day. The installation was straightforward and took under 30 minutes, thanks to the well-illustrated instructions and user-friendly app that guided me through the process.

The sleek design of the Sensi thermostat not only adds a modern touch to my home but also provides an intuitive interface that makes adjusting the temperature a breeze. I particularly enjoy the flexibility of controlling the thermostat from my smartphone, whether I'm at home or on the go. The geofencing feature is a game changer—it automatically adjusts the temperature when I leave or arrive home, making my life much easier and helping to lower my energy bills.

I was initially concerned about the compatibility of the Sensi thermostat with my heating and cooling setup—a basement boiler for heating and central AC for cooling. However, after checking the compatibility on Sensi's website and a quick call to their responsive customer support, I was assured and now enjoy seamless operation across both systems.

One of the standout features has to be the smart alerts, which notify me if the temperature in my home goes outside of the set thresholds. This feature gives me peace of mind, especially during the winter and summer months when temperature consistency is crucial.

Furthermore, the integration with smart home ecosystems like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant is seamless, allowing me to adjust the temperature with voice commands effortlessly.

In summary, the Emerson Sensi WiFi Smart Thermostat has significantly improved the comfort and convenience of managing my home's heating and cooling. Its smart features, ease of installation, and compatibility with various HVAC systems make it a worthwhile investment for any modern home.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Katie,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2019","First off, this is the only smart thermostat I could find that didn't require either a C-wire or a C-wire conversion kit. I'm in an older apartment where adding wires to the furnace isn't an option and had given up on a smart thermostat until I stumbled upon the Sensi Wi-Fi thermostat. (The Sensi Wi-Fi Touch version does need one, so don't get them mixed up!) It was very easy to install, no harder than changing out an analog thermostat, actually easier since the Sensi app walked me through every step and provided stickers to label my wires. It might not have all the bells and whistles of the most well-known smart thermostats (it doesn't learn, or have slick touchscreen interface, or let me put sensors in every room) but it does everything I wanted a smart thermostat to do.

I was able to set up multiple schedules that are easy to switch between, which was really important to me as I my work schedule is unconventional and changes often so even an analog 7-day programmable thermostat can't keep up. When setting schedules you can program as many ""change times"" as you want, so if you want a different temperature every hour you can set that. All it takes is a couple of clicks in the Sensi app to switch between schedules. Sensi hasn't figured out how to let Alexa change which schedule it's on, which is the only minor gripe I have because saying ""Alexa, ask the thermostat to change to my B-Week Schedule"" is slightly faster than opening the Sensi app and selecting the B-Week Schedule myself, but using the app is a breeze so it's only a minor drawback.

Speaking of Alexa, the Sensi Wi-Fi Thermostat connects to smart home systems. It's supposed to connect go Google Home, Apple HomeKit, and Wink as well, although I only have an Amazon Alexa so I can't actually vouch for that. Connecting to Alexa was as easy as setting up any other Alexa skill and I can tell Alexa to change the temperature without getting out from under the covers. It's first-world bliss on winter mornings.

This thermostat doesn't have a touch-screen and looks a lot like an analog model, but it's a worthwhile tradeoff in my book to have smart thermostat functionality without needing a C-Wire. It requires two AA batteries and the thermostat shipped with name-brand batteries included. I've only been using it about 3 weeks so I can't tell how fast they wear down, but the battery indicator still reads full charge currently so I'm not too worried about it eating through batteries like crazy. The price point is also quite good compared to fancier models, it's not much more than some of the analog 7-day programmable options I looked into.

The last bit of praise I have for the Sensi Wi-Fi Thermostat is that Emmerson's customer service is excellent! I called them before purchase to confirm that I really, truly didn't need a C-wire or conversion kit (I'd bought a different thermostat I though would be compatible based online guides before, only to find out it wouldn't work for my apartment) and the customer service representative was very nice and helpful! He had me email in a picture how my old thermostat was wires and he confirmed it would work with no modification while I was still on the phone and told me to call back with any installation questions.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I’ve known for while I wanted to replace it, but it being an older house without a “C” wire, I was hesitant to tackle this on my own. But, this thermostat was SO EASY TO INSTALL.

Chris Yavelow,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2021","I never imagined that a thermostat could have such a positive effect upon my life. The Emerson Sensi WIFI Smart Thermostat ST55 more than lives up to its name. They say the installation is 30 minutes or less, and my installation was definitely less than 15 minutes. I was very pleased with this, because a half-year earlier, I had installed a competitor's 3rd generation “learning” thermostat, and that took about 25 hours of phone calls service visits. That one never worked, so I went back to my 12-year-old thermostat, the one that came with my heat pump, a “dumb” thermostat with only 4 time periods and 2 divisions of the week (weekdays and weekends).

As winter approached six months later, I searched for a WIFI thermostat and found the Emerson Sensi. The Sensi allows as many time periods as you require, and each day can have its own unique schedule. Perfect for me as I have a different schedule every day. Moreover, programming the schedules is very easy from the phone app, quite a contrast to my pervious experience that required hundreds of button presses to adjust schedules.

For me, the most impressive aspect of the Sensi is how even the temperature is. With both my previous thermostats, the original dumb thermostat and the so-called “state of the art” learning thermostat, I found myself jumping up to make adjustments throughout every day and night, and still they always overshot or undershot the desired temperature. Contrast that to the Sensi; I haven’t had to adjust it since the day I installed it and configured the schedule. And I’m not constantly forced to put on or take off a sweater; the Sensi maintains the temperature I desire seamlessly. On top of that, consider that I am writing this in the middle of winter and, since day one, the outside temperature has fluctuated from 3 degrees F to 64 degrees F (minus 16 C to 18 C), with a frequent 30-degree spread (or more) within a 24-hour period. It’s amazing! I’m eager to see how it performs with my air-conditioner this coming summer.

There are many other helpful features of the thermostat and the app: WIFI control of course, ease of creating and editing schedules, usage reports, integration with Apple HomeKit and other home automation systems, the option to have the panel light on constantly, and qualifying for my power company’s energy savings program (with a $90 gift card the first year and $25 gift card in upcoming years). The Sensi has been problem-free since the day of installation, and there have been no internet connectivity issues, despite being 25 feet away from my router. Bottom line: the Emerson Sensi WIFI Smart Thermostat ST55 performs far beyond my expectations. I’m happy to recommend the product without reservation.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Mick,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2024","I am so impressed with this thermostat! I will preface this review by stating that I have just received and installed this unit. I will edit/update review if anything changes after some usage. I did a search for a smart thermostat that did not require a C-wire. All the ones I had seen required a C-wire and unfortunately, I don’t have one, nor do I have anywhere near the thermostat to plug in an C-wire adapter. This Sensi unit came up in my search, so I had to look into it. Reading through the reviews, it was suggested to download the Sensi app prior to receiving the thermostat. The app is amazing. You are able to enter in the wire configuration of your current thermostat and the app will tell you whether or not a C-wire is required. Admittedly, I was skeptical, but I purchased it and it was delivered same day. The Sensi app walks you through the complete install. Trust me when I say, it could not be easier! I removed the original thermostat and installed/setup the Sensi thermostat within 20 minutes. Connected to WiFi and Alexa in a matter of minutes. Everything seems to be functioning as it should. Very impressed. My only concern is battery life, so that will remain to be seen, but for now, I am ecstatic to have a smart thermometer working with my Alexa.

Update: In over 6 months, I’ve yet had to replace the batteries. This thermostat is a keeper!

Phillip C. Adkins,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2024","I really like this thermostat. I had one for about a year, and I just installed another one on the other side of our house. It’s very simple, but also does the Wi-Fi thing very well. Scheduling, humidity monitoring, statistics, it all works very well. The app is excellent, it’s very simple and works great. Installing it also was very easy, even without a c-wire.

i’ve seen other reviews say that the batteries don’t last very long. This is not in the case in anyway for me. As I said before, I’ve had one of these for about a year – with the same set of batteries. And if you look at the battery meter it still has full three stripes, that is the battery is still totally full after a year. So at least in my experience, you don’t have to worry at all about not having a C wire – the battery seems to be working 100% OK.

so, I would totally recommend buying this. Again, I bought a second one because I liked the first one so much. It’s not very expensive, it’s simple and it works great.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The Sensi app is well-thought and straightforward to use, the install procedure/walk-through was simple enough and the functionality is as expected.
I did have to set up slight temperature and humidity offsets to make this one agree with my other sensors.
Alexa picked it up immediately after installing it.
I like that I can only set the fan to recirculate a certain percentage of the time (I use 10%) to still move the air around.
The ""dehumidifier""/""comfort"" feature could be done better (maybe consider a comfort or mold growth curves). As it is right now, it only starts/keeps cooling/dehumidifying if the room temperature is higher than set temperature and the humidity is higher than the one set. It will not start dehumidifying if the temperature is lower and the humidity higher than the ones set. At least I can now watch the temperature and humidity remotely and start the AC/cooling/dehumidifying (by lowering the set temperature) if humidity gets too high.",5.0 out of 5 stars
supermonkey,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2024","I bought this thermostat to use at a vacation property. The property has a mobile home with a very basic electric heat only furnace. The wiring to the thermostat was only two wires, a red and a white. The instructions included and the setup on the app will tell you that it won't work with only a red and a white wire. I connected the red wire to the RH terminal and the white wire to the W/E terminal. I installed the thermostat on the plate and set the temperature to 70° and it's working just fine. I found the default cycle rate of medium to be too sensitive, so I set it to slow. Wi-Fi setup was easy and I'm able to control the thermostat from the app without any issues. I installed Energizer ultimate lithium AA batteries which are the longest lasting AA batteries. We'll see how they hold up over time with the Wi-Fi usage.

I can view this thermostat from thousands of miles away, control my heating and air conditioning and follow what is happening inside and outside the house when not occupied. Great. One thing I found out. If you turn off power to the HVAC system while away, the thermostat, even with battery, loses its wifi communication.

Alex A.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2020","I bought this during this year's prime day and installed it almost immediately. I had some old honeywells that did fine, but I wanted wifi access and a little more control over scheduling than the usual four times + weekend/weekday settings. I don't have a c-wire with my heating system, but was still able to install and operate without one because wifi can be turned on and off very easily right on the unit. This unit has great instructions built right into the mobile app. It asks you what wires you have available, then gives you step by step instructions.. I had to fudge it and pretend I had a Common wire in order to move forward. Once I got it installed, I setup a schedule using the app (can't use the unit for that).

I did run into a little snag at first. It connected to wifi, but then froze and rebooted. I was concerned until I saw ""ota"" on the unit. ""OTA"" means ""over the air"", which is a fancy way of saying it downloaded an update. If it happens to you, just walk away for a while. It will freeze, reboot, OTA, boot back up, freeze, then you'll be good. The whole thing took maybe 5 minutes, but standing there staring at it made it seem longer.

If you don't have a c-wire but want to get this installed in the interim, you can. Just make sure to turn off wifi on the unit menu when you're done getting everything set up otherwise you'll burn through those two AA's in an hour or two. I also hear wifi coverage is spotty on battery power.

If you want an easy c-wire solution, search on amazon for a ""c wire adapter"" and there's plenty of merchants selling a glorified plug with two wires coming from it with 25 feet of slack. That's what i'm planning on doing this weekend as they just came in. If you have forced hot air, you can connect to the 24 volt on the fan, but I hear it's kind of spotty too. Plus the thought of jury rigging ANYTHING on such an expensive and critical appliance just gives me the creeps. Better to spent $15 on the adapter.

If you have wired audio speakers before, this is really no different. In the box there's little stickers for you to label things before you take out your wiring too. If you don't have a c-wire, there isn't even enough voltage to give you a jolt. This is one of the easiest installs you will do as a homeowner so don't be afraid! I have faith in you!

H. LEE,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2019","I have to say that anything that has to do with electrical, heat, A/C, wires, etc. makes me nervous. I wasn't sure if I needed to hire a electrician to install this and so glad I didn't b/c the installation process literally took 15-20 minutes. If you go online and search this system, you'll find a lot of installation support and people talking about the installation process. Follow the instructions and the key is install the app first. The app itself will pretty much walk you step by step. I image the tricky part for people is determining if they have c wire or not. If you don't, it's probably a good idea to research more if this system works for you using pure batteries. I chose this thermostat b/c of the reviews and the size. It pretty much was the same size as my non-wireless honeywell system. A few things I've learned that I feel will be helpful for people purchasing this to install it themselves:
1. Remove the cover of your existing thermostat and it should tell you if you have a C wire or not. If you do, there will be a wire that is plug to the label C. If not, you don't.
2. The system works only on 2.5 gHz vs. 5 gHz so if you have both, make sure you program your system to connect only to 2.5 gHz and remove any auto-connect to 5 gHz even if the option comes up.
3. Create one account and if others in your home want to remotely use the system, they cannot create their own account and add this or not, you will all have to access this one account linking to this system
4. Understand the settings. You can control how sensitive the thermostat actives. There's a cycle rate setting. Fast cycle rate = tighter temp. control and shorter on/off cycles and slow cycle rate = wider temp. swing and longer on/off. I find that the medium works for us.
5. Should your wireless, phone app, or remote access run into an issue, the system still works. You just have to do everything manually. Note: if you set the system on lock and only able to control via the mobile app., that may be an issue. You are stuck with how you last set the system. I'm sure there's a override manually and I hope I never find out. I don't have mind set to lock.

If you are looking for a fancy thermostat with tons of different data readings, this is not it. This is pretty straight forward and simple. Tells you the temperature the thermostat is reading at, your choice of your temp setting, the humidity percentage, and whether the system is currently running or off cycle (blue background if currently running, gray is off).

Steve,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2023","I love my Thermostat … I’m adding a couple comments about the circulating fan option. This feature insures that the fan runs at least x% of each hour. I love this in the summer as it brings the basement cool air back upstairs without running the compressor.
—-—-> I DO WISH <—— that it had a option to control how frequently it ran rather than just once per hour. Even without that flexibility, it’s far better than without when I manually turned on & off the fan to get the circulating air.

Other features from my original review. …
I love controlling the Thermostat from my phone.

Setup was easy. The app gives detailed step by step instructions. At first I had a little trouble because I marked the colors of the wires (B blue wire, W white wire) instead of marking the labels from the old Thermostat. After I called the help line and fixed my wire labels the setup worked fine.

I really like the flexibility for setting up schedules. You can have multiple different schedules. Each schedule can be programmed with for settings per day for each day of the week. I created separate schedules for heating and cooling. I also created a separate schedule for when we are away.

I had to reconnect the Thermostat to the WiFi after a storm took out our power for a half day. The system was continuing to run on my schedule, but I couldn’t see it on the Sensi App until I reconnected it. I don’t know if it would have eventually reconnected on its own.

Our Lennox system is quite old & only 4 of 8 wires matched the Sensi unit. We called tech support & spoke with Rose who was fantastic. We emailed a pic of our setup to her. She asked that we hold for approx 5-7min. We had to take the panel off of the air handler to look for additional wiring, which didn’t help much. After we clarified that the black wire on our Lennox thermostat was labeled R, not B, Rose was able to confirm what our new wiring arrangement should be. She also helped us reprogram our Sensi thermostat for the new wiring configuration. At that point, the rest was a piece of cake. We were very impressed with the level of knowledge & support provided.

Jose & Marcia,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024","We had issues installing our Sensi overseas. We have had to call and wait for Sensi Emerson support. We got lucky during 1st set of 4 Sensi Emerson devices. Got through and support overrode zip code issue. But we found one device was defective... So, we bought another Sensi and same problem with setup in same overseas location.

Here's my letter to Sensi.

Hello Sensi Support, We have purchased and installed at least 10 Emerson Sensi Model# ST55 in my various properties. The installation in USA is easy. But the overseas or international is difficult. Due to needing a specific zip code / location, we have been forced to call Sensi technical support number.

Sensi Emerson Support

Unfortunately, this requires a long distance phone call where we must hold on the phone line until someone actually responds.  There is no way to leave a message.

We recently purchased 4 Sensi devices.  The devices were setup with nice Sensi Emerson support. The Sensi support person was able to override Sensi's zipcode limitation for the Las Terrenas in Dominican Republic. The allocated zip code is 32000.

Unfortunately, one device was defective immediately and never could sync temperature of room. It was way off.  So, we bought a replacement Sensi. Now, we need help again to set up the 4th Sensi device.

My requests are as follows:
(1) Can the zip code 32000 be made permanent in Sensi system?
(2) Can someone call or email me back from technical support / setup support?
(3) Am I able to get a refund on my defective Sensi?

Note that I have championed your Sensi Emerson product to others. I have continued to do so regardless if my recent setback. But, I would like some help for my issue. 

I would prefer to give 5 stars!
Thanks

Jennie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024","Could only connect wifi once. Got a new wifi router for home and tried to set Sensi thermostat using the sames steps as I did before. However, this time around, the Sensi app would not go to next screen once my phone connected to Sensi's wifi. Did many of the troubleshooting steps as researched (instatlled brand new battery for thermostat, ""rebooted"" thermostat, restarted phone, changed phone's wifi settings, etc.) but to no avail. Now, the thermostat is now just a dumb thermo. Had good potential. If app issue gets fixed, this would be a 5 star.

UPDATE: I was able to reconnect the Sensi thermostat. In my original negative post, I tried reconnecting to new home wifi using a different account email address and a different phone. I eventually discovered that if I log in with the app on the original set-up phone and email address, the app would work. Only thing I would have liked is if Sensi would put a warning to use original email address for account login and phone. I recently read this as a potential fix in one of the Amazon's reviews (I hadn't seen this fix in my earlier research). With the app now working and me being able to check on the temperature setting remotely, this thermostat is an easy 5 stars. The additional options in the app such as setting offsets, cycle rates, a/c protection, et. are just great! I have no c-wire so I use a battery, but it is also great that Sensi provides on their website how to wire for a c-wire (without c-wire adapter) by using a jumper but they provide how to install a c-wire adapter so this thermostat give folks few options. I have central a/c and propane gas heater with no c-wire and the Sensi works for my configuration. I will eventually try to wire using a jumper to set-up a ""mock"" c-wire.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Phillip Baxter,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024","There is so much I like about this thermostat.

Pros:
The setup is great, the easiest I’ve ever installed. The app is great, very well laid out and makes scheduling super easy. I think the thermostat actually looks good. I don’t want my thermostat to look like something out of a sci-fi movie. It’s really intuitive for anyone to change the settings on the thermostat.

Cons:
It’s a big one, it short cycles like crazy. It’s like the software programmers for this thermostat were trying to make the system run as many cycles per hour as possible. You can see from my pics, the system turned off at 5:03, then back on at 5:09, then back off again at 5:16. The temperature never changed the whole time. I have cycle settings set to “slow”. This is supposed to make it cycle the least, and have the longest runtime. Well it runs for 6-9 minutes, then it’s off for 5-7 minutes. I had this thermostat installed for a week, and this is how it ran the whole time. Rapid cycling like this leads to increased humidity, decreased efficiency, and decreased HVAC equipment life. It takes a good 3 minutes for your HVAC system to cool down to operating temperature after the system starts. That 3 minutes is essentially wasted energy, it doesn’t contribute to cooling your home. That’s why longer runtimes are better, they have a bigger percentage of their runtime spent actually cooling your home. Longer runtimes are better for your compressor too, the biggest stresses on the compressor are at startup. Reducing the number of startups of the compressor leads to longer compressor life. This thermostat does the opposite.

Solution suggestion for Sensi:
If the designers of this thermostat would just add a couple of user settings, this would be my favorite thermostat out there. They need to add a compressor minimum runtime setting that users can enable, they also need to add a temperature differential setting that would allow users to set the thermostat to not turn on the compressor until the temperature is above the setpoint by 1 degree, and not turn off the compressor until the temperature is below the setpoint by 1 degree. These 2 settings would fix the short cycling issue.",2.0 out of 5 stars

This has the common wire connected to the thermostat and we have opted to leave the backlight on all the time and it serves as a night light in the hallway.,5.0 out of 5 stars

JamesH,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2024","Our HVAC master technician spent over an hour on the phone (after waiting 45 minutes to connect with him) with Sensi representative to get this thermostat to communicate properly with our newly installed York heat pump. The thermostat will not signal the hp to switch from 1st stage to 2nd stage cooling and as a result the hp runs continuously in hot weather. The thermostat is set at 78 degrees, yet runs continuously. Our energy bills are sky high!
Of course the thermostat is beyond the time limit to return to Amazon.
Would not recommend this thermostat.",1.0 out of 5 stars

T. Baker,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2024","I have been wanting a smart thermostat for quite a while. I finally decided I needed to seriously look for one. I looked at all the major brands and while they have come down in price a little, I was still having trouble justifying the expense since I don't need some of the features, even though they are pretty neat. I just need something that can be easily programmed, and it is nice that I can adjust it from my phone if necessary. This one fits the bill. It does monitor humidity as well as temperature, and is so easy to use. Large numbers on a well lit screen on the unit also, which is great if you have trouble seeing up close without readers, especially in the middle of the night, LOL! It does not work with 5G WiFi so if that's all you have, don't get it. I have a dual signal WiFi, works flawlessly.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Mel,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019","I was looking for a smart thermostat without breaking the bank and without the need for any fancy features like self learning based on your habits for example. Got a good deal on the Sensi and decided to try it out. I downloaded the app before purchasing and was able to check my existing wiring to see if the Sensi was compatible for my system. The app is simple and goes through the all the necessary steps for set up. You will need the C wire for this thermostat.

Once I confirmed compatibility, and after delivery, following the instructions on the app took me through the process of removing the old thermostat and installing the Sensi. It was a very easy and logical process which even a novice at home improvement can follow. The only slight hitch in setting up the system was ensuring that the wire connection was secure - a couple of the wires came loose after I thought I had screwed them in. Really not a big deal but I gently tugged on the wires to ensure that they were not loose. The Sensi thermostat attaches to The wall by clipping into the wall plate that is provided. Luckily for me the old wall plate holes were in the right spot for the new Sensi wall plate. Before clipping the thermostat on ensure that the wires are flush with the wall as instructed by the app.

Connecting to WiFi was fairly easy and it was done through the app on my iPhone. The thermostat is only compatible with 2G WiFi so you have to make sure your phone is connected to the 2G network while going through this part of the setup if you have a dual band router (you can switch your phone back to the 5G network after if you wish). WiFi connection was made quickly although the thermostat did take 30 or so seconds to be fully responsive to my phone after I thought the connection was completed (I initially thought I needed to go through a troubleshooting process but did not need to complete that process).

Once fully connected you can easily adjust temperatures in the app, set up schedules and use a variety of options e.g. display humidity etc. There is also a geofencing option if you wish to use that. I set up my iPhone to be able to use Siri to adjust temperatures. You’ll need to set up your iPhone Home app for that. Once again the app runs you through all the steps to do that. I also set up my wife’s phone for her to have the feature that allows her to use Siri. Initial attempts to set her Home app to connect with the thermostat using Siri were unsuccessful until I realized that I could simply share my iPhone Home app settings with hers (just had to make sure to switch to the shared home app profile and not the original default one on her phone). If you do not wish to use Siri you can simply use the controls in the Sensi app and do not have to go though the Home app set up.

I’ve had the thermostat for a week now and I love it. The thermostat is very responsive to changes made within the Sensi app or when using Siri (usually within 1-2 seconds). I also like that I can view ‘Usage’ within the app to see how long the furnace has been active. The app will also allow you to check to see if you are eligible for rebates based on energy savings programs for your area.

Of course if you need to change app settings on the thermostat itself it is very easy to do so. There is a feature in the app that allows you to lock the wall display and only be able to change settings, temps etc through the app if you do not want people to change temps or settings through the wall display.

Overall a great thermostat. Easy setup. Easy to use. Great features. Very responsive when using your phone. 5 stars plus!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Brandi,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2020","We've had this thermostat a month and I really like it so far. It makes me think our old thermostat wasn't actually working for a long time before it started setting itself to 85°. Since it wasn't even programmable, I knew it had to go and if I was going to upgrade I may as well go with something just a bit more...modern than a set-temp-and-it-stays-unless-you-change-it thermostat. I'm going to do pros and cons below. I do want to say, I took my old thermostat off the wall first, wrote down all the wire colors and the letter each was connected to on a piece of paper. The app removes the need for pen and paper. I just used my pen and paper to place the flags mentioned below on the correct wires.

Pros:
1. This thing is super easy to install. Open the box and there are instructions for you to download the Sensi app. Once the app is downloaded it has you choose which letter slots you have wires connected to (R, RH, C, E, OB, etc.). The app then tells you how to use the flags they provide to label the wires. For example I had a wire that went into a slot labeled ""R"", but Sensi only had ""RH"" and ""RC"" (I think it was RC), so the app told me which R my wire needed to go in. Not having any electrical wiring experience, the app was SUPER helpful. It even had you take a picture of your wiring to save to your phone, just in case.

2. The piece that attaches to the wall has a built in level. I am super annoyed when things aren't straight on walls, so this right here, was awesome.

3. The app is really easy to set up. I just have a daytime and nighttime cycle, but I could set up all kinds of things super easily. Vacation modes, turning the AC up when I leave the house... It was great. It even walked me through how to sync the app with my Google assistant and the Samsung Smart Things app, which I didn't end up continuing to use. (See cons #1)

4. The report that tells you how long your AC is running is really helpful as well, especially since we had issues last year with it not being able to keep up. We have better insulation and updated windows and it's nice to see they are working, even when it's 99° with a heat index at 112°. (See cons #2)

5. I like that you can do things like temp and humidity offsets, have the AC turn on to help maintain proper humidity levels (we live in Florida, so this is a big thing for me), change the cycle rate (ended up choosing this one over another brand because people had issues with not being able to adjust the cycle rate on that one), and easily turn heat boost on or off. (See cons #3)

Cons:
1. It doesn't work with Bixby. This is something I don't really understand, but I'm guessing they assume if you're gonna use Bixby you use Smart Things? But I can just use Google for that instead.

2. The recent usage section only shows how long the AC ran that day, not which times it ran or how long at a time it ran. It would be nice to see how long the AC was running at a time, especially in the afternoon when it gets really hot. I have not yet gotten a monthly report since I got the thermostat mid-June and it's now mid-July. Interested to see what the monthly report looks like at the end of the month.

3. Sometimes I had to change settings a couple times before they ""stuck"". I found after changing a setting I needed to wait a few seconds before returning to the settings menu and that helped.

4. Shortly after I got the thermostat the AC drain line clogged. This resulted in my app/thermostat constantly saying cooling was on, but the AC wasn't running. My usage for that day was like 21hrs, but I know it wasn't actually on for the majority of that. Not really a huge issue, but you won't have an accurate reading for that day.

Summary:
Overall, this is a really amazing unit and I have been really glad to have it. It was seriously a breeze to instakl and set up and functions well. I do wish I could connect it to Bixby without using Smart Things and I do wish I had a more detailed daily usage report, but those are very small inconveniences. I normally keep our house at 78° during the day and 77° at night and sometimes that feels cold. I would often feel hot before and wondered if our AC was not working correctly, but it would seem it was actually the thermostat. Very happy with this purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Mister M,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2021","This Sensi thermostat is waaaaaaaaaaay better than Honeywell. The Honeywell software and their mentality is completely OUT OF WACK and their thermostats are pure garbage and it will damage your equipment. The Honeywell Cycle rate is set to about .5+/- so my furnace now in the winter has been running and running nonstop and my furnace was not getting any rest. That is a very bad thing for our heating and A/C system, not to mention the gas and electricity bill. I called Honeywell tech support and they told me that ALL their thermostats have this fixed setting and there is nothing in the menu for us to change that option. Something is really wrong with this Honeywell company and this cycle rate setting is simply inappropriate.

I just installed my new Emerson Smart Sensei and even the WI-FI connectivity process went very smoothly and I successfully connected my new thermostat. The Sensi app takes you thru the entire process fairly quickly and is very easy I have no idea what other people are having problems with. Note that I already knew which cables to connect so if you don't know that's a different story. The Honeywell thermostat on the other hand was a nightmare to install thru the app and it simply doesn't work so I had to go to my desktop PC and finish the process there. Really annoying.

And guess what I found out? The Sensi app itself has the options for me to change the Cycle rates to either SLOW, MEDIUM or FAST that was awesome I could not believe it!!! :-) Sensi was so smart by not putting this option in a hidden menu. Honeywell Engineers and marketing department simply don't know what they are doing. I'm looking forward in seeing how my new Sensi thermostat will perform tonight and I'm sure it won't disappoint. This device looks really great on the wall as well. The Honeywell WI-FI cost me $79 on sale and this Sensi costs more but is TOTALLY worth it!

The only thing I didn't like is that a day before purchasing this device I contacted Sensi tech support and took one entire hour to pick up the phone and someone from the Philippines picked up the phone eventually. This is not acceptable. Other than that I completely recommend this thermostat.

UPDATE: This Emerson Sensi Smart thermostat is definitely a superior product. Only while running it in one day you can see and hear the difference. I set the cycle rate to SLOW and boy what a difference! The thermostat outputs the heat in a very smooth way and when the it reaches the set temperature it stops for several minutes and it DEFINITELY does not restart in 30 seconds like the Honeywell ones. I have no idea what problems others are having that complain saying this thermostat doesn't work but I can tell you that is not the case. The software and hardware is really well made and nice looking as well. I prefer this Sensi to those ugly round looking ""high tech"" and over priced thermostats.",5.0 out of 5 stars
music on vinyl,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2019","Very happy with multiple Sensi wi-fi smart thermostat installations. Well implemented app and easy to follow directions for various types of applications. If you don’t have a “C” wire, it’s relatively easy to add one. You need a 24 volt plug in transformer (about $14 on Prime), and some thermostat wiring. The transformer and 2 wire thermostat wire are independent from your furnace and other thermostat wiring. You just connect one end of the two wires to the transformer, and the other end of the two wires to the correct terminals on the thermostat, and plug the transformer into a traditional electrical outlet. Your existing thermostat wiring just gets transferred to the matching terminal markings on the Sensi. Great flexibility with settings and programming with the user friendly app. Controlling and monitoring your temperature and thermostat from anywhere remotely is very handy. Great way to jump into the smart house scene.

Edit 1/26/2020

I think I may have discovered the reason so many people are having issues with their Sensi installs and the constant Wi-Fi connection problems.
I have four Sensi smart thermostats that I've installed over the course of about a year. The first three installs were very straightforward. Those units have all performed perfectly from the day I installed them. Not a single dropped Internet connection or any other issues. The Sensi mobile app is great, and provides amazing control over programming and controlling the thermostats. I have purchased eight of the Sensi thermostats, but have only installed half of them so far. Most of the units I've purchased have been returns that I've bought for about half price online. Most of them have been registered previously with Sensi. It isn't difficult to have them unregistered through an email request that the app prompts you to do. The two caveats are that you will not have remote access or be able to complete the setup of the thermostat until you are able to register it to your account. The thermostat will still function locally like a traditional thermostat, so that's good. The other problem is that  Emerson / Sensi is painfully slow processing requests to unregister thermostats. Count on at least two weeks. You will have to return to the location of the thermostat to finish registering the unit once Emerson gives you the confirmation they unregistered your thermostat. This is the price of buying a returned unit at half price.
The fourth Sensi install has been difficult. I revisited the Amazon listing for the Sensi thermostats. I was hoping to find some answers to my install problems from some of the reviews on Amazon. I was quite surprised on the number of newer negative reviews. I originally chose the Sensi because of the positive reviews online and on Amazon.
I was having a couple of different issues with the install of my fourth Sensi. Each of my installs were unique as they were for different types of heating and cooling units. Most of my installs were for heat only, including the fourth one. The fourth install was for a Modine warehouse style heater. This required 4 wires. Red heat (Rh), White (W/E), Common (C), and Fan (G). I tested the C (common) with a multi-meter. and I was getting right around 26 volts (correct voltage). Testing is done with the Red lead to Rh and the Black lead to C. The C wire completes the connection and provides constant power to the thermostat to power the Wi-Fi Internet connection. I've seen some comments about not needing a C wire for the Sensi. This may be true, but you will eat through batteries if you rely on them to keep power for the Wi-Fi connection. Technically, you do need a C wire for reliable remote access.
My issues included constant dropping of the Wi-Fi and inconsistent operation of the heater and blower / fan. I did check all of the setup parameters for type of heating unit, etc through the app. Everything was set correctly. The Wi-Fi network that this Sensi is connected to is super stable, and has two other Sensi thermostats that maintain reliable connections through Wi-Fi. The issue with the fan I was having is that unless I switched the setting for fan to ""on"", the heat would not kick on. The correct setting on the thermostat for the fan would be ""auto"". When set to ""on"", the fan stays on even when the unit is not heating. If I set my fan setting for ""auto"", the heater would not kick on.
I was fairly confident I had my wiring correct at both the thermostat and at the transformer on the heater side. It's harder to be certain on the transformer / heater side, because the terminal markings are not consistent from manufacturer to manufacturer. I was lucky enough to find a photo online of the terminal markings and what they represented for my exact Modine unit with the same transformer. I was starting to think that this Sensi unit was defective (like many others do based on negative reviews). I did do some wire swapping, but always ended up back where I started regarding the wiring arrangement. Voltages were all reading accurately at the thermostat. I had the face of the unit on and off from the back plate / wall mount many times. On one occasion, while guiding the thermostat back onto the wall mount, I was applying some upward pressure and heard some electrical clicking at the heater as though it was about to kick on. That was my ""Aha"" moment. The pins that coincide with the thermostat wiring on the main unit / face plate and the related pin openings on the wall mount were not making a good connection. They briefly made a decent connection when I put some increased pressure on the thermostat / face plate. I was able to recreate this heater clicking reaction by pushing on the thermostat. I wasn't certain exactly where the connection was failing (which wire or pin), but I tried a couple of things, and they seemed to have fixed my issues. The first is that I shimmed the back plate away from the wall with a small strip of cardboard behind each end of the back plate and the wall. This would allow the thermostat face plate a little more travel on the wall mount side (deeper seating of the pins). The second thing I did was to go over each thermostat wire where they connect to the back plate / wall mount and reinserted them and made sure that the screws that hold each wire in were very tightly drawn down on each wire. This fixed the fan issue (I was able to set the fan to ""auto"" and have it turn on and off with the heater). This also fixed the Wi-Fi dropping issue. I'm still waiting for Emerson / Sensi to unregister this particular thermostat, and I will revise my review with an update once I have remote access and can confirm these fixes have remained stable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jim Healy,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2024","The reviews conflict as t whether or not this unit requires a ""C"" wire (Common wire). As stated in the product literature, in my installation, a ""C"" wire WAS NOT required.

Installation to replace a previous thermostat was easy; took all of 15 minutes. WiFi access will be helpful in my installation, and it works well with the app. The app is just a remote interface that's identical to the unit face itself.

A couple of days after installation, I got a warning that the temperature of the room was more than 5 degrees above the set temp. The A/C was running, but not keeping up. Traced that to a clogged air filter, but I appreciated the warning message.

Yes, I recommend this unit for price point and function.",5.0 out of 5 stars
M. Yates,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2022","I moved to the East coast last December. We have a six-zone boiler heating system with baseboard heaters throughout 4,200 sq. ft., on three floors (not bragging, just trying to give an idea of the size and complexity of the system). With six old-school manual thermostats spread throughout the house, it was nearly impossible to evenly regulate the heat during the cold winter, so some rooms were very cold and others too warm. I found myself constantly going up and down stairs to monitor temperatures and make sure I wasn't wasting heat or keeping areas too cold that would affect other zones.

My boiler was installed in 2007, so it isn't very old and it's very efficient. However, it's a two-wire system with no C-wire, so the fact that 99.9% of ""smart"" thermostats on the market require a C-wire to operate was very frustrating.

I stumbled across the Emerson ST55 and saw in the description that it could work either with or without a C-wire, so I called Emerson tech support to make sure before I plunked down hundreds of dollars on six thermostats that might not work. Tech support confirmed my fears that it would not work without a C-wire despite the Amazon description, so I kept hunting.

Fortunately I found a YouTube review of the ST55 and the owner said he had been successfully using it with the same kind of two-wire system that I have for over two years. So I figured I'd buy one and see if it worked. Worst case, I'd send it back for a refund.

The instructions inside the box clearly state that it will not work without a C-wire, but I ignored them and kept going. With only two wires it was a breeze to install. I put in the batteries, snapped it into the wall plate, downloaded the app, created an account and was ready for testing in about 15 minutes.

I'm not sure if it's just my system or all boilers, but I didn't realize it doesn't turn on instantly when the thermostat temperature is raised above the existing temperature. So when I first tested it, I was bummed that it didn't work. But as I walked downstairs to the boiler, it was running! So I did some more testing, and found that there's about a 20-25 second delay between increasing the temp and the boiler kicking in.

Granted it's only been a couple months since I got it, but I've played with it plenty and it's working great. Instead of a C-wire, the thermostat is powered by two AA batteries. The guy in the video said he's been using the same regular alkaline batteries for two years and they're still at 90% charge capacity, which is awesome. But I figure that even if I have to replace batteries every year, 12 AA batteries is a helluva lot cheaper than paying an electrician to rewire all six zones!

On top of the six heat zones, I also have two central AC units. Thankfully those have C-wires, but I'm going to replace those thermostats with the Emerson ST55 also so that I'll have full control of all heating and cooling from one simple-to-use app. With any luck it'll go on sale on Prime Day so that I can save some money! :-)

I can't speak to the Alexa integration as I don't use that functionality. But plenty of other reviewers have said it works fine.

I appreciate Emerson's thoughtfulness in adding a built-in level to the back plate. I'm a stickler about things being mounted straight, so it was nice to not have to break out a level to make sure I didn't mount it crooked.

As for aesthetics, the ST55 is nice. It's not too large to look obnoxious, but it has a good-sized display. And I'm not sure if it's just because I'm running it on battery, but the back light doesn't stay on constantly, so it doesn't light up a dark room at night (not too important in common areas, but important if you've got a thermostat in a bedroom).

So, to make a long story short, don't believe Emerson. This thing really does work on a two-wire boiler heat system with no need for a C-wire!",5.0 out of 5 stars
James W.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2020","(Long, but I hope worth the read) Overall, I am extremely happy with the Emerson Sensi smart thermostat. For me it was a pretty easy project, but it is important that you know what type of cooling/heating system you have prior to attempting the installation. Although the basic installation is made very simple using the Sensi app, there were some very important things not covered. I suggest you check out how to configure your Sensi on their site (Configuring Thermostat | Sensi US (emerson.com)). I’m a pretty good DIYer, but have very little experience with AC/heating systems. I was 99% sure I had a heat pump setup, but I called a local AC technician I know to confirm and am glad I did. Having installed a few smart thermostats, to include this one, he not only confirmed I had a heat pump, he also informed me I would have to go into the system settings on the thermostat and change the outside setting from ‘AC1’ to ‘HP1’. This was confirmed when I checked out the Sensi website. Armed with this information, installation went without a hitch and I was up and running in no time.
Pros:
- Easy to install, if you have a little DIY experience, all the information needed concerning your AC/Heating system and gather the additional information before starting.
- Very easy to connect to WiFi and integrate with Google Home. Connected to my WiFi with in seconds following the instructions; when I opened my Google Home app, there was an icon to add Sensi, clicked on it and moved the thermostat to the appropriate room. I have not experienced any drop-offs or loss of the WiFi, even when I turned off my WiFi for a few hours, removed the batters or installed old, weak batteries as tests; in every case, the thermostat remained connected or automatically connected right back up in seconds with no need to go through the WiFi setup operations again.
- The Sensi app, in addition to walking you through the installation, allows you to set up various cooling/heating programs to run automatically, as well as change other settings. Once added to Google Home, you can switch programs (cool, heat, auto), turn it on/off and set the temp. You can also use voice commands through Google to do this as well.
- The ability to adjust the thermostat to compensate for temperature offsets. In my case, where my thermostat is located the temp registers about 3 degrees off from what it is in our master bedroom or living room. I simply adjusted the offset in the Sensi app to compensate for this and now our bedroom and living room remain closer to the set temp then they have in the past.
- It can be operated manually by those less tech savvy. The controls on the face plate look and operate like those on our old ‘conventional’ one. I also like that you can lock out the manual operation from the app so that no one else can mess with the settings; like during the holidays when you have family members over who feel they can change the settings without asking .. lol.
- Being able to adjust the system cycling rates. There are three settings (short, medium, and long) that can be set independently for heat, heat aux and cooling. I don’t mind having my temps vary a degree before the system cycles back on, so I have all mine set to long; during the summer, I may switch cooling to short to see how much of a difference it makes.

Con: I only have one and it is the reason for my 4 rating. The instructions, at least those in the box, should include information on the additional settings that may need to be needed depending on the AC/heating system you have. At a minimum, they should inform you that you may need to make additional setting changes and where to find the instructions online.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Richard,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2018","Purchased this model based on the good reviews and the no requirement for a c-wire. Decided to replace my 17-year old RobertShaw thermostat (t-stat) because I wanted remote capability. I was hesitant to touch A/C wiring whereas I had no experience with A/C wiring. The A/C company wanted $90.00 to install it, but I decided to do it myself since it was just a 4-wire system. (no c-wire). It took me just 15 min to remove the old, and then install/wire up the new t-stat. That's how easy it was. Was able connect the t-stat to my 2Ghz wifi network and used the Sensi app on my mobile. Everything worked just fine. No issues at all with wifi setup and using the app. It works exactly as designed.
You can make t-stats adjustments either by wifi or LTE on your mobile. No delay in signal. My wifi has never lost signal and has stayed up now for 1 week.

The t-stat itself (on wall) has very few settings. Just has temp control, fan/auto/heat/cool and wifi settings. All other settings are done via your mobile. There is also a light switch at the top of the t-stat that when pressed, stays on for 10 seconds, then turns off. BTW: The t-stat light is always off until you press any button. LCD screen is very easy to read with or without the light.

One of my requirements for a t-stat was to have a differential as to how much longer a unit will run once it hits its set temp. This model does not have a adjustable value, but does have a ""cycle rate"" of slow/medium/fast. I set mine to slow to keep it from turning on/off too many times. From the measurements I have taken with a infrared thermometer, the ""slow"" cycle has a differential of 0.7 degrees. This seems to be inline with what Emerson says (actually, they say within 1 degree).

Important note: If your home loses internet access, you will NOT be able to control the t-stat, even when you are at home on your local intranet. Some systems still let you access your devices via the local intranet, but this t-stat require cloud access 24x7.
Now, in case your t-stat screen is locked, and you lose internet connection, you have no way to do any changes on the wall unit since the screen is locked and your mobile is the only way to unlock it. In this case, Emerson has a key sequence you can press on the wall unit to unlock the display. (btw: the screen lock is a feature that you enable on the t-stat to prevent people from making changes on the wall unit)

Small issues:
The light switch at the top of the t-stat is hard to find and press. I never hit it on the first attempt. Always have to feel around at the top and press hard.

There is one problem I constantly hit. I goto my Sensi app and change any setting (temp, lock/unlock screen). The Sensi app accepts the setting changes, so you think all is good. However, when I look at the t-stat on the wall, no changes occurred (see attached picture). This has happened numerous times each day since I have had it. Called support and they are not aware of any issues. In each failure, my wifi signal is up - no problems with wifi.
After a few days of this happening, I see the problem. It does not appear to be the t-stat, but rather the Sensi app itself. It somehow is hung up, but gives the appearance that it is operating. If I kill the app, and restart it, the sync up to the t-stat is working again. Each time that the app behaves this way, I just kill and restart it. Works every time. So, each time I use the app to make a setting change, i just kill the app and restart when I need it.

The accuracy of the t-stat is pretty accurate (within 0.5 degrees of my infrared thermometer)

Overall, love the product. I can easily control my t-stats from my mobile or directly from the wall. Makes life very easy now. BTW: Works great with Google Assistant. I use my Android phone to adjust temperature settings (i.e. Hey Google: Set the temperature to 70 degrees"")

Update: 12/10/18:
Product has worked flawlessly. No issues at all with wifi connectivity. Never had a dropped connection. Both wifi and 4G LTE connections always connect just fine. When making thermostat changes on your cell phone (wifi or 4G LTE), changes take effect within a couple seconds. Also, the problem mentioned above regarding the app freezing when your cell gets out of sleep mode, this has been fixed a while ago in an updated Sensi app. All around, everything works great. Love this product - makes it very convenient to remotely control your AC.

Update: 3/1/2020
Everything has worked flawless. Still have original Energizer AA batteries (full bars). Never had any LTE/Wifi connectivity issues.

Update: 4/2/2021: Not a single problem. Works flawlessly.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jim & Renae,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2019","We wanted a new thermostat for several reasons. The old Honeywell was working fine but it had several deficiencies. First, it was too easy for our grandson to change the settings. And the display was hard to read unless you stooped right in front of it. And the programming was a nuisance.

Searching for a thermostat with screen lockout we discovered that none of the good ole Honeywell residential thermostats have this feature. So we moved-on to almost-as-good - almost-as-old Emerson which has this feature on most of their residential products. Out utility company offers a $25 rebate on programmable thermostats and a $100 rebate on WiFi thermostats. With a Prime Day price of $75 this thermostat is basically free. However we were concerned by all the complaints about setup and network problems. So here is what we found.

The good -

1) Excellent manual controls and screen visibility, copied from the refined design of the legacy Emerson line. Most other WiFi thermostats have too much screen clutter in the attempt to eliminate buttons. Old-fashioned buttons really are better for the most common functions even if they don't look stylish.

2) You can control almost anything you want from your smart phone - after you complete setup.

3) You can configure this thermostat to work with almost any kind of HVAC system.

4) You have plenty of flexibility to create multiple programs with as many or as few schedule steps as you wish. For example you can have separate schedules for when you are home, when you are gone temporarily, when you are gone for months at a time. Some reviewers have complained about the difficulty of programming your schedule. Maybe Sensi have improved the app, but I found it reasonably easy to program, given the flexibility.

The bad -

1) The WiFi setup is very finicky. Were I not an engineer with many years of experience with communications equipment I might well have floundered. Common security features in WiFi routers can defeat your efforts. I would note that I recently installed a smart sprinkler controller that is completely programmed from my smart phone and has full remote access capability. WiFi setup was a breeze. I did not have to touch my WiFi router configuration at all. Sensi could do a lot better.

2) The manuals. Yes Sensi, some people do read manuals. Once you get past the simpleton stuff yours are rather poor. ""See the App"" (which has limited help on some topics) is not a good answer. Things like a list of the menu options and what they do - would be very helpful. The other Emerson thermostats have good manuals - so should yours.

3) Don't bother to call Sensi tech support. You will spend a lot of time on-hold and you might never actually talk to a human. And the support web site was almost as slow. The information is there but you have to be a pro to understand the more detailed stuff. Sensi needs to beef-up their tech support and/or produce a good tutorial on how to connect to a WiFi network. And if they had to write a good tutorial, they might improve their software to make things easier for their customers.

4) I found it necessary to change almost every default setting. Many of the complaints about the performance of this thermostat, arise from not bothering to check every last setting in the app. Better defaults would result in fewer complaints. This problem is confounded by lack of a list of menus and options in the user manuals. If you do not browse carefully through the app, you might miss the setting that you find most annoying.

5) You can control virtually everything else but not the fan schedule. A simple ""Fan On or Auto"" check box in each schedule step would be great.

The gory details -

If you have read this far, you might want to benefit from some of my experience setting-up this device for my network.

1) First let me explain my network setup. Basically my network has a less-trusted domain and a more-trusted domain. In the less-trusted domain sit my smart TVs, Game controllers, a laser printer that anyone can use, VoIP and media gateways, smart home sprinkler and thermostat controllers, etc. In the more-trusted domain sit my server, laptops, a color laser printer, and a very few other devices.

2) Between my cable modem and my less-trusted domain sits a simple but bullet-proof Ubiquity firewall router/switch. Hanging-off the Ubiquity switch in the less-trusted domain, are a VoIP gateway, a WiFi router/switch, a printer and a guest Ethernet port.

3) The WiFi router/switch serves as a second firewall between the less-trusted and the more-trusted domains. The WiFi hub has both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz channels, with separate private and guest access, for a total of 4 SSIDs. The router steers the guest SSIDs to the less-trusted domain and the private SSIDs to the more-trusted domain. The private and guest SSIDs have different WiFi access codes (passwords) so both domains are ""secure"" (in the WiFi sense).

4) By default the guest WiFi clients cannot see each other on the less-trusted domain. This is a common security feature in WiFi routers that support guest access. And it is one of the features that trips-up installation of the Sensi thermostat, but not my smart sprinkler controller.

5) Observing the network interaction between the Sensi app on my smart phone, the Sensi thermostat on the wall, and my WiFi router, at some times the app and the thermostat are operating point-to-point over the WiFi and sometime via the router. So-far so-good. This is expected behavior. However some of the router traffic uses LAN (Layer 2) addresses and some uses IP (Layer 3) addresses. This mixture can mess things up if the network is not configured exactly as the Sensi software developers expected.

6) Sensi should test with other common network configurations. As I mentioned my brand X sprinkler controller does not suffer from these peculiarities. If Sensi invested more money on software engineering and testing with different network configurations they could save a bundle on support costs and customer returns.

My recommendations -

1) Configure your smart phone to use the same WiFi SSID that you want to use for your Sensi thermostat.

2) Be sure this SSID is only available for 2.4 GHz.

3) Go through your router settings to ensure that every WiFi client of this SSID has unrestricted (LAN as well as IP) access to every other client of this SSID.

4) Run the Sensi app through the complete installation and registration process.

5) After everything is working you can restore your normal network configuration in your router and smart phone. Do not change the SSID for the thermostat.

6) If you need to change the SSID for the thermostat later, go back to start. Reset your thermostat and reconfigure your network. Rinse thoroughly and repeat as often as necessary.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jennie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024","Could only connect wifi once. Got a new wifi router for home and tried to set Sensi thermostat using the sames steps as I did before. However, this time around, the Sensi app would not go to next screen once my phone connected to Sensi's wifi. Did many of the troubleshooting steps as researched (instatlled brand new battery for thermostat, ""rebooted"" thermostat, restarted phone, changed phone's wifi settings, etc.) but to no avail. Now, the thermostat is now just a dumb thermo. Had good potential. If app issue gets fixed, this would be a 5 star.

UPDATE: I was able to reconnect the Sensi thermostat. In my original negative post, I tried reconnecting to new home wifi using a different account email address and a different phone. I eventually discovered that if I log in with the app on the original set-up phone and email address, the app would work. Only thing I would have liked is if Sensi would put a warning to use original email address for account login and phone. I recently read this as a potential fix in one of the Amazon's reviews (I hadn't seen this fix in my earlier research). With the app now working and me being able to check on the temperature setting remotely, this thermostat is an easy 5 stars. The additional options in the app such as setting offsets, cycle rates, a/c protection, et. are just great! I have no c-wire so I use a battery, but it is also great that Sensi provides on their website how to wire for a c-wire (without c-wire adapter) by using a jumper but they provide how to install a c-wire adapter so this thermostat give folks few options. I have central a/c and propane gas heater with no c-wire and the Sensi works for my configuration. I will eventually try to wire using a jumper to set-up a ""mock"" c-wire.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Our Lennox system is quite old & only 4 of 8 wires matched the Sensi unit. We called tech support & spoke with Rose who was fantastic. We emailed a pic of our setup to her. She asked that we hold for approx 5-7min. We had to take the panel off of the air handler to look for additional wiring, which didn’t help much. After we clarified that the black wire on our Lennox thermostat was labeled R, not B, Rose was able to confirm what our new wiring arrangement should be. She also helped us reprogram our Sensi thermostat for the new wiring configuration. At that point, the rest was a piece of cake. We were very impressed with the level of knowledge & support provided.

One issue I had: the thermometer reports a room temperature that's 2 degrees below the actual temperature (as measured against multiple other digital and mercury thermometers). The settings allows you to create an offset for the reported room temp, however, so I offset it by 2 degrees and it works fine. But that shouldn't be necessary.

Brewer W Leggett,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2024","Many 2.4 Ghz devices are network picky, especially initial setup. Personally 25 years plus network engineering, conventional networks to broadband to wifi to mesh- no worries.

First in dumb mode the thermostat works quite nicely, wifi setup - not so much. The mini-setup guide is not very informative and no trouble shooting recommendations. Called tech support around 1:45 pm EDT and waited 49 minutes to recorded tips, no one answered. Customer support SHOULD publish hours phones are manned and SHOULD have a call back feature added to their customer service number. My HVAC home contractor uses one and he only covers two counties.

There were help/tips available on several parts of the vendors website, but you had to be diligent when looking. Bottom line, I performed all available troubleshooting steps with no success in connecting to SENSI XXXXX network. Ran setup process fron Sensi app more than 30 times over three hours without success.

Dave,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2024","I like the style of the thermostat, and how it looks on the wall. It works really well here in the Southeast Texas humid climate by displaying the humidity on the screen along with the temperature. The Sensi app is easy and straightforward. Whenever the humidity drops below a preset level, I am alerted and can remotely turn on my system. Additionally, you can lock out the front controls and only control the system from the app, which is useful when kids turn the temp all the way down. For the temperature range, this can be set to prevent someone from turning the A/C below a certain point or the heat up to the maximum. For the price, I would definitely recommend this thermostat.

It can also integrate with Alexa and other home automation apps.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I just need something that can be easily programmed, and it is nice that I can adjust it from my phone if necessary. This one fits the bill. It does monitor humidity as well as temperature, and is so easy to use.

Jose & Marcia,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024","We had issues installing our Sensi overseas. We have had to call and wait for Sensi Emerson support. We got lucky during 1st set of 4 Sensi Emerson devices. Got through and support overrode zip code issue. But we found one device was defective... So, we bought another Sensi and same problem with setup in same overseas location.

Here's my letter to Sensi.

Hello Sensi Support, We have purchased and installed at least 10 Emerson Sensi Model# ST55 in my various properties. The installation in USA is easy. But the overseas or international is difficult. Due to needing a specific zip code / location, we have been forced to call Sensi technical support number.

Sensi Emerson Support

Unfortunately, this requires a long distance phone call where we must hold on the phone line until someone actually responds.  There is no way to leave a message.

We recently purchased 4 Sensi devices.  The devices were setup with nice Sensi Emerson support. The Sensi support person was able to override Sensi's zipcode limitation for the Las Terrenas in Dominican Republic. The allocated zip code is 32000.

Unfortunately, one device was defective immediately and never could sync temperature of room. It was way off.  So, we bought a replacement Sensi. Now, we need help again to set up the 4th Sensi device.

My requests are as follows:
(1) Can the zip code 32000 be made permanent in Sensi system?
(2) Can someone call or email me back from technical support / setup support?
(3) Am I able to get a refund on my defective Sensi?

Note that I have championed your Sensi Emerson product to others. I have continued to do so regardless if my recent setback. But, I would like some help for my issue. 

I would prefer to give 5 stars!

AliThom,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2023","I had a digital, but not smart, thermostat for my old oil furnace. I took a gamble and decided to buy this and hope I had the C-wire I needed.

When I got this thermostat and tried to install it, I ran into some snags. I had the extra wire that I could use as a C-wire coming out the hole where the thermostat would go, but because I had two wires twisted together in my basement, it didn't go all the way to the furnace. I went out, got a new thermostat wire, got that all threaded through the wall and around my beams in the basement...only to discover that my furnace did not have the ""C"" terminal to connect to.

At this point I called customer service and they were helpful. They told me I would need an external adapter, and I got this one: https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07L4DN5R2?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details

While I waited for that to arrive, I had to put my old thermostat back on. When the adapter came, I was able to pull it through the wall so I could plug it in the basement. I connected the positive wire (striped) to the C and the negative to the RC terminals in the thermostat, and the old wires matching where they were before. I also had to snip the jump wire on the faceplate as instructed by the customer service person. That all worked great! As soon as I set my desired temperature, my furnace started right up.

Connecting to the Wifi, I got two failed attempt messages, but I just kept hitting ""try again."" On the third try, it connected. So I would just say keep trying!

I found the app pretty intuitive.

The only thing I would have liked is a step-by-step manual, printed. All the instructions are in the app and one of the steps, you were supposed to click which wires your old thermostat had. If you didn't select ""C"" you can't continue. I would have liked to look ahead a little bit and know all the steps before I started, then just review them as I went.

I like this one because it DOES have physical push buttons on the thermostat, so if you want guests to be able to adjust it, they can do so without the app. But the app control lets me do it easily and check on things when I am away from home. I also like how the temperature numbers are really big, and it displays both the current temp AND what it is set to, in addition to the time. The app also tells you the humidity level!

In the app you can set a schedule, adjust the temperature manually, or even use a geofencing option that automatically turns the heat down 3 degrees when you are not home (based on location of your phone). It will also alert you (if you want) to possible problems with your HVAC system based on extreme highs/lows. You can also see what the current temp is, both inside your house AND the outside temp in your city, and whether or not your furnace is currently running. This was critical for me as I have an old furnace that sometimes wimps out, and I wanted to be able to check the temp when I am away from home for extended periods in case there is an issue.

There is also a ""usage"" tracker but that shows daily data and I'm still on day 1 so I don't have data to display.

All in all, while I had some frustration with the set-up due to having to wait extra for the adapter wire, it was worth it!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Lari Anne Mazzitello,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2023","This is a must buy!! This was super easy to install!!

Note: I think you are supposed to set up the app FIRST and THEN install the device!! But it worked just fine. I think it would have walked you thru the installation if we set up the app before installing the device.

We removed the old thermostat’s cover plate then held up this thermostat w/o the cover plate. Then we took a quick pic of the old thermostat’s wiring with this thermostat’s inner panel. We removed the wiring in the order of this thermostat’s wiring diagram, too to bottom and removed the old plate. When we slipped this thermostat over the wires, they were all aligned an in order. Easy peasy to insert each one in order, top to bottom or bottom to top. Press down the wires, pop on the cover plate.

Then we had to download the app, Sensi, and go thru the process to create a profile, select the wires inside our thermostat, and then zip thru the set up.

So later, we were messing around with the app, setting up the schedules for when to cool/heat and at what temperatures to change and when. The app interface was SO VERY EASY!! It allows you to copy previous schedules or to create new based on existing schedules. It was really intuitive how to schedules and click thru everything. You can set schedules for when you only have heat on. And you can set schedules for when you only have the A/C on. AND you can set other schedules for when you have it on auto and it switches between heat and cool.

Additionally, you can set any type of schedule combo for the week. So if you work from home, set a 7 day schedule. If you work M-F, set a 5 day schedule and weekend schedule. If you work 4-10s, easily set one schedule for your work week and a second for your 3-day weekend! Best yet! If you are a fireman or nurse and work a couple days on and a few days off , set up a schedule or two, call one long week and one short week or call it MTFSa/WThSu to show which days you are at work/home. I have never had one where I could schedule each day independently and was so easy to make multiple schedules. I can create one schedule for the days I work/am home, and then create a copy of that and just swap the days that I’m at work/home without having to schedule each and every day all over again. This is the easiest interface EVER!! ( I know my explanation doesn’t do it justice, but it is nice. I’m about to schedule another one for when I work nights. Then I just toggle between them at work if I find out I need to pull a double shift

Spamazon,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2024","Pros:
Easy to set up and install, had this up and running in 10 mins including wi-fi connect. Follow the instructions by down loading the app first and go through the steps. Shut your furnace off at your breaker box otherwise you will blow a fuse and need to replace it in the furnace. I do not use Apple Home Kit but you can if you want as part of the set up. Pretty basic cheap thermostat. Looks good, flat, snug against wall, secure, does not protrude like others. Only about 1” from wall. Back lit auto off after about 15 seconds. Light button on top to turn on manually. Blends in with wall (neutral or white) pretty good. Back plate is optional for $7. You probably don’t need it with this one. App is easy to use, simple, vanilla.
Cons:
Temp buttons (up / down arrows) are not soft quiet click / touch. They are a little too loud, like a really cheap on off wall switch. Wish they had used soft touch and not loud “snap or click” when you press the arrows. There is no way to set the thermostat to “Auto” temp mode except through the app only. No touch screen on this model, just keep in mind for less than $95 what you are getting, a glorified cheap piece of plastic made in China that requires a California Prop 65 cancer label warning and that has pretty basic vanilla functions and aesthics. No comparason to the Google Nest Learning model or the Ecobee 4 premium model. With this one you are getting what you pay for. There is no justification for griping and complaining. Can’t say I didn’t warn you. No frills, no bells and whistles. Just a vanilla thermostat that works and looks pretty good on the wall.",4.0 out of 5 stars

zarchitect,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2019","I research everything (probably over-extensively) before I buy - especially a gadget. I know I wanted more control over temperature (in and out of the house) - that was primary without spending a 2nd mortgage to set a temperature.

At the end, it came down to the hockey-puck or this one (hockey-puck being the ubiquitous Nest). EcoBee and Honeywell also had ones and looked compelling - each one with features that were eyebrow raising. But at the end, I just needed a way to keep tabs of the temperature while away. I didn't need a weather report (my phone does that), a high-rez touch screen (it's a thermostat - not a TV), nor for it to be so smart that it turns into HAL (Space Odyssey reference in case you needed to know). All the competitors did that and more - the hockey puck apparently the worst of the bunch as to stalking you to see how many breaths you put out to offset it by .004 degrees (or something like that). AND - in an age where we're now monitored 24/7 by Alexa, Google, Siri and the smart toaster and microwave - listening to our every word so they can sell our every secrets and desires to evil marketers for a billion dollars so they could target spam us when we're the most vulnerable and end up with 55 gallons of ice cream, a Euro-massager, and a pet iguana at 3am on a Wednesday hand delivered by a chippery Amazon Prime delivery guy in a rented U-Haul van stuffed to the gill with the hopes and nightmares of other unsuspecting souls.

Anyway - privacy was a concern so I really didn't want Alexa or anything with a microphone. If I really wanted to talk to a wall, I'll go to the mirror and start singing - at least I have an audience of one that way... If our house has a microphone embedded in everything and we start blurting out commands indiscriminately to meet our over-entitled needs like bi-polar lunatics - when will it stop? We'll end up vegetables sitting on the couch not lifting a finger eating our 55 gallons of ice cream... AHA! I knew it!

I digress - it's a thermostat. I don't have a consistent schedule so I can't have it create one magically - it can't read my mind... yet. And some days I like it cooler than others - what then? Will I have a verbal fight with the hockey puck? It would win - it's too smart for me!

So I needed something that was a step up from the ol' knob and tube dial form the days of Kojak and have the ability to see / control this thing from 2000 miles away as I worry that I left something on (Bonus - I can make the other house-occupants suffer remotely if they do me wrong). I can also check on whether they set the temperature down to -50 thinking that it'll it cool off faster and they leave the house / windows open. Maybe I do need a yelling hockey puck...

Oh - Emerson. In the past Emerson was known as the bane of the electronics world - breaking down on day 91 on a 90-day warranty gadget. The epitome of planned-obsolescence! I'm giving it another chance - maybe they grey up a little. If I see polar bears roaming my living room eating my ice scream when I come home, I won't be happy - stay tuned on that...

Oh - before I go - also needed it to be dumb enough that if something failed (because it always does at the most inopportune time) - it won't freak out. AKA - some of the devices needed a 24/7 WiFi connection Why does one gadget need to depend on another for survival? So if my WiFi goes out then I die of heatstroke?

For all you readers out there - buy it for what you want to get out of it but don't be sold on things that truly don't matter in your daily lives for at the end of the day, it's just a thermostat - not a hyper-augmented inner core balancing module.",4.0 out of 5 stars

DNA,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2020","I am so happy I bought this. I got a new AC and I wanted something more hi tech than the thermostat that it came with. I also didn’t want to spend $200 on a Nest. I just wanted something simple that was programmable but also worked with Alexa. This is it! I actually did my research and found this was better than the equivalent Honeywell thermostat.
1. If you have both central air/Heat you do not need a C-wire. I live in a condo and they were having problems with the c-wire so I told them to just install it without it, and it still works perfectly. It does have AA batteries that I will have to change eventually but that’s fine.
2. I love that it works with Alexa. I like it colder at night so I set up a routine, I tell Alexa “Good Night” and she shuts off my lights and turns the air down to my desired temp.
3. This thing has GeoFencing! I thought I would need to program it for weekdays but this is even better. Every time I take my phone 3 miles away, it automatically raises the temp 3 degrees and then lowers it again when I’m back within a 3 mile range. So if I’m just walking my dog or running an errand in the neighborhood it won’t adjust unnecessarily and only does it when I’m gone for longer periods.
4. Also has programmable schedules for those who choose this. I just use Alexa and Geofencing so I don’t even have to use this feature.
5. I think it’s prettier than the Honeywell and the Nest. I like that it’s white and has a white glow on the screen so it looks better on the wall. The Honeywell has a green light apparently.
6. Optional Humidity control. You can set it to a certain humidity percentage and it will overcool a couple of degrees to reach your humidity level. I loved this at first but it didn’t work for me because it was doing it even when I was away and I would rather it just keep the temperature that I wanted instead. But this is a great feature if that is important to you.
7. 100% control with the Sensi app. I can adjust my temp from my bed, from work, from my car, while on vacation . It’s amazing. I honestly have not even had to touch the actual thermostat since it was installed. And the fact that you can have Alexa control it and tell you the temp inside and outside is awesome.
8. All of these features are optional. You can turn them on and off in the app and cater the system to your family’s needs. Oh and do you have kids or a pesky family member that keeps changing the temp? You can actually lock the buttons on the actual unit from the app and use only the app.

This does not have room sensors and it will not learn your schedule or figure out what room you are in or anything like the Nest or other thermostats do. But if you are like me and live in a small space then those features aren’t necessary and with the Geofencing, even if my schedule fluctuates, it will still only adjust if I’m 3 miles away no matter what my schedule is.

Overall I say this is so worth the price. I should have bought this a long time ago. I am very happy at the moment but I will come back and update the review if anything changes.",5.0 out of 5 stars

S. Hoffman,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2024","There are many smart thermostats available these days with decent reviews. I looked at several and sifted through those reviews.
The reason I chose the Sensi thermostat is because it blended familiar old style buttons and display screen with new high tech smart thermostat capabilities. We have a vacation home that outside temperatures can vary from 5 degrees during the winter to 95 degrees during the summer. We have had the Sensi thermostat installed for over a year and adjust the temperature prior to our arrival and can monitor the indoor temperature of the house from 200 miles away via wifi.
It has worked flawlessly and decided to install an additional one in our primary residence this year. Highly recommended!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Rolo,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2024","It looks solid, attractive, good quality, and it met my expectations. It connected smoothly and quickly to my WiFi network. In my case, I only replaced my previous traditional thermostat, so I didn't need to read the directions or any external advice with connections. The device comes with the initials of the colors of the wires though. I think taking a photo of the previous connections is a good practice before unplugging the cables from the old device. I've been using the thermostat for about three weeks now and it always connects immediately from wherever I am.",5.0 out of 5 stars
MD and AZ,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2022","I have two Sensi thermostats, one for our primary home in MD and one for a second home in AZ. Our HVAC in AZ is conventional forced air system, so the set up was straightforward and pretty seamless - it took a few tries to get it to connect to Wi-Fi but once it finally took we were good to go. Fortified by my success I charged ahead with installing one at the MD house, which was built in 1928 and has two separate systems - the original hot water radiators for heat and a separate forced air AC system. Again the set up was straightforward - I followed the prompts on the app and still had to try several times to get it to connect to Wi-Fi but eventually it did and all seemed well. One aspect of the set up that was fraught with peril was that the set up prompts directed me cut the built in C wire on the Sensi. This seemed a very final move so before I did it I did some googling to try to educate myself on what the C wire is for and essentially determined that because I have two totally separate systems that don’t talk to each other, I don’t need a C wire. So I cut the wire and all seemed operational.

When I turned the heat on I noticed that I didn’t hear the characteristic whistle of the radiators getting going and that the boiler was not kicking on. I then discovered that the forced air was blowing, even though the thermostat was in “heat” mode. Then, when I put it in “cool” mode and cranked up the setting, the furnace would kick on. In a slight panic I reviewed the photo I took of my old thermostat wiring and saw that it was the same configuration as what the Sensi app had walked me through, so I knew that wasn’t the issue. Based on the negative reviews I had read, I didn’t have much hope that the Sensi help page would actually be helpful, but I found an FAQ along the lines of “ why isn’t my heat turning on”. It suggested that I needed to configure my thermostat to talk to my system, and walked me through changing the default settings on the thermostat itself to work with my specific system configuration. And - success!!! The heat kicked on in “heat” mode and the AC kicked on in “cool” mode and it was squared away.

So my main takeaways are that you have to stick with it and perhaps do some troubleshooting, but this is good affordable smart thermostat solution. I really like that it looks like a regular thermostat, meaning minimal wall patching of the area around it, and the app seems to work well and be pretty intuitive. And - MD gave me a $75 rebate so it was even cheaper (incomprehensibly AZ does not offer a rebate.)

So - I recommend!",4.0 out of 5 stars

Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2023","Wanted to upgrade the thermostat unit but my wiring didn't include the c-wire which removes many other options from the table. Luckily the ST55 doesn't require it (and instead uses batteries). The ST55 is actually Emerson's lower tier smart thermostat, and doesn't have a lot of the bells and whistles of their higher end units. The design is also much more traditional, as opposed to the higher end units, which basically are entirely screen, no buttons. But I like having the buttons and didn't neccessarily want to mount somthing that looked like a smart phone on the wall.

The installation was very straight forward and the included bubble level made mounting it horizontally level quite easy. The app guides you through install and as long as you know what your wires are, you shouldn't have any problem.

Using it is very straight foward. Basic functionality is all supported like setting a temperature and setting a schedule. If you generally just want to do the most basic of tasks then this thermostat will definitely suffice. The information is all displayed on the screen. The screen displays both time and humidity, but alternates it - so if you want to know the humidity and it currently displays time, just wait a few second and it will switch. The associated application is also pretty useful and lets you see and control the unit from your smart phone. If you register an account you also can get notifications - for example, when the humidity is above 70% you'll get an email (at which point you can turn on the dehumidifier or AC). I personally haven't had any issues with it after a few months of use, so as far as I can tell, this unit is completely reliable - it does what I need it to do, no more and no less.

The higher end models will also obviously have all the same functionality along with even more advanced functionality I'm guessing, but if you don't really want something super fancy and like the traditional appearence of this unit, then this will be more than adaquate. Also if you don't have the C-wire then you simply won't have too many options anyway. If however you really want even more smart features and want something more futuristic, then well a higher-end model might suit you more.",5.0 out of 5 stars
DH,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2024","Would have been a nice unit but I need to return it. All of my Wi-Fi access points in my house are set up for WPA3 only, as even WPA2/3 transitional is not secure. Rufus AI generated answer incorrectly said this product supports WPA3, which it absolutely does not. Tried on a temporary WPA2 network and it connected right away. Then I did my usual ""will this work with the Internet down"", and the answer is a hard no, I could not even do a basic set temperature change with the Internet down. Strike two. Third strike is that the compatibility of this item with Home Assistant is pretty poor. There is a GitHub integration out there, but again it's not local control, it goes out to the Emerson / Copeland servers to execute commands. Strike three.

One pro for this item, though, is they did have phone support that helped talk through the wiring setup for this for my ancient geothermal heat pump. Rather DIY friendly, all things considered.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Korryn,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024","Works great. Easy to install myself following a YouTube video. Setting up to wifi was simplified as well. The programming works great and no issues with anything really, except the batteries it came with. The batteries lasted less than a year (10 months) and no longer worked even when the batteries showed 4 bars on the display. When this happens, you can no longer control the thermostat from the app or it goes offline and the wifi signal disappears or stops displaying on the top left corner of the screen.

I still recommend this thermostat and will try out other batteries, even though the Energizer batteries it came with are typically good batteries.

Tasty Bits,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2020","I own two of these units. One in a Commercial setting and one Residential. Overall decent product but it may not be the easiest install if you don’t prepare.

Pro: app is very informative, very configurable and granular.

Con: Temperature spread not configurable. Unit seems to be confused for the first 12 hrs after install or if you change the primary configuration with lots of short cycling of the system. Needs to just sit in an off or not actively heating/cooling for several hours prior to use.

Everything is setup to be user friendly. No physical manuals, install the phone app and it should walk you through everything step by step. 2.4ghz WiFi network support only. Problems arise if your system doesn’t have a Common (C or Blue) wire or if your system is wired in an unexpected manner. My Commercial system was connected using colors that the app configurator deemed “Invalid” yet clearly it worked with the old thermostat. I am not and HVAC tech but using the service manual for the old thermostat I reverse engineered what each wire was for and hooked up the Sensei appropriately.

Other manufacturers let you adjust the temperature spread in the advanced settings to limit and control short cycling of the system and adjust when it comes on usually by configuring a % or specific # of degrees. Emerson uses a generic approach called the “Cycle Rate” with 3 possible settings of Slow, Medium or Fast. Slow supposedly allowing the widest spread in temperature. In my experience this is all of a 1 degree spread but it looks and feels to be a 0 degree spread as the system will come on when the display and target temps match.

The advanced settings are not part of the initial app based setup. You need to download the real user manual to understand and modify the advanced settings as needed to match your system.

Prior to changing your thermostat out, it is best to document your equipment as best as you can and/or dig into the advanced menu of your existing thermostat if digital and document the settings there. It makes a difference of you have single or dual stage Cooling or heat, heat pump, reversing valve power orientation and backup electrical heat. You will need to configure all of that in the new thermostat.

One key step during install is turning on the WiFi network on the thermostat, disconnecting your phone from your regular WiFi and connecting to the thermostat to perform the config, then moving your phone or device back to the regular network to complete the configuration and testing. Also be aware that if your unit cannot connect to the WiFi you want or that it disconnects/drops a lot you are either trying to connect to a 5ghz network or the 2.4Ghz network is saturated with other nearby networks causing a weak signal or your WiFi router is too far away from the thermostat.

One last tip, many WiFi routers from internet providers or stores tout that they provide 2.4Ghz and one or two 5Ghz networks all in one single “Network”. While this is true and will give your computing devices the fastest speeds IOT devices like these thermostats only work on 2.4Ghz and will work absolutely flawless if split the 2.4 and 5 GHz networks giving the 2.4 its own SSID network name. Everything will still route through your main router so you can use the app on a phone connected to the 5Ghz to control your unit on the 2.4Ghz network.",4.0 out of 5 stars

El,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2023","Living in a house that hasn’t been updated since the 90’s means we were stuck without a common wire and with a vintage Honeywell basic thermometer, you know the ones, everyone has had one in their first crappy apartment lol.

When we first moved in we converted the downstairs thermostat to a nest and then when moving upstairs we realized the AC was from 1989 and needed to be rewired or replaced. I don’t like to replace things that are working great just to make them tech friendly so I started looking for options.

A local air conditioner dude quoted me $400 to install a nest thermostat with a common wire adapter. I thought that was fair but couldn’t afford it so I tried to do it myself and ran into issues with our ancient AC system’s power source. I gave up on ever having a smart thermostat that I could install myself for an affordable amount of money and we just adjusted it manually and consistently whenever it was hot.

However I got desperate during these Texas 110 degree days recently with my old AC thermostat popping on and off over and over so I started the search over. Determined not to spend $5000 on a whole new system cause yikes.

I found this one on Amazon after an extensive search and thought it’s too good to be true that it doesn’t need a common and it fits where the old 1990’s honeywells need updating.

I installed it so easily just like a normal thermostat, no wire jumping or skinning needed. No adapter on our dinosaur ac! I didn’t even have to open up the ac itself just the wall thermo. The app walked me through everything, and It took me about 45 mins total to connect it and calibrate it for the excess temperature issues we were having (our thermostat is in a hot spot in the room, you can adjust it just for these sorts of situations) within the first day we were seeing a change in the control of the temperature in these hot daytime hours!

A month later I am happy to say it’s working so well and our house is finally eco friendly with a lower bill during the summer. We haven’t had as many issues with our AC running all day and the app gives us a breakdown of energy usage and temperature. I only wish I had found this sooner because it solved a lot of our problems until we can officially replace our very old AC.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Just Josh,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2022","Installing this thermostat is very easy. Wire it up, setup the app, connect to it with the app, enter a code from the thermostat, and it connects to your wifi and is then available to view and configure in the app from anywhere.

At a basic level it works just like you’d expect any thermostat to work. You can control it right from the thermostat using the up/down arrows for the temperature. There are also buttons to set the heating or cooling mode (or turn it off), set the fan to on all the time or Auto, and to turn it on the programmed schedule mode. This thermostat also has a mode where it can automatically switch between heating and cooling as needed.

You can program the thermostat using the buttons on the unit itself, but it’s much easier to use the app to setup your schedule. You can setup various events throughout the day such as if you want it to be a certain temperature when you wake up, change when you are out for the day, change again when you’re back home, and change again for when you go to bed. In this sense it’s pretty much like any other programmable thermostat.

The app gives you a few nifty features (besides the expected ability to adjust it from anywhere… very convenient from bed):
- You can lock the physical buttons so only the app can control the thermostat. Perfect if you have issues with people adjusting the thermostat when they shouldn’t be.
- You can setup the fan to run a certain amount of time per hour to circulate the air in case the heating and cooling doesn’t need to run the fan much. This is a nice alternative for air circulation compared with just leaving the fan on all the time.
- You can use the app to tweak the “actual” temperature by plus or minus five degrees. This will change the room temperature display number and thus the behavior of the thermostat. This is convenient both for calibrating the thermostat if you want to set it to be exactly the same as another thermometer that you have, and also if you want to use it to set the temperature in another room that might be hotter or colder than the area where the thermostat is located.
- You can see the usage day by day on a graph. You can see how much the heat, air conditioning, and fan were on each day. Very convenient to see how your temperature settings impact the actual energy usage.

A great all around thermostat and a good alternative to “smarter” models if you don’t really care about the smart stuff but still want to be able to control your thermostat from an app.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Stevie,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2024","This was such an easy install, ANYONE !! Will be able to install this without any problems. The setup and install instructions on the app were easy to follow, so simple, not a lot of unnecessary confusing directions, just a select your product by clicking the pic that matches your product, then it goes into a simple step by step direction with pictures. I was concerned about matching the wires correctly because of how old our thermostat is, and because there are 5-6 wires but far more slots to plug them into but the app made it fail proof. I also loved how easy it was to get it connected to WIFI, took a minute or so and worked perfectly the first time around. Could not be happier with this!!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Placeholder,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2024","I cannot say enough good things about this product. It arrived quickly, the thermostat works extremely well. The instructions were just incredible. I thought about having an expert install the thermostat for me. However, the instructions included a video for each step. I was able to install the thermostat myself without a hitch. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a product that has better instructions and we’re available on the app for this product. The thermostat will automatically switch between heating and air-conditioning without having to flip a switch. If you are going to use the plate which is sold separately, install the plate when you installed in your new thermostat?

You will need code to set up the wifi. The code for mine was on the Welcome pamphlet in small print on the last page. It was a little hard to find, but this was the only hitch.",5.0 out of 5 stars
PT,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","Emerson did an amazing job with this product! I finally broke down and bought a wifi thermostat because I was tired of having to continually run over to my manual thermostat to adjust it. When going from summer to winter, or winter to spring, there are many days where you need heating on one day, and cooling the next... or heating during the morning... cooling during the day... and heating again during later that night. This makes the wifi thermostat the only logical choice.

My initial concern was the infamous ""c-wire,"" and whether that would be an issue, but Emerson has developed a system that is as foolproof as you can find. You download their app, and simply follow the step-by-step instructions, and voila! If necessary, you can go back a page or two, or you can go through the entire app a page at a time, to familiarize yourself, then go back to the first page and begin. I can't speak highly enough of their app and how well it is done. I only wish other companies would follow suit, and include such an easy to follow instruction app!

As to the thermostat itself, it is not too difficult to figure out, and I was most pleased with how quick and simple it was to setup the daily schedule. That was the one area where it was not as intuitive as it could have been, and a few extra instructions explaining it could have helped. But I still managed to figure it out in just a few minutes of trial & error, since the screen would tell me that I was doing it wrong, and would not let me go to the next step. But again... all in all, it was a surprisingly simple process from start to finish.

I was also pleased with how easy it was to setup the daily schedule. On my 7-day programmable manual thermostat, each day had to be set individually. On the Sensi, you can simply select select the days that you want programmed, and apply the temperature settings to that entire range of days. So rather than having to program 7 individual days, I simply set a schedule for 5 work days, and another schedule for my two days off.

The one thing I would caution everyone about is AA batteries! The batteries in the package were about 70% when I installed them into the thermostat. Fortunately, I keep plenty of rechargeable batteries on hand, so I was able to charge up a set. When I installed those, the battery meter showed a full 100%. I will monitor to see how long the batteries last, but with rechargeable batteries... it's actually no big deal one way or the other.

The unit works fine, and it took no time to install. The mounting bracket uses the exact same holes as the unit I was replacing, and you will probably need the super tiny philips head screwdriver and a pair of needle nosed pliers to push the copper wires back into the wall after you have them inserted & screwed down on the thermostat wall mount. If you leave them extending out, they will block you from being able to snap the face-plate onto the wall mount.

I highly recommend this unit. The cost is excellent... it works excellent... and installation was a breeze!

J. S. Keck,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2024","Added 2 of these last year to replace the ""dumb"" thermostats in our vacation home on Cape Cod. Nest and a lot of other Smart thermostats required a C-wire, which we didn't have. The Sensei units didn't need it, which was a main reason I ended up buying them. BUT, I'm really happy with the purchase now about 8 months later. We have to leave the heat on over the winter as the house is not set up to drain plumbing & winterize, etc. The Sensei units not only give me the current temps in the home, they show me the outside temp. The app also lets me see how much the heat has run for any given day, etc. When it's going to be colder than normal for a few days, it's easy to just open the app and dial up the heat a bit. Don't have to call a neighbor (or my brother in law) to have them go over and adjust the thermostats for us. Plus we got some $ back thru the Mass Save Energy program, so they where practically free. Installation was a little on the fussy side; they lost wifi connection a few times, but I think that's the fault of my Eero mesh system more than the thermostats. So far, they've been great and I can recommend them, especially if you have a remote location you want to monitor.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Bill,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2023","I have a house from the 60s so no C-Wire. We just have RH and W wires. Our furnace is gas with hot water baseboard heat so I think technically it's a boiler. I read others saying they didn't need a C-Wire so I figured I'd give it a try. The setup process makes you select your current wiring setup and if you pick RH and W it says it won't work. I just said I had a C-Wire even though I didn't. I was able to get it connected to Wi-Fi and it seemed good so I was going to wait and see how the batteries held out. Had an issue where the heat was on even though the thermostat wasn't asking for it. Found the thermostat was setup for an electric system so fixed those settings. Then noticed on my Taco control panel that the yellow light that indicates the thermostat is calling for heat was faintly illuminated. It was doing this even when the thermostat mode was set to off. So while it seemed like it may work, it's behaving strange due to the absence of the C-Wire so I'm not taking any chances. Put the old thermostat back and it is back to normal.

I have another one of these thermostats in the finished basement where I do have a C-Wire and it's great. The app is great and I like the usage reports that show how much time the thermostat spent asking for heat.",4.0 out of 5 stars
CDMSALES12539,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024","Nice quality of features. Easy to use. VERY easy to change between heat and cool modes without having to go to another screen unlike many other manufacturers touch screen units. Unfortuatenly, the app makes you go to another screen (please change that!). Also, I wish the MENU button was a 2 or 3 second press to activate. We hit this menu button accidentally at night, because it it dark, too often when chaning the temperature. Must be changed. Wish had a simple Permanent Hold button in app. Instead, you have to go to another screen to turn schedules OFF. Could be designed better.",5.0 out of 5 stars
ZaHArah,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024","I was done fighting my nest for a common wire or power issue so I decided to go cheap and find something that still has the smart capabilities at an affordable price. the first unit that I bought for some reason stopped working after a few days. so I swapped it and now this unit has been working perfectly, no issues with the scheduling, no issues connecting, no issues with display. so far it's just been the perfect product that I need right now.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Ted Long,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2024","My utility company had a rebate of up to $125 for a self-installed smart thermostat. So, my overall cost was zero. Was simple to install and configure to work with my Amazon Echo. Using the separate app that gets installed on my android phone, allows me to easily set a schedule and/or temporarily set the temperature. The android installed app is so good it changes color while viewing if the (in my case) the heat is actually running.
Current temperature, at the thermostat, is pretty large and easily read. But temp setting is a bit small on the device, but still easy to read. Another useful feature is the current humidity level. With my forced hot air heat, the air dries out very quickly, so when the humidity level drops below 25%, I usually turn on a humidifier to add more moisture in the air. The humidity level, like the current setting. is pretty small on the device, but is also more easily read on the app.
Physical install, and app setup, took me less than 15 minutes, and Alexa setup just a few minutes more. The only thing that I would like to have that is missing is a physical button just to temporarily turn on the back light. But as my phone app works just fine, the lack of a back light only button, is really not an issue.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JMP,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2024","If you buy the like new or used options, expect not to receive everything. I bought 'like new' option for about $25 less and while the thermostat did look new, there were no batteries and no mounting bolts. Fortunately, this has the same install footprint as the 13 year old Honeywell it replaced, so no worries. We bought two fresh batteries. Installation was great, very easy, took maybe 15 minutes. The wifi setup had no issues and the system is running as it should. For the price gamble, it was well worth it. Probably the missing items should have been disclosed as I expected like new to mean it was open box or damaged packaging. It is clear someone returned it but kept the batteries and bolts.",5.0 out of 5 stars
