THE CMC WB,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2024",Connects easily to our existing Google Nest system. Installation was easy and only took a few minutes. Make sure you understand your existing wiring before you start and this is an easy replacement for your existing thermostat. Being able to adjust settings ing the Google home program makes it very convenient to use.,5.0 out of 5 stars
misiro,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024","Everything about this thermostat is a downgrade from the other Nest thermostats. I have had every version of the Nest thermostat and this one is the worst.

1) The controls are less intuitive. The spinning wheel is what made the Nest thermostat so easy to use and is the reason why the circle shape worked. If you remove the spinning to navigate the thermostat, what is the point of it being round like this? Instead, you have to use a touch-sensitive panel on the side which uses swipe and tap gestures. It sucks.

2) The app is a downgrade. You can no longer use the more intuitive Nest app. You have to use the Google Home app with this thermostat which requires more taps and searching through menus for simple control.

3) The colors are pretty, but it actually looks cheaper than the Nest Learning Thermostat or Nest Thermostat E. In my opinion, the best looking and most functional model was the E, which they have discontinued for reasons which baffle me.

5) I guess when we received it the battery was very low. It's been months of seeing ""Very Low Battery"" on the screen. Yes, I will replace the battery (a AAA), but it should come with a battery that has some charge. Not a good luck to ship things which, when first powered on, immediately says the battery needs to be replaced. Besides, if it's Low Battery as the screen has indicated for months now... why is it continuing to operate for this long?

Sadly, we will be looking to other brands for thermostats once we finally get frustrated enough with this one. Besides, Google sells your personal data and profits from it. Best I avoid supporting that in the future anyways: and so should you.

I recommend passing on the Nest Thermostat if you like simplicity, function, and style.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Tony M.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2022","I replaced and existing Wi-fi Enabled Honeywell that never worked very well. Overall the Nest Thermostat it’s a very positive upgrade : better aesthetics , better UI and much better “smart” features meaning i am saving money right away.

If you are a Google Home / Nest user then there is a lot of added value due to the automation and reporting features . The home and away detection using Google Home App works well to reduce usage while you are away from home. the daily reporting helps you estimate your bill. and the scenario-based scheduling gives you useful control over heating to balance comfort and usage

There are some failures though . the initial wire detection failed , i believe due to firmware issues . also my furnace has a semi automated fan, so the green wire detection failed while the timed fan was enabled . after 3 iterations the setup completed fine and the unit has been working great . Once active, my furnace now cycles less frequently which reduces noise in the house

the device UX is great but not intuitive for guests . yet another “one click does everything “ UI that takes time to understand . This could be good if you don’t want guests to fiddle

Finally, the Google HOME UI is very clumsy for basic features like setting schedules and reading the temperature . the app has too many features and functions that get in the way of basic thermostat usage . I recommend commanding via google assistant or setting hold temperature via the Device UI. Once you set a schedule , you won’t be adjusting temps often so it’s a minor hindrance .

Overall it’s a very positive purchase and with the rebate and cost savings you’ll save at least $100 in the first year . It’s a classy device —easily the best looking Thermostat on the market with the glossy mirrored finish and high contrast display .

All in I highly recommend it with some reservations that will likely be cleaned up with software revisions . If you are eligible for a rebate or a heavy Google user, it’s an obvious upgrade to pursue",4.0 out of 5 stars

Ethan C.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2024","I have an AC and heat pump with backup heat. This thermostat doesn’t support backup/emergency heat which I didn’t know when I bought it. Still works for heat and AC but if you want the assurance of everything hooked up then you’ll need the “learning thermostat” version.
Pros:
Good home/away sensing and easy to use in the Google home app. One tap enrollment in electric supplier rebates.
Cons:
Terrible controls on the actually thermostat. They couldn’t have picked a worse interaction method than sliding and tapping the side. Please just put buttons or an actually moving ring smh. But I usually just use my phone or Google home to adjust it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
David Calabrese,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2024","The theromstat itself is great. Easy to hook up and get up and running. Very easy to use.
The only problem is the app control. You have to use Google home app to work it, which is fine but Google home does not refresh every time you open the app. Even with background app refresh on the app opens to its last settings of temperatures. You have to close the app and reopen it everytime to get it to update the current settings and temps. There is a Google nest app but that app is not compatible with this Google nest product. That makes no sense. Both Google nest thermostat and the app are made by Google and supported by Google yet the Google nest app does not work this thermostat. A dedicated app to the nest unit would be nice instead of having to use Google home app which is an overall app and not dedicated to the nest unit. Google home needs to refresh when you open the app",4.0 out of 5 stars

CF,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2022","I really liked the presentation of this device, it is clean and well built, although the software is atrocious. Google Home is so convoluted that make you feel an idiot because all you want to do is set up the thermostat temperature range.

By default the device require wifi to even activate; but the process is simple. Overall you will have hard time depending if your AC/heater has the blue wire or not (which is the one carrying the power from what I can understand reading comments online). This device has its own set of batteries but I had hard time setting up my system because it was complaining that a wire was not set (yellow; which was set); so reading online I found that the software require the blue wire connected/shorted to be physically connected to the device, for the system to work. Please check online about this issue and you will find very detailed instructions about how to solve it.

Clearly the issue is purely on the software side: the app ask you to tell how many wires you have, so you need to connect the blue wire but tell the app you do not have it connected; and magically the thermostat will work. YMMV depending on your AC/heater system of course; they have different number of wires so check with someone knowledgeable.

Other than that; setting up a simple range of temp for the whole day was a challenge, because this thing is so smart that it think that you need 4 different setup for different time of the day, as if you want to keep your temperature constant. After a lot of jumps and hoops, I was able to keep the bloody thing in a range where it turn on only when it is too hot or too cold, and stay off the rest of the time.

Also not sure why the option to set a range is disabled by default, but I assume it is because people use those for AC only and not for heating and AC combo? My system has a combo for AC and heater so I needed the setting that turn on heater when too cold, and AC when too hot; and had to dig in the settings to change this, while it should be a simple option right on the main app page.

The controls on the unit are OK; there are no buttons and the screen is not touch screen, you have a strip on the right side which is hard to use unless you got some sort of dexterity or your fingertips are super conductive I guess. I am a tech person for living and this interface was quite weird to handle; would rather have 3 buttons to do everything instead of the strip but once you know how to handle the device, it is usable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Traci on the Coast,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2024","Our HVAC tech told us to buy this when our Honeywell thermostat bit the dust. It's been a nightmare. We live in a hot and humid climate and no matter what we do, this thermostat keeps resetting itself to 82 degrees randomly. We've gone to every online forum we can find to figure out how to keep it from doing this and discovered that everyone has the same problem. So we have to constantly check it if we want our house cooler than 82 degrees - which we absolutely do. We sleep at 68 degrees and live at 72-75 degrees. It's very hard on your HVAC system to vary more than 3-5 degrees throughout the day so this is less than ideal. We do NOT recommend. We are having Honeywell thermostats reinstalled. Their app is easy to use and understand none of this nonsense.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Nathan Perkins,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023","This thermostat is excellent when integrated with Google Home. Using the new script editor feature, we have nearly full control over the settings based on any trigger we like.

The in-app temperature scheduling works well.

The only thing missing is full control over the fan. The fan scheduling options are limited to running it every day, between a start and end time, and running it for a specific duration in each hour. For example, you can schedule it between 2pm to 8pm by running it for 15 minutes every hour, or for ""60 minutes every hour"", which basically enables it full-time.

The fan cannot be enabled or disabled with automation so there's no ability to:

- Turn off the fan when home presence is away.
- Enable the fan when home presence is home.
- Enable the fan when upstairs is much hotter than downstairs.
- Etc.

The fan can be manually turned on or turned on via the app, but it has to be for a specific amount of time, like 30 minutes, 8 hours, etc.

We've accepted that we will have to manage the fan ourselves by manually turning it on when needed.

Overall, a great product that is really cheap when combined with rebates. It would be excellent if it supported better control on the fan.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Al,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2023","I was a little surprise when I got my Nest. I did a search for the e-nest which is one down from the top of the line. This is what came up in my search. But it's not what I got. I got the bottom line basic nest unit. It works pretty well does everything it is supposed to but it does not have all the bells and whistles of the two more expensive thermostats. One you cannot turn the bezel to adjust the temperature, you must sweep your finger along a line on the side. It works, but I did not expect this. Second when doing the installation it's pretty straightforward but I could not find an installation for this model. All the Google Home installation directions took me to the Top Line or the one lesser model. Also this does not come with a bezel plate for behind it. Unless your wall is pristine with a hole no bigger than about an inch and a half across you are going to have to put an escutcheon plate behind the mounting bracket. Not a problem, just a surprise. Also I ran into a couple of configuration issues when doing the self test however I just pushed Skip and everything worked. Overall it wasn't too difficult just a bit surprising.",4.0 out of 5 stars
David N,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2023","Initial install
It went well other then when it came to adding to the google home app. The google home app kept failing to add it.

Batteries:
After two months of use I've had a couple power outages and each time it says batteries low this last time I took it off the wall. I looked at the batteries they say google on them they also say not rechargeable alkaline. Why have non rechargeable batteries seems like a engineering flaw. It couldn't have brought up the cost to make it charge after all the older Nest stuff did.

Google App:
Forces you to use google home instead of nest. if you ever had one of the older nest thermostats you will miss the nest app.

Things you cant do on this thermostat
Nest App: better scheduling also allowed you to login to the nest webpage to make changes.
Older nest thermostats allowed you to lock the physical to a temp range to keep the kids from getting ridiculous.

Masha,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2022","I was dreading installing this. Thought to myself - I am handy but am I that handy?! Was putting off purchasing because I was thinking install would be a nightmare! Electric and plumbing - both Ararat’s make me pause… My house was built in 2016 so not that old. I have no idea how much harder install it like be if you own an older home. Picture of the inside of my old Honeywell thermostat is attached / one of those just regular standard thermostats. I did check comparability prior to purchase - seemed ok. I read the instructions first and followed them precisely! And it was easy actually. Took about 30 minutes which included taking the old one off as well. Works great as expected / anticipated / described. Word of advice- do this in the day time and good lighting. Or have someone hold a flashlight while you are installing. You are going to be turning off the power prior to the install, so you need another source of light to see what you are doing.

Johnd,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2024","We purchased two of these for our new home to replace Honeywell thermostats that we thought were difficult. After three hours of attempting to program through the app on our phones, we finally had to wait for our son to come visit so he could install them. He is extremely tech savvy and it took him two hours to load onto one phone. We would like to have had them on two phones but apparently that is not an option. After YouTube videos and about two hours, I managed to set a schedule for the winter with the heat coming on at certain time and going off at a certain time. We have now switched into spring, and are in need of some AC and after again, hours of struggling through the app on our phone, and YouTube videos, no matter what we set one of our ACs to it kept coming on heat, even though we had it on the cool setting and at 70. It was 76° in the house so it should’ve cooled but instead it just kept giving us heat. We finally just shut the breaker off for that AC so that our house wouldn’t be 80° before we had company arriving.

The guy I got clearly knew next to nothing about programming it; every time I asked a new question he put me on hold so he could look it up. The program he helped me create failed to do the simple tasks I wanted. Too many choices, zones, presets, just tech at its worst. I don't know why, but starting heating at 4:30 in the morning the office went from 56 degrees to 66 degrees in 5 hours.

misiro,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024","Everything about this thermostat is a downgrade from the other Nest thermostats. I have had every version of the Nest thermostat and this one is the worst.

1) The controls are less intuitive. The spinning wheel is what made the Nest thermostat so easy to use and is the reason why the circle shape worked. If you remove the spinning to navigate the thermostat, what is the point of it being round like this? Instead, you have to use a touch-sensitive panel on the side which uses swipe and tap gestures. It sucks.

2) The app is a downgrade. You can no longer use the more intuitive Nest app. You have to use the Google Home app with this thermostat which requires more taps and searching through menus for simple control.

3) The colors are pretty, but it actually looks cheaper than the Nest Learning Thermostat or Nest Thermostat E. In my opinion, the best looking and most functional model was the E, which they have discontinued for reasons which baffle me.

5) I guess when we received it the battery was very low. It's been months of seeing ""Very Low Battery"" on the screen. Yes, I will replace the battery (a AAA), but it should come with a battery that has some charge. Not a good luck to ship things which, when first powered on, immediately says the battery needs to be replaced. Besides, if it's Low Battery as the screen has indicated for months now... why is it continuing to operate for this long?

Sadly, we will be looking to other brands for thermostats once we finally get frustrated enough with this one. Besides, Google sells your personal data and profits from it. Best I avoid supporting that in the future anyways: and so should you.

Johnd,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2024","We purchased two of these for our new home to replace Honeywell thermostats that we thought were difficult. After three hours of attempting to program through the app on our phones, we finally had to wait for our son to come visit so he could install them. He is extremely tech savvy and it took him two hours to load onto one phone. We would like to have had them on two phones but apparently that is not an option. After YouTube videos and about two hours, I managed to set a schedule for the winter with the heat coming on at certain time and going off at a certain time. We have now switched into spring, and are in need of some AC and after again, hours of struggling through the app on our phone, and YouTube videos, no matter what we set one of our ACs to it kept coming on heat, even though we had it on the cool setting and at 70. It was 76° in the house so it should’ve cooled but instead it just kept giving us heat. We finally just shut the breaker off for that AC so that our house wouldn’t be 80° before we had company arriving. Yesterday we removed it and put the Honeywell back in, and are very glad of it simplicity. My advice is that these are not very user-friendly at all.

OClover1975,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2022","I've had this particular Nest thermostat for almost 1 year now and it hasn't stayed connected to WiFi for a full 48-hours since my purchase. One may ask, ""Why wait 1 year to write a review and provide feedback?"" Well, it's because the thermostat does it's job and I really didnt want to disconnect it, re-install my old one, only to put in a new Nest when it arrived. And because it randomly connected to my WiFi today, only to last for about 2 hours, so that's why I'm writing review now. One of the biggest pros of having a smart thermostat, is the ability of accessing it online and adjusting the temperature from your bed or wherever you are. But this one hasn't stayed connected without me having to disconnect it and basically re-install it (minus the re-wiring). My WiFi strength is great, never have had any issues with any of my other electronic items, only the Nest. So with all of the troubleshooting and lack of help from tech support, I'm giving it 1 star. Next time, I'm buying brand new. I've had a Nest thermostat before, but it was a new purchase, not used or refurbished. Lesson learned.",1.0 out of 5 stars

So a few weeks later we hired an electrician to install one and install this new Nest….well, long story short he added a C wire and installed the Nest and it still didn’t work. Can’t return it I guess because it’s been taken out of the box. So we wasted ~$120 and can’t qualify for any energy rebate. Expensive mistake. Not sure I will ever trust Google products again.

The instructions using the app were easy enough but annoying. I’m a bit old fashioned and would have preferred a simple set of paper instructions rather than trying to page back and forth with an app. Anyway… after trying several different thermostat wiring configurations per the app instructions i finally gave up and came to the conclusion as per the app instructions that it won’t work without running another power wire.

Robert,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2021","I have experience with Nest products pre-google and I loved them. My old thermostat was great. This new one is awful. The plastic feels cheap, the display is unattractive, the lack of the click ring feels like a step in the wrong direction. But worse than the aesthetics is the actual function of the device itself. It constantly loses connection to my network (the only device in the house that does so). Every time it loses connection and disappears from the app, I have to go through the install procedure, remove it from the wall, scan the QR code, tell the app what wires I have, give it info about my system and wait for it to connect.

The guy I got clearly knew next to nothing about programming it; every time I asked a new question he put me on hold so he could look it up. The program he helped me create failed to do the simple tasks I wanted. Too many choices, zones, presets, just tech at its worst.

I bought this to add to my home that already has several Nest Learning and Nest Thermostat E thermostats. This one feels cheap and poorly engineered.

The sliding does not work well and, as a result, changing the temp is challenging. Further, you cannot add this thermostat to the Nest app - you have to use Google Home and Google Home is just not as good as the Nest app in terms of features.

The Haptic Touch system didn’t always work correctly, causing a lot of headaches in toggling back and forth between menus. Generally it worked okay in the app - but only when it was properly connected to the WiFi.

Relatedly, the biggest problem was if the WiFi or electricity went out, it would not automatically reconnect.

The supporting app is cumbersome and requires a great deal of repetition to set all the times of day and all the rooms, even with some rudimentary copy and paste functionality.

I have an infant, and this is expressly bad. We need it at 68 or higher. We just found the nursery had reverted to 67 without prompt.

I bought this thermostat for the specific purpose of having a way to limit the range of temperature guests could set at our short term rental; this came out of guests turning old thermostat down into the 50s. I bought this model as I did not need the learning features of the more expensive Nest Learning Model. As I have the Nest learning model at home and it is an excellent product with all the features one would expect, I assumed the only feature I would be giving up with this model was the learning capabilities. Sadly Google decided to hamstring this lower end model by not including basic functionality that even less expensive thermostats include by default. As far as design, the touch screen is a fingerprint magnet; you'll be cleaning this thing all the time.

Sadly Google would not take my units back as I no longer had the packaging; this has turned out to be an expensive experience. My advice, forget this Nest Model and either splurge on the Nest Learning or get a lower cost alternate brand that most likely has far more features.",2.0 out of 5 stars
JoeD,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2022","Before you purchase this device you need to understand that it requires a C line. If you do not have one, you will need to purchase and install one. It is not a simple process.Or you could have a professional do it for you (i.e. additional costs). If you attempt to install it without one, the app will tell you it is required and will not add the unit to your Google Home and will not be operational.

Even after your installation, there is a reasonable chance that if you loose power that the unit will not function correctly after the power comes back. My unit did not display the correct room temperature after such an outage. It read 12-15 degrees above the actual temp. After researching online, it seems this is not an uncommon problem with these units. In my attempt to repair this, the app ultimatly suggested I ""restore to factory defaults"" and reinstall it. After many hours and failed attempts, the app suggested I contact a professional and offerred me such a professional by simply clicking a button on the app. For an upfront cost of $129.

Gracie Dogg,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2022","Here is the best example of Not Ready: If you use the Help function within the app, you have to close the Help function to follow the directions of what to do. After you do Step 1, you have to re-open the Help function, re-ask your question to find Step 2 and then close the Help function to do Step 2. Repeat for each and every step. So basically, you have to go find a second device to read the Help steps or open a browser on your phone to look up the Help pages so that you can access the app at the same time. That's a completely non-functional use of the Help section within the app.

Adrienne Levay,"Reviewed in Canada on December 21, 2022","I was so excited to update my 1970s thermostat with this Nest. However, upon installation, I discovered you MUST have a c-wire for internal battery management. Theoretically you don't need one but if you do not connect a c-wire it will require changing the Triple A batteries approximately every 6 or 7 days. As I don't have AC, I moved my Y wire to be my C-wire the the support of a hired plumber. Once this was done, the internal battery would still not charge. I was never able to get the internal battery to read over 3.6V which is apparently the critical voltage for the unit to be able to keep full functionality. THEN it dawned on me that even if I could get the internal charging properly when the HVAC system turned on, because I live in a 4 season climate and I don't have AC, I would not be using the system AT ALL for 4 to 5 months of the year. The battery would surely be dead after one summer if I did not keep putting Triple A batteries in it every week (because you cannot turn this unit off to conserve battery) and there is no USB charge option on this unit!! I would have a 130 dollar purchase that got me through ONE winter, if this is the case. Therefore I returned it and will look for some other options.

Tony M.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2022","I replaced and existing Wi-fi Enabled Honeywell that never worked very well. Overall the Nest Thermostat it’s a very positive upgrade : better aesthetics , better UI and much better “smart” features meaning i am saving money right away.

If you are a Google Home / Nest user then there is a lot of added value due to the automation and reporting features . The home and away detection using Google Home App works well to reduce usage while you are away from home. the daily reporting helps you estimate your bill. and the scenario-based scheduling gives you useful control over heating to balance comfort and usage

There are some failures though . the initial wire detection failed , i believe due to firmware issues . also my furnace has a semi automated fan, so the green wire detection failed while the timed fan was enabled . after 3 iterations the setup completed fine and the unit has been working great . Once active, my furnace now cycles less frequently which reduces noise in the house

the device UX is great but not intuitive for guests . yet another “one click does everything “ UI that takes time to understand . This could be good if you don’t want guests to fiddle

Finally, the Google HOME UI is very clumsy for basic features like setting schedules and reading the temperature . the app has too many features and functions that get in the way of basic thermostat usage . I recommend commanding via google assistant or setting hold temperature via the Device UI. Once you set a schedule , you won’t be adjusting temps often so it’s a minor hindrance .

Overall it’s a very positive purchase and with the rebate and cost savings you’ll save at least $100 in the first year . It’s a classy device —easily the best looking Thermostat on the market with the glossy mirrored finish and high contrast display .

All in I highly recommend it with some reservations that will likely be cleaned up with software revisions . If you are eligible for a rebate or a heavy Google user, it’s an obvious upgrade to pursue",4.0 out of 5 stars

CF,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2022","I really liked the presentation of this device, it is clean and well built, although the software is atrocious. Google Home is so convoluted that make you feel an idiot because all you want to do is set up the thermostat temperature range.

By default the device require wifi to even activate; but the process is simple. Overall you will have hard time depending if your AC/heater has the blue wire or not (which is the one carrying the power from what I can understand reading comments online). This device has its own set of batteries but I had hard time setting up my system because it was complaining that a wire was not set (yellow; which was set); so reading online I found that the software require the blue wire connected/shorted to be physically connected to the device, for the system to work. Please check online about this issue and you will find very detailed instructions about how to solve it.

Clearly the issue is purely on the software side: the app ask you to tell how many wires you have, so you need to connect the blue wire but tell the app you do not have it connected; and magically the thermostat will work. YMMV depending on your AC/heater system of course; they have different number of wires so check with someone knowledgeable.

Other than that; setting up a simple range of temp for the whole day was a challenge, because this thing is so smart that it think that you need 4 different setup for different time of the day, as if you want to keep your temperature constant. After a lot of jumps and hoops, I was able to keep the bloody thing in a range where it turn on only when it is too hot or too cold, and stay off the rest of the time.

Also not sure why the option to set a range is disabled by default, but I assume it is because people use those for AC only and not for heating and AC combo? My system has a combo for AC and heater so I needed the setting that turn on heater when too cold, and AC when too hot; and had to dig in the settings to change this, while it should be a simple option right on the main app page.

The controls on the unit are OK; there are no buttons and the screen is not touch screen, you have a strip on the right side which is hard to use unless you got some sort of dexterity or your fingertips are super conductive I guess. I am a tech person for living and this interface was quite weird to handle; would rather have 3 buttons to do everything instead of the strip but once you know how to handle the device, it is usable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Nathan Perkins,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023","This thermostat is excellent when integrated with Google Home. Using the new script editor feature, we have nearly full control over the settings based on any trigger we like.

The in-app temperature scheduling works well.

The only thing missing is full control over the fan. The fan scheduling options are limited to running it every day, between a start and end time, and running it for a specific duration in each hour. For example, you can schedule it between 2pm to 8pm by running it for 15 minutes every hour, or for ""60 minutes every hour"", which basically enables it full-time.

The fan cannot be enabled or disabled with automation so there's no ability to:

- Turn off the fan when home presence is away.
- Enable the fan when home presence is home.
- Enable the fan when upstairs is much hotter than downstairs.
- Etc.

The fan can be manually turned on or turned on via the app, but it has to be for a specific amount of time, like 30 minutes, 8 hours, etc.

We've accepted that we will have to manage the fan ourselves by manually turning it on when needed.

Overall, a great product that is really cheap when combined with rebates. It would be excellent if it supported better control on the fan.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I have 2 units running for a year now without a C wire. I recently changed the batteries proactively even though the units did not indicate a need.

They come without in the box instructions. My knee-jerk reaction was to pack it up and send it back, but I decided to use the app and proceed that way. That works just fine. Installation is simple. I took it slow making sure I followed everything exact so if anything went wrong it wasn't user error.

Outside of my phone and TV I don't have a lot of respect for smart devices. My home is filled with them. Mostly useless things like my smart dishwasher, stove, and washing machine, that simply tell me when they're done. Is that really smart? This smart device is and you need it.

The setup of the device and app is doable even for a noob. Those who wrote how hard it is probably had other issues.

Why do you need a smart thermostat? 1) Not needing to adjust the temps when you leave the house is big. 2) When that cold snap happens, not waking up to a freezing house is another. 3) It is nice to know how much the heat and air run. Just knowing that might influence your habits.

Why you don't need a smart thermostat. You don't need to adjust your home's temps while you are away. Not really. You've already programmed it that when you're gone, and it knows you're gone, it will lower go into eco mode. You don't need to check the temps. But if that makes a thrill run up your spine guess what? This thermostat can do that.

There are some nice eco reports that this Nest generates as well. I like these but they are like infotainment. They are interesting, but I'm not going to act on them. I want the temperatures a certain way in my house (I work out of my home too) and my computer gear must be kept cool. But it did influence how I set my eco mode and made me power down my computers while away and at night to conserve energy.

I have 2 of the same model. One on each level. One of them crashes every few days in a peculiar way. It stops logging eco data and becomes unresponsive to the app, but still reports being connected to the network and continues to function properly. Resetting it restores function. I haven't contacted CS because I just don't want to spend the time.

This is odd and very hard to troubleshoot and the only reason I am deducting a star. The same issue has happened to the other unit but only 3 times in a year. Both have very strong wifi connections.

It was also relatively easy to install, however this location was already previously set up with a Lyric smart thermostat so all necessary provisions were already present including the C-wire.

Actually doing stuff on the thermostat itself is not a great experience, you would think that it has touch sensors all around the outside and you would ""spin"" your hand around the edge like other Nest models, but no only the right side registers touch and is very finicky at that. Sometimes swipes register, sometimes taps to select register, but other times they don't. Thankfully however, aside from initial setup, the rest of controlling afterwards can be done via your phone instead.

App functionality works great, the unit has very stable WiFi connection, and there is a lot of features and scheduling functionality within the Google Home app that if you're somewhat competent at tech (specifically smart home and using Google's app) isn't too hard to figure app. It's much better than trying to do things via the thermostat's controls.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Masha,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2022","I was dreading installing this. Thought to myself - I am handy but am I that handy?! Was putting off purchasing because I was thinking install would be a nightmare! Electric and plumbing - both Ararat’s make me pause… My house was built in 2016 so not that old. I have no idea how much harder install it like be if you own an older home. Picture of the inside of my old Honeywell thermostat is attached / one of those just regular standard thermostats. I did check comparability prior to purchase - seemed ok. I read the instructions first and followed them precisely! And it was easy actually. Took about 30 minutes which included taking the old one off as well. Works great as expected / anticipated / described. Word of advice- do this in the day time and good lighting. Or have someone hold a flashlight while you are installing. You are going to be turning off the power prior to the install, so you need another source of light to see what you are doing. All in all good experience so far. I need to patch up a small hole where the old thermostat was but not a big deal - see picture. Recommend purchasing. And I think this is my longest review ever. Maybe lol.",5.0 out of 5 stars
IVAN ITURRALDE,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2023","I am upgrading from a gen 2 Nest that died and just will not turn on. I am beyond amazed how easy it was to install this new one. I do have a “Blue C Common” wire that I had installed for the Gen 2 as it would battery drain all the time. This screen is super bright FYI, don’t let the mirror fool you it’s very clear and bright!

This new one was installed, firmware updated, up and running no lie in like 15 minutes, I am a little disappointed it was so easy as my wife looked at me and said “that’s it ?” If you’re wondering this is the Fog Color and my wall is painted Sherwin Williams “Anew Gray” and they pair well together.

Gary,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2021","I'm a bit mystified by the number of reviewers complaining about the lack of installation instructions or needing a C wire. The Google Home app takes you through installation step-by-step. Installation is basically this: turn off the HVAC circuit breakers, remove old thermostat making sure to label the wires as you disconnect them, connect the wires to the same terminal letters as the old thermostat, pull the Nest battery plastic barrier to allow batteries to make contact, turn the circuit breakers back on, and then use the Google Home app to set the thermostat controls. I have a relatively new Trane HVAC gas system which uses wires G, Y, W, and R. The Nest works fine with no C wire. The entire process to remove and replace the thermostat took about 35 minutes. The only additional requirement is installing the Nest thermostat skill on Alexa if you want to allow voice control of the Nest through Alexa. It's a great thermostat. The Google Home app allows simple setup. With Alexa, it's easy to override any presets simply by telling Alexa to change the temperature or to switch from heating to cooling, or vice versa. A nice feature of the Nest is that when you set whatever temperature you want at a given time, the thermostat will pre-heat or cool so the target temperature is achieved when the specified time is reached. In case you're concerned about what happens in the event of an internet outage, don't be. The thermostat retains all of its settings and can be changed manually on the thermostat itself should you experience an internet outage. Finally, the thermostat temperature precisely matches two other accurate temperature gauges I tested it against.",5.0 out of 5 stars

misiro,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024","Everything about this thermostat is a downgrade from the other Nest thermostats. I have had every version of the Nest thermostat and this one is the worst.

1) The controls are less intuitive. The spinning wheel is what made the Nest thermostat so easy to use and is the reason why the circle shape worked. If you remove the spinning to navigate the thermostat, what is the point of it being round like this? Instead, you have to use a touch-sensitive panel on the side which uses swipe and tap gestures. It sucks.

2) The app is a downgrade. You can no longer use the more intuitive Nest app. You have to use the Google Home app with this thermostat which requires more taps and searching through menus for simple control.

3) The colors are pretty, but it actually looks cheaper than the Nest Learning Thermostat or Nest Thermostat E. In my opinion, the best looking and most functional model was the E, which they have discontinued for reasons which baffle me.

5) I guess when we received it the battery was very low. It's been months of seeing ""Very Low Battery"" on the screen. Yes, I will replace the battery (a AAA), but it should come with a battery that has some charge. Not a good luck to ship things which, when first powered on, immediately says the battery needs to be replaced. Besides, if it's Low Battery as the screen has indicated for months now... why is it continuing to operate for this long?

Sadly, we will be looking to other brands for thermostats once we finally get frustrated enough with this one. Besides, Google sells your personal data and profits from it. Best I avoid supporting that in the future anyways: and so should you.

I recommend passing on the Nest Thermostat if you like simplicity, function, and style.",1.0 out of 5 stars

KIWH,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2024","We have an older gen version of the nest that we love.

As someone proficient in various tech - this was a struggle. And definitely a problem for my older parents. The Haptic Touch system didn’t always work correctly, causing a lot of headaches in toggling back and forth between menus. Generally it worked okay in the app - but only when it was properly connected to the WiFi.

Relatedly, the biggest problem was if the WiFi or electricity went out, it would not automatically reconnect.

It has made a process I've never spent more than a moment thinking about (setting the temperature in my home) into a nightmare of reading and re-reading the directions then ending up exasperated because this won't do the simplest thing any thermostat should do- stay at the temperature you set.
Yes, you read that right. You cannot set and forget the temp for more than 24 hours. So let's say you plan for an upcoming coldsnap by leaving your upstairs at 65 degrees, which is a comfortable sleeping temp and a bit chilly in the day but nonetheless a temp that won't have your heat pump running constantly or worse yet, going into emergency heating mode. Don't get me started on what it'll do when we go on vacation.
I find myself waking in the middle of the night, or closing my eyes to go to sleep only to realize that yes, once again I need to set and hold the temp otherwise it will jump up to some preset temperature based upon what? I have no idea. If ""eco"" mode is chosen there is no way to adjust those temps either. Apparently Nest believes they know what eco means more than the homeowner does.
My newer more advanced Nest thermostat downstairs also has eco mode but it can be adjusted to hold a temp and supposedly it ""learns"" whatever that means.
Since replacing a Honeywell digital thermostat with this monster my utility bills increased by 1/3! Can I prove it's due to this device? No I cannot. But I can sure suspect it.

Steph,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2023","I absolutely loved my nest for the first two years I have had it. It did occasionally disconnect from the wifi, but was easy to reconnect. The warranty on it went out about 6 months ago, and for the last three months it has decided to go haywire.

Every so often, the thermostat decides that it is not connected to any power system and refuses to operate the HVAC system. I have had my regular HVAC guys (who installed the current HVAC only a few years ago) come over and check the system, and they found nothing wrong with it. They both said they did not like google nest thermostats because they can cause tons of issues, but mine seemed to be working perfectly fine at the time of them checking everything.

I had not had any issue with it until this passed Thursday night, when I woke up because it was cold in my house. I went to turn up the heater through the app, but noticed the HVAC was not coming on. I got up and tried to turn the heat up manually, but the thermostat stated it was not connected to power and gave error code E298. This was the code I also got a few months ago when I had this issue the first time. I turned the switch off at the HVAC for the remainder of the weekend, as I was out of town and knew it would not get cold enough to warrant the heater turning on while I was away. I have attempted 4 times tonight (Sunday) to get the thermostat to connect to power, but to no avail.

misiro,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024","Everything about this thermostat is a downgrade from the other Nest thermostats. I have had every version of the Nest thermostat and this one is the worst.

1) The controls are less intuitive. The spinning wheel is what made the Nest thermostat so easy to use and is the reason why the circle shape worked. If you remove the spinning to navigate the thermostat, what is the point of it being round like this? Instead, you have to use a touch-sensitive panel on the side which uses swipe and tap gestures. It sucks.

2) The app is a downgrade. You can no longer use the more intuitive Nest app. You have to use the Google Home app with this thermostat which requires more taps and searching through menus for simple control.

3) The colors are pretty, but it actually looks cheaper than the Nest Learning Thermostat or Nest Thermostat E. In my opinion, the best looking and most functional model was the E, which they have discontinued for reasons which baffle me.

5) I guess when we received it the battery was very low. It's been months of seeing ""Very Low Battery"" on the screen. Yes, I will replace the battery (a AAA), but it should come with a battery that has some charge. Not a good luck to ship things which, when first powered on, immediately says the battery needs to be replaced. Besides, if it's Low Battery as the screen has indicated for months now... why is it continuing to operate for this long?

Sadly, we will be looking to other brands for thermostats once we finally get frustrated enough with this one. Besides, Google sells your personal data and profits from it. Best I avoid supporting that in the future anyways: and so should you.

I recommend passing on the Nest Thermostat if you like simplicity, function, and style.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Tony M.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2022","I replaced and existing Wi-fi Enabled Honeywell that never worked very well. Overall the Nest Thermostat it’s a very positive upgrade : better aesthetics , better UI and much better “smart” features meaning i am saving money right away.

If you are a Google Home / Nest user then there is a lot of added value due to the automation and reporting features . The home and away detection using Google Home App works well to reduce usage while you are away from home. the daily reporting helps you estimate your bill. and the scenario-based scheduling gives you useful control over heating to balance comfort and usage

There are some failures though . the initial wire detection failed , i believe due to firmware issues . also my furnace has a semi automated fan, so the green wire detection failed while the timed fan was enabled . after 3 iterations the setup completed fine and the unit has been working great . Once active, my furnace now cycles less frequently which reduces noise in the house

the device UX is great but not intuitive for guests . yet another “one click does everything “ UI that takes time to understand . This could be good if you don’t want guests to fiddle

Finally, the Google HOME UI is very clumsy for basic features like setting schedules and reading the temperature . the app has too many features and functions that get in the way of basic thermostat usage . I recommend commanding via google assistant or setting hold temperature via the Device UI. Once you set a schedule , you won’t be adjusting temps often so it’s a minor hindrance .

Overall it’s a very positive purchase and with the rebate and cost savings you’ll save at least $100 in the first year . It’s a classy device —easily the best looking Thermostat on the market with the glossy mirrored finish and high contrast display .

All in I highly recommend it with some reservations that will likely be cleaned up with software revisions . If you are eligible for a rebate or a heavy Google user, it’s an obvious upgrade to pursue",4.0 out of 5 stars

CF,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2022","I really liked the presentation of this device, it is clean and well built, although the software is atrocious. Google Home is so convoluted that make you feel an idiot because all you want to do is set up the thermostat temperature range.

By default the device require wifi to even activate; but the process is simple. Overall you will have hard time depending if your AC/heater has the blue wire or not (which is the one carrying the power from what I can understand reading comments online). This device has its own set of batteries but I had hard time setting up my system because it was complaining that a wire was not set (yellow; which was set); so reading online I found that the software require the blue wire connected/shorted to be physically connected to the device, for the system to work. Please check online about this issue and you will find very detailed instructions about how to solve it.

Clearly the issue is purely on the software side: the app ask you to tell how many wires you have, so you need to connect the blue wire but tell the app you do not have it connected; and magically the thermostat will work. YMMV depending on your AC/heater system of course; they have different number of wires so check with someone knowledgeable.

Other than that; setting up a simple range of temp for the whole day was a challenge, because this thing is so smart that it think that you need 4 different setup for different time of the day, as if you want to keep your temperature constant. After a lot of jumps and hoops, I was able to keep the bloody thing in a range where it turn on only when it is too hot or too cold, and stay off the rest of the time.

Also not sure why the option to set a range is disabled by default, but I assume it is because people use those for AC only and not for heating and AC combo? My system has a combo for AC and heater so I needed the setting that turn on heater when too cold, and AC when too hot; and had to dig in the settings to change this, while it should be a simple option right on the main app page.

The controls on the unit are OK; there are no buttons and the screen is not touch screen, you have a strip on the right side which is hard to use unless you got some sort of dexterity or your fingertips are super conductive I guess. I am a tech person for living and this interface was quite weird to handle; would rather have 3 buttons to do everything instead of the strip but once you know how to handle the device, it is usable.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Nathan Perkins,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023","This thermostat is excellent when integrated with Google Home. Using the new script editor feature, we have nearly full control over the settings based on any trigger we like.

The in-app temperature scheduling works well.

The only thing missing is full control over the fan. The fan scheduling options are limited to running it every day, between a start and end time, and running it for a specific duration in each hour. For example, you can schedule it between 2pm to 8pm by running it for 15 minutes every hour, or for ""60 minutes every hour"", which basically enables it full-time.

The fan cannot be enabled or disabled with automation so there's no ability to:

- Turn off the fan when home presence is away.
- Enable the fan when home presence is home.
- Enable the fan when upstairs is much hotter than downstairs.
- Etc.

The fan can be manually turned on or turned on via the app, but it has to be for a specific amount of time, like 30 minutes, 8 hours, etc.

We've accepted that we will have to manage the fan ourselves by manually turning it on when needed.

The device looks nice and is fun to tap, but it’s not easy to use and takes some time to figure out.

I like the schedules you can set up and how you can add favorites like “home” “away” traveling” “sleep” “etc”. But I COULD NOT figure out how to turn my thermostat off when I was out of town for 2 weeks in the middle of summer which was very frustrating given no one needed my house to be cooled.

It’s a nice product but if I were to do this again, I would probably choose a more user friendly thermostat.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Masha,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2022","I was dreading installing this. Thought to myself - I am handy but am I that handy?! Was putting off purchasing because I was thinking install would be a nightmare! Electric and plumbing - both Ararat’s make me pause… My house was built in 2016 so not that old. I have no idea how much harder install it like be if you own an older home. Picture of the inside of my old Honeywell thermostat is attached / one of those just regular standard thermostats. I did check comparability prior to purchase - seemed ok. I read the instructions first and followed them precisely! And it was easy actually. Took about 30 minutes which included taking the old one off as well. Works great as expected / anticipated / described. Word of advice- do this in the day time and good lighting. Or have someone hold a flashlight while you are installing. You are going to be turning off the power prior to the install, so you need another source of light to see what you are doing. All in all good experience so far. I need to patch up a small hole where the old thermostat was but not a big deal - see picture. Recommend purchasing. And I think this is my longest review ever. Maybe lol.",5.0 out of 5 stars

This new one was installed, firmware updated, up and running no lie in like 15 minutes, I am a little disappointed it was so easy as my wife looked at me and said “that’s it ?” If you’re wondering this is the Fog Color and my wall is painted Sherwin Williams “Anew Gray” and they pair well together.

Johnd,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2024","We purchased two of these for our new home to replace Honeywell thermostats that we thought were difficult. After three hours of attempting to program through the app on our phones, we finally had to wait for our son to come visit so he could install them. He is extremely tech savvy and it took him two hours to load onto one phone. We would like to have had them on two phones but apparently that is not an option. After YouTube videos and about two hours, I managed to set a schedule for the winter with the heat coming on at certain time and going off at a certain time. We have now switched into spring, and are in need of some AC and after again, hours of struggling through the app on our phone, and YouTube videos, no matter what we set one of our ACs to it kept coming on heat, even though we had it on the cool setting and at 70. It was 76° in the house so it should’ve cooled but instead it just kept giving us heat. We finally just shut the breaker off for that AC so that our house wouldn’t be 80° before we had company arriving. Yesterday we removed it and put the Honeywell back in, and are very glad of it simplicity. My advice is that these are not very user-friendly at all. Unfortunately, we are two months past our return date so an expensive lesson. Hope this helps you not make the same mistake that we did.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2022","It's a nice product but I have to ding it a couple of stars because after changing the password to my network the thermostat became disconnected. You would think it would be relatively straightforward to reconnect with the app. This is after all a Google product and surely they can design a simple way to reconnect a device to a wifi network. Surprisingly this is not the case. You have to remove the device from the app, rescan the QR, and then navigate to the wifi setup. Obviously this is not optimal but in my case even this didn't work and I had to do a factory reset before being able to reconnect to my network. In addition to the frustration and lost time all the thermostat usage data was lost.

My only complaint is that the test on Google said my system was compatible and then when I went to install it, it said it wasn’t. Once I figured out that my system was pretty basic (yellow line was also labeled as W2, no O/B labeled but used the B line for O/B) it helped to just fudge a little and it works like a charm!

The main issue is that this can only be control by google app on phone, no web option at all (and google no info that this not available just does not appear in google home web). *This does not work with the full function nest app / nest web* It is a cheap half-built solution. Given rebates abound, just go for the full function nest version that hosted by nest.com / nest app.

The guy I got clearly knew next to nothing about programming it; every time I asked a new question he put me on hold so he could look it up. The program he helped me create failed to do the simple tasks I wanted. Too many choices, zones, presets, just tech at its worst.

I bought this to add to my home that already has several Nest Learning and Nest Thermostat E thermostats. This one feels cheap and poorly engineered. The display looks and feels cheap and you have to slide your finger on the side to change the temperature vs. merely rotating the entire frame. The sliding does not work well and, as a result, changing the temp is challenging. Further, you cannot add this thermostat to the Nest app - you have to use Google Home and Google Home is just not as good as the Nest app in terms of features.

As someone proficient in various tech - this was a struggle. And definitely a problem for my older parents. The Haptic Touch system didn’t always work correctly, causing a lot of headaches in toggling back and forth between menus. Generally it worked okay in the app - but only when it was properly connected to the WiFi.

Relatedly, the biggest problem was if the WiFi or electricity went out, it would not automatically reconnect.

I have an infant, and this is expressly bad. We need it at 68 or higher. We just found the nursery had reverted to 67 without prompt.

I bought this thermostat for the specific purpose of having a way to limit the range of temperature guests could set at our short term rental; this came out of guests turning old thermostat down into the 50s. I bought this model as I did not need the learning features of the more expensive Nest Learning Model. As I have the Nest learning model at home and it is an excellent product with all the features one would expect, I assumed the only feature I would be giving up with this model was the learning capabilities. Sadly Google decided to hamstring this lower end model by not including basic functionality that even less expensive thermostats include by default. As far as design, the touch screen is a fingerprint magnet; you'll be cleaning this thing all the time.

Sadly Google would not take my units back as I no longer had the packaging; this has turned out to be an expensive experience. My advice, forget this Nest Model and either splurge on the Nest Learning or get a lower cost alternate brand that most likely has far more features.",2.0 out of 5 stars

If you do not have one, you will need to purchase and install one. It is not a simple process.Or you could have a professional do it for you (i.e. additional costs). If you attempt to install it without one, the app will tell you it is required and will not add the unit to your Google Home and will not be operational.

Even after your installation, there is a reasonable chance that if you loose power that the unit will not function correctly after the power comes back. My unit did not display the correct room temperature after such an outage. It read 12-15 degrees above the actual temp.

Gracie Dogg,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2022","Here is the best example of Not Ready: If you use the Help function within the app, you have to close the Help function to follow the directions of what to do. After you do Step 1, you have to re-open the Help function, re-ask your question to find Step 2 and then close the Help function to do Step 2. Repeat for each and every step. So basically, you have to go find a second device to read the Help steps or open a browser on your phone to look up the Help pages so that you can access the app at the same time. That's a completely non-functional use of the Help section within the app.

Tech suggestions are a pain to dig through because they often push you to pages that don't actully answer your question. Or, even though you have selected the correct thermostate out of three choices, it gives you steps that don't apply to YOUR thermostat.

Adrienne Levay,"Reviewed in Canada on December 21, 2022","I was so excited to update my 1970s thermostat with this Nest. However, upon installation, I discovered you MUST have a c-wire for internal battery management. Theoretically you don't need one but if you do not connect a c-wire it will require changing the Triple A batteries approximately every 6 or 7 days. As I don't have AC, I moved my Y wire to be my C-wire the the support of a hired plumber. Once this was done, the internal battery would still not charge. I was never able to get the internal battery to read over 3.6V which is apparently the critical voltage for the unit to be able to keep full functionality. THEN it dawned on me that even if I could get the internal charging properly when the HVAC system turned on, because I live in a 4 season climate and I don't have AC, I would not be using the system AT ALL for 4 to 5 months of the year. The battery would surely be dead after one summer if I did not keep putting Triple A batteries in it every week (because you cannot turn this unit off to conserve battery) and there is no USB charge option on this unit!! I would have a 130 dollar purchase that got me through ONE winter, if this is the case. Therefore I returned it and will look for some other options.

Tony M.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2022","I replaced and existing Wi-fi Enabled Honeywell that never worked very well. Overall the Nest Thermostat it’s a very positive upgrade : better aesthetics , better UI and much better “smart” features meaning i am saving money right away.

If you are a Google Home / Nest user then there is a lot of added value due to the automation and reporting features . The home and away detection using Google Home App works well to reduce usage while you are away from home. the daily reporting helps you estimate your bill. and the scenario-based scheduling gives you useful control over heating to balance comfort and usage

There are some failures though . the initial wire detection failed , i believe due to firmware issues . also my furnace has a semi automated fan, so the green wire detection failed while the timed fan was enabled . after 3 iterations the setup completed fine and the unit has been working great . Once active, my furnace now cycles less frequently which reduces noise in the house

the device UX is great but not intuitive for guests . yet another “one click does everything “ UI that takes time to understand . This could be good if you don’t want guests to fiddle

Finally, the Google HOME UI is very clumsy for basic features like setting schedules and reading the temperature . the app has too many features and functions that get in the way of basic thermostat usage . I recommend commanding via google assistant or setting hold temperature via the Device UI. Once you set a schedule , you won’t be adjusting temps often so it’s a minor hindrance .

Overall it’s a very positive purchase and with the rebate and cost savings you’ll save at least $100 in the first year . It’s a classy device —easily the best looking Thermostat on the market with the glossy mirrored finish and high contrast display .

All in I highly recommend it with some reservations that will likely be cleaned up with software revisions . If you are eligible for a rebate or a heavy Google user, it’s an obvious upgrade to pursue",4.0 out of 5 stars

CF,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2022","I really liked the presentation of this device, it is clean and well built, although the software is atrocious. Google Home is so convoluted that make you feel an idiot because all you want to do is set up the thermostat temperature range.

By default the device require wifi to even activate; but the process is simple. Overall you will have hard time depending if your AC/heater has the blue wire or not (which is the one carrying the power from what I can understand reading comments online). This device has its own set of batteries but I had hard time setting up my system because it was complaining that a wire was not set (yellow; which was set); so reading online I found that the software require the blue wire connected/shorted to be physically connected to the device, for the system to work. Please check online about this issue and you will find very detailed instructions about how to solve it.

Clearly the issue is purely on the software side: the app ask you to tell how many wires you have, so you need to connect the blue wire but tell the app you do not have it connected; and magically the thermostat will work. YMMV depending on your AC/heater system of course; they have different number of wires so check with someone knowledgeable.

Other than that; setting up a simple range of temp for the whole day was a challenge, because this thing is so smart that it think that you need 4 different setup for different time of the day, as if you want to keep your temperature constant. After a lot of jumps and hoops, I was able to keep the bloody thing in a range where it turn on only when it is too hot or too cold, and stay off the rest of the time.

Also not sure why the option to set a range is disabled by default, but I assume it is because people use those for AC only and not for heating and AC combo? My system has a combo for AC and heater so I needed the setting that turn on heater when too cold, and AC when too hot; and had to dig in the settings to change this, while it should be a simple option right on the main app page.

The controls on the unit are OK; there are no buttons and the screen is not touch screen, you have a strip on the right side which is hard to use unless you got some sort of dexterity or your fingertips are super conductive I guess. I am a tech person for living and this interface was quite weird to handle; would rather have 3 buttons to do everything instead of the strip but once you know how to handle the device, it is usable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Nathan Perkins,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023","This thermostat is excellent when integrated with Google Home. Using the new script editor feature, we have nearly full control over the settings based on any trigger we like.

The in-app temperature scheduling works well.

The only thing missing is full control over the fan. The fan scheduling options are limited to running it every day, between a start and end time, and running it for a specific duration in each hour. For example, you can schedule it between 2pm to 8pm by running it for 15 minutes every hour, or for ""60 minutes every hour"", which basically enables it full-time.

The fan cannot be enabled or disabled with automation so there's no ability to:

- Turn off the fan when home presence is away.
- Enable the fan when home presence is home.
- Enable the fan when upstairs is much hotter than downstairs.
- Etc.

The fan can be manually turned on or turned on via the app, but it has to be for a specific amount of time, like 30 minutes, 8 hours, etc.

We've accepted that we will have to manage the fan ourselves by manually turning it on when needed.

I have 2 units running for a year now without a C wire. I recently changed the batteries proactively even though the units did not indicate a need.

They come without in the box instructions. My knee-jerk reaction was to pack it up and send it back, but I decided to use the app and proceed that way. That works just fine. Installation is simple. I took it slow making sure I followed everything exact so if anything went wrong it wasn't user error.

Outside of my phone and TV I don't have a lot of respect for smart devices. My home is filled with them. Mostly useless things like my smart dishwasher, stove, and washing machine, that simply tell me when they're done. Is that really smart? This smart device is and you need it.

The setup of the device and app is doable even for a noob. Those who wrote how hard it is probably had other issues.

Why do you need a smart thermostat? 1) Not needing to adjust the temps when you leave the house is big. 2) When that cold snap happens, not waking up to a freezing house is another. 3) It is nice to know how much the heat and air run. Just knowing that might influence your habits.

Why you don't need a smart thermostat. You don't need to adjust your home's temps while you are away. Not really. You've already programmed it that when you're gone, and it knows you're gone, it will lower go into eco mode. You don't need to check the temps. But if that makes a thrill run up your spine guess what? This thermostat can do that.

There are some nice eco reports that this Nest generates as well. I like these but they are like infotainment. They are interesting, but I'm not going to act on them. I want the temperatures a certain way in my house (I work out of my home too) and my computer gear must be kept cool. But it did influence how I set my eco mode and made me power down my computers while away and at night to conserve energy.

I have 2 of the same model. One on each level. One of them crashes every few days in a peculiar way. It stops logging eco data and becomes unresponsive to the app, but still reports being connected to the network and continues to function properly. Resetting it restores function. I haven't contacted CS because I just don't want to spend the time.

This is odd and very hard to troubleshoot and the only reason I am deducting a star. The same issue has happened to the other unit but only 3 times in a year. Both have very strong wifi connections.

Ash N,"Reviewed in Canada on August 17, 2022","The thermostat is good looking, with the neat mirror finish and a bright easy to read display. It was also relatively easy to install, however this location was already previously set up with a Lyric smart thermostat so all necessary provisions were already present including the C-wire.

Actually doing stuff on the thermostat itself is not a great experience, you would think that it has touch sensors all around the outside and you would ""spin"" your hand around the edge like other Nest models, but no only the right side registers touch and is very finicky at that. Sometimes swipes register, sometimes taps to select register, but other times they don't. Thankfully however, aside from initial setup, the rest of controlling afterwards can be done via your phone instead.

App functionality works great, the unit has very stable WiFi connection, and there is a lot of features and scheduling functionality within the Google Home app that if you're somewhat competent at tech (specifically smart home and using Google's app) isn't too hard to figure app. It's much better than trying to do things via the thermostat's controls.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Lauran,"Reviewed in Canada on October 17, 2022","My condo had instructions for the older version of this the thermostat so I thought, how hard could it be to install? HARD. Sooo unnecessarily difficult. Basically Google doesn’t want you to install it yourself. My old thermostat didn’t have labels which might have been part of the issue. If yours does then the Google Home app will walk you through what goes where. I wasn’t especially impressed with the Google app for setting default temperatures, it’s really not user friendly. I’d recommend starting with the defaults and adjusting once it’s set up. Now that I’ve gotten past all that it’s all I could ask for. It does look nice. I didn’t realize “fog” was the green colour but I really like it. It’s just getting through the installation, that may kill you.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Masha,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2022","I was dreading installing this. Thought to myself - I am handy but am I that handy?! Was putting off purchasing because I was thinking install would be a nightmare! Electric and plumbing - both Ararat’s make me pause… My house was built in 2016 so not that old. I have no idea how much harder install it like be if you own an older home. Picture of the inside of my old Honeywell thermostat is attached / one of those just regular standard thermostats. I did check comparability prior to purchase - seemed ok. I read the instructions first and followed them precisely! And it was easy actually. Took about 30 minutes which included taking the old one off as well. Works great as expected / anticipated / described. Word of advice- do this in the day time and good lighting. Or have someone hold a flashlight while you are installing. You are going to be turning off the power prior to the install, so you need another source of light to see what you are doing. All in all good experience so far. I need to patch up a small hole where the old thermostat was but not a big deal - see picture. Recommend purchasing. And I think this is my longest review ever.

IVAN ITURRALDE,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2023","I am upgrading from a gen 2 Nest that died and just will not turn on. I am beyond amazed how easy it was to install this new one. I do have a “Blue C Common” wire that I had installed for the Gen 2 as it would battery drain all the time. This screen is super bright FYI, don’t let the mirror fool you it’s very clear and bright!

This new one was installed, firmware updated, up and running no lie in like 15 minutes, I am a little disappointed it was so easy as my wife looked at me and said “that’s it ?” If you’re wondering this is the Fog Color and my wall is painted Sherwin Williams “Anew Gray” and they pair well together.

Gary,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2021","I'm a bit mystified by the number of reviewers complaining about the lack of installation instructions or needing a C wire. The Google Home app takes you through installation step-by-step. Installation is basically this: turn off the HVAC circuit breakers, remove old thermostat making sure to label the wires as you disconnect them, connect the wires to the same terminal letters as the old thermostat, pull the Nest battery plastic barrier to allow batteries to make contact, turn the circuit breakers back on, and then use the Google Home app to set the thermostat controls. I have a relatively new Trane HVAC gas system which uses wires G, Y, W, and R. The Nest works fine with no C wire. The entire process to remove and replace the thermostat took about 35 minutes. The only additional requirement is installing the Nest thermostat skill on Alexa if you want to allow voice control of the Nest through Alexa. It's a great thermostat. The Google Home app allows simple setup. With Alexa, it's easy to override any presets simply by telling Alexa to change the temperature or to switch from heating to cooling, or vice versa. A nice feature of the Nest is that when you set whatever temperature you want at a given time, the thermostat will pre-heat or cool so the target temperature is achieved when the specified time is reached. In case you're concerned about what happens in the event of an internet outage, don't be. The thermostat retains all of its settings and can be changed manually on the thermostat itself should you experience an internet outage. Finally, the thermostat temperature precisely matches two other accurate temperature gauges I tested it against.",5.0 out of 5 stars

misiro,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024","Everything about this thermostat is a downgrade from the other Nest thermostats. I have had every version of the Nest thermostat and this one is the worst.

1) The controls are less intuitive. The spinning wheel is what made the Nest thermostat so easy to use and is the reason why the circle shape worked. If you remove the spinning to navigate the thermostat, what is the point of it being round like this? Instead, you have to use a touch-sensitive panel on the side which uses swipe and tap gestures. It sucks.

2) The app is a downgrade. You can no longer use the more intuitive Nest app. You have to use the Google Home app with this thermostat which requires more taps and searching through menus for simple control.

3) The colors are pretty, but it actually looks cheaper than the Nest Learning Thermostat or Nest Thermostat E. In my opinion, the best looking and most functional model was the E, which they have discontinued for reasons which baffle me.

5) I guess when we received it the battery was very low. It's been months of seeing ""Very Low Battery"" on the screen. Yes, I will replace the battery (a AAA), but it should come with a battery that has some charge. Not a good luck to ship things which, when first powered on, immediately says the battery needs to be replaced. Besides, if it's Low Battery as the screen has indicated for months now... why is it continuing to operate for this long?

Sadly, we will be looking to other brands for thermostats once we finally get frustrated enough with this one. Besides, Google sells your personal data and profits from it. Best I avoid supporting that in the future anyways: and so should you.

I recommend passing on the Nest Thermostat if you like simplicity, function, and style.",1.0 out of 5 stars

KIWH,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2024","We have an older gen version of the nest that we love.

As someone proficient in various tech - this was a struggle. And definitely a problem for my older parents. The Haptic Touch system didn’t always work correctly, causing a lot of headaches in toggling back and forth between menus. Generally it worked okay in the app - but only when it was properly connected to the WiFi.

Relatedly, the biggest problem was if the WiFi or electricity went out, it would not automatically reconnect. We installed this system in a vacation house - and if either of those issues occurred we were unable to control or change the temperature settings remotely, defeating the purpose of the wireless system.

It was 76° in the house so it should’ve cooled but instead it just kept giving us heat.

Demolish,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2024","Cutting right to the chase, I hate this thermostat. It has made a process I've never spent more than a moment thinking about (setting the temperature in my home) into a nightmare of reading and re-reading the directions then ending up exasperated because this won't do the simplest thing any thermostat should do- stay at the temperature you set.
Yes, you read that right. You cannot set and forget the temp for more than 24 hours. So let's say you plan for an upcoming coldsnap by leaving your upstairs at 65 degrees, which is a comfortable sleeping temp and a bit chilly in the day but nonetheless a temp that won't have your heat pump running constantly or worse yet, going into emergency heating mode. Don't get me started on what it'll do when we go on vacation.
I find myself waking in the middle of the night, or closing my eyes to go to sleep only to realize that yes, once again I need to set and hold the temp otherwise it will jump up to some preset temperature based upon what? I have no idea. If ""eco"" mode is chosen there is no way to adjust those temps either. Apparently Nest believes they know what eco means more than the homeowner does.
My newer more advanced Nest thermostat downstairs also has eco mode but it can be adjusted to hold a temp and supposedly it ""learns"" whatever that means.
Since replacing a Honeywell digital thermostat with this monster my utility bills increased by 1/3! Can I prove it's due to this device? No I cannot. But I can sure suspect it.

Steph,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2023","I absolutely loved my nest for the first two years I have had it. It did occasionally disconnect from the wifi, but was easy to reconnect. The warranty on it went out about 6 months ago, and for the last three months it has decided to go haywire.

Every so often, the thermostat decides that it is not connected to any power system and refuses to operate the HVAC system. I have had my regular HVAC guys (who installed the current HVAC only a few years ago) come over and check the system, and they found nothing wrong with it. They both said they did not like google nest thermostats because they can cause tons of issues, but mine seemed to be working perfectly fine at the time of them checking everything.

I had not had any issue with it until this passed Thursday night, when I woke up because it was cold in my house. I went to turn up the heater through the app, but noticed the HVAC was not coming on. I got up and tried to turn the heat up manually, but the thermostat stated it was not connected to power and gave error code E298. This was the code I also got a few months ago when I had this issue the first time. I turned the switch off at the HVAC for the remainder of the weekend, as I was out of town and knew it would not get cold enough to warrant the heater turning on while I was away. I have attempted 4 times tonight (Sunday) to get the thermostat to connect to power, but to no avail.

misiro,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024","Everything about this thermostat is a downgrade from the other Nest thermostats. I have had every version of the Nest thermostat and this one is the worst.

1) The controls are less intuitive. The spinning wheel is what made the Nest thermostat so easy to use and is the reason why the circle shape worked. If you remove the spinning to navigate the thermostat, what is the point of it being round like this? Instead, you have to use a touch-sensitive panel on the side which uses swipe and tap gestures. It sucks.

2) The app is a downgrade. You can no longer use the more intuitive Nest app. You have to use the Google Home app with this thermostat which requires more taps and searching through menus for simple control.

3) The colors are pretty, but it actually looks cheaper than the Nest Learning Thermostat or Nest Thermostat E. In my opinion, the best looking and most functional model was the E, which they have discontinued for reasons which baffle me.

5) I guess when we received it the battery was very low. It's been months of seeing ""Very Low Battery"" on the screen. Yes, I will replace the battery (a AAA), but it should come with a battery that has some charge. Not a good luck to ship things which, when first powered on, immediately says the battery needs to be replaced. Besides, if it's Low Battery as the screen has indicated for months now... why is it continuing to operate for this long?

Sadly, we will be looking to other brands for thermostats once we finally get frustrated enough with this one. Besides, Google sells your personal data and profits from it. Best I avoid supporting that in the future anyways: and so should you.

I recommend passing on the Nest Thermostat if you like simplicity, function, and style.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Tony M.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2022","I replaced and existing Wi-fi Enabled Honeywell that never worked very well. Overall the Nest Thermostat it’s a very positive upgrade : better aesthetics , better UI and much better “smart” features meaning i am saving money right away.

If you are a Google Home / Nest user then there is a lot of added value due to the automation and reporting features . The home and away detection using Google Home App works well to reduce usage while you are away from home. the daily reporting helps you estimate your bill. and the scenario-based scheduling gives you useful control over heating to balance comfort and usage

There are some failures though . the initial wire detection failed , i believe due to firmware issues . also my furnace has a semi automated fan, so the green wire detection failed while the timed fan was enabled . after 3 iterations the setup completed fine and the unit has been working great . Once active, my furnace now cycles less frequently which reduces noise in the house

the device UX is great but not intuitive for guests . yet another “one click does everything “ UI that takes time to understand . This could be good if you don’t want guests to fiddle

Finally, the Google HOME UI is very clumsy for basic features like setting schedules and reading the temperature . the app has too many features and functions that get in the way of basic thermostat usage . I recommend commanding via google assistant or setting hold temperature via the Device UI. Once you set a schedule , you won’t be adjusting temps often so it’s a minor hindrance .

Overall it’s a very positive purchase and with the rebate and cost savings you’ll save at least $100 in the first year . It’s a classy device —easily the best looking Thermostat on the market with the glossy mirrored finish and high contrast display .

All in I highly recommend it with some reservations that will likely be cleaned up with software revisions . If you are eligible for a rebate or a heavy Google user, it’s an obvious upgrade to pursue",4.0 out of 5 stars

CF,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2022","I really liked the presentation of this device, it is clean and well built, although the software is atrocious. Google Home is so convoluted that make you feel an idiot because all you want to do is set up the thermostat temperature range.

By default the device require wifi to even activate; but the process is simple. Overall you will have hard time depending if your AC/heater has the blue wire or not (which is the one carrying the power from what I can understand reading comments online). This device has its own set of batteries but I had hard time setting up my system because it was complaining that a wire was not set (yellow; which was set); so reading online I found that the software require the blue wire connected/shorted to be physically connected to the device, for the system to work. Please check online about this issue and you will find very detailed instructions about how to solve it.

Clearly the issue is purely on the software side: the app ask you to tell how many wires you have, so you need to connect the blue wire but tell the app you do not have it connected; and magically the thermostat will work. YMMV depending on your AC/heater system of course; they have different number of wires so check with someone knowledgeable.

Other than that; setting up a simple range of temp for the whole day was a challenge, because this thing is so smart that it think that you need 4 different setup for different time of the day, as if you want to keep your temperature constant. After a lot of jumps and hoops, I was able to keep the bloody thing in a range where it turn on only when it is too hot or too cold, and stay off the rest of the time.

Also not sure why the option to set a range is disabled by default, but I assume it is because people use those for AC only and not for heating and AC combo? My system has a combo for AC and heater so I needed the setting that turn on heater when too cold, and AC when too hot; and had to dig in the settings to change this, while it should be a simple option right on the main app page.

The controls on the unit are OK; there are no buttons and the screen is not touch screen, you have a strip on the right side which is hard to use unless you got some sort of dexterity or your fingertips are super conductive I guess. I am a tech person for living and this interface was quite weird to handle; would rather have 3 buttons to do everything instead of the strip but once you know how to handle the device, it is usable.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Nathan Perkins,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023","This thermostat is excellent when integrated with Google Home. Using the new script editor feature, we have nearly full control over the settings based on any trigger we like.

The in-app temperature scheduling works well.

The only thing missing is full control over the fan. The fan scheduling options are limited to running it every day, between a start and end time, and running it for a specific duration in each hour. For example, you can schedule it between 2pm to 8pm by running it for 15 minutes every hour, or for ""60 minutes every hour"", which basically enables it full-time.

The fan cannot be enabled or disabled with automation so there's no ability to:

- Turn off the fan when home presence is away.
- Enable the fan when home presence is home.
- Enable the fan when upstairs is much hotter than downstairs.
- Etc.

The fan can be manually turned on or turned on via the app, but it has to be for a specific amount of time, like 30 minutes, 8 hours, etc.

We've accepted that we will have to manage the fan ourselves by manually turning it on when needed.

My thermostat worked fine as a thermostat, but neither I nor the HVAC installer could get the Nest Thermostat to connect to WIFI or to the Google Home App. The installer said this Nest Thermostat and the Google Home App that controls it are finnicky and he's had lots of calls for help to get them to work on the App. He said he could come back in a few days for no charge and spend more time trying to get the App to connect to the Nest Thermostat. I decided to return this one and buy a better Smart Thermostat.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Angela Texas,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2024","This thing was a major pain to install. You need to hire someone that really really knows about these things. Lots of wires and it took me 3 different people before I actually got it working. And the heater still only works on emergency heat and there is no option to have the system just circulate the air like my last Thermostat did

And because it took me 3 installers to get it working, I missed the window to get the rebate that I was supposed to get from my utility company.. which is the only reason I purchased it.. and I hate it.

It only gets 2 stars because at least I can control it from my phone and monitor usage.",2.0 out of 5 stars
M. E. Wildey,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2023","I purchased this one for my boyfriend for this coming Christmas. He has been pining after one since he sees the ease and functionality that mine provides. I can shut my a/c off if I forgot when I left the house, and conversely I can turn it on before I return home. There is a weekly schedule that you can program temperatures to change at different times of the day if you wish to leave the system on, yet keep the output at minimum usage. I love that there are different colors now, too. Too late for me, I have basic black, but ordered the grey for him-I'm sure he will love it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kathryn Van Arcken,"Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2023","The installation process was horrible. I felt bad my HVAC guy had to sit around for an hour just trying to figure out how to connect this thing to wifi.

The Google Home app freezes constantly and has glitches. This is really frustrating at times when you actually need an adjustment of temp.

The device looks nice and is fun to tap, but it’s not easy to use and takes some time to figure out.

I like the schedules you can set up and how you can add favorites like “home” “away” traveling” “sleep” “etc”. But I COULD NOT figure out how to turn my thermostat off when I was out of town for 2 weeks in the middle of summer which was very frustrating given no one needed my house to be cooled.

It’s a nice product but if I were to do this again, I would probably choose a more user friendly thermostat.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Masha,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2022","I was dreading installing this. Thought to myself - I am handy but am I that handy?! Was putting off purchasing because I was thinking install would be a nightmare! Electric and plumbing - both Ararat’s make me pause… My house was built in 2016 so not that old. I have no idea how much harder install it like be if you own an older home. Picture of the inside of my old Honeywell thermostat is attached / one of those just regular standard thermostats. I did check comparability prior to purchase - seemed ok. I read the instructions first and followed them precisely! And it was easy actually. Took about 30 minutes which included taking the old one off as well. Works great as expected / anticipated / described. Word of advice- do this in the day time and good lighting. Or have someone hold a flashlight while you are installing. You are going to be turning off the power prior to the install, so you need another source of light to see what you are doing. All in all good experience so far. I need to patch up a small hole where the old thermostat was but not a big deal - see picture. Recommend purchasing. And I think this is my longest review ever. Maybe lol.",5.0 out of 5 stars

This new one was installed, firmware updated, up and running no lie in like 15 minutes, I am a little disappointed it was so easy as my wife looked at me and said “that’s it ?” If you’re wondering this is the Fog Color and my wall is painted Sherwin Williams “Anew Gray” and they pair well together.

Johnd,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2024","We purchased two of these for our new home to replace Honeywell thermostats that we thought were difficult. After three hours of attempting to program through the app on our phones, we finally had to wait for our son to come visit so he could install them. He is extremely tech savvy and it took him two hours to load onto one phone. We would like to have had them on two phones but apparently that is not an option. After YouTube videos and about two hours, I managed to set a schedule for the winter with the heat coming on at certain time and going off at a certain time. We have now switched into spring, and are in need of some AC and after again, hours of struggling through the app on our phone, and YouTube videos, no matter what we set one of our ACs to it kept coming on heat, even though we had it on the cool setting and at 70. It was 76° in the house so it should’ve cooled but instead it just kept giving us heat. We finally just shut the breaker off for that AC so that our house wouldn’t be 80° before we had company arriving. Yesterday we removed it and put the Honeywell back in, and are very glad of it simplicity. My advice is that these are not very user-friendly at all. Unfortunately, we are two months past our return date so an expensive lesson. Hope this helps you not make the same mistake that we did.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2022","It's a nice product but I have to ding it a couple of stars because after changing the password to my network the thermostat became disconnected. You would think it would be relatively straightforward to reconnect with the app. This is after all a Google product and surely they can design a simple way to reconnect a device to a wifi network. Surprisingly this is not the case. You have to remove the device from the app, rescan the QR, and then navigate to the wifi setup. Obviously this is not optimal but in my case even this didn't work and I had to do a factory reset before being able to reconnect to my network. In addition to the frustration and lost time all the thermostat usage data was lost.

My only complaint is that the test on Google said my system was compatible and then when I went to install it, it said it wasn’t. Once I figured out that my system was pretty basic (yellow line was also labeled as W2, no O/B labeled but used the B line for O/B) it helped to just fudge a little and it works like a charm!

Jakob,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024",The packaging was open and everything was just thrown in the box. The box was missing all of the installation hardware. It’s was clearly a returned item that somebody slopped in the box.,1.0 out of 5 stars
Miranda,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2024","Product focuses too much on being eco friendly and does not actually go to temperature set. IE I have it set to 72 and the house is 76 and it’s not even running.

You also can’t just have the fan on. You have to set it on for a timer AND you have to have AC or heat on to run the fan.

I would not buy again.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Boardgames are Awesome,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2022","I've been using this for 4 months and STILL can't get the location-aware feature to work probably when my phone is home or leaves! I have to manually change the setting and it's obnoxious! The schedules work fine, but this is supposed to use my phone to know when I'm home (like on my day off) and it RARELY does -even with my walking by the thermostat, it usually takes around an hour for it to realize that it needs to change 😡🤦🏼‍♂️",3.0 out of 5 stars
sarah poppen,"Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2023",Bought this to replace an older thermostat and love it. Its so easy to use and like being able to change the thermostat with our phone.,5.0 out of 5 stars
ChSm,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2023","without a C wire it will not act as wifi controllable thermostat (well not after the battery runs down which is quick). google sells a conversion kit - BUT - you will need access to your HVAC unit itself to install that (not just the filter vent). not recommend as it misleading in saying C wire not needed - without it is works as a dumb digital thermostat.

*Update*
Did get the google power adapter (extra cost) to make this work. The side swipe control is very awkward and over sensitive - not at all like the full nest version rotating ring. The main issue is that this can only be control by google app on phone, no web option at all (and google no info that this not available just does not appear in google home web). *This does not work with the full function nest app / nest web* It is a cheap half-built solution. Given rebates abound, just go for the full function nest version that hosted by nest.com / nest app.

Changed rating to 1-star",1.0 out of 5 stars

BillV,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2024",Wish I had something nice to say but this only lasted a year before I had to go a different route. It constantly disconnected from the WiFi and didn’t work on the app,1.0 out of 5 stars
mushimoshi,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023",Our original ac sensor unit was giving out (buttons no longer worked). The Nest Thermostat was easy to install and has a beautiful aesthetic. Highly recommend buying a base plate to cover up where the original sensor unit rest.,5.0 out of 5 stars
J. R.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2022","I just set it and forget about it, it knows when I am away, lowers the temp and really saves a lot of money. I can turn it on remote have the house cold or warm before I arrive. I just love the intelligence in this product. Google is amazing! it also really looks nice as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Wolf S. Schramm,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2023","They redesigned the controls, there is a very counter intuitive control, is a slider touch sensitive on the right side, that you can't even see standing in front of it, so if you are a first time user, you should definitely read the stupid manual.

The control for the temperature and the menu, is a touch sensitive slider, people that have never encountered this design, have the hardest time using it, most of the time they give up, how do I know? Try running a rental unit with one of these, people won't stop calling you to figure out how to use the damn thing.

I hope whoever designed this gets fired, seriously.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Joe,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2021",Setup was a little daunting it said it wasn’t compatible with my system but I hooked it up anyway and it works fine. The nest app is useless everything is moving to google home app. No baseplate?,4.0 out of 5 stars
