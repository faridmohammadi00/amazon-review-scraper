TennisDrum,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2017","I finally jumped onto the Nest bandwagon and love it. Easy to install in a few minutes. Came with a back plate to cover up the area my old thermostat covered. Set up is a breeze and really well thought out. Quickly learns your patterns and can be set to anticipate the temperature changes so that when you wake up in the morning the adjustment has already been made. Part of set up is telling it your ZIP code, so it knows the weather (and can tell you) so it anticipates how hard the system needs to work to heat or cool and whether it will need to be on AC or Heat. iPhone app is a breeze and well thought out.

Since getting the Nest, I've also purchased some WeMo devices and they all work together well. The WeMo app found the Next thermostat on our network and now I can use the single iPhone app to control all of that (don't have to go back to the Nest app if I don't want to). Haven't gotten the Amazon Echo/Dot but that's likely next and will make using these devices even easier.",5.0 out of 5 stars
bobfp,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2024",The previous Nest didn’t last but a year. Google had some issues with a number of them. Ours was part of a new HVAC System that we had installed. Went through hoops over the phone. Finally we were offered a replacement free. However the Google representative wanted our credit card information and said once we returned the bad one they would credit our account. Told him that I would not go that way and that didn’t make sense and politely hung up. I just purchased another through Amazon. Works great so far.,5.0 out of 5 stars

C. Roberts,"Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2020","I really liked Nest better before Google bought them. The software on the device was simple, elegant and worked the first time. Not so with Google - it takes at least two or three tries to get these Nest devices added to your existing account. I have no idea why it fails the first two, three and fourth times...and then magically it works - it's just a bad design and does not give you confidence in the device. The hardware installation was easy - but Google needs to update the package instructions...you guys stopped including the cool little screw driver that used to come with the Nest devices but you left it in the installation page as a part you include in the packaging. Once it's up and running, its great....but you need to be patient with it and not give up after the first couple of failed phone app equipment adds. Keep your phone is close proximity to the device - it attempts to add it that way - and sometimes it fails and have to keep trying....with each try it gets a bit further in the installation, finally getting on your wifi and getting it on the phone app. Overall - I loved Nest from the first day - you can see Googles hand here...and they messed up a very elegant and well designed device, but at the end of the day after a few try's it worked",4.0 out of 5 stars
HULKGAMECRIT,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024","outside the fact google dared to use motherboard components that cant survive even a year of use, theres some pretty large flaws with the app.

you cant sync ur nest to your phone in the case of a problem, you cannot connect the nest to your pc via usb to troubleshoot anything on the device even tho it has a usb port . the app cannot tell when wifi has died. it enters an endless loop of hunting for a signal or blaming ur house when the device fails its job

there no firmware updates online, so if anything bad happens during an installation or upgrade ur basically sol, this imo is unbelievable

outside all of this, the app cant easily tell if ur home via ur phone, it maybe senses only once or twice a day max meaning it always runs the ac for hours until finally entering evo mode. its a simple api call but maybe google felt like they wanted to save money so they limited the interaction. they should have come up with a better solution. its a power waster.

take away: go find a smart thermostat that aint a google product. the name of the game is useful functionality, easy programming, easy repair, and easy diagnostic. google was sloppy on everything involved and now im facing rmas because i decided to trust them",1.0 out of 5 stars

Broham Dingleberry,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2016","Easy setup (read below if you have a two wire system without a C (common) wire), awesome interface, top notch quality, what else can I say? Love that I can control so many features from my laptop and smartphone. I also have three Nest Protect smoke and CO detectors which are monitored by the same app. Nest/Google hit not just a home run, but a grand slam out of the park with these two products.

-------------------

If you have a conventional two-wire system like me (Rc and W1), this is exactly what you need to get your smart thermostat working!

When I removed my Honeywell digital thermostat (non wifi), it had only two leads connected: Rc and W1. Not knowing anything about the latest generation of wifi thermostats, I went ahead and ordered the Nest Pro Gen III thermostat. Upon setup, I ran into two codes; e73 and e74. Essentially, they had to do with no power going to the unit. my VIN and VOC were 2.50 so I dug around on the internet, which led me to this transformer.

One lead went to C (24v common) and the other to Rh (see my photo of the interface's digital connection diagram). You may need to swap between Rc and Rh if you still have a error code readout. After plugging in the transformer, the VIN AND VOC read 34.17!!! Remember to plug this transformer into a surge protected outlet to prevent a possible damaged thermostat.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Capt Bob,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023","March 2024 update: Removed 2 stars. Reason 1. The app frequently wants me to log in again. A real pain. The checkin requires me to turn on cookies and allow Javascript both of which comprises my security. In addition I greatly dislike Google’s constant spying on mre. Reason 2. I cannot turn off the Greenies programmed into the app that constantly want to invade my thermostat settings and influence what I buy.

This is the fourth one I have installed n my house. It is fairly easy to set up. The app is really good.

The thermostat as it clearly states in the description requires the C wire. However, if you have a two wire system, you can purchase an optional device that connects at the furnace and allows the thermostat to function with only two wires.

I am using this with a three remote sensors ($100 for 3 on Amazon) in my upstairs. The thermostat itself is mounted in the hall. A sensor is mounted in a different bedroom. On the app, you can see all four temperatures. The awesome feature is that the main thermostat or any one of the sensors can be chosen as the control for the temperature. One of my bedrooms runs cooler than the rest so the sensor in this bedroom is the controlling temperature.

Another feature I like is that it lights up when a person walks near it. This feature makes it easy for my wife or I to find our way to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The light is dim enough such that the sleeping partner is not disturbed.

The remote control from anywhere on the internet is a great feature as well. If you go away, you can control the thermostat from anywhere.

The learning feature works well although once in a while if we are too inactive watching tv in the evening it suddenly starts getting cold. I would not change this feature, because it can save a lot of fuel. I can put up with unintended cooling once in a while.

Making a temperatures setpoint change manually is very easy…spin the dial cw for increase or ccw for decrease.

Setting schedules is easy on the app and a little cumbersome on the dial, but possible and reasonable. I like the ability to copy one day’s schedule to another day. Given we are retired, I made one schedule, copied it and pasted it sx more times.

When you walk near the thermostat, the setpoint and actual temperature display. The setpoint is easy to see from ten feet away, to see the current temperature you need to be at normal reading distance…about three feet for me.

Being made by Google, I suspect that more data than I wish is being collected and added to thier database. I elected to minimize my exposure by putting the thermostats on my guest WiFi which limits any access to my sensitive equipment such as my computer. As a retired security industry guy, that you place all home control devices such as tv streamers (Firestick, Hulu, Apple TV, etc), appliances, power plug controllers, etc. on the guest WiFi as well. Most modern routers allow for at least one guest network.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Consumer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2023","I've been waiting to write this, because I wanted to give the thermostat some time to ""learn"". After living with it for over a year I can say there are two things I like about the thermostat, the look, and the ability to operate it remotely.
I have an irregular on-call/travel schedule so I am not home for set times and dates from week to week, but when I am home I don't want to worry about the thermostat changing the temperature for me. Depending on the settings, the Nest will eventually learn what times it thinks it needs to turn on/off Heating/AC and then start changing the temperature on it's own. Even if you're home and override that by setting it to a different temperature, it will change the temperature all on it's own. Eventually I got tired of fighting it and set the thermostat to manual mode. The learning/schedule might be better for someone that is home for set times/days throughout the week/month. I can't seem to get mine to run the fan only mode without turning on the AC or Heat. If you want to turn on the FAN only for your central air, after the fan runs for a pre-determined amount of time it will run the heat/ac as it sees fit.
The remote access feature is nice when it works. When I first set it up I registered it with an email address I use for login type memberships. I loaded the app on my phone and it worked great for the fist few months. Eventually my login stopped working and I was unable to remote operate my thermostat. When I contacted Nest support they told me I had to create and use a ""Google"" account to log in. I explained that I had been using another email account to log in for months and they advised that I was no longer allowed to use a different email because it's a google product and they're not going to change that. So now I have a google account that I really only created and use for this silly thermostat.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Rick James Bish,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2020","Installed two of thee in my RV and they are working great. The wiring for the original Thermostats was 12vdc, which is what is sent to signal the AC. I had to provide 24vac to the Nest since that is what it requires. This was done with $13 24vac transformer. I then had to turn that back into 12vdc. I did this with a set of 4 relays. The end result works great and its a huge upgrade from the original slide type thermostat, which was not accurate on temperature at all and had my AC running much longer than necessary.

My only complaint so far about this device is the restrictions on the Farsight feature. The display can obviously show multiple lines, you can tell that with the weather option, which shows a large number for current outside temp and then three smaller temps below that for later in the day. They could easily show the inside and target temp as well as fan speed all on one screen.

Be warned that in most cases you cannot just swap out your existing RV Thermostat with the Nest. Check what voltage and whether its AC or DC at your current thermostat first. If its not 24vac then you will need other components.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Stephen Bonneau,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2024","I am beyond furious with Google and their appalling customer service.

Weeks went by, and instead of resolving the issue, Google had the audacity to claim that we never returned the defective unit! As a result, they charged us a whopping $250 for the replacement. Despite our numerous attempts to prove that we did send it back, they continue to give us the runaround.

Their refusal to acknowledge their mistake and return our money is absolutely unacceptable.

Just Some Guy,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2018","I have the C wire issue, even though the install process said it would work without it. Not awesome, Nest, that is seriously false advertising.

I received a thermostat that had already been unboxed and used. The long install screws were covered in drywall dust from being installed already, and one of the small screws was missing, as were the stickers to label the wires. More on that next.

Anyway, the battery was completely drained and the thermostat took hours to charge also.

As I followed the app to install, the part came to take a picture of the current wiring, so I did that. Then I put my phone down and finished disassembling the old thermostat. When I picked up my phone, the app had signed out and lost the picture because I had to re-start the whole process. Not cool, Nest. Fortunately I was able to recover the photo by browsing the app cache on my phone, which is far too technical for most users. Overall, my experience has been very poor. I'm waiting for a C wire adapter to be delivered tomorrow to get the system working again.

B. Ogatiy,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2016","Installed easy. Then it had a blowout of some sort. Had to get a replacement. Nest recommended to call a technician, which I did and he found nothing wrong. Nest then had me add a common wire, and since that time has worked, sort of worked.

While it does work as a thermostat, the advanced features of power saving are not very good. I find that I must walk by this thermostat so that it will turn on the AC. If I'm home but don't walk by it the house slowly warms. I've set specific schedules and it sort of conforms to them, at the points set (time and temp) but not necessarily between those points.

So overall, it wasn't a simple install due to the additional wire that they claimed in the beginning wouldn't be needed, but was. Nest did offer to pay for the common wire to be installed though (I installed it myself).

I wouldn't recommend this, it's just too costly, had problems, and just doesn't work right without constant manual intervention.

It does however seem to work mostly as a manual thermometer, at least when someone is home and willing to walk by it frequently. Else it doesn't work.

For instance, at times I want it to maintain a temperature, and it won't. Yeah, just reading this makes me knock it down another star to two. It's at best a 2 star product, but mostly hype and marketing, without much substance.",2.0 out of 5 stars

The unit doesn't turn on when I get home, it still shows as away and sometimes takes a long time to figure out I'm home.
Secondly, there is a fatal w5 error that is well documented online. It's caused by a change in your WiFi settings, or a drop in speed and will cause the unit to completely drop internet connectivity. The issue is not repairable either. I've been waiting over a month now and have not received a replacement.

you cant sync ur nest to your phone in the case of a problem, you cannot connect the nest to your pc via usb to troubleshoot anything on the device even tho it has a usb port . the app cannot tell when wifi has died. it enters an endless loop of hunting for a signal or blaming ur house when the device fails its job

there no firmware updates online, so if anything bad happens during an installation or upgrade ur basically sol, this imo is unbelievable

outside all of this, the app cant easily tell if ur home via ur phone, it maybe senses only once or twice a day max meaning it always runs the ac for hours until finally entering evo mode. its a simple api call but maybe google felt like they wanted to save money so they limited the interaction. they should have come up with a better solution. its a power waster.

Their refusal to acknowledge their mistake and return our money is absolutely unacceptable.

Cat,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2022","I’ve had my Nest thermostat for over a year and was SHOCKED to find my energy costs going UP and increased maintenance required on my Lennox Furnace system.

I spent so much money on this system because I thought it was “smart,” but honestly it’s got some of the dumbest, unintuitive features and settings.

I started paying more attention to why my furnace was working so hard and found out it was short-cycling. Meaning that even though I have my furnace on a schedule, the heat clicks on throughout the day for about 1 minute, shuts off for 2-3 min, then turns BACK on for another min, and so on. (The schedule I have set is supposed to heat to 68 degrees at 9 am then drops to a set temperature of 62 degrees during the day, then heats back to 68 degrees at 6 pm and drops to a set temperature of 62 degrees overnight - sidenote: if you choose to set a temperature schedule through the nest, you can’t set a different temperature on the schedule within an hour of the initial set temperature, otherwise I would have my house heat to 68 at 9 am and then drop to 62 at 9:30 am, but no, the earliest I can set the next, lower temperature, is 10 am, a full hour after the house heats and has been maintaining the initial set temperature, so dumb!)

After I realized my system was short-cycling due to the nest thermostat, I spent hours searching through convoluted “help” articles from Nest. This is how I found out that the thermostat is constantly trying to heat the house and keep it set to the TENTH OF A DEGREE. Meaning that if I set my thermostat to heat to 68 degrees, the thermostat will assign a temperature of 68.6 degrees Fahrenheit. After it heats to that temperature, anytime it drops down to 68.5 degrees Fahrenheit, the whole system clicks on and heats the house back up to 68.6 degrees. Ideally, you’d be able to set the “hysteresis” or a timer on the thermostat (especially on a $200+ thermostat equipment) so that the temperature could be set to something like 72 degrees, heat to that temperature, and then not switch back on to heat the house for a set period of time or until the temperature in the house drops to a certain temperature like 68 degrees.

This lack of intuitive settings on the Nest is costing me a FORTUNE between furnace maintenance and increased energy costs (kind of crazy when the Nest is supposed to be so “eco friendly”!) and I’m considering switching back to my $15 Honeywell thermostat which is insane. Until they add this feature to the Nest thermostat, I warn you to steer away from this equipment!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2024","After years of wrestling with the product, I conclude the highest and best use of the Nest Learning Thermostat is as a hockey puck. The customer support is horrible. The software, user interface and functioning is much more complex than necessary. At the same time, the device will not perform simple basic functions like hold at a set temperature if you have programed a schedule. The only way to set the thermostat at a fixed temperature is to erase the schedule. This requires tediously re-creating a new schedule to use scheduling again. The learning aspect of the thermostat is primitive, illogical and completely useless. I can save energy much more effectively than a Nest thermostat. The worse function is that somehow the thermostat turns itself down when I need heat the most. An example is on an early, dark, cold winter morning getting out of the shower when the bathroom should be warming but IS NOT. After being set low all night according to my programed schedule, I sent the time to turn on and call for heat. Oh no! A little message appears and says something like, ""Peek Time"" and the temperature is automatically set lower by Nest software. So I step out of the shower freezing when the bathroom should be getting warmer. This is downright obnoxious and unhealthy. Except for keeping the temperature elevated and wasting energy all night, I can't figure out how to stop this nonsense. The imbedded software goes out of its way to make life worse.

Angela M Stensby,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2023","I would never buy this - or any nest. I would bet its feature's are relatively worthless for most people living in a home day to day. Is it really that hard and time consuming to set a thermostat? I am ready to take a hammer to the nest that came with my 1000 sq ft condo - it doesn't matter what temp I set it to it just goes back to the ""eco"" temperatures and then my A/C or furnace have to run for ridiculously long time to get back to the temp I want. I guess it's not smart enough to realize that I am actually still home (and would like the temp to be 73) even though I am not walking in front of it every 30 minutes. Its not smart enough to realize which unit is should run, A/C or furnace and it's not smart enough to know to run the fan so the air doesn't get stale. Additionally I don't know how ""smart"" it is to have daily ""home"" and ""away"" temperatures, when it was proven back in the nineties that it's more efficient to just leave your thermostat at a set temperature day in and day out instead of having temps for when you are awake vs sleeping or home vs at work or day vs night. Fortunately I didn't take a hammer to it, because I found a Youtube video that showed the 6 steps to turn it into a manual thermostat - so no I would not buy this and end up paying for features that are essentially useless and will most likely not save a person anything time or money wise.

Ashley,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2022","I bought two of these and installed it in my new house. First few months they worked as expected but within 6 months the upstairs stopped connecting to the wifi and after many attempts and help from my brother (a techie electrical engineering and comp sci graduate) who has one himself, we couldn't fix it and I called google customer service and got exhausted from their questions and wait time (got young kids) and decided to live with it not connecting. Then just another few months or so later the second one also stopped connecting. At this point again I waited to get help from different people, and again it was confirmed the item is defective. I then tried customer service and again gave up with waiting and decided to live without it having wifi and just changing it manually on dial (again b/c I have no time). Well problem is that it often goes changing temperatures as it goes into it's own timings on when it wants to cool or heat and so every time I want to adjust it, I have to get up and walk over to it. It also random times connects onto the wifi but not the app. Well this was an annoyance as it often went to it's own temperature settings and I can hear it working and it wakes me up at night when the air starts blowing all a sudden. Again I just lived with this but within the last year, it's also gotten to the point where the temperature readings are off by a good 6 degrees. I had my HVAC company come and verify this by measuring it with their portable thermostat. They said my actual system in house is fine and all maintenance is up to speed (we have a 2014 constructed house), but the control is with the thermostat and that itself has the wrong temperature by a significant variance. He tried to call Google himself to help me get support while he was with us but after an hour on the phone, he hung up and had to go for his next customer. He suggested getting an ecobee as he said many people have similar issue with Nest. He thinks it may be that it's connecting to the wifi is heating up its own device and then causing the reading to be off. Anyway, I've tried several times to get help from customer service and rather than admit they have a defective product that we paid over $200 each for and help us by providing a refund or an exchange, they just have us try endless troubleshooting steps until we run out of time or patience. I was told to read off numerous things off my device and then try removing the C wire, which I wasn't comfortable touching in case I get electrocuted or I break it. At the end of the day, no one should have to do numerous steps like this after buying a thermostat for $200 to get it to work properly.",1.0 out of 5 stars

RNW7,"Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2022","I purchased two Nest 3rd Gen Learning thermostats through my local electric utility co-op in June 2022. They both worked fine for a couple months, then, without warning, I started getting low battery warnings on one of them. Subsequent troubleshooting with Google revealed a defective unit with battery charge retention issues and I was issued an advanced exchange RMA for a replacement. Note: The only replacement offered is a refurbished unit and they put a credit hold on one of your credit cards until they receive the defective unit. A week after that issue was resolved the second original thermostat started giving a W5 error, a known issue with these thermostats that involves a failure of the internal Wi-Fi chip. When this happens, the thermostat can only be controlled manually, not remotely through the app. Another RMA was issued, another replacement order placed, along with another temporary hold on my credit card. When the refurb replacement was received it was also found to be defective, again due to faulty battery charging issues. However, Google would not authorize a replacement of the defective replacement until the original defective thermostat was returned to them. When I explained that returning the original thermostat without a working replacement would leave me with no way to control my hvac, they said there are no exceptions. I would need to return the original thermostat first, otherwise I would be charged the $230 temporary hold amount.

WBMV-FM 88.7,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2020","One year ago, I purchased the Nest Thermostat as the exterior of the Nest was a good design and I mistakenly thought the expensive Nest would work well for my family in our home. The most important fact about the Nest Thermostat is an understanding and the acceptance, prior to buying, the buyer is not in control of the thermostat. The term ""learn"" is exactly what the Nest is and that's when all the good stuff will turn sour and in only a day or two. After a day or two, then, let's say, you have a really cold day and it is chilly inside too; you turn the Nest Thermostat up a few degrees, a note will pop up on the face of the Nest and will indicates in 2.5 hours the heat may not even turn on 2.5 hours. The Nest will decide the owner is not being a good steward in our Eco world and decide for you to not turn on and, regardless, of what you try to do, the heat will not come on so your heater may take the chill out of the air. Also, if the home is extra warm in the summer, you'll experience the same delay. The Nest is the boss and it will let you immediately know that fact. Sometimes, the delay is a little less and also a little more but you'll realize, you, the buyer, are not in control of your home's thermostat and your indoor temperatures. The Nest determines what is best for the buyer and the environment and there is no way to change the learning factor and according to the Nest tech's, with whom I spoke, they finally tell me what I have learned is a fact...you are not in control of your thermostat.

Zaurius,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2018","Short version: Loved their thermostat for years, they admit to breaking it after the warranty expired with a patch and offered a coupon for a replacement, coupon won't work with black Friday deal... But spoke with a Sr. Rep and he said he'd credit the difference, got an email from a different Sr. Rep reneging on the previous promise.

Long version: I bought a Nest thermostat few years ago to replace the original thermostat that came with my house (30+ years old). Week ago it stopped working... Was flashing green for a day, then red, then kept cycling the home screen and resetting. I called them and the Sr. Rep (initials AC) said they were aware the recent patch caused this to the Gen 2 models, and how he could only offer the max coupon on 40% off. Except the coupon only works on their site and I couldn't even pick the color I wanted! After 4 days with no heat in November... We get the Nest and all is good. Day after it's installed, we get an email saying Black Friday deal! Nest is now only $18 more than we paid after our 40% discount. Called them asking if they would honor their return policy and after speaking to a different Sr. Rep (initials KM), he said he spoke with his order management team and will process a partial refund of $70 (the discount from Black Friday). I told him I was only hoping for the 40% discount to apply to the Black Friday rate, and get a $42 refund. He said it's fine and how they stand behind their product and how important customer satisfaction was. Two days later, another Sr. Rep (initials KK) said they can't do a partial refund, and they we're going to renege on what KM said. So here I am, sharing my experience on how they (perhaps unintentionally) ruined my old Nest and made promises just to later take it back... And during the holidays no less. So beware when dealing with a company that will not replace equipment they destroyed, but blatantly lie to customers and not honor the promises made by even their Sr. staff. Very disappointed!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Kerri Shadid,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2020","I used to absolutely love my Nest. I bought it so that I could adjust my temperature in bed from my smart phone, which I would routinely do. It was great!

BUT THEN Nest sold out to Google, and all that changed. At first I just noticed that I was no longer automatically logged into the Nest app. When I tried to login, it wouldn’t let me use what I thought was my Nest password, and it wouldn’t let me reset the password. It forced me to use my Google account and then create a Google Home account. However, I don’t want to share my home address with Google for it to then be shared who knows where else, and there’s no way now to use the app without sharing your home address. So now my fancy Nest is just a regular cheap thermostat that I can’t adjust from my phone. I would absolutely not buy this product now after they merged with Google.

Also, I never used it for the smart aspect. I routinely change the temperature throughout the day depending on if I’m hot or cold, and it would take random adjustments that I made and try to turn them into rule, which I didn’t like.",1.0 out of 5 stars

This is a POWER STEALING thermostat. Despite Nest's claims, it really does not function well without a common wire, which often means an expensive visit from an electrician. It may work for a year, two years, and then randomly fail. If you are this unlucky, like me, you will find that your warranty is expired and you have absolutely no recourse. GOOGLE NEST TECHNICAL SERVICE WAS COMPLETELY UNHELPFUL. All they did was parrot their online instructions, which I had already tried, and hock their NEST PRO service at me multiple times. I REPEAT: DO NOT BUY THIS THERMOSTAT. I hate to admit this, but I am just putting back my old mechanical thermostat - it will last you 20+ years with no issues. And honestly I never use the Alexa or ""learning"" features anyway.

Ditto, the above when it is cooling.

Just Some Guy,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2018","I have the C wire issue, even though the install process said it would work without it. Not awesome, Nest, that is seriously false advertising.

I received a thermostat that had already been unboxed and used. The long install screws were covered in drywall dust from being installed already, and one of the small screws was missing, as were the stickers to label the wires. More on that next.

Anyway, the battery was completely drained and the thermostat took hours to charge also.

As I followed the app to install, the part came to take a picture of the current wiring, so I did that. Then I put my phone down and finished disassembling the old thermostat. When I picked up my phone, the app had signed out and lost the picture because I had to re-start the whole process. Not cool, Nest. Fortunately I was able to recover the photo by browsing the app cache on my phone, which is far too technical for most users. Overall, my experience has been very poor. I'm waiting for a C wire adapter to be delivered tomorrow to get the system working again. I'll continue to use the system, but my initial rating is terrible because of how much I paid for false advertising and already been used equipment for full price.",2.0 out of 5 stars
B. Ogatiy,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2016","Installed easy. Then it had a blowout of some sort. Had to get a replacement. Nest recommended to call a technician, which I did and he found nothing wrong. Nest then had me add a common wire, and since that time has worked, sort of worked.

While it does work as a thermostat, the advanced features of power saving are not very good. I find that I must walk by this thermostat so that it will turn on the AC. If I'm home but don't walk by it the house slowly warms. I've set specific schedules and it sort of conforms to them, at the points set (time and temp) but not necessarily between those points.

So overall, it wasn't a simple install due to the additional wire that they claimed in the beginning wouldn't be needed, but was. Nest did offer to pay for the common wire to be installed though (I installed it myself).

I wouldn't recommend this, it's just too costly, had problems, and just doesn't work right without constant manual intervention.

It does however seem to work mostly as a manual thermometer, at least when someone is home and willing to walk by it frequently. Else it doesn't work.

For instance, at times I want it to maintain a temperature, and it won't. Yeah, just reading this makes me knock it down another star to two. It's at best a 2 star product, but mostly hype and marketing, without much substance.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I have installed several of these over time because friends insisted they wanted it against my recommendations. They aren't any easier or more difficult than a 30$ thermostat but to set them is much more obnoxious, the instructions are very basic and it's much like a phone... once you buy it, your on your own figuring out features and how to use it. Personally it's like a glorified old fashioned thermostat from back in the days. Also it's app is not easy to figure out and there are too many apps available for it that probably aren't official and want to charge you more money. At 200+ per therm it better be the only or at least the obvious app and it best be free. Also it mentions its visible from across a room, except it turns the display off after a few minute so what difference does that make being able to see a display that is off until I walk by it again.

Capt Bob,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023","March 2024 update: Removed 2 stars. Reason 1. The app frequently wants me to log in again. A real pain. The checkin requires me to turn on cookies and allow Javascript both of which comprises my security. In addition I greatly dislike Google’s constant spying on mre. Reason 2. I cannot turn off the Greenies programmed into the app that constantly want to invade my thermostat settings and influence what I buy.

This is the fourth one I have installed n my house. It is fairly easy to set up. The app is really good.

The thermostat as it clearly states in the description requires the C wire. However, if you have a two wire system, you can purchase an optional device that connects at the furnace and allows the thermostat to function with only two wires.

I am using this with a three remote sensors ($100 for 3 on Amazon) in my upstairs. The thermostat itself is mounted in the hall. A sensor is mounted in a different bedroom. On the app, you can see all four temperatures. The awesome feature is that the main thermostat or any one of the sensors can be chosen as the control for the temperature. One of my bedrooms runs cooler than the rest so the sensor in this bedroom is the controlling temperature.

Another feature I like is that it lights up when a person walks near it. This feature makes it easy for my wife or I to find our way to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The light is dim enough such that the sleeping partner is not disturbed.

The remote control from anywhere on the internet is a great feature as well. If you go away, you can control the thermostat from anywhere.

The learning feature works well although once in a while if we are too inactive watching tv in the evening it suddenly starts getting cold. I would not change this feature, because it can save a lot of fuel. I can put up with unintended cooling once in a while.

Making a temperatures setpoint change manually is very easy…spin the dial cw for increase or ccw for decrease.

Setting schedules is easy on the app and a little cumbersome on the dial, but possible and reasonable. I like the ability to copy one day’s schedule to another day. Given we are retired, I made one schedule, copied it and pasted it sx more times.

When you walk near the thermostat, the setpoint and actual temperature display. The setpoint is easy to see from ten feet away, to see the current temperature you need to be at normal reading distance…about three feet for me.

Being made by Google, I suspect that more data than I wish is being collected and added to thier database. I elected to minimize my exposure by putting the thermostats on my guest WiFi which limits any access to my sensitive equipment such as my computer. As a retired security industry guy, that you place all home control devices such as tv streamers (Firestick, Hulu, Apple TV, etc), appliances, power plug controllers, etc. on the guest WiFi as well. Most modern routers allow for at least one guest network.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Consumer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2023","I've been waiting to write this, because I wanted to give the thermostat some time to ""learn"". After living with it for over a year I can say there are two things I like about the thermostat, the look, and the ability to operate it remotely.
I have an irregular on-call/travel schedule so I am not home for set times and dates from week to week, but when I am home I don't want to worry about the thermostat changing the temperature for me. Depending on the settings, the Nest will eventually learn what times it thinks it needs to turn on/off Heating/AC and then start changing the temperature on it's own. Even if you're home and override that by setting it to a different temperature, it will change the temperature all on it's own. Eventually I got tired of fighting it and set the thermostat to manual mode. The learning/schedule might be better for someone that is home for set times/days throughout the week/month. I can't seem to get mine to run the fan only mode without turning on the AC or Heat. If you want to turn on the FAN only for your central air, after the fan runs for a pre-determined amount of time it will run the heat/ac as it sees fit.
The remote access feature is nice when it works. When I first set it up I registered it with an email address I use for login type memberships. I loaded the app on my phone and it worked great for the fist few months. Eventually my login stopped working and I was unable to remote operate my thermostat. When I contacted Nest support they told me I had to create and use a ""Google"" account to log in. I explained that I had been using another email account to log in for months and they advised that I was no longer allowed to use a different email because it's a google product and they're not going to change that.

C. Morgan,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2018","The Nest is nice and modern and I can control most features with the Nest App or Alexa, but there is room for improvement in its features. I’d give it 3 1/2 stars right now.
The schedule is a good feature (but common in smart thermostats now); I like that it tells us the humidity level in the house, which I imagine will be more important in winter.
The learning feature seems good (even if I’m impatient that it seemed to take a while to realize that we don’t want to freeze through summer nights).
But Nest missing some features that our previous thermostat had:
-Nest only displays the temperature it’s set for. It does not give you the current temperature in the house. It’s important to know the ambient temp so that I can set it accordingly.
-I can’t turn the fan on or off from Alexa.
-I can’t turn the fan off from the Nest App (can only turn it on).
-The Eco temperatures take over, which can sometimes be bad. Eco gradually raises or lowers the temperature over hours, which is bad when It’s working harder than you need at the moment.
For instance after a hot summer day, in the evening when it cools down outside, ECO still blasts the air conditioning inside so that we’re freezing at like 10pm. It’s not enough to raise the temp in the app, b/c ECO will take hours to transition. We have to turn the thermostat and fan to “off” b/c it doesn’t make sense to have to sleep under multiple blankets in the middle of a heat wave waiting for ECO mode to eventually stop blowing cold air.
-The NEST also gave a wiring error twice after I shut off the air conditioner and fan on 2 nights when it was freezing us out. We had an electrician come Re-do the wiring after the first error message. He said the wiring looked fine but he followed Nest’s instructions to be certain the wiring wasn’t the issue... but then when the same error happened again in the same circumstance, I realized it must be a glitch when you shut it all off suddenly.

Nest could fix these issues with a software upgrade. I hope they do.
If so, I increase my rating to 5 stars.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2019","First, let me state that this device is beautiful and I love the interface. However, if you are using this to automatically control humidity, you should probably reconsider because: this ""smart"" thermostat DOES NOT factor in outdoor air temperature adjusting the humidity level. As the outside air temperature drops, indoor humidity as percentage should also drop to avoid moisture levels that are too high. If you live in a place with temperature swings (i.e. places where it snows), you may need to adjust humidity settings several times per week (if not per day) to maintain appropriate humidity levels inside the house. With the Nest, you have to constantly do this manually. Given that the Nest obtains outside temperatures through the internet, it seems it should easily be able to add the auto-adjusting feature for humidity. If you're in the market for a smart thermostat and want it hooked up to a whole house humidifier, look to the Ecobee or something else which can appropriately maintain humidity. This has been a complaint of Nest users for years. Apparently a third party app was developed to address the humidity issue, but Google put a stop to this. Think of this way: Nobody buys a car based on windshield wipers, but would anyone buy one without them? If something basic and essential is missing from a device, skip it. I will have to put my Nest up for sale and buy something more useful unless Google provides a fix . . . quickly.",3.0 out of 5 stars

M. K.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2023","I bought and installed this and was generally really happy with it for about five years. It worked great. After the fifth year, for some reason, my heater kept running and running, even when it wasn't hot. In fact, when it was supposed to be cooling it would still be heating. Many times, my temperature got up to about 90º F. Nothing would work.

After a lot of annoyance, I reset the thermostat and added it again, and the thermostat shut off the heat and started working again. It was okay for less than a day and then it started again. I came home, and found my home at about 90ºF last night. I looked it up, and apparently it seems to have something to do with the battery wearing out after that amount of time. It's fine, but I wish I'd known to expect it when I bought it. I was annoyed, but I went out to Target and bought a replacement at the store(the exact same model).

From the moment I popped the new thermostat on, I knew that it was working, because not only did my heater not keep on, but my air conditioner immediately turned on, and it turned the temperature down. I hadn't really felt that during the last year. I think the old thermostat was just turning on the blower but not the AC. I was really tired, and I fell asleep on top of my blankets. I woke up with the house at about 65º F, which is colder than I like my home, but it's the default for this model. I was cold, but I was overjoyed to have my home thermostat working again. I set it to my preferred temperature and went about my day. As of right now, my home's temperature is very comfortable.

These thermostats are good, for about five years. I have had mine for about six years. The new one uses the exact same base, so replacing it was as simple as popping the old one off of the mount and popping the new one on. Replacement took about 30 seconds, and then using the app to tell it to look for the new thermostat. This IS actually a very nice thermostat, but know that if you get it there's a good chance you'll be getting another one in about five years.",4.0 out of 5 stars
C.H.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2018","CYA, I am not liable and I suggest you consult a professional, qualified HVAC:

Our house has two floors. We have 2 A/C units outside and 2 furnaces. The attic has a furnace that controls upstairs and the upstairs has a furnace that controls the first level. The upstairs is not working correctly so turned off the attic furnace and only use the downstairs heating to heat the whole house. This is not efficient and also makes our furnace work overtime. We had an old Honeywell circle thermostat (mercury, mechanical) and bought a Nest. I followed Nest's instructions and while the A/C worked, the heater kept cycling (on for 2 seconds, off for 2 seconds) over and over again. I watched multiple YouTube videos on how to remove wires at the furnace board and jump wires and also how to move thermostat G to C...nothing worked. Our thermostat kept cycling on and off. We called Nest and they said our system is faulty. I did not believe that. We have a 4-wire setup (W1, Y1, RH (or RC), and G). After calling Nest, they concluded our HVAC was faulty. I knew it wasn't. I then watched more YouTube videos for removing wires and then jumping one to another (which worked to pass the test) but then didn't work when using the Nest. After we confirmed that the fan would turn on (YouTube video suggestion) we tried using the Nest as it should be used. Nope. We confirmed the fan works but that the Nest, despite stating it does not need a (C) common wire to work, still did not work properly. Long story short, I bought a 18/2 50-ft thermostat wire at a big box store, used just the white (technically, you can use any color as long as it is the same wire), turned of all power to the furnace and A/C, connected it to the C on the furnace board (works for most furnaces newer than 2010 or that pass the previously mentioned YouTube video test), and connected the other end of the wire to the Nest in the (C). Once connected and fully put back together (furnaces often have a button that dis-enable it unless the unit is put back together or the button is depressed), it now works 100% fine. Other smart thermostats can work without a (C), and Nest says it can too, however; in my experience customer service is not accurace and if you live in a home that has the old mercury/lead circle thermometer (aka, nothing is digital) and you have just 2 or 4 wires, and you want to use a Nest, you'll likely need to buy a $10-$15 50-foot 18/2 Thermostat wire and use one of them to connect the furnace (C) to the Nest (C).",4.0 out of 5 stars

It works with multiple third-party devices and supports voice commands via Google Home and Amazon's Alexa voice service as well! The thermostat is also equipped with 802.11b/g/n (2.4GHz) and 802.11a/n (5GHz) Wi-Fi circuitry, a Bluetooth radio, and 512MB of memory. It works with most 24V heating and cooling systems. It supports three-stage heating, two-stage cooling, three-speed fans, and humidifier and dehumidifier add-ons. What’s definitely cool is that it uses motion sensors to detect your presence and it will switch to ECO (energy conservation) mode automatically if it thinks you are not home.
Design wise it comes in black, white, stainless steel, or copper finish and it has a large display (2.1”) with a high resolution (480 by 480). That allows you to see the display throughout a large room without a problem.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Michael Hudson,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2019","I Installed this a month ago when I moved into my new place. I have yet to see about the energy saving, but it does intigrate with the NEST Protect (CO / Smoke alarm) and the Nest cameras I have arond the house. I perfer to use the thermostat as a more natural alarmclock. This raises the temp in my home to my wake up targe temp every morning. I also enjoy the easy control from any google assistant in any room or preheating my home from the app if I've been away and had the heat off. 1 Caviet - Long Complex WiFi passwords are extreamly difficut to enter on this device. Every other Nest component I installed grabbed the WiFi password from my phone - On the Thermostat, you have to use the dial to select every character. With 64 characters in my PW, I just connected this thermostat to my guest network with a less complex password. Not exactly what I wanted, but functionally, it works seamslessly.

Jeff Curtis,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2019","I bought the Nest e-learning thermostat I August of 2018. It took about 10 minutes to install and I love it. The reason for the 4 star rating is the capabilities or lack thereof with Alexa. Alexa can put the device in eco mode (by voice command) but cannot take it out of eco mode. Additionally, when setting up routines in Alexa, the eco option is not available. Otherwise, the thermostat is a wonderful piece of equipment.

TennisDrum,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2017","I finally jumped onto the Nest bandwagon and love it. Easy to install in a few minutes. Came with a back plate to cover up the area my old thermostat covered. Set up is a breeze and really well thought out. Quickly learns your patterns and can be set to anticipate the temperature changes so that when you wake up in the morning the adjustment has already been made. Part of set up is telling it your ZIP code, so it knows the weather (and can tell you) so it anticipates how hard the system needs to work to heat or cool and whether it will need to be on AC or Heat. iPhone app is a breeze and well thought out.

Since getting the Nest, I've also purchased some WeMo devices and they all work together well. The WeMo app found the Next thermostat on our network and now I can use the single iPhone app to control all of that (don't have to go back to the Nest app if I don't want to). Haven't gotten the Amazon Echo/Dot but that's likely next and will make using these devices even easier.",5.0 out of 5 stars
bobfp,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2024",The previous Nest didn’t last but a year. Google had some issues with a number of them. Ours was part of a new HVAC System that we had installed. Went through hoops over the phone. Finally we were offered a replacement free. However the Google representative wanted our credit card information and said once we returned the bad one they would credit our account. Told him that I would not go that way and that didn’t make sense and politely hung up. I just purchased another through Amazon. Works great so far.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Broham Dingleberry,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2016","Easy setup (read below if you have a two wire system without a C (common) wire), awesome interface, top notch quality, what else can I say? Love that I can control so many features from my laptop and smartphone. I also have three Nest Protect smoke and CO detectors which are monitored by the same app. Nest/Google hit not just a home run, but a grand slam out of the park with these two products.

-------------------

If you have a conventional two-wire system like me (Rc and W1), this is exactly what you need to get your smart thermostat working!

When I removed my Honeywell digital thermostat (non wifi), it had only two leads connected: Rc and W1. Not knowing anything about the latest generation of wifi thermostats, I went ahead and ordered the Nest Pro Gen III thermostat. Upon setup, I ran into two codes; e73 and e74. Essentially, they had to do with no power going to the unit. my VIN and VOC were 2.50 so I dug around on the internet, which led me to this transformer.

One lead went to C (24v common) and the other to Rh (see my photo of the interface's digital connection diagram). You may need to swap between Rc and Rh if you still have a error code readout. After plugging in the transformer, the VIN AND VOC read 34.17!!! Remember to plug this transformer into a surge protected outlet to prevent a possible damaged thermostat.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Rick James Bish,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2020","Installed two of thee in my RV and they are working great. The wiring for the original Thermostats was 12vdc, which is what is sent to signal the AC. I had to provide 24vac to the Nest since that is what it requires. This was done with $13 24vac transformer. I then had to turn that back into 12vdc. I did this with a set of 4 relays. The end result works great and its a huge upgrade from the original slide type thermostat, which was not accurate on temperature at all and had my AC running much longer than necessary.

My only complaint so far about this device is the restrictions on the Farsight feature. The display can obviously show multiple lines, you can tell that with the weather option, which shows a large number for current outside temp and then three smaller temps below that for later in the day. They could easily show the inside and target temp as well as fan speed all on one screen.

Be warned that in most cases you cannot just swap out your existing RV Thermostat with the Nest. Check what voltage and whether its AC or DC at your current thermostat first. If its not 24vac then you will need other components.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Their refusal to acknowledge their mistake and return our money is absolutely unacceptable.

HULKGAMECRIT,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024","outside the fact google dared to use motherboard components that cant survive even a year of use, theres some pretty large flaws with the app.

you cant sync ur nest to your phone in the case of a problem, you cannot connect the nest to your pc via usb to troubleshoot anything on the device even tho it has a usb port . the app cannot tell when wifi has died. it enters an endless loop of hunting for a signal or blaming ur house when the device fails its job

there no firmware updates online, so if anything bad happens during an installation or upgrade ur basically sol, this imo is unbelievable

outside all of this, the app cant easily tell if ur home via ur phone, it maybe senses only once or twice a day max meaning it always runs the ac for hours until finally entering evo mode. its a simple api call but maybe google felt like they wanted to save money so they limited the interaction. they should have come up with a better solution. its a power waster.

Steve M.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2024","I received the Nest thermostat as a gift 7 years now. I stopped using the learning features and just set the schedule manually. I did this because the ""learning"" is actually pretty stoopid. I found that all it does is update the schedule any time I made a temperature change. For example, if at 3:00 PM on Tuesday, I changed the temperature to 73F, it would add to the schedule to set the temperature to 73F every Tuesday at 3:00 PM. That's not ""smart"".

It has access to current conditions like weather/outdoor temperature and humidity (via the internet), indoor temperature and indoor humidity. Why doesn't it learn from that and track those conditions and adjust the temperature based on what it's seen?

I also don't see any benefit of the ""cool to dry"" feature. It really doesn't do anything unless the indoor humidity reaches and unhealthy level (it doesn't seem to care about it being at a comfortable level).

Jacob Norton,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2024","As someone who's always seeking innovative solutions to simplify daily life, the Google Nest Learning Thermostat has been an absolute game-changer in managing home comfort. Here's why I enjoy using it so much:

Intelligent Learning: The Nest Thermostat doesn't just adjust the temperature; it learns your schedule and preferences over time. This means no more manual adjustments. It's like having a personal assistant for your home's climate control.

Energy Savings: One of the most appealing aspects of the Nest Thermostat is its ability to save energy. By intelligently adjusting the temperature based on your habits and presence, it optimizes energy usage without sacrificing comfort. I've noticed a significant decrease in my energy bills since installing it.

Sleek Design and User-Friendly Interface: The design of the Nest Thermostat is sleek and modern, seamlessly blending into any home decor. Its interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy to navigate and adjust settings both at home and remotely through the Nest app.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2024","After years of wrestling with the product, I conclude the highest and best use of the Nest Learning Thermostat is as a hockey puck. The customer support is horrible. The software, user interface and functioning is much more complex than necessary. At the same time, the device will not perform simple basic functions like hold at a set temperature if you have programed a schedule. The only way to set the thermostat at a fixed temperature is to erase the schedule. This requires tediously re-creating a new schedule to use scheduling again. The learning aspect of the thermostat is primitive, illogical and completely useless. I can save energy much more effectively than a Nest thermostat. The worse function is that somehow the thermostat turns itself down when I need heat the most. An example is on an early, dark, cold winter morning getting out of the shower when the bathroom should be warming but IS NOT. After being set low all night according to my programed schedule, I sent the time to turn on and call for heat. Oh no! A little message appears and says something like, ""Peek Time"" and the temperature is automatically set lower by Nest software. So I step out of the shower freezing when the bathroom should be getting warmer. This is downright obnoxious and unhealthy. Except for keeping the temperature elevated and wasting energy all night, I can't figure out how to stop this nonsense. The imbedded software goes out of its way to make life worse. An expensive product with software engineers who program the device to be destructive to health and comfort. Bizarre!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars

Capt Bob,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023","March 2024 update: Removed 2 stars. Reason 1. The app frequently wants me to log in again. A real pain. The checkin requires me to turn on cookies and allow Javascript both of which comprises my security. In addition I greatly dislike Google’s constant spying on mre. Reason 2. I cannot turn off the Greenies programmed into the app that constantly want to invade my thermostat settings and influence what I buy.

This is the fourth one I have installed n my house. It is fairly easy to set up. The app is really good.

The thermostat as it clearly states in the description requires the C wire. However, if you have a two wire system, you can purchase an optional device that connects at the furnace and allows the thermostat to function with only two wires.

I am using this with a three remote sensors ($100 for 3 on Amazon) in my upstairs. The thermostat itself is mounted in the hall. A sensor is mounted in a different bedroom. On the app, you can see all four temperatures. The awesome feature is that the main thermostat or any one of the sensors can be chosen as the control for the temperature. One of my bedrooms runs cooler than the rest so the sensor in this bedroom is the controlling temperature.

Another feature I like is that it lights up when a person walks near it. This feature makes it easy for my wife or I to find our way to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The light is dim enough such that the sleeping partner is not disturbed.

The remote control from anywhere on the internet is a great feature as well. If you go away, you can control the thermostat from anywhere.

The learning feature works well although once in a while if we are too inactive watching tv in the evening it suddenly starts getting cold. I would not change this feature, because it can save a lot of fuel. I can put up with unintended cooling once in a while.

Making a temperatures setpoint change manually is very easy…spin the dial cw for increase or ccw for decrease.

Setting schedules is easy on the app and a little cumbersome on the dial, but possible and reasonable. I like the ability to copy one day’s schedule to another day. Given we are retired, I made one schedule, copied it and pasted it sx more times.

When you walk near the thermostat, the setpoint and actual temperature display. The setpoint is easy to see from ten feet away, to see the current temperature you need to be at normal reading distance…about three feet for me.

Being made by Google, I suspect that more data than I wish is being collected and added to thier database. I elected to minimize my exposure by putting the thermostats on my guest WiFi which limits any access to my sensitive equipment such as my computer. As a retired security industry guy, that you place all home control devices such as tv streamers (Firestick, Hulu, Apple TV, etc), appliances, power plug controllers, etc. on the guest WiFi as well. Most modern routers allow for at least one guest network.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Angela M Stensby,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2023","I would never buy this - or any nest. I would bet its feature's are relatively worthless for most people living in a home day to day. Is it really that hard and time consuming to set a thermostat? I am ready to take a hammer to the nest that came with my 1000 sq ft condo - it doesn't matter what temp I set it to it just goes back to the ""eco"" temperatures and then my A/C or furnace have to run for ridiculously long time to get back to the temp I want. I guess it's not smart enough to realize that I am actually still home (and would like the temp to be 73) even though I am not walking in front of it every 30 minutes. Its not smart enough to realize which unit is should run, A/C or furnace and it's not smart enough to know to run the fan so the air doesn't get stale. Additionally I don't know how ""smart"" it is to have daily ""home"" and ""away"" temperatures, when it was proven back in the nineties that it's more efficient to just leave your thermostat at a set temperature day in and day out instead of having temps for when you are awake vs sleeping or home vs at work or day vs night. Fortunately I didn't take a hammer to it, because I found a Youtube video that showed the 6 steps to turn it into a manual thermostat - so no I would not buy this and end up paying for features that are essentially useless and will most likely not save a person anything time or money wise. (If you want to save energy and money just set your $50 manual thermostat to 78+ in the hot months and 68 or lower in the cold months and be done with it)",1.0 out of 5 stars
Layton,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2023","We've had these thermostats for years and the only consistent thing about them is they unexpectedly give weird error codes that are often difficult to resolve. Their app and website don't help, leaving one to use Google and YouTube to provide assistance. Most recently, the battery on my thermostat (attached to my wall with a power source) died - this left no connection to my WiFi, then ensured my phone app was also offline.

After a ridiculous amount of time and effort trying to get the battery recharged (using an external USB cable), I've given up and have purchased another brand of thermostat for both my upstairs and downstairs. I'm done with Nest, it's not user friendly when things go south. And that typically happens at night or in the heat of the day (in Texas).",3.0 out of 5 stars

Consumer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2023","I've been waiting to write this, because I wanted to give the thermostat some time to ""learn"". After living with it for over a year I can say there are two things I like about the thermostat, the look, and the ability to operate it remotely.
I have an irregular on-call/travel schedule so I am not home for set times and dates from week to week, but when I am home I don't want to worry about the thermostat changing the temperature for me. Depending on the settings, the Nest will eventually learn what times it thinks it needs to turn on/off Heating/AC and then start changing the temperature on it's own. Even if you're home and override that by setting it to a different temperature, it will change the temperature all on it's own. Eventually I got tired of fighting it and set the thermostat to manual mode. The learning/schedule might be better for someone that is home for set times/days throughout the week/month. I can't seem to get mine to run the fan only mode without turning on the AC or Heat. If you want to turn on the FAN only for your central air, after the fan runs for a pre-determined amount of time it will run the heat/ac as it sees fit.
The remote access feature is nice when it works. When I first set it up I registered it with an email address I use for login type memberships. I loaded the app on my phone and it worked great for the fist few months. Eventually my login stopped working and I was unable to remote operate my thermostat. When I contacted Nest support they told me I had to create and use a ""Google"" account to log in. I explained that I had been using another email account to log in for months and they advised that I was no longer allowed to use a different email because it's a google product and they're not going to change that.

M. K.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2023","I bought and installed this and was generally really happy with it for about five years. It worked great. After the fifth year, for some reason, my heater kept running and running, even when it wasn't hot. In fact, when it was supposed to be cooling it would still be heating. Many times, my temperature got up to about 90º F. Nothing would work.

After a lot of annoyance, I reset the thermostat and added it again, and the thermostat shut off the heat and started working again. It was okay for less than a day and then it started again. I came home, and found my home at about 90ºF last night. I looked it up, and apparently it seems to have something to do with the battery wearing out after that amount of time. It's fine, but I wish I'd known to expect it when I bought it. I was annoyed, but I went out to Target and bought a replacement at the store(the exact same model).

From the moment I popped the new thermostat on, I knew that it was working, because not only did my heater not keep on, but my air conditioner immediately turned on, and it turned the temperature down. I hadn't really felt that during the last year. I think the old thermostat was just turning on the blower but not the AC. I was really tired, and I fell asleep on top of my blankets. I woke up with the house at about 65º F, which is colder than I like my home, but it's the default for this model. I was cold, but I was overjoyed to have my home thermostat working again. I set it to my preferred temperature and went about my day. As of right now, my home's temperature is very comfortable.

These thermostats are good, for about five years. I have had mine for about six years. The new one uses the exact same base, so replacing it was as simple as popping the old one off of the mount and popping the new one on. Replacement took about 30 seconds, and then using the app to tell it to look for the new thermostat.

Cat,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2022","I’ve had my Nest thermostat for over a year and was SHOCKED to find my energy costs going UP and increased maintenance required on my Lennox Furnace system.

I spent so much money on this system because I thought it was “smart,” but honestly it’s got some of the dumbest, unintuitive features and settings.

I started paying more attention to why my furnace was working so hard and found out it was short-cycling. Meaning that even though I have my furnace on a schedule, the heat clicks on throughout the day for about 1 minute, shuts off for 2-3 min, then turns BACK on for another min, and so on. (The schedule I have set is supposed to heat to 68 degrees at 9 am then drops to a set temperature of 62 degrees during the day, then heats back to 68 degrees at 6 pm and drops to a set temperature of 62 degrees overnight - sidenote: if you choose to set a temperature schedule through the nest, you can’t set a different temperature on the schedule within an hour of the initial set temperature, otherwise I would have my house heat to 68 at 9 am and then drop to 62 at 9:30 am, but no, the earliest I can set the next, lower temperature, is 10 am, a full hour after the house heats and has been maintaining the initial set temperature, so dumb!)

After I realized my system was short-cycling due to the nest thermostat, I spent hours searching through convoluted “help” articles from Nest. This is how I found out that the thermostat is constantly trying to heat the house and keep it set to the TENTH OF A DEGREE. Meaning that if I set my thermostat to heat to 68 degrees, the thermostat will assign a temperature of 68.6 degrees Fahrenheit. After it heats to that temperature, anytime it drops down to 68.5 degrees Fahrenheit, the whole system clicks on and heats the house back up to 68.6 degrees. Ideally, you’d be able to set the “hysteresis” or a timer on the thermostat (especially on a $200+ thermostat equipment) so that the temperature could be set to something like 72 degrees, heat to that temperature, and then not switch back on to heat the house for a set period of time or until the temperature in the house drops to a certain temperature like 68 degrees.

This lack of intuitive settings on the Nest is costing me a FORTUNE between furnace maintenance and increased energy costs (kind of crazy when the Nest is supposed to be so “eco friendly”!) and I’m considering switching back to my $15 Honeywell thermostat which is insane. Until they add this feature to the Nest thermostat, I warn you to steer away from this equipment!",1.0 out of 5 stars

They both worked fine for a couple months, then, without warning, I started getting low battery warnings on one of them. Subsequent troubleshooting with Google revealed a defective unit with battery charge retention issues and I was issued an advanced exchange RMA for a replacement. Note: The only replacement offered is a refurbished unit and they put a credit hold on one of your credit cards until they receive the defective unit. A week after that issue was resolved the second original thermostat started giving a W5 error, a known issue with these thermostats that involves a failure of the internal Wi-Fi chip. When this happens, the thermostat can only be controlled manually, not remotely through the app. Another RMA was issued, another replacement order placed, along with another temporary hold on my credit card. When the refurb replacement was received it was also found to be defective, again due to faulty battery charging issues. However, Google would not authorize a replacement of the defective replacement until the original defective thermostat was returned to them. When I explained that returning the original thermostat without a working replacement would leave me with no way to control my hvac, they said there are no exceptions. I would need to return the original thermostat first, otherwise I would be charged the $230 temporary hold amount.

you cant sync ur nest to your phone in the case of a problem, you cannot connect the nest to your pc via usb to troubleshoot anything on the device even tho it has a usb port . the app cannot tell when wifi has died. it enters an endless loop of hunting for a signal or blaming ur house when the device fails its job

there no firmware updates online, so if anything bad happens during an installation or upgrade ur basically sol, this imo is unbelievable

outside all of this, the app cant easily tell if ur home via ur phone, it maybe senses only once or twice a day max meaning it always runs the ac for hours until finally entering evo mode. its a simple api call but maybe google felt like they wanted to save money so they limited the interaction. they should have come up with a better solution. its a power waster.

Essentially, they had to do with no power going to the unit. my VIN and VOC were 2.50 so I dug around on the internet, which led me to this transformer.

One lead went to C (24v common) and the other to Rh (see my photo of the interface's digital connection diagram). You may need to swap between Rc and Rh if you still have a error code readout. After plugging in the transformer, the VIN AND VOC read 34.17!!! Remember to plug this transformer into a surge protected outlet to prevent a possible damaged thermostat.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Capt Bob,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023","March 2024 update: Removed 2 stars. Reason 1. The app frequently wants me to log in again. A real pain. The checkin requires me to turn on cookies and allow Javascript both of which comprises my security. In addition I greatly dislike Google’s constant spying on mre. Reason 2. I cannot turn off the Greenies programmed into the app that constantly want to invade my thermostat settings and influence what I buy.

This is the fourth one I have installed n my house. It is fairly easy to set up. The app is really good.

The thermostat as it clearly states in the description requires the C wire. However, if you have a two wire system, you can purchase an optional device that connects at the furnace and allows the thermostat to function with only two wires.

I am using this with a three remote sensors ($100 for 3 on Amazon) in my upstairs. The thermostat itself is mounted in the hall. A sensor is mounted in a different bedroom. On the app, you can see all four temperatures. The awesome feature is that the main thermostat or any one of the sensors can be chosen as the control for the temperature. One of my bedrooms runs cooler than the rest so the sensor in this bedroom is the controlling temperature.

Another feature I like is that it lights up when a person walks near it. This feature makes it easy for my wife or I to find our way to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The light is dim enough such that the sleeping partner is not disturbed.

The remote control from anywhere on the internet is a great feature as well. If you go away, you can control the thermostat from anywhere.

The learning feature works well although once in a while if we are too inactive watching tv in the evening it suddenly starts getting cold. I would not change this feature, because it can save a lot of fuel. I can put up with unintended cooling once in a while.

Making a temperatures setpoint change manually is very easy…spin the dial cw for increase or ccw for decrease.

Setting schedules is easy on the app and a little cumbersome on the dial, but possible and reasonable. I like the ability to copy one day’s schedule to another day. Given we are retired, I made one schedule, copied it and pasted it sx more times.

When you walk near the thermostat, the setpoint and actual temperature display. The setpoint is easy to see from ten feet away, to see the current temperature you need to be at normal reading distance…about three feet for me.

Being made by Google, I suspect that more data than I wish is being collected and added to thier database. I elected to minimize my exposure by putting the thermostats on my guest WiFi which limits any access to my sensitive equipment such as my computer. As a retired security industry guy, that you place all home control devices such as tv streamers (Firestick, Hulu, Apple TV, etc), appliances, power plug controllers, etc. on the guest WiFi as well. Most modern routers allow for at least one guest network.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Consumer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2023","I've been waiting to write this, because I wanted to give the thermostat some time to ""learn"". After living with it for over a year I can say there are two things I like about the thermostat, the look, and the ability to operate it remotely.
I have an irregular on-call/travel schedule so I am not home for set times and dates from week to week, but when I am home I don't want to worry about the thermostat changing the temperature for me. Depending on the settings, the Nest will eventually learn what times it thinks it needs to turn on/off Heating/AC and then start changing the temperature on it's own. Even if you're home and override that by setting it to a different temperature, it will change the temperature all on it's own. Eventually I got tired of fighting it and set the thermostat to manual mode. The learning/schedule might be better for someone that is home for set times/days throughout the week/month. I can't seem to get mine to run the fan only mode without turning on the AC or Heat. If you want to turn on the FAN only for your central air, after the fan runs for a pre-determined amount of time it will run the heat/ac as it sees fit.
The remote access feature is nice when it works. When I first set it up I registered it with an email address I use for login type memberships. I loaded the app on my phone and it worked great for the fist few months. Eventually my login stopped working and I was unable to remote operate my thermostat. When I contacted Nest support they told me I had to create and use a ""Google"" account to log in. I explained that I had been using another email account to log in for months and they advised that I was no longer allowed to use a different email because it's a google product and they're not going to change that. So now I have a google account that I really only created and use for this silly thermostat.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Rick James Bish,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2020","Installed two of thee in my RV and they are working great. The wiring for the original Thermostats was 12vdc, which is what is sent to signal the AC. I had to provide 24vac to the Nest since that is what it requires. This was done with $13 24vac transformer. I then had to turn that back into 12vdc. I did this with a set of 4 relays. The end result works great and its a huge upgrade from the original slide type thermostat, which was not accurate on temperature at all and had my AC running much longer than necessary.

My only complaint so far about this device is the restrictions on the Farsight feature. The display can obviously show multiple lines, you can tell that with the weather option, which shows a large number for current outside temp and then three smaller temps below that for later in the day. They could easily show the inside and target temp as well as fan speed all on one screen.

Be warned that in most cases you cannot just swap out your existing RV Thermostat with the Nest. Check what voltage and whether its AC or DC at your current thermostat first. If its not 24vac then you will need other components.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Stephen Bonneau,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2024","I am beyond furious with Google and their appalling customer service.

Weeks went by, and instead of resolving the issue, Google had the audacity to claim that we never returned the defective unit! As a result, they charged us a whopping $250 for the replacement. Despite our numerous attempts to prove that we did send it back, they continue to give us the runaround.

Their refusal to acknowledge their mistake and return our money is absolutely unacceptable.

Just Some Guy,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2018","I have the C wire issue, even though the install process said it would work without it. Not awesome, Nest, that is seriously false advertising.

I received a thermostat that had already been unboxed and used. The long install screws were covered in drywall dust from being installed already, and one of the small screws was missing, as were the stickers to label the wires. More on that next.

Anyway, the battery was completely drained and the thermostat took hours to charge also.

As I followed the app to install, the part came to take a picture of the current wiring, so I did that. Then I put my phone down and finished disassembling the old thermostat. When I picked up my phone, the app had signed out and lost the picture because I had to re-start the whole process. Not cool, Nest. Fortunately I was able to recover the photo by browsing the app cache on my phone, which is far too technical for most users. Overall, my experience has been very poor. I'm waiting for a C wire adapter to be delivered tomorrow to get the system working again. I'll continue to use the system, but my initial rating is terrible because of how much I paid for false advertising and already been used equipment for full price.",2.0 out of 5 stars

B. Ogatiy,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2016","Installed easy. Then it had a blowout of some sort. Had to get a replacement. Nest recommended to call a technician, which I did and he found nothing wrong. Nest then had me add a common wire, and since that time has worked, sort of worked.

While it does work as a thermostat, the advanced features of power saving are not very good. I find that I must walk by this thermostat so that it will turn on the AC. If I'm home but don't walk by it the house slowly warms. I've set specific schedules and it sort of conforms to them, at the points set (time and temp) but not necessarily between those points.

So overall, it wasn't a simple install due to the additional wire that they claimed in the beginning wouldn't be needed, but was. Nest did offer to pay for the common wire to be installed though (I installed it myself).

I wouldn't recommend this, it's just too costly, had problems, and just doesn't work right without constant manual intervention.

It does however seem to work mostly as a manual thermometer, at least when someone is home and willing to walk by it frequently. Else it doesn't work.

For instance, at times I want it to maintain a temperature, and it won't. Yeah, just reading this makes me knock it down another star to two. It's at best a 2 star product, but mostly hype and marketing, without much substance.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Stu K,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2022","I purchased 4 units for my home and in 4 years I have replaced all 4 bases and or heads. It just happened again. Nothing in my house has changed. Worked with customer service which is now in the Philippines and they were sure again I needed a new base. Ordered from Google and same thing.
Right now In NY it’s 15 degrees. I jumped my wires to get heat and today I go out and get a different brand thermostat. At $250 per unit they should last longer then 2 years before they crap out!",2.0 out of 5 stars
Cameron Sito,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2023",Had to replace twice now and their help line is just as awful. Will never purchase google nest for my home. It never had the correct temperature and just does not connect to the google gauges in the other rooms. Just garbage that told me I would have to wait 21 days before they would send my 3rd replacement. I now have to ship my family out of the house and stay in a 80 degree house in the south and find a new thermostat. If you do buy just be ready to replace every year and a half.,1.0 out of 5 stars
shawnmb26,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2020","After a few months this stopped working with my WiFi, turning it into a regular thermostat. Nest customer service is a joke. It is online only, no phone customer service. After hours online with them, I waited a month for our replacement only to not receive it. Contacted them again and was told I needed to pay for the new one up front and then they’d refund when the old one was received by them. I wasn’t happy about it because this was not what they had said the month before. I went ahead and did what they told me to do only to be transferred to someone else and be told there were more online forms to fill out. Finished those forms and then was told I didn’t fill them out and needed to do it again. Obviously, I was being jerked around. This was three months ago and we still have no replacement. I will NEVER buy another Nest or Google product again. Their products are garbage and their customer service is even worse.",1.0 out of 5 stars
DaveMeowthews,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2018",The Nest is a must for all homes. Very easy to install and easy to use. The app is fantastic and means I can adjust the temps from anywhere - even when we’re away on vacation. The Nest in intuitive and “learns” your habits. And our energy use has dercresed drastically. We have purchased two and will never NOT have a Nest in our own again.,5.0 out of 5 stars
N. Leja,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2020",It was difficult to install because it comes with no basic menu navigation instructions. I spent .5 hours trying to figure out how to enter a capital letter to connect to my network. The software is limiting and not intuitive. You also need to use a magnifying glass to read a couple items. I think the software is the major flaw. Once I logged in using my google account I could not revert to a separate password. Basically when you use your google account it has access to all your information. Customer support is limited to online chat. I see no benefit to purchasing this device compared to much less expensive alternatives. Access with Alexa and remote access is beneficial.,2.0 out of 5 stars
Benji,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2020","I bought this to get control of our central air conditioner. However, the features don't work as well as expected.

The unit doesn't turn on when I get home, it still shows as away and sometimes takes a long time to figure out I'm home.
Secondly, there is a fatal w5 error that is well documented online. It's caused by a change in your WiFi settings, or a drop in speed and will cause the unit to completely drop internet connectivity. The issue is not repairable either. I've been waiting over a month now and have not received a replacement.

Buyer beware. With my experience with Google products unfortunately, a lot of advertised features either stop working or don't work as expected.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Peter A. Allen,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2020","Bought my first Nest Thermostat and installed it without incident. All rather easy and successful. Decided to add two more thermostats to my home, so I purchased two additional units. The second one also was installed easily and successfully. The problem arises on unit #3. With this one, the software application appears to not allow more than two units in a single home. After 2 hours of back/forth on the various support forums, the only resolution was to create a second “home” (called a structure) in the Next/Google application. That allowed the third unit to be connected. Sadly, this results in no ability to see/control all of the units in my home in a coordinated manner. It also prevents Alexa from connecting to the third unit.

All in all ... the Google software world is materially deficient for anything that is more than the simplest of scenarios. If you’re looking to maximize the utility of this form of home automation, I’d go to a different solution.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Hank,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2017","I'm having problems with this keeping the correct time-- yes, the time. Not the date, but the time-- it's off by about 30-45 minutes. I thought it was my router or network, but everything else on the network tells the correct time. Also, sometimes it does not know when I am home or away -- I mean know it correctly.

Montoya,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2020","I own 2 Nest 3 thermostats. Both are installed in exactly the same configuration. One stays online, the other disconnects itself at regular intervals and I have to log back in to the network. It's very irritating. If you wonder why there are so many positive reviews ... they are from people who have a tech background or are more experienced with tech issues than you are. I also had another Nest thermostat that was generation #1 or #2, and I had to return it because of non-performance. The only time I telephoned Nest service, the young lady gave me the wrong answer, which added to my disappointment with Nest. If you want good results, buy a good brand of regular digital thermostat, and skip the ""learning"" ones. BTW: I had the same problem with an Ecobee ""learning"" thermostat and sent it back. For the 3rd thermostat in my house, I chose a recent model Honeywell digital thermostat without the ""learning"" capability, and it works beautifully,",1.0 out of 5 stars

This could take days and who wants to spend another $200 just to get a warranty replacement. I was waiting on hold for 2 hours and spoke to a rude agent and the waited on hold for another 30 minutes for a manager only to find out from the agent “managers are too busy to talk with you, they will call you back” meanwhile it’s snowing here and I don’t have a working thermostat.
