(Update: The manufacturer has replaced the unit without any cost to me -- only the time spent to go through the process and reply to emails. The new unit was shipped free of shipping cost and in advance of me even returning the original defective unit. They included a pre-paid shipping label and asked me to ship back the original defective unit. They also offered a small refund to be credited to my account for all of the hassle -- I haven't seen it reflected in my account yet, but it's a nice gesture for having to go through the whole process of having it replaced. The replacement unit works great. Accordingly, I'm updating my rating to 5 stars. It's unfortunate that the original item had a defect, but the manufacturer replaced at no cost and gave a partial refund -- not sure what more I could ask for. I am leaving the original review below just for context.)

It works -- it draws moisture from the air very effectively, it is relatively easy to use and move around, and the Wi-Fi function works fine, BUT... it leaks all over the floor.
It leaks if it's in the pump function (to perpetually pump into an existing drain, which is how I initially had it set up,) and it also leaks if the pump function is turned off (set to internal bucket.) So it kind of makes all the pros moot point -- I mean, I guess it's removing MORE than it's dumping back onto my floor, so I suppose that's a plus, but it's also now warping the floor unless routinely dried up, so I suppose it would be okay if you had it set on top of a drain where it could pull moisture from the air and then leak it into the drain... In any event, I initially had this in a place I would not be regularly 'tending to' in the pump function, so this is very much less than ideal.
I have reached out to the manufacturer directly, providing invoice, to see if I could simply have it replaced with a non-defective one, but thus far has only been roadblocking (requesting video showing where the leak is coming from) despite the fact that I noted it appears to be coming from the bottom where two pieces of plastic clip together, and despite the fact that... I don't really care where it's coming from -- it's leaking on my floor and it's not supposed to leak on my floor (so they want me to run it and let it leak on the floor and attempt to video the bottom of it?), and I just want to give this defective one back (again, I provided a copy of my invoice from purchase) for one that's not defective. And I think that's very reasonable -- I paid full purchase price, I'm the one being inconvenienced, and I'm not even asking for a refund -- I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that the product line, overall, is good, and that I just happened to get a lemon. So it's unfortunate that I appear to be put in the position to 'prove my case.' I simply want a version of this product that I paid ($291.19) for.
Lastly, I even waited to write a review. Manufacturer had an opportunity to replace. I am now leaving negative review.
So, I guess... take your chances? If you get one that doesn't leak on the floor, I 'm sure it's a great product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Roger Lo,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2023","I am absolutely thrilled with the 50-pint dehumidifier with built-in pump.This remarkable appliance has completely transformed my basement environment. Not only does it effectively remove excess moisture, but the added WiFi functionality has made controlling it a breeze.
From the moment I set up the dehumidifier, I noticed a significant improvement in the air quality. The unit operates quietly yet efficiently, ensuring a comfortable and dry atmosphere in my basement. The 50-pint capacity is perfect for my needs, and the integrated pump is a game-changer – it effortlessly pumps out collected water, saving me the hassle of constant emptying.
The real standout feature, however, is the WiFi capability. Being able to control the dehumidifier remotely through the dedicated app is incredibly convenient. This level of control has given me peace of mind, especially when I'm away from home.
I must commend for creating a product that not only delivers on its promises but exceeds expectations. The build quality is solid, the design is sleek and unobtrusive, and the performance is outstanding. I am truly impressed with how this dehumidifier has transformed my basement into a dry, comfortable, and healthy space.
In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend the 50-pint dehumidifier with pump and WiFi to anyone in need of an effective solution for excess moisture. It's a five-star product that has earned as an essential part of my household.",5.0 out of 5 stars
DMAHChicago,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2024","This product is exactly as advertised! ‘Assembly’ was minor and easy.

mcemc,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2024",Works great. Makes noise but isn’t to bad. The pump and tube is a must. I live in the south so I would have had to empty every hour. Now I just run the hose to the sink and drain it there.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Mike,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024","I have ordered one a year ago and it was working great for about 6 months and then it stopped working. I contacted customer service and they send me a replacement. Replacement worked another 6 months and it stopped working again. Now I am looking for something more reliable.
I would not recommend this dehumidifier for any one.
After I did not have any response from seller I decided to fix it myself. It was very low on Freon so I added some Freon and now it is working. In order to do so you have to completely disassemble the unit very bad design. Stay away from this unit.",1.0 out of 5 stars
PKSpence,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2022","UPDATE 07 Aug... We received the replacement unit & waited 24-hours before plugging it in. The pump is working great! We've run an extra length of the vinyl hose out the garage door and the pump is having no issues pumping out the water. The relative humidity is holding at a constant 40-41% and we're very pleased! It gets a solid 5-star rating from us.
UPDATE 03 Aug... I reached out to the manufacturer via their ""Contact Us"" form on their website. They offered a couple of suggestions, none of which solved the problem with the pump. They are sending out a new unit via FedEx and told me to keep the old one. Although the pump is defective, and we have to manually dump the water, I must say it really brings down humidity! It went from 73% to 45% in about an hour or two. Other than the issue with the pump, we're very impressed with the effectiveness of it, AND the support we received! Once we get the new one set up, we're sure everything will be as it should.
We've got the 50-pint model that has a pump. We've got the pump turned on and a short piece of hose about 12"" long going from the pump connector on the back of the unit into a container, so that we could verify that the unit is actually working. The pump doesn't appear to be running because after a just a few minutes, the unit displays the ""E5"" error code. No water is getting pumped into the container! We've got the dehumidifier located in the basement and with the pump turned OFF, we have to go up and down the stairs every few hours to empty the water container inside the unit. We specifically bought one that has a pump to avoid that.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Xygxag,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2023","I chose this dehumidifier specifically for the pump feature. When I first ran the unit I received a pump error. I contacted the seller via email and they suggested a few diagnostic steps to ensure I was using it correctly. Ultimately, they replaced it completely. Their support was excellent - they were very responsive, eager to help, and committed to my satisfaction.
I have been running the replacement unit in our basement continuously for a few days now, and it works perfectly. The pump feature provides exactly what I had hoped for - a hands-off system that can keep my basement bone dry. It's keeping our usually damp basement of around 900 square feet down to ~40% relative humidity.
I have not tested the network and remote monitoring features as I have no need for them, but if I do I'll update this review with the results.
I would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again in the future. Many thanks to them for helping and resolving the issue quickly.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Christa S.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2024","I prefer to write glowing reviews of awesome places, things, and products when I find them. I wish that I could do that this time, but unfortunately, I can't.
I bought this dehumidifier in May, primarily for two reasons:
- The unit was advertised as being the most energy-efficient of 2024 by the Dept of Energy
- The videos of the unit operating were some of the quietest that I had found
The energy efficiency was important to me because the unit has to run pretty much consistently in my cabin, which doesn't have any vapor barrier in the walls, and the sound was important because I live in a small 3-room cabin, so no matter where I put the unit, it is within 15 feet of my bed.
When the product first arrived, I was ready to leave a 5-star review. The instructions for setup and using it were very clear and easy to understand, the packaging was easy to remove, the delivery was on time and had no damage, and the unit seemed even quieter than I had expected from the videos.
That said, life got in the way of my glowing review, so I figured I would go back in a few months to post. Now I'm kind of glad that I waited.
Not even two months into the 1-year warranty, there was a small click in the unit as the pump came on, and immediately the noise coming out of the unit was 5 times louder than it had been just a second before. The sound wasn't just loud, but it had an annoying buzz to it, like a fan blade was vibrating against the case from the inside. The unit did still technically work, but the pump was no longer pumping as quickly or efficiently as it had before, so in addition to the pump being significantly louder and more disturbing, it was also running significantly longer before stopping each cycle.
After trying everything we could think of (checking it for being level, making sure it wasn't vibrating against the wall, making sure that there wasn't anything under it, etc), I finally decided to see if a warranty repair or replacement could be made, because it was so loud that it was waking us up 2 to 3 times per night.
I had to download the manual from their website, and I turned to the warranty page (attached). The warranty fine print is significant, and people should know that DuraComfort's warranty is not the standard wording you're most likely used to. I figured out what I was in for when I got to the list of things that the warranty *doesn't* cover, including ""changes in the appearance of the product that do not affect performance."" It's not so much that the items on the list were individually unreasonable, it was that there were so many detailed exclusions (ex, ""corrosive atmosphere""?) and that the list was so extensive in making absolutely certain that there were as many ways to get out of the warranty as possible.
But it had the email address to request warranty service/replacement, so I went ahead and sent my request, along with a photo of my Serial Number plate (to prove that it wasn't ""damaged or manipulated"" and to show what the serial numbers were) along with a PDF copy of my Amazon receipt as proof of purchase date. That began what has to be considered my ""game"" with the warranty department, where I win if I can get them to honor the warranty, and they win if they can find a way to refuse. I don't normally call a warranty repair a game, but as it turned out with DuraComfort, that's what it was.
I got a quick response to my email in fluent English, asking me to email a video so that they could hear the sound. That is their first trick, and they do it to everybody, but it took me a few days to understand why that was unfair and unreasonable. I waited until the pump came on again, and took the video attached to this review, about a minute long, so that it had the noisy pump as well as my normal speaking voice and the normal operating sound of the unit, so that the sounds could be compared. The sound was clearly audible on headphones and not quite as obvious on laptop speakers; however, it turns out that the video was over 350MB, and Gmail only allows 25MB attachments on emails.
Hoping that maybe I was wrong and that they were actually asking for the video without knowing that it would be impossible to email directly from the phone, I uploaded the video to my Google Drive and emailed them a link. No luck.
They responded that they couldn't access my link in a very vague way (""I can't open this link."") - not that the link was giving an error, or that the video downloaded but wouldn't play, but just ""I can't"" -- like maybe they are forbidden from clicking on links to the video request that they know is going to be impossible to email native from a cellphone.
So I went and learned how to make the video smaller. It took me about an hour to locate a free online video editor that would let me crop the image portion of the video, shrink the image resolution, trim the outside ends off of the length, and re-compress it into a different format that eventually ended up under 25MB. Unfortunately, in the conversion process, the sound also lost some of its sharpness and clarity, but it was the only free option that I could find, and by then I realized that this was a game that I was likely destined to lose.
I sent the video as an email attachment, and within 5-10 minutes at the most, I got a canned response that the unit was too close to the wall and that the Warranty wouldn't cover it if the vent was too close to the wall.
I responded that the vent was not on the wall side, and pointed out that in the video, the pump tube comes out of the unit on the left, away from the wall, and that the pump tube is on the same side as the intake vent on this unit. I pointed out that there were 3-4 feet between the intake vent and the nearest object or wall, and I also volunteered that the unit was not touching the wall, to save myself an extra email. At that point, I listed out all the things I had done, re-explained the problems, and confirmed systematically that I had followed all of the warranty requirements, one-by-one (sent serial number photo, sent receipt, it hadn't been dropped, it was on a level concrete-supported floor, it wasn't touching a wall, etc). Then I asked if they were going to honor the warranty or not.
The response came back that the noise of 3 to 5 times as loud for twice as long every cycle was considered normal operation, and that no repair was needed.
So now I am having to run a garden hose through my house to prevent the pump from running until I can afford to buy a different dehumidifier, which will not be DuraComfort.
Based on all the reviews I have seen along with my experience, I think that this could be an amazing dehumidifier in general, particularly if you get lucky and get a good unit. If you're looking to put something in a large basement where no one sleeps, this is probably a great purchase ( it really is one of the top-rated dehumidifiers for energy efficiency in 2024).
Still, consider carefully if you need it to be quiet, or if you need it to pump the water uphill in order to get it out of the basement. In that case, you're better off picking a different company, because this company is not going to repair or replace your unit for anything except total failure (actual leaking, not dehumidifying at all, not pumping at all).
Meanwhile, they are going to do their best to play their games and make it impossible to file in every way that they can.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Choche G.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2024","In a central Tx (outside 65% hum) it will fill its 1.7G container in about 12hrs so it does work and that is about 30 pints in 24hrs. Unfortunately, it is somewhat noisy - about the level of a typical a-c window unit made in the 90s (sounds like its vibrating but its not) - not too bad but not too good in say a bedroom at night or even living area with a TV - vol will need to be raised so in an area where sound does not matter this works very well.

Steve E.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2023","Summary: Excellent customer support and they really stand behind the product. The jury is still out on the quality of the product.
I ordered this product in July 2022 to use in my house crawl space. Because getting it into the crawl space isn't simple, I ran it inside for a week before moving it.
The product was easy to setup and get the app running for remote mgmt. While running inside, I noted that the humidity level reported by the product was 5-10% off from what my Ecobee thermostat reports. Though, that wasn't a big deal for me. I just wanted to keep the crawl space humidity near 50-55%. So, accurate enough.
After approx 90 days of use, the product stopped running with an error code on the display. After contacting support, they confirmed that the refrigerant was low (according to the error code). To address the issue, the seller offered to provide a new unit. The new unit arrived within about 3 days and was up and running.
During the winter months, the product was turned off because the humidity bis generally quite low. In May, we moved to a new home and the humidity was high so I began running the product inside. After approx 2 months of use, the product would run but was no longer extracting moisture from the air. After observing this for 2 days, I noticed that the coils were iced over. After allowing the coil ice to thaw and dry, I tried the unit again with the same result. Within approx 30 mins, the coils would begin to ice up.
At this point, I contacted support again. This product should have a useful life considerably longer than a few months. Again, I had an excellent experience with support. After a few questions and answers (over night for each question/answer because support is in Asia), the seller offered to replace the unit again. I was asked to return the defective unit. Return shipping was provided.
Two days ago, I received the 2nd replacement unit and it has been running fine since setup. In the next few days, the product will go into the crawl space again.
If I experience another failure within the next year, I'll write an updated review.",3.0 out of 5 stars
bethesdaadk,"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2022","I have a day left before I can return the unit. The E5 code seems to indicate that the tube isn't properly inserted into the unit - I assume to create a good ""seal"" so that the water can be pumped out. But as my pictures show - the tube insertion is as good as it's going to get.
One extra star because their support team is responding to emails - but it's a long turn-around and I suspect the time-zone difference is great.
I needed this precisely for the pump feature - as another reviewer said. Manually dumping is not helpful.
Update - upgraded rating as I returned original unit to Amazon and ordered a replacement. No E5 code. Unit is working. However, eventually the filter light came on. But there really aren't cleaning instructions - so I treated it the same way as I would a room unit AC and ran the filter under the water in the sink. Though I could barely tell it was dirty - running water through it did appear to make it cleaner - but the filter light is still on. Is there a way to reset the light?",4.0 out of 5 stars

Michigan Man,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2022","Things that were important to me with the dehumidifier were that it was smart, had a large water / tank capacity, could run on a quiet setting and that it worked. This dehumidifier does it all. Setting up the “smartness” of the humidifier was pretty simple, but I haven’t used it much.
I’ve focused mainly on turbo (needed to get my lower level dry quickly!) and the continuous settings. I have used the “comfort” setting as well when I’ve been in the lower-level and needed it to be quieter. I used the timer just once when playing around with it. It worked and was easy to use. I mainly just use the continuous setting.
I haven’t had to change the filter yet, but it looks like it will be pretty easy to do. I have humidifiers where it’s tough to switch out the filter, so this is a nice change. For it’s water capacity of 35 pints, it’s actually pretty compact, light and easy to move with the wheels on the bottom.

Original review:
Don’t buy Dura Comfort dehumidifier for the wifi function
Pairs with “Smartlife-Smarthome” app for iphone. Sadly it is useless because when you use the app with this dehumidifier, and power it off with the app, the dehumidifier loses its settings. When I use this app, it always resets to 50% humidity instead of the 40% I set it to. Always turns the pump off after I have turned it on.
When I do NOT use the app, the dehumidifier properly remembers my settings across power cycles as I would expect. So I obviously will not be using wifi functions of new my Dura Comfort dehumidifier. Shame. I will now try to reset it to get it off my wifi network.
As for the main function of dehumidification, so far so good. I will update this review if that changes. Too bad about the wifi app.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Heather Davis,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2022","This review is for the unit with pump and remote control. I am using 24/7 in a condo to keep moisture at about 45. It has been working since October. Two issues: let's say you use the pump with the drain (this is probably why you bought this unit). If you change ANY settings or turn off/on remotely via the app, the PUMP WILL TURN OFF, regardless. At that point the only way to turn the pump on is via the BUTTON ON THE DEVICE! Let's say you are on vacation and the power at home goes off for a few minutes and then back on.. Well, you will be able to remotely turn the device back on but not the pump! The device will fill up the bucket and then stop working until you are back from the vacation. So basically the remote control for a unit with the pump is a joke, and this is why I give this device 1 star. The second issue are the casters: they are very loud, moving the device around is loud for you and neighbors (especially the one below). I would not recommend the unit with pump and remote control, unless they update the firmware to solve the problem.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Marconelli,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2022","The DuraComfort is a nifty little unit that does a great job at dehumidifying damp spaces. We're in a coastal location, within a few yards of the sea, and our basement is damp year-round. So this dehumidifier was just what we needed. (We've tried some other models in the past, and they have all failed in one way or another. But I have great hopes for this one.)
First of all, let me urge you not to be misled by a negative review alleging that the the remote and the drain hose were missing. The reason no remote was included is that none is needed: your smartphone is what you use to control the unit remotely. And the ad clearly states that the optional drain hose is not included, as the accompanying photo shows. So there are no missing pieces. I used a simple garden hose to take advantage of the continuous drainage this unit allows, so that I can run it continuously without having to empty the water collection bucket.
I first tried to use my iPad to install the app that is recommended for controlling the DuraComfort remotely via WiFi, but I was unsuccessful. I wrote to the manufacturer about the problem, and very quickly got the reply that a smartphone, not an iPad, was required. When I used the phone, instead, it loaded smoothly. Problem solved.
The manufacturer recommends the app ""Smart Life - Smart Home,"" by Guangdong Winkezi Intelligent Control Technology, but I found that a different app I already had installed (""Smart Life - Smart Living,"" by Volcano Technology) also worked just fine. My guess is that any number of other apps designed to control smart technology devices like this unit, would also work.
The DuraComfort offers two different fan speeds and 4 different modes. You can choose a preset humidity level that you're aiming for, and then run the fan at low speed (""Dry"" mode) or high speed (""Turbo"" mode); or you can set it to run continuously, irrespective of humidity level achieved (""Continuous"" mode); or you can set it to choose the appropriate humidity level itself, based on the ambient temperature, in which case it will default to low speed (""Comfort"" mode). The mode selection must be done on the unit itself; all the other functions -- fan speed, humidity level, power on/off -- can be done either on the unit or on the app.
I decided to set mine on ""Dry"" mode, and chose a humidity level of 45% (rather than the default setting of 35%). When the ambient humidity got below 45%, the fan and compressor turned off, but the unit itself remained powered on. Then when the humidity level rose above the preset level, the unit resumed its dehumidification.
It comes with two user manuals -- one for the dehumidifier, and one for the WiFi connection. The latter is very thorough, although it might be nice if it mentioned that a phone, not a tablet, is required. The former was written by someone with a good Chinese-English dictionary, but an imperfect command of English. Still, it was never impossible to figure out what was intended, however comically it was expressed (e.g., ""the filter can take out like fig"" means ""the filter can be removed as shown in the accompanying illustration"").
Bottom line: the DuraComfort dehumidifier is a well-designed and apparently well-constructed machine. I found that its ambient humidity readings tended to be a few percentage points lower than a couple of other gauges I was using, that it is easy to compensate for, if one felt the need to do so. It's a winner.
I highly recommend the DuraComfort dehumidifier.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Yani,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2023","Got this dehumidifier to keep the humidity down in the basement. It works pretty well most of the time. 90%. Sometimes it blows out hot air though heating up the room. I haven’t had much of a problem with humidity since I started using it. You need to empty it out about two times a day for a room that is 50‘ x 16’ during a New England summer. It also has an attachment to connect a hose directly to the back, but I haven’t used that yet. It would probably make it a lot easier since I wouldn’t have to empty it out so much. all in all it does the job that I expected it to.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Vincent,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2022","I’ve been in desperate need of a dehumidifier as spring and summer is approaching. My climate is very humid and that can deteriorate a lot of things in your home - flooring, furniture, metal objects, etc. I found this item and I’ve got to say that it has impressed me thus far and has pulled a significant amount of water out of the air. It’s doing a great job maintaining the humidity levels and I know that it’s doing the job as it feels more comfortable in the house. My plan is to move this item to the basement as I have a lot of sporting goods and equipment that will rust if I don’t control the humidity. I really like the fact that this can be controlled via mobile application and I’ve tried to link it Alexa. It appeared to sync up, however, I wasn’t able to control it via voice commands. I have been able to control it via the phone application and that worked just fine. The noise level is low and even with the fan turned up to a higher setting it’s still relatively quiet. The water bin is easy to empty and as an alternative you can connect a garden hose style tube for drainage. There’s also a notification on the unit that lights up when the water bin is full and there’s a filter that has to be cleaned periodically. I look forward to using this during the summer and seeing how well it does with maintaining humidity levels in the basement. As of now I'm pleased with how it functions - if I can get the Amazon Alexa to control it or give me feedback on the device then I’ll be all set. Give it a try!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Moonglow ColorKid,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2022","Excellent dehumidifier perfect for large spaces. Convenient to use and easy to set up. We have a large attic that I use heavily for storage and accessing extra items, but our house is a remodeled old farmhouse with a lot of air circulation issues. This meant the attic had a lot of trouble with heat, poor air movement, and because the roof had been foam insulated - trapped moisture and air. On very hot days, my walls would weep from the crown moulding because there was just so much hot air trapped in the roof. I had a hunch a large dehumidifier might be the right thing for keeping air not just circulating, but also helping to dry it out.
This dehumidifier is very large (compared to a room dehumidifier) so getting it up the steps was challenging as it was heavy, but once I got it up into the attic and plugged in, it ran like a champ and within 24 hours the change in the room was remarkable. It was probably 10 degrees cooler, and I have not noticed the wall seepage one time since then, even when we had a recent string of very hot days accompanied by torrential rain.
Because it's a big dehumidifier designed for a large space, the tank is also quite sizable, so we use two 1-gallon pitchers to empty it which helps us get it down the steps easier. This way the tank can pop back inside immediately and I don't have to bring it downstairs to empty, then back up again. When you consider that we had been looking at completely revamping our A/C system, removing the foam insulation, installing an attic ventilation system, and changing out the roof as possible fixes for the moisture problem, it makes this $200 machine that fixed the issue seem like a blessing from the Amazon gods! We are beyond satisfied with how this product has functioned and fixed our home care issue. I highly highly recommend trying out dehumidifiers if you have moisture problems related to air circulation before you revamp your entire A/C system! While you may still need to make those changes eventually, this is a great way to help stop the moisture causing damage in the meantime.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Pamdirac,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2022","This dehumidifier is a conventional one with a compressor running on refrigerant with more modern wifi connectivities. It is significantly more effective than the one I currently use with semiconductor cooling chips in terms of effectiveness and coverage area. With a total area of 500 sqft, it fills the bucket within several hours so I decided to connect the hose to the drain directly. It control the humidity well below 40% at the set point and is quieter than the 20 yrs old one left by the previous owner of the house. The wifi connection is easy with the Smart Life app which I've used with a couple of other smart devices. There are only two minor problems, one is the machine keeps running on the dry mode even if the detected humidity is below the setting of 40%, i.e. it still runs at 36% humidity when the setting is 40%. The humidifier takes air from the back through the filter while venting on the side, not like most dehumidifiers venting at the front. It is hard to be installed in the wall cabinet because the vent will be blocked. Would probably better if it can vent in the front.",4.0 out of 5 stars
K_Chihuahua,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2022","Absolutely LOVE this dehumidifier!!!
It remove so much water FAST!!!
We live in a 3 story 2600sqft + townhouse and have dehumidifiers on every floor. lol
We have an open layout on the second floor so one big dehumidifier is needed and this was PERFECT.
This does the job!!!
It’s heavy, like any other dehumidifier, but the handle on top makes it super easy to move around and it’s like you are carrying a suitcase. PLUS you can put the handle back inside when not in use which gives it a clean look.
I have a similar 50 pints dehumidifier and this DuraComfort is quieter, more compact and powerful!!!
I never realized how convenient it is to have wifi!!
I first thought that I don’t need wifi for a dehumidifier but I was wrong!!!
It’s so convenient!
I don’t run the dehumidifier 24/7, since I don’t want a high electric bill so it’s super convenient for me to control the power with an app.
Now I can check the humidity level in bed and turn the power on through my app. I can make my living room air comfortable before even getting up!!
How convenient!!
I’ve been using the smart life app for all my smart home devices so I’m glad Duracomfort uses the same app too!!!
Pairing the dehumidifier was SUPER easy.
It took no time for me to add it.
The overall size is compact compared to the one I already have. I also have an air purifier in the living room and this dehumidifier is a bit bigger than that one.
FYI, it says 490 Watts but my wattage meter actually says 545 Watts.
It is energy star rated and still a little less than my other 50 pints energy efficient dehumidifier so it’s still good and not a big deal but just FYI.
Last but not least, I LOVE the neat hooks and the “plug fixer”!!
You can neatly hook the power cord and plug in so that it wouldn’t just be hanging!

I am pleased with how this dehumidifier works in my space. I have Smart Life on my phone so as soon as I had plugged this dehumidifier in and it began searching, a Smart Life note popped up saying it had found a new device and asked if I wanted to add it. Because I have Smart Life and it is already a skill in Alexa, I also have voice control over this dehumidifier though it's more of an on/off control via Alexa. Still, I can turn it on through my phone before coming in for a shower and leave it on for 20-30 minutes after I take my shower to ensure the room is not contributing to the higher humidity to the room/house. I did take a short piece of hose and have it draining into the vanity sink so it's leaving the house/going down the drain and I don't have to worry about overflow.

Richard Ballard,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2022","I ordered this dehumidifier for my fieldstone foundation basement; moisture seeps though the walls (especially in rainy weather). I didn't expect the dehumidifier to eliminate seepage, but I wanted reduced basement humidity to discourage mold / mildew formation. I also wanted continuous drain operation so I needn't repeatedly empty the dehumidifier drain bucket; this dehumidifier typically condenses up to 8 pints of moisture per day.
This is a compact convenient dehumidifier. It weighs 25 pounds, it is sufficiently quiet for bedroom use, it is sufficiently compact (18 x 12 x 12 inches) to sit on a utility sink drain board, and it consumes less than 150 watts in normal operation. It arrives well packaged in a cardboard carton with top / bottom polyfoam inserts; the package also contains an (optional) drainage tube and a clearly-written user guide. The carton instructs letting the dehumidifier sit undisturbed vertically for 24 hours before powering up; this rest period allows the coolant to migrate to the condenser bottom. It is advisable to remove the folded drainage tube and folded AC power cord from the dehumidifier drain bucket and allow them to relax during this 24 hour rest period.
Setup is easy: the dehumidifier removable drain bucket holds ~2 quarts of condensed moisture (the dehumidifier pauses and beeps when the drain bucket is full) or attach the included tube for continuous drainage. After power up the dehumidifier has three modes: dry [settable relative humidity (RH) plus fan], fan (only) and laundry (dehumidify constantly for 24 hours, then return to dehumidify mode). Air circulation is weak in my basement; I chose ""dry plus fan"" (the fan runs constantly, the condenser runs when RH exceeds the RH setting). At the other end of my basement I added a (not included) small box fan to promote better air circulation throughout the basement.
Operation is automatic and convenient: with continuous drain operation the only required maintenance is a weekly cleaning of the dehumidifier's air filter. [A limited amount of ""wipe clean"" cleaning is required before long-term storage.] The dehumidifier dries out my basement with little power consumption and little repeat maintenance.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Alex B.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2022","I was so impressed with the DuraComfort 4,500 sf version of this dehumidifier I picked up months ago that I wanted to also get this one to keep in the basement. This 3,500 is a much more manageable size! The other one is HUGE and heavy and amazingly powerful, this one is much more manageable size.
The unite does specify that it should be upright for 24 hours prior to turning on the unit. After that 24 hour period, I turned it on and fired up the app. Connected and setup in the app within 5 minutes (it took me about 15 min the first time) and was a complete breeze! The unit included everything it was supposed to (note: it's not supposed to come with a hose nor remote). Glad it didn't come with a remote, I lose remotes, but I don't lose my cell phone. Now that it's connected, I can monitor the unit and humidity from wherever I am. While in the office, I can turn on the unit! Energy Star certified is such a bonus, especially if you plan on setting it and forgetting it. No big surprises on my energy bills. Works like an absolute charm! You can feel the exhaust as a nice dry flow of air. Quiet running on the low settings but when you need it, those high settings are majorly powerful.
My entire house is 1,800 sf, so this more than has me covered. Since I keep the basement door closed due to pets, I know it may be a little overkill but I really did want the separate units, so buying both is a good idea if you need/can. If you plan on keeping it in 1 spot all the time, that larger 4,500 sf model is the way I'd go. If you plan on moving from room to room on demand, this smaller 3,500 sf is fantastic still too.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sharon Beverly,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2022","This Dehumidifier for basement 50 Pint for 4500 sq ft With Energy Star Certified & Smart Wi-Fi is for a small (about 1200 sq. ft, including small basement) home in a humid, mountainous area.
We normally keep a dehumidifier running in the basement, but it doesn't have the capacity to take care of the house. This dehumidifier's ability to cover 4500 sq ft should do a much better job than our old one.
The box in which it arrives is quite heavy. Once opened, you can raise the handle at the top of the unit to carry it where you will place it. It even has casters to roll it into place.
There are two ways to read the instructions. There are paper instructions (decently-sized font) and the ability to use a QR code to read them. The instructions are for both the set-up of the dehumidifier and for using it via wi-fi.
The unit is fairly quiet; not much noisier than running a fan.
The dehumidifier has a built-in pump for drainage. Or, drainage can be accomplished with the tubing into a bucket or a permanent drainage hole. One of the plusses of this unit in comparison to our old model is that it doesn't require a gravity feed to drain the moisture. That could be an important feature for your use.
You can use the app to set the amount of humidity you want in the room. Obviously, the drier the setting, the more frequently you will need to empty the bucket (if you don't have a permanent drainage space).
Time will tell if this is a vast improvement over our old unit. Should any problems arise, they will be noted here as an edit.",5.0 out of 5 stars
SteveinKC2,"Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2022","Updating my original 4 star review as of Sept 30, 2023, down to 2 stars, as after 14 mos of service, it throws an E3 Pump Error and quits working, regardless of pump on or off, drain tube or water bucket drainage. After a full power cycle will work for a few minutes and then throw the E3 error again in all different configurations, hose, bucket, pump on/off. Haven't been able to find any vendor support at all.
It came very well packed, with stiff cardboard reinforcement in the box corners, which was important as my old Vivosun dehumidifier took a beating in shipment, as these are heavy dense units that I am sure the package handlers hate, so kudos to Amazon Delivery. I like the big fan with turbo that really moves air and doesnt make much noise other than moving air. I also like the handle on top that conceals when not in use as these units are heavy if going up or down stairs, you really need the handle, and also the four casters for moving the unit around. The controls are pretty straightforward to get the unit up and running right after plugging it into the wall, but perusing the owners manual allows you to dial it in for optimal settings in your environment and/or connect the wi fi control feature by first scanning the qr code, then a second qr code, downloading the app, and then going thru the connection process to get the app on your phone talking to the dehumidifier. If you plan to empty the bucket regularly, you're all set, if you want to use the hose and/or pump to drain into a floor drain, just push the hose into the hole on the back of the unit till it clicks/snaps tightly into place and unfurl the supplied clear tubing, that is much longer than most, to a drain. Lost one star on energy efficiency, 490 watts is still a lot of juice, and I thought at $299, it was a little overpriced versus competitors, which is probably why Amazon has a $20 coupon on the listing at the time I am writing this review.

It’s got some convenient features like Wi-Fi which I haven’t used yet and may not use but it’s still a nice feature. The touch panel is intuitive to use. It’s easy to set up the first time out of the box. The directions are clear and easy to understand. There are two pamphlets with directions on them. One is for the unit itself and the other explains how to set up the Wi-Fi.
The unit has a pump built right into it. My current dehumidifier is old and I have it gravity feed into a condensate pump separate from it.
I’m hoping this built-in pump holds up. If the pump isn’t used it can also drain by gravity into another condensate pump or a drain. It of course has the option to use the built-in bucket.
It’s heavy but I was still able to carry it down into my basement easily. It has a handle built into the top and while carrying it I had no fear that it would break off.
Overall it’s a well thought out machine that I highly recommend. If I encounter any problems with it over time I will come back and write them in this review but so far the unit has been working flawlessly.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Drew's Reviews,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2022","I have been testing and reviewing SmartHome products since they first being released almost 15 years ago. Much of my home is operated via app, set on schedules and triggered in one way or another. When I saw this smart dehumidifier that worked via Tuya I was excited to give it a shot.
I have thoroughly tested this product over the last several months and, as my followers know they can count on, I have put this product through a full battery of testing.
In terms of a dehumidifier it’s decent - not great but also not bad. As with the vast majority of these products the claims made in the listing are vastly inflated over what the device is actually capable of accomplishing. For example there is no way this could effectively dehumidify 3,500 square feet (other places in the listing it reads 2,500) - the reality is it will be effective for 500-750 square feet - or one large room.
I set this up with a drain hose as to not have to constantly deal with emptying the drainage bucket. I would highly advise utilizing this solution if possible as the built in bucket is not large and will require emptying every day or 2 in most situations.
I can say this definitely pulls moisture from the air - as every dehumidifier should. Though the settings on this model are just not very effective.
I have tested the humidistat extensively and found it is not accurate. Using multiple humidistats placed around this device with all of them getting nearly identical readings this will have a variance of over 5%.
This unit will run far more than is necessary. As many dehumidifier users understand, these units consume a decent amount of power due to the compressor. This unit will run long after it has reached the set humidity level, turn off then turn back on within minutes to run longer - while all of my other humidistats show humidity is actually below what I have set.
Finally I want to discuss this being a SmartHome device. As my followers know, I write about SmartHome equipment all of the time. Having SmartHome devices is great as long as they are actually smart, make our lives easier and work together with other smart devices in order to optimize our living environment.
Shortly after receiving this unit I reached out to the manufacturer to ask questions which I often do.
In response to my question as to if it possible to utilize external SmartHome triggers as I have multiple TUYA monitors that detect temperature and humidity this is the response I received:
“The unit can not be paired with other external sensors within TUYA through IFTTT? Yes, TUYA currently does not have a plan to support dehumidifiers. We are also communicating this issue and discussing possible solutions. We will launch this soon. You are welcome to continue to pay attention to our follow-up. The function of TUYA involves a voice function of ALEXA, and we are working hard to realize it. We believe that this additional function will be added in our second generation, please wait and see.”
This is obviously not the case as there is a full dehumidifier section and many products that monitor humidity which can then be set to trigger another SmartHome device. For example, I wanted to place a sensor within my cabinet and set it where if humidity was at or over 40% the dehumidifier would turn on - a very simple IF THIS THAN THAT (IFTTT) program. It surprised me that a manufacturer of a SmartHome product would claim the platform on which they have built their product would not accommodate this which it most certainly does.
The only controls available in the TUYA app are on / off, fan speed, humidity level (which is not accurate) and a timer. Without anyway to even control the mode or interact with other SmartHome devices such as my air quality meter, having this unit on Tuya is pointless.
There is a limit of the number of devices that can be connected to the router at any given time. While many people never reach this limit, due to my constant testing and use of this type of equipment I do. In the end I decided this unit does not warrant the IP address space on my network.
I have tested and reviewed many dehumidifiers, as I conclude my testing of this unit I have determined that while it does dehumidify the SmartHome capabilities have a lot of work before they are actually helpful. At the current price point there are better options in terms of dehumidifiers that can remove more moisture and are easier to operate. Hopefully this company will continue to improve the SmartHome capabilities but, at this time I can not recommend this product.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Deadbunny,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2022","The dehumidifier itself is a great product. I have been using it in my basement which normally gets quite damp in the summer months, and it has easily kept it dry so far. I have it draining into a floor drain using the included hose and I monitor it using an app on my phone - which is very convenient when your dehumidifier isn't in a high traffic location. The humidifier is pretty nice looking and more importantly with its two speed fan, is quiet enough to be able to have a conversation right beside it. Having said that, I probably wouldn't want it right beside me when watching TV.
This works great! The musty smell is gone and there's a noticeable difference in the basement in the humidity level. It looks great and it's overall pretty quiet! It comes already assembled and it has wheels so you can easily move it around. I have no complaints!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sean McGill,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2021","Wow, I really like the simple interface panel. This is so easy to move around due to the 360 swivel wheels and top handle. The bucket also has a handle for easy dumping. It has auto shutoff when the bucket is full so I don’t use the phone APP. This is very suitable for large rooms. I use this in my basement and it does a great job taking out the humidity.
Still working over 8 months later too.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023","This unit has a one year warranty. However, if the company does not supply a repair location to fix for free, then the warranty is useless. I ordered from Amazon on 9/9/2022. Today is 8/1/2023 and it started icing up 2 weeks ago. That's less than a year and I sent the company my official Amazon purchase receipt. It ices up and blows cold air. Not working at all. It used to work. I never used the app. Waiting for an answer from their online customer service as they are located in another country!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Mark Gilden,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2022","My laundry room is always a bit more humid than any other room in the house. I used to have a standard dehumidifier that I would empty regularly in there, but this is so much better! It's much smaller so it can actually fit on a shelf instead of taking up floor space, and thanks to the included continuous drain I have it dripping into the utility sink drain. No more emptying the bucket, and the room in general stays much more pleasant thanks to removing the humidity. An excellent product!",5.0 out of 5 stars
rangerike,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2022","Even though my basement is only about 1200 sq. ft., it's way better to have a large dehumidifier that runs from time to time over a small one that runs constantly and can't even keep the humidity really in check, but this definitely does that and does it well. It really is for a basement or larger space because of its size and even if it works quickly, it'll take up a lot of floor space in a small room, so is better as a larger area dehumidifier.
The pump works well and comes with a decently long hose so you can better position it based on where you need it and not where your hose will reach. It also has smart functionality, however, for a dehumidifier that seems a bit excessive and something that I'll not be using all that much even if I did set it up.
Overall, it does its job quite well and keeps my basement at the right humidity and that's all I really wanted without having a dehumidifier run constantly.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Nitty's Mom,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2021","I had a larger dehumidifier in my basement but after 5 years it stopped working. My basement, which is about 1200 sq. ft and tends to feel damp in the summer needs a dehumidifier. This 35 pint unit is working well, even though it is now winter in NJ. The reason I still run it in the winter is that it is in my laundry room and I like to line dry some of my clothes. The dehumidifier speed the drying process considerably. The water reservoir doesn't hold 35 pints, so if you did run it in the summer on high, you would probably have to empty it more than once per day.
UPDATE: After running for two summers, this unit has died and is not repairable. Buy a name brand. 1 star
This unit can connect to wifi and can be run with a phone app. Personally, I won't use this feature because I don't see the need to adjust it except at the control panel. For that reason the unit is more costly than a similar 35 pint unit which could be purchased for approximately $50 less. If you aren't interested in another phone app, you could save some money. 4 stars.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Tracylulu80,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2022","This dehumidifier is fantastic. It took down half a bucket of water in my basement, in about an hour.

Since the dehumidifiers run for at least an hour (or two), being energy efficient will bring down my electric bill. The display on the top is bright blue and easy to read.

Devin,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2024","(Update: The manufacturer has replaced the unit without any cost to me -- only the time spent to go through the process and reply to emails. The new unit was shipped free of shipping cost and in advance of me even returning the original defective unit. They included a pre-paid shipping label and asked me to ship back the original defective unit. They also offered a small refund to be credited to my account for all of the hassle -- I haven't seen it reflected in my account yet, but it's a nice gesture for having to go through the whole process of having it replaced. The replacement unit works great. Accordingly, I'm updating my rating to 5 stars. It's unfortunate that the original item had a defect, but the manufacturer replaced at no cost and gave a partial refund -- not sure what more I could ask for. I am leaving the original review below just for context.)
