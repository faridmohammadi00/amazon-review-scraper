gb,"Reviewed in Canada on August 2, 2024",I measured the height and ordered it but when i tried to install it i realized that the top has to swing up to load to load the pod and that made it too high for my cabinets. I guess u can slide it out everytime to make way for the clearance but wasn't for me. Qaulity machine though.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Angel Di Nardo,"Reviewed in Canada on May 18, 2023","I love my keurig. Disappointed by the fact only one person in the house can connect to the keurig via the app or wifi. And for some reason it seems like the water level it's always changing within one 10oz setting. But those are such minor details in our house hold, especially with such perfect tasting coffee,
Update: not even a year owning our machine it asks to descale and we descale the machine using the keurig descale kit half way through it gives me an error code and turns off dead, i tried everything i waited thirty minutes and checked on it, then tried unplugging it then tried checking it in a different outlet its dead wont turn back on. I got nothing. God im starting to miss a good old purculator these days. I bet i wont even get reimbursed or rectified for this machine, and as i said in my earlier statement it sucks that it only allows one person in the house to connect to it",4.0 out of 5 stars
Sharon D,"Reviewed in Canada on December 5, 2023","I had the old K200 in Teal blue and then had a Nespresso machine for a while, but the coffee was getting too expensive and I had to order online usually.

So I decided to check out Keurig again, since they had so many new machines now !
I’ve had it almost two weeks now and it’s great !
Things I like about it :
No preheating necessary
Very quiet
Lets you know when water is low and time to add more (so you don’t run out while a coffee is brewing !)
Came with the filter kit for the water reservoir which I had had for my old Keurig.
Able to adjust strength and temperature
It was easy to download the app too and connect to wifi.
The brew ID feature is cool; I haven’t tried any compatible pods yet but i probably will.
All in all, if you can get it on sale (I did ), it’s worth it !!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Aesir,"Reviewed in Canada on April 28, 2024","Horrific design, the water tank does not like to stay on the machine, brush it lightly, and you better get the towels because it is wet clean up time. The coffee is Keurig coffee, 2 stars at best, but we buy these machines for speed, here is where this machine really sucks. It does the ""Brew ID"" thing, which takes up to 30 seconds to determine the k-cup, which it doesn't really like to do more than once or so a day, so not a useful feature at all. Every 3rd or 4th cup of coffee, the machine will not brew the cup, it will spit out a teaspoon of coffee, and then say used pod, adding even more time to this already laborious wait. The power cord is shorter than a Chihuahua's tail, so be prepared to unplug it to move it 6 inches to clean underneath. If you want a cup of coffee tomorrow, that you brew today in a substandard disposable POS machine, then by all means purchase this trash.
EDIT: Came in to reiterate what an absolute piece of trash this machine is. I truly wish Amazon would allow zero star reviews, as this machine doesn't even deserve a single star. Absolute garbage from an environmental mess of a company.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Stephen Walker,"Reviewed in Canada on November 16, 2023","UPDATE - seems a software update resolved the problem with WiFi connectivity. Keurig support team was great to deal with (albeit by email). They stuck with the problem until it was resolved. Thanks!!
Really nice machine for making coffee! BUT, as yet, I have not been able to take advantage of any of the SMART features as I cannot get it to connect to my Wi-Fi network. Customer Support was not available during the weekend, however support via email has been good. But one email a day with suggestions isn't very productive, and so far, my unit is still a K-Supreme PLUS STUPID. Awaiting response from support team - hoping the software version on the unit is old so a new unit can be sent out.
Hopefully a resolution can be found, otherwise I'll exchange for a cheaper basic machine that just sits in the corner and make a great cup of coffee. Perhaps that SMART stuff is just a lot of useless extras....",3.0 out of 5 stars
Jim Poloway,"Reviewed in Canada on July 25, 2024","This unit is designed to sell pods made by Keurig. Every time you turn it on, it searches for a Keurig pod bar code. Also, it no longer permits reusable K-cups for those who prefer to use their own ground coffee.
The 8 oz setting only gives you 6 oz so I have to use the 10 oz setting. The ""new and improved"" multi-injection pod ports leak water out of the top of the pod bypassing the pod into your coffee cup. The single injection point worked so much better. I will be giving this one away and going back to my old unit.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in Canada on February 11, 2023","So it's a Keurig and it works great and I like having the options of stronger coffee and hotter coffee and different sizes, however the Wireless feature where you can select a time to brew your coffee everyday is somewhat useless as I tried to do my hubby's coffee for him but it wouldn't Brew unless I agreed to the fact that there was a cup in place. So rather than just conveniently telling the app what time I want my coffee perks, I still have to agree to it therefore I couldn't ignore it or sleep through it. I had to watch for this message to pop up so his coffee would brew. Just as easy to stand there and push buttons.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Edit: called Keurig, it’s just the Philippines call center used by all the big companies when they want to provide fake customer support. So gave up on that quick.
Took it apart by following a YouTube video. I fixed it but prying the cover off was not easy.

In the middle of the descale process, an error message popped up and the unit shut off completely and wouldn’t turn on again, dead unit. Searched through Reddit threads for known issue to troubleshoot. Keurig Customer service is sending a replacement. Don’t waste your time on this unit.
Sep 2022 update: replacement machine is also a dud during initial setup, hung up on cleansing brew with error code 8. Attempted many unplug and replug to initiate brew without luck. 3rd machine replacement is in the way.
Jan 2023 update: The 3rd replacement has failed. Once again, it was operating fine until the descale message popped up. Shortly after while brewing coffee, the unit started to over heat, blowing excessive steam, followed by a loud “POP” noise. The unit didn’t turn on afterwards and water started to flood my countertop.
I will not bother to pursue a 4th replacement (although under warranty) but rather I’ll be moving on from Keurig completely.

The frother is not PFOA, PFTE, PFOS free so if you have any small pets it's not safe to use.

Just Me,"Reviewed in Canada on May 16, 2023","My first impression when seeing this was that Keurig was going after the Nespresso market. The design is very similar to a number of Nespresso models. This is not meant as a slight in any way, as I have always been a fan of the Nespresso single-cup coffee maker's designs.
► The one step up with this machine is the milk frother sitting to the right side at the front, which makes it simple to get at.
Overall the machine looks great. The minimal metal, which contrasts the black, is nice and isn't an eye-sore.
► Filling the water reservoir is simple now that there is a handle on it. The capacity allows it to hold enough water to make coffee for at least a couple of days, depending on how much caffeine we need.
► Being able to make different-sized shots is a normal feature these days.
► The frother does a great job. Its design produces better froth than the other companies that make similar machines.
» One thing I did find after having it on the counter for a few days is that the design is relatively easy to wipe down, but there are some corners where dust can be hard to get at.
» As with most countertop appliances these days, the cord could be made longer so that it can stay on the countertop, and I don't need to find an extra short extension cord to reach the AC outlet. Not every kitchen counter has an AC outlet every two or three feet.
The control panel at the top is easy to use but not so easy to view for vertically challenged people like my wife. Sure, there is the option to use the phone app, but ... another app ... It's getting to the point where almost everything these days has an app. Sure, apps might make life easier when you can control some things while you're away from home but needing to scroll through pages of apps is getting annoying.
🗿 Is the app useful? Kinda, sorta, might be for coffee nerds, so maybe it will be a great add-on for some people.
Ok, griping out of the way. Like other Keurig machines, this makes a great cup of coffee, as we found out after needing to go buy some pods. We have been using Nespresso machines because of their simplicity we have not replaced any of the Keurig pods
✘ Ok, I said I was done griping, but I will take one more swipe at the company. At least Nespresso always includes sample pods with their machines! Over the years, we have used various Nespresso machines and have always enjoyed sampling the variety of flavours in the sample packs. Flavours, we would normally not buy simply because we had not tried them. Keurig could do well to take note of this marketing scheme since, after sampling the Nespresso pods, we did end up buying more flavour varieties on a regular basis.
Set up after pulling everything out of the box was simple and fast. After a quick cleaning run, we were sipping coffee in no time. Keurig makes great coffee, as does Nespresso, and personally, I have a hard time deciding which I prefer.
» A notable item, for those who enjoy it, which another reviewer also mentions, there isn't really any crema.
👴 Ok, sorry, one more thing to nag about. At this price, would it kill the company to include a reusable pod so we can use our own favourite coffee, which they do not offer in their pod selection???
Overall, even with my griping, this is a great coffee maker, and I like the departure from the standard Keurig coffee machine design. I would take this over the older designs any day.
It's because of the lack of a reusable cup or any samples that I'm giving this only 4 stars.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Heather,"Reviewed in Canada on May 30, 2023","This is a very simple Keurig machine that allows you to access most functions via buttons right on the top or through an app. We are using it almost exclusively through the buttons, and I've only made use of the app just to see how it is done. (Note that the machine does not come with any sample k-cups.)
The machine allows you to slot in a k-cup and select the amount of water you want to pass through it (6, 8, 10, or 12 oz). You can also adjust the temperature, save favourite settings, or just dispense some plain hot water. The machine will sense which k-cup you've inserted and suggest the best settings to use.
Operation is very simple, and mostly consists of pressing the big K button. There is a large water jug that holds enough water for several cups of whatever you prefer. It sits to the back and right of the main part of the machine. A milk frother sits to the front right, and it is also simple to use.
The app allows you to make the same adjustments you can make using the buttons on the machine. You can also use it to brew your drink at a distance (make sure you leave a cup under it!). It also offers suggestions for drinks you can make using whatever k-cup you search for (e.g. a dirty chai latte using a chai latte k-cup and a coffee k-cup, both brewed using 6oz of water, add your sweetener and whipped cream after brewing).
There are a few things about the machine I don't like. Firstly, you can't use the milk frother while the machine is dispensing your drink. So weird. Secondly, the screen can be a little hard to read. This is possibly due to my height (quite short) and the glare from the lights under my cupboards. But it seems like the screen is tilted at a slightly weird angle that makes it hard to see unless you are above it just right. Also, the default temperature is a little lower than I like, but this is adjustable.
Overall, I feel like, other than the milk frother, this is a pretty basic machine that allows you to customize the amount of water and temperature of your drink. It is easy to use, and I do like the addition of the milk frother since it allows for fancier drinks.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Sapphire,"Reviewed in Canada on April 28, 2023","New model, New brew. I've owned several Keurigs over the years and this one brews the best cup of Joe to date.
What's new with the brewing system? For one, more needles that inject hot water to provide good extraction of the coffee in the pods. Past models had one needle. These same Tim Hortons pods used to be a bit weak and lack luster. However with this model, the flavor is strong, rich and robust. Significantly more body than brewed under the K Cafe model and others. What's extra nice is that there are controls to adjust temperature and strength which allows customization of flavor.
Size is decent as well, pretty compact. Water reservoir contains a filter to help with the richness of the brew as well, but also is a component that needs to be changed every so often depending on the quality of the water used.
The smart feature is hit or miss depending on your preference. Yes you can start a brew from your phone but you need to physically be at the machine to load the pod. The nice feature of the smartness is that it can track and maintain pods that you like/dislike and makes reordering easy. It is a smart device so I connected it to a separate router for my smart devices.
Another downside of the Smartness is that the machine has to read the pod before it can brew and sometimes that takes a while, quite annoying. Yes it's cool that it recognizes the specific pod that put in once it had the brewID feature. However the time to recognize that is too long.
Overall it brews excellent coffee and takes up minimal space but needs improvement with the smart features.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Sewist and the Geek,"Reviewed in Canada on April 25, 2023","The Keurig K:Supreme Smart Brewer is really cool and interesting but I'm not sure, at least for our family's needs, that the app and connectivity is useful.
Here's my take.
- The machine, as always, is well packed and easy to set up and use.
- The electrical cord, as slways, is way too short.
- Turning on the machine and connecting to the app was easy to do. Just be sure to have your internet password at the ready; you'll need it.
- Once set up, run a cleaning brew. Now you're ready to brew.
- I do appreciate that you do not need to open and close the pod area to get hot water. YAY
- The first brew was a Wolfgang Puck pod. In the app this pod is not identified. I assume this is a license brand and that's why?
- Next I brewed a Tetley Peppermint tea, which is branded with Keurig and appeared in the app when the pod was inserted and the lid closed.
Everything brewed hot and as expected, no different than our vurrent Keurig. However, one difference seemed to be the pull of electricity. We live in an old building with very old electrical workings. When we brew with the older machine the lights flicker. With this new machine, no flicker! That's got to be good!
So, in the end, I wouldn't dole out more money for the app features, but, it's still a great machine snd definitely worth it gor those who are comforted with enable machines.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Lillian,"Reviewed in Canada on June 3, 2023","This Keurig model really likes to be hooked up to the app. If it can't identify the pod that you've inserted, then it defaults to classic brew.

I just need to grab a quick coffee in the morning and this does what I need it to. I have noticed that it does make a small squeaky sound when it brews, I am not sure where it is coming from but it is a bit annoying. It doesnt affect the brewer though so I don't mind too much but I did notice it.
One thing I do like about the machine though is that it tells you that there is a used pod in the machine. So if you forget to take it out, the machine lets you know. Which is convenient. Overall its a good machine and I really like it.",4.0 out of 5 stars

SMB,"Reviewed in Canada on April 25, 2022","This is a fairly decent K-Cup coffee maker that includes a number of new features that bridges the gap between the higher (not from Keurig specifically) and lower end of the models that brings out the best of both worlds. In fact, this is the best model that Keurig offers (amongst K-Supreme models are the K-Supreme Plus Smart, K-Supreme Plus, and the lowest K-Supreme).

It has a large of number of customization options that includes 5 strength settings, 6 temperatures, and 6 cup sizes to choose from. In addition, it also has a setting for ice coffee specifically by brewing extra strong (than what you've set) coffee to minimize and reduce dilution. This is perhaps the feature that I like the most (and summer is coming).
Although it does look relatively small, the devil is in the details and that is the water reservoir because it's at the rear-left and it's NOT aligned alongside the back edge which makes it larger than necessary and requires more space at the back specifically and that's just bad design. Make sure you are aware of how much space you have or it might become very frustrating very fast.
All in all, this is a fairly decent K-Cup coffee maker and does what it claims to do for the most part; however, it is a bit pricey at $270 for what it provides and this would've been a much better deal around $200-$220 in my opinion.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Nature lover,"Reviewed in Canada on May 2, 2022","I am a coffee lover and over the years tried different kinds of machines, drip coffee machines, Nespresso machines and Keurig machines.
Extremely trusted brand and pioneer in single pod servings, Keruig has come up with K-Supreme Plus SMART Single Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker With Connected Capabilities.

The design is well thought and only takes a small counter space. You can make hot and over ice beverages and the size is customizable between 4, 8, 10 and 12 oz. Water heat is also customizable which is awesome. And you can store your customized setting on the coffee machine itself!! No need to download the app.

Jim and Wife,"Reviewed in Canada on May 21, 2023","Since this is a major purchase, this review goes into detail about this Keurig K-Supreme Smart machine. We’ll discuss the good and the bad, and hopefully allow you to make an informed buying decision. Don’t Like Reading? Skip to the “OVERALL” section for the summary. Spoiler Alert! Wife and I like this Keurig a lot! 😊
The one appliance that gets used multiple times every day is our coffee maker. We have used many coffee makers over the years. Keurig was a major staple for at least 15 of those years. We’ve gone through several which can be seen as either good or bad. For the most part, we’ve had a very good experience with Keurig which is why we continued to purchase them. However, this past year we haven’t touched our old Keurig, but we still had some unused pods. We decided to order the Keurig K-Supreme Smart coffee maker and see what this new technology was all about. It certainly has a lot of bells and whistles compared to our old one!
💜DON’T FEAR THE TECHNOLOGY!
This machine may be very intimidating for our lovely elderly users. Totally understandable. First of all, there is no need to fear the technology side of this machine. I walk you through the tech side in our video; it's pretty easy. The Keurig is virtually plug-and-play. We only needed to fill up the water reservoir and plug in the machine. You are greeted with choosing your language, and then two options to either connect or skip. We chose to connect, but you could use the machine without connecting. If you choose “Connect”, you can turn the machine around where you’ll see (on the rear side) it has a QR code. Scanning it with your phone with your camera open will direct you to the appropriate Keurig app. Once downloaded, the app will prompt you to connect to your machine. It took a couple of tries to finally link the machine, but now it’s done! The video my wife and I have attached will show you how easy it truly is.😊
The machine will then prompt you to run some hot water through the Keurig before you brew your first coffee. When that’s complete you are ready to grab your first K-Cup. We did find it odd we had to wait for the “BrewID” to scan our K-Cup before it would start brewing. After the delay, we were able to get a great-tasting coffee. If you’re interested in learning more, I go into detail about the APP in the “Breakdown Of The App” section below.
✅WHAT WE LIKE:
▪️I think this is the hottest coffee I have ever had in a Keurig!!!🤗 Hopefully it stays this way. Some Keurigs we have used in the past have lost their “hotness” over time. This has been consistent with other family members who are Kuerig lovers as well. It is one of the biggest complaints we have all had discussions about and is one of the reasons why we started to stray away from Keurig.
▪️My wife and I are extremely impressed with the app and recipe suggestions provided based on the coffee you like. Pretty awesome to be honest! It gives step-by-step instructions based on the coffee pods you’re using.
▪️The app is useful and makes it easy to set up your favourite brew settings on your device.
▪️Connecting your Keurig also registers it for an extended warranty. As a bonus it allows you to purchase two boxes of 24 K-Cups and get 2 boxes free.
▪️We really enjoy the handle on the reservoir to fill it from your sink. Not sure how long it took Keurig to introduce this feature, but it’s a must!
▪️You can make the reservoir accessible on the rear of the machine or the side.
▪️We like the option to use this machine over ice! Excellent for a refreshing summertime treat!
▪️The size of the Keurig machine is perfect, especially if you do not have a lot of counter space. You’re able to get roughly 4 - 12oz cups of coffee from the reservoir.
❌WHAT WE DON’T LIKE:
▪️I don’t like being restricted to a maximum size of 12oz. My wife and I drink 16oz with our old Keurig. I’m not sure why this is so restricted and should be standard. This is another reason why we moved away from Keurig recently.
▪️I am uncomfortable with the fact that the machine is tracking all my habits and not knowing or understanding what is being done with my information. I truly don’t like the feeling that someone is watching me every time I have a coffee.
▪️I still hate that I need to remove the drip tray to fit my travel mugs, annoying!
▪️The BrewID treats certain pods as generic, even though they are meant for the Keurig brewer. It’s possible since my pods are older and have a bar code rather than a QR code it won’t recognize it?
▪️The wait time for the BrewID to recognize takes an additional 5-10secs before you can start brewing. I just want my coffee as quickly as possible.😩 My wife finds it annoying as well.
▪️Flavours on the App are limited for decaf drinkers. My wife’s favourite Zavida decaf coffee is not available to purchase on their APP. My go to is regular Zavida Hazelnut Vailla and Columbian. We like supporting Canadian made coffee. We would love to get this brand via subscription through the App if possible. 🙏
☕BREAKDOWN OF THE KUERIG APP:
🏠The Home Button:
▪️Café Creation- Featured recipes you can easily follow.
▪️Coffee Maker- Gives you online access to your machine. You can turn it on, set a favourite brew settings (ie cup size 6oz-12oz, brew type balanced, rich, robust, strong or intense and finally 6 heat settings from warm to max hot), schedule a brew or settings (telling you if your machine is connected to Wi-Fi, coffee maker details or high altitude on/off)
▪️My brew style- Which shows what K-Cups you have been brewing and suggests possible alternatives that you may also enjoy.
🛍️OTHER OPTIONS:
▪️Next is the shop section which allows you to purchase Keurig pod, maker, accessories etc…
▪️The brew button will give you all the information on the pod inserted in the machine and will let you brew right from your device. 🛑It will give you a warning to put a cup under the machine!
▪️Orders allows you track any online orders you have placed or schedule auto-delivery.
▪️Account which shows all your registers coffee makers, Face ID, connecting to Alexa/Goggke Assistant etc…
🦋OVERALL:
We were debating if we would ever return to the Keurig eco-system. I think this machine has brought it back into the fold. Kuerig has come a long way since our last Kuerig purchase. My wife loves how compact it is and she is already making a permanent home for it because it takes up less room on the counter than our other favorite coffee maker. The App is extremely easy to use, fun to look at all of the recipes and suggestions. However, we don’t like that Keurig knows what we are drinking every day. Companies should be paying us a monthly fee for our info as far as I'm concerned. If you are concerned with your coffee machine being connected online, you can disconnect it and skip all the connecting prompts. If you want to upgrade your coffee-drinking experience give the Keurig K-Supreme Smart a try!",5.0 out of 5 stars

J. Miller,"Reviewed in Canada on May 11, 2022","I've been using this Keurig K-Supreme Plus SMART coffee maker for a couple of weeks now, making several coffees every day, so I've definitely put it through its paces. Having owned and used probably a dozen different keurig machines over the years, this one is by far the best. I've also used the regular K-Supreme so I can compare it to that and maybe offer some insight on whether it's worth the upgrade.
The main feature here is the screen and smart/wi-fi capabilities. Otherwise it is similar to the K-Supreme Plus, with a couple small differences: Instead of 3 temperature settings and 3 strength settings, it has 5 of each. For comparison the regular K-Supreme (non-Plus) has no temperature settings and only 2 strength settings.
I can tell you without a doubt that the multi-stream feature on these does improve the taste of the coffee. It tends to make it a stronger, more full bodied flavour. But with the 5 strength settings you can customize that a lot.
The wi-fi/smart features are mostly the BrewID and the app. The BrewID reads the QR code on the pod and recognizes what pod is inserted. It will then ping the keurig servers via wifi and download the recommended settings for that particular pod (and your chosen cup size). You can override these settings, of course. You can even save favourite combinations of settings. I honestly found myself overriding them most of the time, because I was either changing the cup size or what I was drinking out of, or if I was planning to add sweetener or drink it black, etc. For example if drinking out of a regular mug you might want to use one of the hotter temperature settings so it lasts longer, but when using an vacuum insulated tumbler I found myself always using the lowest temperature so I didn't have to wait long for it to become a drinkable temperature. Of course if I was adding milk or cream, I could also compensate that by upping the temperature. Changing the strength setting basically changes the speed at which it brews, higher strength lets the water soak the grinds longer (helpful when making larger sizes like 10 oz or 12 oz).
Some of the k-cup pods I tried (for example one of the Kirkland ones) did not show up in BrewID yet (I'm sure it will eventually, this is pretty new). In those cases, it seems to use a set of default recommended settings that change based on the chosen size (this can be seen in attached video).
The app is really more of a gimmick to me than anything. I never once had the urge to use the app to choose my settings, it was simpler to just use the buttons on the machine. But one thing you can do is put a pod in before you go to sleep and then when you wake up in the morning, open the app and tell it to start brewing. Some people might find that useful I guess. The main value for BrewID to me is for people who drink a wide variety of brands and flavours. If you tend to stick to one or two flavours, you will probably just have your ideal settings and use those regardless of what BrewID recommends.
Also worth noting you do not have to setup the app or connect it to wifi, it makes coffee with all the features regardless (minus BrewID). But if you're going to do that, you may as well just get the K-Supreme Plus. Also as of this writing, when you register on the app they give you an extended warranty, so it's probably worth it for that.
The coffee maker itself is really easy to use. The water reservoir is so simple to remove and just fill it up at my water cooler. Also, the coffee maker itself is incredibly silent. It makes almost no noise at all when brewing. And if you're only used to the old style keurig, you'll be amazed when you see that it doesn't even need to heat up the water first. The heating is done as it brews, there's no waiting.
Also the ""over ice"" button locks you into specific settings that keurig deemed ideal for making ice coffee (6 oz., high strength). To make an ice coffee you fill a cup/tumbler with ice cubes, leaving just enough room for the 6 oz of coffee and whatever else you plan to add to it. The hot coffee melts most of the ice but tends to leave a few cubes (you may want to add a few more cubes after it's done).
Overall I am really impressed with the machine. But if you don't think you will utilize the app or BrewID recommendations, I would advise you to save a bit of money and get the K-Supreme Plus.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Reviewer,"Reviewed in Canada on May 18, 2023","I've had 3 other Keurig K-cup pod machines over the recent years. The first two tasted quite good and lasted several years. The latest one, I had to discard due to wonky controls and the fact that any coffee that came out of it were just watery with a very bland taste, no matter if I used filter water or even those reusable pods which I packed it full. This machine is my next try.
I honestly got a bit overwhelmed by all the modern features that it came with.
What I liked:
- Adjustable heat level for the coffee (yeaaa! now I don't have to preheat the ceramic cup to keep the fresh brew hot)
- The coffee tastes better, a lot better than the old Keurig machine, even when using the same BrewID pods. The taste is richer (even at the lowest intensity), and the aroma that fills the room after a new brew is much stronger than the previous machine.
- The slim formfactor works well for our kitchen where there's limited counter space. But with lots of counter space, it looks a bit awkward on its own.
- I'm old-school when it comes to buttons... the UI & button layout on this machine are very intuitive.
- The drip bay can fit a taller travel mug about 7"" height (with the drip tray removed).
- Connecting to Wi-Fi was easy-peasy; setup on the app was also very intuitive. Although, I'm having a bit of problem with voice control via Google Home; it's hit or miss.
- You can use this without Wi-Fi!
What I didn't like:
- The water spout drains out a rough stream of coffee, and splashes from hitting the cup splatters all around. I wish Keurig could design a spout that streams more smoothly.
- My SO's height is on the shorter side; and unfortunately, all the button controls are on top facing the ceiling... so she has to get on her tippy-toe to easily access & see those controls.
- I'm not a fan of the BrewID, as I like to use the reusable pods. But, it's getting to be more useful as my SO has very different taste to mine, and this allows custom adjustment based on the k-cup pod.
- The remote brew control via the mobile app is definitely gimicky; not as useful as I initially thought; if I'm already standing at the machine to put in the pod & the cup on, I just prefer to press a few buttons to get the brew started; can't get used to having to pull out the phone and fiddle with the app.",5.0 out of 5 stars
AllGoodNamesRGone,"Reviewed in Canada on May 11, 2023","The Keurig K-Café Smart is a game-changer for coffee lovers seeking a café-style experience right in the comfort of their own homes. I recently had the pleasure of trying out this remarkable coffee maker, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint! Here's my honest take on the Keurig K-Café Smart:
First and foremost, the design of this machine is simply stunning. With its sleek and compact form, it adds a touch of elegance to any kitchen countertop. It's clear that Keurig paid attention to detail when creating this coffee maker. ✨💯
One of the standout features of the Keurig K-Café Smart is the ability to control it through the accompanying app. The app interface is user-friendly and allows for customization of brew settings, scheduling, and access to a wide range of coffee recipes. It's a coffee enthusiast's dream come true! ☕📱
Filling the water reservoir is a breeze, thanks to its generous 60-ounce capacity and easy-to-use handle. Say goodbye to those messy water refills—the Keurig K-Café Smart streamlines the process for a hassle-free experience. 💦🙌
Now, let's talk about the taste. The Keurig K-Café Smart delivers a satisfying cup of coffee that rivals your favorite coffee shop. The milk frother is a game-changer, offering three hot settings and the ability to create cold foam for indulgent lattes, cappuccinos, and mochas. I was blown away by the creamy and flavorful drinks I was able to create with this machine. 🥛✨
While the Keurig K-Café Smart offers a fantastic coffee experience, there are a few things to keep in mind. Firstly, it doesn't come with a reusable pod, so you'll need to purchase one separately if you prefer to use your own freshly ground coffee. Additionally, the quality of the coffee pods you choose will greatly impact the taste of your brew, so be sure to select high-quality options for the best results. Lastly, while it offers espresso-like shots, it's important to note that it doesn't produce the same crema as dedicated espresso machines. ⚠️❗️
In conclusion, the Keurig K-Café Smart is a remarkable coffee maker that brings the café experience right to your kitchen. With its sleek design, app control, and delicious coffee creations, it's a must-have for coffee enthusiasts. While there are a few considerations to keep in mind, the overall experience and convenience of this machine make it a worthwhile investment. 💪👌

Mother of Three,"Reviewed in Canada on May 15, 2023","I got this to replace my very basic Tassimo machine that is over 10 years old, and boy, am I happy to have done so! This Keurig machine is a step above anything I've tried for at-home coffee brewing!
I am not a coffee connoisseur, but this definitively brews a better coffee than my old Tassimo. There is also a lot more selection in what coffee pods you can get (as Tassimo machines are hard to find in Canada and the supply of Tassimo T-discs seems to be dwindling).
In addition, since I prefer creamier flavoured and sweeter caffeinated drinks (ex. café lattes, café mochas, etc.), this is a great machine for creating those without any extra guesswork or paying more at your local coffee shop. The app has recipes that walk you through how to use the milk frother (i.e., what setting to use, how much milk to add, etc.) and what type of brewing setting to use. It also tells you what other ingredients you might need (ex. chocolate syrup, cinnamon, etc.).
The water reservoir comes with a water filter built in. No need to pre-filter water that goes into the coffee brewer (which I had to do with my Tassimo). I can just use tap water. The reservoir is also quite large, so no need to refill often. The handle makes it easy to hold and refill without spills.
The milk frother is not dishwasher safe, but it's super easy to clean and dry by hand. It froths milk very well, and creates a nice creamy latte.
The app allows for pre-set/remote brewing. I don't really have much need for that feature, but I could see someone who is in a rush out the door every day being able to set up their coffee pod and mug the previous night to save time in the morning. However, this would only work well for brewing plain coffee. Anything that requires the milk frother would still require time to pour fresh, cold milk, and letting the frother work before you can make your drink.
The app is linked to the online Keurig store, so you can purchase accessories and coffee pods readily. Registering your unit also gives you a ""buy 2 get 2 free"" coupon code for boxes of coffee pods.
Overall, I am quite happy with this unit. It looks sleek and modern on my kitchen counter, is easy to use and clean, and makes delicious drinks! I am also looking forward to getting some reusable pods to be more environmentally friendly and be able to use any brand of coffee beans in the machine.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Morgana,"Reviewed in Canada on April 24, 2023","I've always been skeptical about getting a pod coffee maker regardless of the brand mainly due to its impact to the environment. However, with most of the pods being recyclable and more communities' collection system being able to recycle these pods, I decided to take a leap of faith and ordered this Keurig smart pod coffee maker.
The item arrived well packaged using recyclable materials. The unit came preinstalled except for the water filter. Yes, a water filter is included! The instructions to activate the install the water filter was cleared on a separate pamphlet as well as on the water filter's packaging.
The design of the machine was slim so that it fits into small space very well. While the water tank can be placed in two different orientations, I'd recommend installing the water tank on the side (default orientation) for easy access. If you wish to move the tank to the rear, remove the locking piece from the rear bottom of the machine and careful shift the tank base to the back. Once finished, place the locking piece to the side to secure the base. While in this orientation, the cord can be routed under the tank base so the machine can still sit flush to the surface. A very thoughtful design!
The user experience with the machine was out of the world! While the product description and additional information claims that the machine must be setup through a 2.4GHz network, I was surprised to find out that I didn't need to actually do that. I followed the prompts on the machine and connected the machine to my WIFI through the Keurig app. The process was smooth, and I am particularly impressed by the machine remembering the last step I was on when I had to step away during the connection/set up process. This is particularly important as most products on the market would require you to restart the process.
By installing the Keurig app and pairing it with the machine, I am able to take advantage of the system's smart features. I can now set favorite brew on the app and apply that exact same settings to the same kind of pod every time.
On the other hand, I've been thinking of replacing my hot water boiler, and now that I have this Keurig machine being able to dispense hot water, I can consider ditching the water boiler altogether for the time being.
In terms of maintenance, I'd recommend picking up Keurig's 3-month care kit and do the maintenance as recommended by Keurig. In addition, run a hot water dispense process after each brew especially if you enjoy a non-coffee brew from time to time like me. This helps prevent your next brew from being contaminated from your previous brew.
Overall, I am very impressed with what this machine can accomplish and would highly recommend it for those shopping for a pod coffee maker.",5.0 out of 5 stars
AzherS,"Reviewed in Canada on May 16, 2023","I adore this Keurig.
This is not my first Keurig, as I had the regular single-serve before. My wife and I would have our morning coffees from it, but we would still go to coffee shops sometimes as they have different flavours and types of coffee (like cappuccinos, mochas, etc) that we weren't able to (or knew how to) make at home.
However, this SMART Keurig makes a HUGE difference. The shot option really draws out the best flavour from the K-cup, and makes the world of a difference when it comes to the coffee you drink and allows you to make drinks like a barista. The app is great for getting a sense of how to make some of the drinks you'd get at a coffee shop (though I find that they tend to use less coffee shots - I replace all the recipes that call for single shots with double or triple shots). I've since made iced cappuccinos, caffe mochas, iced coffee, and more.
One thing to note is that you will likely need to get flavoured syrups and other ingredients if you plan to follow some of the recipes, as only the most basic ones (cappuccino, iced coffee, latte, etc) can be made with just coffee, sweetener, and milk alone.
We also had a milk frother before getting this Keurig, but basically never used it as we were making very simple coffees, so it felt like an unnecessary step to making our morning brew an aesthetic. However, since we got this Keurig, we have been using the included milk frother all the time. It's easy to select a setting (cold + 3 hot settings) and to start. The coolest feature we've seen is that the Keurig will WAIT for the milk to finish frothing before brewing your coffee, meaning that the coffee won't be cool by the time you pour the frothed milk.
The Keurig itself is very simple to use, and you can either use the buttons on the Keurig itself or the app to control it. It has an over ice, shots (single or double), signature brew, and regular brew options. There are also options to control the temperature of the brew and the size. With the app, you can also schedule a brew, so that your coffee can be ready even if you're not near your Keurig. However, you should have a mug ready underneath along with a coffee pod in the machine if you plan to use this feature.
The app is capable of providing suggestions based on the coffee pod you have used, what flavour you are craving, or what type of coffee you desire. It gives recommendations on which coffee pods to use for recipes, and also let's you order pods directly from the app. As an added bonus, you also get an extended warranty when you connect your Keurig to the app!
For set up, the Keurig was very easy to set up. Once out of the box, you just need to take off the tape, fill up and attach the water reservoir, attach the frother, then plug in your Keurig and follow the instructions on the panel of the Keurig.
The frother was a bit less intuitive to use as the panel nor the app have instructions for how to use the frother. I had to consult the instruction manual where I discovered that despite looking like one button, the frother actually had 2, where the location of where you press the button affects what you are controlling (pressing the bar changes the frothing mode, while pressing the K starts the frother). Once I figured that out, it has been smooth sailing.
Cleaning is also quite easy. The collecting tray disassembles very easy, and the water reservoir and frother are also easily detached. The frother needs to be cleaned with a bit more care than the other components as it is electrical, but the frothing tool inside can be detached to make it easier to clean the different components of the frother.
Overall, I think this Keurig is wonderful, and makes the coffee I make comparable to coffee shops. I don't think I need to even go to coffee shops anymore when I can make delicious iced caffe mochas from the comfort of my own home and for cheaper than at a coffee shop!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Jason R.,"Reviewed in Canada on May 14, 2023","This is an excellent K-Cup brewer and I'm giving it full marks despite one of the main ""selling"" features being the app-connected stuff which I feel nobody will ever truly find useful at least I won't. The stuff you can control with the app is kind of neat just in the sense that you can do it, but at the end of the day I don't think it really adds anything truly practical since most of the coffee making process requires you to physically be at the machine anyway and it's not like it takes long to brew a cup.
The design of the machine is nice, it looks and feels like a high end appliance which is more than I can say for most of the k-cup brewers that I've come across which always seem a downgrade in overall design from many of the say, Nespresso, machines. It has a huge amount of customization options and flexibility to produce coffee exactly like you want. The frother is clutch and works super well, and I actually like the Keurig frother design a lot more than my Aerocinno. This machine heats up fast and is ready to churn out coffee in no time, and it has no problem at all producing a coffee as hot as I like it (sometimes single serve machines seem only capable of producing lukewarm results).
I wish it would have come with a reusable cup for your own grounds at this price point.",5.0 out of 5 stars
William 75001,"Reviewed in Canada on May 28, 2023","Verdict: 4⭐ + ❤️
*** The good 👍
✅ Attention to detail: I'm trying to show it in the video and pictures, all the moving parts have shapes that ensure that they can be easily put back into place without effort. We also like the blinking ""K"" that indicates that something is going on, either at the coffee-making level or at the mlk-frothing level.
✅ Overall Quality: The first thing to outline is the SILENT working of this machine. It is really silent, much more than my drip coffee. As you can see in the video, both coffee and milk come out steaming from the machine. And the overall build is, in my opinion, much better than what I would expect from a 300$ machine (that's the price it was going for at the moment of writing these lines).
✅ Controls & connectivity: The controls and the display are cleverly located at the top of the machine. This makes coffee making very easy, even with my eyes half shut at 5 AM. The WiFi connection allows you to get additional features and settings which can be really cool. This is a plus and a minus at the same time, read the next comment to understand why.
*** Comments
👎 I am not enjoying the fact that the machine constantly reminds us to connect to the internet. I thought it would be sufficient to control the machine from my phone over the dedicated WiFi network from the machine or via Bluetooth, but it does not suffice. Not having the opportunity to choose, that is costing a star.

Geobound,"Reviewed in Canada on May 9, 2023","Well let’s face it, it’s a Keurig so of course it’s going to be good! LOL…
After having my original 9 year old Keurig machine start to fail lately, I figured it was time to break down and get a new one…….and boy this hasn’t disappointed!
I have to say that the instructions of how to actually use this machine is a little lacking, but it doesn’t take long to figure it out if I’m honest.
The remote coffee as shown in the video works great, but there are a few things to remember first.
1. Have a coffee cup in place before you leave your machine
2. Make sure to put in a new pod
3. The thing I couldn’t find was how to set your pod in the machine and make it for later, but it turns out all you do is put your pod in the machine and press and hold the giant K button until it shuts off.
4. Also if you are making an ice coffee, remember to use a plastic cup and not a glass one
The only thing I miss on this one that isn’t on my old one is the 4 oz size, but I’ve later learned that if you get the “PLUS” version, this option is available. The hack for that is to select the 6 oz size and when you get to the amount of coffee you want in your cup, to hit the cancel button. I can’t speak for the taste quality from a proper espresso serving to the modified one, as each persons tastebuds are different.
I also found that this machine spits more water/coffee out of the serving area than my old one, but it’s only drops and takes just a few seconds to wipe them up.
What I love about this machine is that I can adjust the heat level. As you can see from my video I like my coffee HOT, and this one is just about perfect. Normally I have to make my coffee and then microwave it for 30 seconds or so, but this one stops just short of burning your tongue off…….which I’m happy with! LOL….
My overall experience with Keurig has been great, and I can’t honestly see me switching brands.
I’d rate this machine a solid 5 stars……10 or more if I could. LOL…..",5.0 out of 5 stars

I love the slim design and the large water reservoir with a handle, which you can place either in the side or at the back. Means it can easily slide in beside other countertop appliances, we have ours next to our air fryer. The app was easy to install and download and connected to my wifi. Machine automatically knew to run through a cleaning cycle and after placing a coffee pod in, it was recognized as a Tim Horton's pod which was a fun addition! I ran 2 water cycles after the coffee and the second was already completely clear. I like the 6 temperature settings and 4 cup sizes which is great to dial in the strength of the coffee to your liking as well. The water heater up super fast and would definitely be great to use as a hot water dispenser.

Just A Monkey On The Vine,"Reviewed in Canada on May 22, 2023","While I’ve owned a previous Keurig this one makes better tasting coffee with the same pods. I’m guessing it has something to do with being able to choose strengths and now it has five spouts versus the traditional one giving your brew better water coverage. I really like how slim it is and the fact that you can reposition the water container to the back. I didn’t find it as accessible for our counter so I left it on the side. It still takes up very little counter space. I like its handle as well, way too many coffee machine reservoirs don’t have handles While it has an app and can be connected to WIFI. I personally don’t need a machine to tell me when I’m running low on coffee, trust me I know 😆 You can also save your favourite brew strength, temp, and size for quicker brewing which I do like. The only disappointment was that it does NOT come with that sweet looking red cup. I totally thought it did.

You can choose to download the Keurig app to your mobile device and you can set your coffee to brew right from your device. ****Just make sure you have a mug placed on the machine****
This is such a great option, I can set my coffee to start brewing when I am still in bed and my alarm just rings for the morning. By the time I am down over the stairs my coffee is sitting there waiting for me ready to drink.
The app is easy to use, it has a few simple options for brewing.
One thing that I absolutely love about this machine that is different from others is that the water reservoir that is attached is separate from the machine, so I can easily remove it and it has a handle for easy carrying and filling. It easily clips back onto the base of the Keurig machine.
Very convenient and it holds quite a bit of water, this is definitely important for me.

My preference for the same pod limits the use of this ""SMART"" feature. Personally, I think this feature is best for adventurous people that like trying different flavors.

Putting it simply these K cup machines are just another type of drip coffee maker. That being said I do not like drip coffee. I do like this K cup machine though. It makes a normal cup of coffee at a good strength without making it harsh or bitter. The trick is in using the right coffee pods.
This is a pretty cool device that lets you customize to your taste. You have five brew sizes, five strengths and six temperature settings. So with a quality coffee pod and your settings you can guarantee a good cup of coffee. I think it is hilarious and had to try it for testing purposes, but all I could think of was the line from Big Bang Theory that says everything is better with bluetooth. Yup, that is right folks they have an app. In it you can customize the settings and even set timers for when you want coffee. It is easy to set up and did not have any issues.
The reason I am laughing? Go find phone, wake it up, activate app, scan to settings, log in your preferences and click save. Now when you want a coffee repeat the steps to get into the app and hit coffee. However, you still have to go over to the machine put in a pod and make sure there is a cup underneath. It takes up to about two minutes using the app. Or walk up to the coffee machine, pop in a pod, turn on, press temp. button, press strength and amount then press start. Max 20 seconds. Seeing as you are there get milk ready by that time your coffee is done. The app is about as smart as your smart watch telling you that you have a phone call when you can hear your phone ringing.
I guess that is why they charge so much. Personally I do not use the app because it is so much faster from the machine. Everything works good and the customization really make a difference. It will take a few times to find your preference, but it will be worth it. You will get a perfect cup of coffee every time with little to no effort. I would suggest to only use distilled water as that will make your machine last longer without having to do the descaling all the time.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Mike,"Reviewed in Canada on August 22, 2022","I like this coffee machine for several reasons:
1. It saves me a lot of money compared to my Nespresso machine. The K-cup pods are slightly cheaper in general compared to Nespresso line pods, and when you add the hundreds of coffee pods I use every month, the cost adds up. So, the slightly cheaper K-cup pods save me lots of money in the long run.
2. I very much like the level of customization options this machine gives me. I can choose from 6 different temperature levels, 5 different coffee strength levels, 5 different cup sizes, and even make iced coffee. So, this large range of settings options makes this machine very very useful, especially if you have multiple people in your home who use the machine and all those people have different tastes.
3. I love love love the smart function in this machine. I have used the app several times and it works great each time. I am outside shopping and I can open my app and order it to make my coffee just the way I like it from the app, and when I get home after 5 minutes, a hot cup of coffee exactly according to my liking is waiting for me. So, I no longer have to come home and then wait until the coffee is made. I can order the machine through the app from anywhere in the world and it will make the coffee at my home. Genius. I love this feature.
4. The machine is not too big, not too small. It is big enough to be noticeable to people when they come to my kitchen, and small and compact enough to occupy very little space in my kitchen counter. It stays in one small space in the corner and does not disturb me from working in the kitchen.
All in all, this is a well-built coffee machine that is cheaper to operate than the Nespresso line of machines. Makes coffee remotely and smartly through the app so that you have hot coffee waiting for you when you arrive home. My family and friends love it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
The Couple's Opinion,"Reviewed in Canada on June 3, 2023","The design is sleek and modern and the milk frother is a game-changer. It froths the milk perfectly, creating velvety-smooth foam for my lattes and cappuccinos. I love how easy it is to use and clean.
One of the features that disappointed me most was the app connection. I couldn't make it to connect to my wireless network even with my 2.4 GHz network properly setup. Therefore, after researching on the web I found out that if your router has 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz enabled, you have to disable the 5 GHz network in order to connect the coffee machine. Since my preference is for the 5 GHz, I sadly gave up on setting the connection. Instead of saving your coffee preference on the app, you will have to do it manually on the menu on the coffee machine.
Remember to register your machine on the official Keurig website to save money on promotions when purchasing K-cups.
Overall, it is a great, reliable, and fancy coffee machine that doesn't take up much space on your counter and saves you time.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Tay,"Reviewed in Canada on May 10, 2022","It took me a few hours of internet searching trying to troubleshoot why this would not connect to my wifi, I tried 2.4G, and 5G, reset it, reset my phone, and even reset our modem. I then stumbled upon a Reddit thread where someone said connecting via their 'guest' wifi connection worked for them so decided to give that a try and enabled the guest wifi on our network and VOILA! It worked!
I have no idea why but now that it's finally working I'm not going to question it.
This Keurig can also pair with Alexa and Google home but have not fully set that up yet.
You can pre-program this sleek little machine to make you a fresh coffee in the morning, or you can use the Keurig app on your phone to start making it before you get out of bed or you can just get up and push the button on the machine :)
We have all of our family's preferences saved into the app by their name, you just select it on your app or push the heart on the machine and scroll until their name shows and then brew it - they can choose the oz of coffee, how strong the coffee, and how hot the coffee is.
The machine will also recognize the pod via their BrewID, just insert the pod and it will recognize the brand and brew the coffee to perfection.
It comes with a filter and a plastic filter holder for the water tank to get you started, it does not however come with a reusable K-cup so if you prefer those, be sure to put one in your cart along with this. I purchased 3rd party k-cups that work beautifully, just be sure to get the right ones for the Keurig K-Supreme Plus SMART with the 5 holes on top - the old k-cups with the single hole will not work with this machine.
I didn't think I needed wifi enabled coffee maker, but now that we have this.... lol I don't think we will be without one! - it's just so easy to click on the app and get a cup of coffee going no matter where you are - I've seriously sat on the porcelain throne and got my coffee started so when I came out a fresh cup would be ready for me :) you just have to always have a fresh pod in and a cup ready to go.",5.0 out of 5 stars
S&P,"Reviewed in Canada on June 9, 2023","Keurig just made mornings 100% better with this mechanical ray of sunshine!
It’s compact, but it does everything I want it to. (I still can hardly believe it fits so easily under the cupboard, even on the pod drawer!)
My favourite way to do coffee, now that warm weather is here, is latte-over-ice style. It looks so pretty too! It’s like a party in a cup.
I get a kick out of the written instructions & reminders on the machine’s screen. “Used pod;” “brewing will begin when frothing has finished;” and my favourite, “Enjoy!…”
All parts of the machine have functioned perfectly, to my delight.
The only thing I haven’t used much is the app/wifi feature. I like my coffee complicated, so setting it up for brewing at a certain time isn’t feasible (imagine milk sitting in the frother all night). Although I’ve browsed the recipes on the app—and tried some of the

𝒜𝓊𝓇𝑜𝓇𝒶,"Reviewed in Canada on May 6, 2022","Over the years, I have tried several different models of Keurig coffee machines, and this K-Supreme Plus has some significant improvements: much quieter, better-tasting coffee, and programmable settings. The machine is sturdy and well made. It has a compact design and looks great on my kitchen counter. The water reservoir is large and has a handle so it's easy to remove and fill up. Although it is a smart coffee maker, it is very easy to operate and easy to understand. I love that when I wake up in the morning and ask Alexa to brew coffee from bed, the coffee is ready when I walk into the kitchen. This piece makes one of the best cups of coffee I've had from a home brewer and tastes as good as handcrafted coffee. It's also easy to make iced coffee and tastes just as good. It brews very fast. I believe this is due to the five nozzles pushing more water in. also no coffee grinds in my coffee mug. It doesn't drip once the coffee is done. Love the different brewing options with temperature and strength.
In beginning, I can only ask Alexa to turn my brewer on and off, but I cannot brew coffee. It took me a while to figure this out.
How to set up a voice command to brew a cup of coffee. Kindly go through the below steps:
1. Register your new Keurig. This will require downloading the Keurig App from the App Store or you can simply scan the QR code. Doing this also gives you a 12 months warranty.
2. Open Alexa App, and tap ""Skills & Games"". Tap magnify glass in the top right corner, Search for Keurig and then tap Keurig. From here, Enable the Skill. This will require you to log into your Keurig account with login credentials which was created in step 1.
3. At this point, you need to create a Routine. Via Alexa App, tap on ""Routines"" found under ""more"" bottom right corner of the App. Tap the ""+"" sign in the top right corner.
Enter routine name - ie: Coffee, tap next
When this happens - tap Voice, enter the command you want to say when asking Alexa to make your coffee, ie: I need a cup of Coffee, tap next
Add action - tap Smart Home, tap All Devices, tap Keurig Coffee Maker, from here, select Power to turn on Keurig, and then select Brew a Favorite and select the Favorite you want to be brewed. tap next
When completing these three entries, tap Save.
You can also add a phrase for Alexa to say when the Routine is called like ... ""Enjoy your cup of Java""
I have to say that I really like this coffee maker. It's the best coffee maker I've ever owned. Looking forward to many years of happy brewing.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Neil,"Reviewed in Canada on May 27, 2022","Review:
This is absolutely the best coffee brewing machine I have ever used.
I previously had a cheaper and smaller Keurig machine that worked well, or so I thought. After using this a few times I realized how poor of a job my old machine did. This was superior in every single way.
I was particularly impressed with how quickly this heated up. It started brewing almost instantly after turning on and selecting a size. It took me off guard because it was SILENT during heat up. It started brewing so quickly that I thought the liquid coming out was going to be cold. In fact it was extremely hot as intended.
The water container is an excellent size. It holds enough to last me at least a week of brews, so I am very impressed with the size overall.
Another impressive aspect was the piercing device that punctures the pod. In my old machine it had a singular puncture point, but this machine uses 3 or 4 and is very accurate.
The coolest feature overall is that it's 'smart'. You can integrate it into a phone app and brew straight from your phone (if a pod is already inserted). You can also control the levels as well. The machine also has a built in scanner so it knows exactly what pod you put in. It shines a little light down as you close the pod in and registers it on the screen and the app. It's incredibly impressive.
The price is steep, but honestly after seeing how great it is in almost every aspect I actually would justify the price and would recommend spending the full retail listed cost IF you are a regular coffee drinker or Keurig user.
Pros 👍:
✔ Quickness of brew
✔ Easy to use
✔ Quality
✔ Water container size
✔ Smart/App integration
✔ Heats up fast
✔ Multipronged piercer
Cons👎:
✘ Price

JMC,"Reviewed in Canada on May 18, 2022","I have owned other Keurig coffee makers previous to this one but this is the best so far! I’m most impressed with the design, small footprint and best of all the handle on the water reservoir. This can also be connected to the internet allowing the user to make a coffee from anywhere and schedule it as well. Being a “smart” coffee maker also means that software updates will be automatically done whenever there are upgrades/improvements made by Keurig. I have noticed 2 such software updates in the month that I’ve had the unit. Other Keurig units I’ve owned worked by piercing the k-cup with a single hole and then infuse the k-cup with water. This K-Supreme Plus puts 5 holes in the top of the K-cups. Keurig calls this Multistream Technology which is supposed to saturate the coffee in the K-cup more evenly which is intended to give the finished product more flavour. All I can say is that I’m very happy with the flavour of the coffee I’ve had so far. I’m also very happy with the options available for customization in regards to temperature (6 settings) , strength of flavour (5 settings) and size (5 settings). You can also opt for what the manufacturer of the K-cup recommends for the strength setting…Keuring calls this BrewID and the machine reads this setting on the label of each K-Cup as there is a small QR type of code on the top of each one. You can also save your favourite settings with one touch and give them a name for easy retrieval. Another feature that sets this Keurig apart from others I’ve used previously is that you can brew back to back cups of coffee…no more waiting for the water to heat up like in the past. There’s also a large water reservoir (2.3L/78oz) that will allow you to brew 9 cups of coffee before needing to refill it. When you do need to refill, this reservoir is also the easiest to deal with because of the nice thick handle that I haven’t seen before on Keurig reservoirs. My only complaint about this unit is the fact that my 30 oz. coffee tumbler is too tall by only about half an inch to fit underneath the Keurig. Definitely not a dealbreaker, but it is a bit of an inconvenience to an otherwise near perfect product. Highly recommended!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Lesley,"Reviewed in Canada on June 19, 2022","If you’re looking to elevate your Keurig game, this is the machine to use. It has everything you need to make barista quality drinks at home for a fraction of the cost. With the Keurig app, you can customize your drinks and also look at suggestions on how to create new and exciting drinks. You just need to scan your pod and the customizable steps show up on the screen. The app works really well and I haven’t experienced any crashing. I will say though, that sometimes having to use an app isn’t that convenient on a busy morning. Sometimes you just want a darn-tooten’ cup of coffee and you don’t want to use your phone to get it. It would be nicer if you could select some favourite settings and have them saved on the actual machine so you don’t have to run back upstairs because you forgot your phone on the bedside table. The frother is great. It’s easy to use and I like that it does both cool and warm froths. The style of the machine is really nice. It doesn’t take up an abundance of counter space and I really like how it has a designated spot for the frother. The water tank is quite large and its removable for easy cleaning and access. Overall, this is an excellent machine. It elevates your Keurig drinks to a brand new level.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Another Bored Consumer,"Reviewed in Canada on April 27, 2022","But the question is, is it actually necessary? Here are my thoughts after upgrading my 10 year old Keurig that basically had one button.
1. Extremely stylish and sleek on my countertop. It is smaller then my old machine which is shaped like a Dorito, fat top and skinny bottom. The Water reservoir does take up more space in a weird location but its designed to be that way. Makes looking at water level and refilling much easier though.
2. Strength and temperature settings work really well, I prefer really hot strong coffee. I tried lower temperature and weaker flavour and it is very noticeable. Not sure how that works since the pods all contain the same amount of coffee grinds.....
3. WiFi is cool but kind of unnecessary.
4. Makes really good ice coffee. I am very surprised, it does not taste too diluted at all.
5. The ID feature is pretty cool, it reads the QR/BarCode and can tell you what its brewing and the settings. It's not that surprising since the pods technically say what it is, but I am easily impressed.
6. Can make 2 large cups of coffee back to back without needing to wait. My old machine had to take some time to reheat the water before making a second cup for my spouse, so I imagine the heating container or element is much larger.
Overall, this is a high tech machine that slowly puts Keurig in the mid end coffee pod machine market, comparing itself to Nespresso machines. At this price, I still feel that Nespresso is a few steps ahead, but Keurig definitely is making steps to shake off the 'cheap coffee' label that they originally started with.",5.0 out of 5 stars
S R M,"Reviewed in Canada on May 22, 2022","I have long accepted that I will never be one of those fragrant lovers who import top-quality, single-origin beans, grind them at home, and perform advanced mathematical calculations to determine the ideal water temperature and quantity for the perfect coffee. However, I enjoy a delicious cup of coffee at least twice a day. I simply prefer the process to be as effortless as possible, which is why I consider the Keurig coffee maker a life-changing device in my daily coffee routine.
Operating the Keurig coffee makers couldn't be easier: You simply place one of the pre-measured, flavorless capsules in the machine, fill the water tank, and then press a few buttons to prepare a hot or cold beverage of your choice (namely coffee, tea, or cocoa). For years, my machine has saved me from waiting in line at the drive-thru for 20 minutes twice a day to order $6 worth of coffee at my local Starbucks. I feel that this is the ultimate budget-friendly and time-saving way to meet my daily caffeine needs.
Pros:
* Can be programmed and controlled via smartphone or voice command.
* Personalization by strength, temperature and cup size.
* Works with more than 200 K-Cup varieties to recognize the type of beverage (including capsules from 75 beverage brands, such as Starbucks, Dunkin', Newman's Own and Peet's Coffee)
* A MultiStream feature that allows for better saturation of coffee grounds for optimal flavor and aroma
* Removable 78-ounce water tank with jug-like design
Disadvantages:
* Brews only one cup of coffee at a time.
* Cannot brew a latte or cappuccino
* Does not work with tall travel mugs",5.0 out of 5 stars
The Westleys,"Reviewed in Canada on May 14, 2022","This coffee maker definitely feels like a fancier, more futuristic version of the dozens of similar pod-style coffee makers on the market these days. You can load in your pods, let it read the settings automatically, and then just press go, or you can customize your drink in a bunch of ways. You’ve got 5 or more settings for temperature, size, and strength, as well as the option to brew over ice. If you’re too modern to press a button on a machine to make your coffee, open your phone from the other room and set up your coffee via the Keurig app (sadly you will need to ensure there is a cup under the machine, they cannot automate that part just yet). Or if even that is too much, schedule it to make the coffee itself on a timer, allowing you to wake up to a hot cup of coffee on time. The coffee tastes great too!
If I did have a complaint about this machine, it would be the water tank. Functionality-wise, it’s big, and it has an easy handle to refill it very quickly, which I love. But aesthetically, it looks like a big clunky tower sticking out the side of an otherwise sleek, elegant machine. I’m kinda surprised that they designed it this way because the machine itself looks very slim and cool, and then the water tank is just there, looking very out of place. But again, at least it’s big and easy to fill.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Honest Reviews,"Reviewed in Canada on May 13, 2022","Put usual there are no corners cut with this Keurig machine.
Every piece of this machine is high end, and functions with absolute ease. I've been using both pods as well as the refillable k-cup and both have been a very delightful experience. For refillables users, you will need to pop out the k cup holder, so if you're like myself and like using both, it does make an extra step. But the process only takes about 15 seconds.
The options on this machine are endless, but also not overwhelming if you just want it too brew your coffee.
Through the app and display you can really get into the fine details of your brewing experience. Or you can simply just select the size of cup you want and hit brew and not have to worry about any of that.
I love the app. It is one of those quality of life things you really don't need but it's nice too have. The brewer can connect too your wifi, which you can then link your phone too the app and have wireless brewing with a tap of your phone.
It makes waking up on those bad mornings a tad bit easier.
Brew time, and hot water dispensing is really quick and effective. This machine has basically replaced my kettle as well.
Cold brew options were just as easy to access as hot brew coffees, and the exact same quality.
I can't say a single thing negative about this machine. It's very high end, and has every feature plus more.

To-The-Point Reviews,"Reviewed in Canada on May 21, 2022","It has been years since I last used a Keurig machine. I ended up switching from my old one to an espresso maker because the quality difference was just too hard to beat. Ordering this Keurig was absolutely on a whim and I was very skeptical of how good it actually would be.
Boy, am I still surprised. The sheer convenience of this Keurig machine is incredible. Being able to quickly brew coffee is nice, but it's also really nice to be able to schedule a brew in the morning when I'm rushed for time. The flavour of the coffee is better than I remember it being, and it always comes out delicious. This is further aided by the fact that you can adjust the brew temperature, brew strength, and (as with all other Keurigs) the brew amount. Even more convenient, it's a breeze to use the manufacturer's recommended settings because of the QR code reader built into the label for each cup.

Henry,"Reviewed in Canada on April 27, 2022","At about $80CAD more expensive than the non-smart Keurig K-Supreme Plus the benefits are subjectively minor, you get:
- 7 additional favorite preset brew settings (10 compared to 3)
- 3 additional brew temperatures (6 compared to 3)
- 2 additional brew strengths (5 compared to 2)
- BrewID with compatible K-cups (requires internet connection)
- Google Home and/or Alexa connectivity (i.e. ""Okay google, tell Keurig to make me a 4oz cup of hot water"")
There are only 5 Google Home or Alexa commands at the moment:
All commands start with ""Tell my Keurig to...""
- Turn coffee maker on
- Turn coffee maker off
- Brew (#ozs) cup
- Brew hot water
- Brew (Favorite name)
You cannot specify temperature or strength, instead you would use your favorites for that.
Overall this is a great compact machine with debatable benefits of it's smart functionalities. Personally the smart functions are not worth the additional $80 compared to the non-smart version - however this may be different for your use case.

They tilted the screen a bit to help make it much easier to see the screen, and added more temperature and brewing strength options. It's great that it shows the pod that was inserted and even shows whether or not the pod was used, so you always know whether or not you put a new pod inside. The default settings seem to be more bitter/burnt compared to the Keurig classic, although if you adjust the settings you can fix that. It's great that you can put a pod in over night and place a mug beneath and then wake up and brew a fresh cup from bed. They made it much easier to get hot water as now you just press the K button when there is no pod. You can set favourite settings and control the machine entirely from the app which I really enjoy.

For a cofee maker, pairing this with my WiFi wasn't too complicated and was straight forward.
This also has a barcode reader at the top that will read the cooking instructions from your Keurig cups in order to brew them perfectly. We compared both a coffee and apple cider brewed with this machine and our dumb Keurig, and the Smart keurig seemed to have brewed a stronger coffee and apple cider. They both had a very deep and bold flavour, and did not taste watered down. You can adjust the strength and temperature using the menu on the top as well. Using the controls at the top is as simple as setting your size, and manually specifying your temperature or strength if you disagree with what the barcode reader has said.",5.0 out of 5 stars

These pre-configurations are updatable through WiFi, allowing the manufacturer to add new types or further improve the previous ones.
The app allows you to schedule brews ahead of time, e.g., just before you wake up in the morning. This is given that you already have a new pod installed before that.

Tina,"Reviewed in Canada on April 24, 2022","This is a great machine. I am so happy to get to test it. It brews nicely and the coffee is a perfect. It is programable and you can Pair with with you Iphone or android phone,. The best feature that I really like is that when you put in your k-cup it reads who the coffee manufacture is before brewing your k-cup, It will even tell you the flavor of coffee it is brewing for you as well. The other option is that you can also brew a cup of cold coffee as well. I really like the features as well. From having Keurig machines before this is much more superior from the previous ones that I have owned in the past. You will be happy to upgrade you old one to this one. Works perfectly.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The design is sleek and modern and the milk frother is a game-changer. It froths the milk perfectly, creating velvety-smooth foam for my lattes and cappuccinos. I love how easy it is to use and clean.
