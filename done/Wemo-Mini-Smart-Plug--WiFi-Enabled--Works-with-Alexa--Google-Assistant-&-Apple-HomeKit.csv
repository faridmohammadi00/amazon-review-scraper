Melster,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2017","I have bought three of these so far and definitely plan on purchasing a couple more, all are working well and as expected. I purchased one a couple months ago, loved it, and so I bought two more just this past week. I have the three of them set up to turn on/off four lights twice a day (three hours in the morning and 5+ hours in the evening) and also have them hooked up to Alexa with two commands. They are fairly easy to setup initially via the app and also simple to pair with Alexa, just follow the instructions and you're golden.

I'm not going to lie though, I did encounter a couple minor, super small hiccups during the setup but nothing that I couldn't figure out or would cause me to rate this any lower than a 5 star (maybe a 4.5 but since half stars aren't allowed we will round up). First tiny hiccup: the first wemo I purchased took a few tries in getting the app to recognize it but with some persistence, a dash of patience, and a couple of restarts of the wemo, wemo app, and iPad and it was good to go in less than 15 minutes and it hasn't given me any trouble since (the two other wemos I purchased a week or so after and together they took less than 5 minutes to setup). Second and last little hiccup (solved in less than 10 mins but still something for users to be aware of): getting Alexa to turn my two newest wemos on at the same time by saying one command, I thought I could be clever and name both wemos with the same name and Alexa would know to turn both on/off when I said their name, however, it turns out that you have to instead create a ""group"" within Alexa's app containing the wemos you want to turn on/off together and the caveat is they cannot have the same name within the wemo app. If anyone figured out how to side step this (besides creating a group or asking Alexa more than one command) let me know, but naming two wemos the same name just did not work for me (or Alexa).

Use one wemo for two lights! - My third wemo works double and controls our two small lights on either side of our tv, just plug a multi-socket plugin into the wemo plug and wah-la, a one plug wemo became a two plug wemo. :)

Lastly, and most importantly, our cat Snickers is a HUGE FAN of these wemos and appreciates them very much because it makes her feel like we are home if we get home late or go away for the weekend. And yes, Snickers told me this herself, she also said that her and Alexa get along great and that they talk at least a few times a day. I have not witnessed any of their interaction because she says they only chat when we aren't home, and trust me I've tried asking Alexa if she talk with Snickers and she just outright denies knowing who Snickers is altogether. I have also tried looking into Alexa's app for the conversations but to no avail, I suspect either Snickers is going onto my iPad and deleting their convos or Alexa is not recording them. I contemplated getting a security camera but as much as I want proof of their friendship I would just never forgive myself if I ruined it.

In any case, these are great and I definitely recommend purchasing more than one, at least enough to control all the lamps you turn on daily or even periodically because the wemo app also lets you set which days you want it to turn on/off.",5.0 out of 5 stars
R. B.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2017","I was somewhat alarmed at the number of negative reviews of the Wemo mini smart plug switch. I decided to take it slowly, ordering one or two at a time. I now have six with a seventh coming.
Set up was effortless. The process of connecting to Wi-Fi, naming the switch, connecting to Alexa, setting up single lamps, joining a group, and testing it took five minutes for the first lamp and with practice now takes three minutes. I easily set up groups of lamps controlled by a single command.
I have not tried timed lamps but it looks simple. I have not tried IFTTT. I did not download the firmware update since everything was working.
However, I did try causing trouble. I unplugged a switch and plugged it back in. I changed the name of a switch. I turned off the Wi-Fi and then turned it back on. I set up switches on different floors of the house than the router or the Echo. At no time could I get any of the switches to fail.
The oldest one I have is less than two weeks old, so there is the possibility of failure in the long run. Otherwise I am truly baffled at why some people have had so much trouble.

Update: I ordered two more plugs, numbers 8 and 9. This time I had problems. They would not detect the Wi-Fi. I recycled the plugs and the Wi-Fi to no avail. I unplugged all of the previous 7 plugs, as recommended by another reviewer, but still could not get the new ones to connect. I tried several more times over a period of six hours. I saw why others gave up at this point but i was encouraged to persist because the first 7 worked. Suddenly the new ones connected. I'm truly not sure why. However, a month has gone by and all 9 are operating perfectly. Once again I recycled the Wi-Fi and unplugged the plugs but could not get anything to fail. Clearly these plugs have quirks, but now everything works: Alexa, the Wemo app and the rules. My only sure advice is to persist and you will be rewarded with eventual success.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Robert G. Coach,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2017","Update to my review 27 Nov 2018
The Wemo app finds NONE of my 24 remaining devices. Yet the Wemo server continues to automatically turn on and off two rooms. Go figure. Yesterday, 7 of the 24 remaining Wemos left and cant be found by anything. I have been using Alexa to control them while I go through the COSTLY process of replacing them all, but even SHE cant find these lost sheep. I am accelerating the replacement process. I cant wait to be Wemo free and look forward to the day when I can delete the Wemo app from my life. On a happier note, the Amazon smart plugs have worked flawlessly since installed and are currently on SALE!
Update to my review 7 November 2018.
After a LOT of effort I managed to get the 30 Wemo's connected and working. I just had my cable modem die and since replacing it the Wemo app no longer finds Any OF THE 30 active devices. ""Not Found"" Which is very odd because they are all connected to my wireless network and they are all WORKING via Alexa voice command. And they still turn on and off according to the preset schedule. But none are accessible or controllable by the Wemo app.

I ran a test with the Amazon wireless plug. It set up first try and has worked every time reliably. I am in the process of replacing all my Wemo devices with Amazon wireless plugs because they work and the Wemo has been nothing but trouble since I began installing it several years ago. If you are considering the purchase of a Wemo device I recommend you buy a goat and inspect its entrails prior to completing your purchase.

Update to my review. Yesterday, 3/5/2018 all my Wemo devices went off line. All of them. Not found. Not by Alexa nor by the Wemo app. I restarted all my devices. Nada. Not found. Restarted the wireless hub, no joy. NONE OF MY WEMO DEVICES ARE FOUND since the update.

I am now in full up manual mode. And looking for a different solution. I cannot say this LOUD enough. Belkin devices are CRAP and they just dont work. They have been nothing but painful since I installed them two years ago. At least once a month they just go away and now apparently they are not coming back. DONT buy this if you are truly into home automation. Find another solution. I am

I bought one last year and liked it. I went all in and now have most of the house on Wemo switches and outlets. They worked fine for many months until the latest firmware update. Now most of them are continually off line. I have reset, restarted and performed all the recommended updates including adding multiple wireless extenders throughout the house. They are performing so poorly that I am considering going back to pre Wemo days. Its just very frustrating. Had they left them alone I suspect that they would still be operating just fine. Now they are worthless and I can no longer recommend them.

November 2017 update. For the past two months the Wemo app will not find any of my devices. Fortunately I have been able to control them using Alexa else I would have backed the truck up and recycled them all.

This first happened when Belkin did a firmware update. The last three firmware updates have killed connectivity. The first time I reconnected all 22 devices. It took a full day. I contacted Belkin support and got a terse replay ""not our fault"" basically don't call us we will call you NEVER.

The second time I managed to get the devices to connect after two days of resetting them by cycling the power. What a huge pain in the butt. Again, Belkin support said ""Not our fault, move along we are not interested in your little problems""

Yesterday I was forced to do another firmware update cause I lost half the devices. You guessed it, they all went away again. I contacted Belkin support again. They told me to go away I was obviously not getting the message. They do not support their devices.

I used to buy Belkin wireless but went away from them several years ago because they are unreliable, inconsistent and not supported.

I tried to update the Wemo app. No update available. I tried controlling them through Alexa, but got the server not responding error message from Alexa. Interesting but for half the devices I could command them individually but not collectively via Alexa. Other room groups worked through Alexa normally but none worked through the Wemo app which did not find ANY of their own devices.

I tried to enable the Wemo skill in Alexa but of course Wemo did not find my wireless network. Nuts. Alexa was turning them on and off using the new Alexa built in hub, but Wemo did not find them while connected to the same freaking network. Belkin is junk in my opinion only matched by their lack of support. Can I go with half a star?.

I started going through the Wemo app trying different things. It was connected to my local wireless network but I deleted and reconnected it again. Like magic all of a sudden the devices showed up only three hours later!

I highly recommend that if you do decide to go with Belkin you place the switches in a location where you can easily access it manually because I can guarantee that you will need to do so.

Unless and until Belkin starts to support their devices and the reliability improves I recommend to my friends and family that they look at alternative solutions.

I would say that I have had a bad experience but it does not raise to that level. :-)",1.0 out of 5 stars
Gadget Guru,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2019","I have 4 Wemo minis that I use in tandem with 3 of the original plug switches, 1 Wemo insight plug and several light switches. I guess you could say I'm pretty well entrenched in the Wemo universe at this point.

All devices work great over my older wireless G router which is on the first floor in the kitchen of my home built in 1875. Not only do I have to contend with thick plaster and lathe walls (and perhaps some lead paint I'd rather pretend isn't there), thick hardwood framing and floors, 3 stories (including the finished attic, but I also have a metal tile ceiling in the kitchen. It's literally the worst case scenario, aside from maybe masonry.

Despite this, all my Wemo components across all three floors and even the detached garage manage to connect and show up in the app, both on the local and outside networks. I do see a lot of reviews that have an issue with this, but despite all the obstacles, I've had no issues. I do make the initial connection to the network on my first floor, but even after relocating the devices, they still show in the app with no issue.

I like using these switches for multiple reasons:

1) Automation: I can turn lights on and off based on sunset and sunrise times, exact time or any combination or sunset/sunrise and specific times. That means my porch light comes on at dusk and turns off at dawn and other lights turn on at dusk and turn off at the time I normally head to bed. This is especially great for holiday decorating.

2) Remote control: I can turn lights or other devices on or off from anywhere the internet exists.

3) Security camera control: I have several outdoor security cameras, but never wanted to have them inside since I didn't want to risk someone getting into the DVR and being able to view me indoors. With a Wemo switch, I can automate the cameras being on only when I'm not home or manually turn them on remotely at other times rather than activate or deactivate them through the security DVR. That means a hacker would need to have access to both the DVR and the Wemo switch to spy on me indoors. Granted, they would only see ""public"" areas on the first floor, but it's nice to have that extra security measure with two systems.

4) Access to lighting controls from anywhere in the house: It's nice to be able to turn on outside lighting from my bedroom using the app to investigate a noise I might hear outside. Whether it's a raccoon or a human prowler, it's nice to say ""get off my lawn"" from the safety of a lockable upstairs room using outdoor lighting.

Overall, installation, updates and use are pretty painless. I make it harder on my self by having MAC Address filtering turned on in my router, so I have to manually add each device address in before it will connect. Most people don't do this, so it's a problem I made for myself, not an issue for the device. Once I manually add in the MAC Address, things go pretty smoothly.

I have a password with special characters in it, so I can conform there is no issue with using them. The devices also see unfazed my using the newer WPA2 security.

Once you have one device connected, you can save those credentials to make adding more devices easier.

Overall, things are easy, but it's not entirely peaches and cream. Here are the reasons for only 4 stars:

1) The overall installation could be far easier if the app could simply read a QR code on the device and add it directly to the home network using the saved credentials that way. It's silly to have to connect to the device, send the credentials to it (or enter them manually if it's the first device), then connect back to the home WiFi network to use it with the other devices. Seriously: scan QR code through the app using the camera, input WiFi credentials (or select already saved WiFi network), plug in the device, then wait for it to connect and appear in the app. It should be that simple. It's not unworkable the way it is, but there's no reason for it not to be easier.

2) You can't change your WiFi password on all the devices using the app. That means if you update your router password periodically (as you should), you have to first deprogram ALL the Wemo devices, change the router password, then manually add them all back in. Seriously. What moron thought that was a good way to do it? The app lets you save the Wifi properties for adding additional properties. You should be able to go into the settings and change it and have all the devices update in one shot. That's, like, how everything else in the world works. Stupid, stupid, stupid....

3) Switches don't resume their previous on state if power is lost, then restored. They seem to reconnect to my network fine, but it's annoying my outside light remains off after power is restored instead of remembering the state it was on (or comparing the current state to the running program) and turning on if it should be on. If Belkin is worried something could trip a breaker or do something else bad if the switch somes back on unattended, simply make it a check box function for each individual switch. That way I can decide what should come back on following a power failure and what should remain off. Further, they can program in a delay to ensure the system is no longer at risk of brown-outs to avoid the effects of multiple power drops.

4) These things aren't cheap. In comparison to other similar devices on the market, the price of the Belkin devices is becoming more out of line with the market reality. Fortunately, occasional sales make that less of an issue, but Belkin really needs to price their products more competitively to ward off competition from the cheap Chinese knock-offs.

5) Belkin seems to take far too long to respond to new feature demands. It's only recently as last year they finally added a dimmable light switch, for example. Other manufacturers were already out with options for that long before Belkin came out with their product. Likewise, companies like Lutron not only have app controlled switches, but have options for adding additional switches to lights without the need for a direct connection with them. While the Belkin WiFi based system would likely at least need a power connection to an add on switch, they absolutely need to create ""add-on"" switches that can control a main switch, essentially creating a 3-way switch option to lighting. These add on switches would read the state of the main switch and show the the state in the app, and merely trigger the on/off press on that main switch they connect to. In short, they would only act as a remote control for the main switch. Belkin already has the ability to do this, as evidenced by the addition of the ""long press"" rule, but they need an option for a dedicated add-on switch to avoid the cumbersome ""long-press"" option that is really a complete pain to use.

6) Belkin needs more options for the rules. Right now, the rules only let you set one on/off event for days that you choose. If you want a second or third on/off event, you need another rule. That means you need separate rules for work days and weekends, morning and evening, home and away, home and vacation, holidays and literally every single thing else you can think off. My thermostat lets me set all those options that can be accessed in an unattended manner for most (work day/day off, morning/evening, etc.) , and two touches for others (vacations, holidays, time of year, etc.). I should be able to use on rule to turn a light on in the evening and off at bed time, turn on in the morning and turn off when I leave for work and have separate times for my days off. There should then be a check box to enable whatever vacation or holiday rules I might have set. If you're like me and have a lot of devices, having individual rules for each occasion for each device means a whole lot of rules.

Now, some of these negatives I can live with because there is at least a work around, even if it's more cumbersome. In some cases, I choose not to use a Wemo switch unless or until that option becomes available (such as my foyer light that has a three way switch). In the case of making it a pain when changing my WiFi password, I took off a star for making me jump through unnecessary hoops a couple of times a year. That star also includes the somewhat cumbersome method of adding switches.

The fact is, once added, the switches do work great (for me, anyway). Belkin just needs to get on the ball and bring their product a few steps further to make them stand out from the competition that is in danger of eating their lunch.",4.0 out of 5 stars
The Suburban Experimentalist,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2019","UPDATE: So I initially started using these in April, and it is now October 10th. I have had no problems with these, and at one point I was gone from the house for a month, turning the lights on and off, and have had no problem with this at all. Firmware has been updated at least twice since installing them, with no issues. It still works with Apple Home kit on my phone. I still rate them at this point great!

So i just recently starting using smart devices in my home. I do not want something that is always listening to me, so I do not want an Alexa, or Google Hub.

I set this smart plug up using the Wemo app in just a few minutes. This is contrast to another manufacturer I tried.

Can this work with Apple Homekit on your phone?
See the video, but the video, but the answer is yes! I was able to to use Apple Home kit to control this smart plug after I used the Wemo app to do a firmware update on the plug. At this time however, I was not able to do so on the Wemo light switch.

After doing the firmware update using the Wemo App, the Wemo smart plug simply showed up when I clicked on the Home app on my phone.

From that point, I could just push the home button and ask Siri to turn the light on our off.

Responsiveness of the Wemo app:
The app is instantaneous as far as I am concerned. That again is in contrast to another manufacturer that has a lot of lag(delay) in turning the decide on and off.

What can you do from the Wemo app:
You can schedule the device to turn on and off at certain times, you can program an auto off timer, You can use a motion detector to turn devices on and off, but you need to install a Wemo Sensor, or Netcam to do so. There is Away mode, for vacation, and you can get motion alerts (again if you have a sensor). You can do firmare updates to your devices, you can see who has access to your devices, and disconnect those you don't want on your system, and you can setup control to Alexa, Google assistant, nest, etc. You can also use the app to get in touch with the makers of Wemo.

Reliability:
My Wemo devices will occasionally become disconnected for a few minutes, but I am not sure what the issue is. It doesn't happen often, and it is not troublesome to me.

I really like the Wemo devices over the other smart devices I have used.

I hope this is helpful!

Lazyboy,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2018","I had asked the question as to whether or not this device will operate simultaneously with both Alexa and HomeKit. The answer I got was yes and it was true (I think) what I wasn’t told was that in order to work with Homekit it was necessary to update the firmware. Not really a big deal but if you’re installing eight of them it does take some time. With that said, I did get all the devices to show up in the Homekit app (although one stubborn unit took a total restart to do so) and I can operate through both the Homekit and Wemo apps. I have not yet had the chance to work our automation on HomeKit nor the chance to blend them into Alexa (I’m trying to make this really easy for someone else) but my first impressions are -
It’s a fairly simple setup once you get the first one
It does what it should.
Check back for an update on the grouping, voice automation (a single device at a time has worked as hoped) and finally voice control on two separate OS’s, HomeKit and Alexa. Probably a weekend adventure.

An add on update. I set up two scenes through HomeKit (very simple to do btw) and both worked with either the phone scene tab on the app and with Siri. With that said and as I have read elsewhere, three devices dropped from the network and had to be found again. For the mathematically inclined, that’s nearly a forty percent drop rate on the second day. I’ll attribute that for now to the new programming but am not encouraged that issues have showed up so quickly.

Final edition- have had the plugs three weeks now. Working flawlessly and will buy a few more (running eight now) based on my experience. Please note that I have only run them with HomeKit but I would expect the same results from Alexa.
Final final edition. I have added two more of these to my network to now total ten. My caveat remains that set up and integration into HomeKit can still be frustrating but....
I didn’t need a hub and the HomeKit scenes I have set up have performed without fail. Just remember you need to update the firmware to make it work. Once brought into the HomeKit network, it works with my tv remote, my phone, my Mac laptop.....you get the picture. My wife loves coming home this time of year and turning on lights all around the house with only asking for it. Nice feature to have. You cannot dim lamps (yet?) but on and off based on the scene you define is all we really wanted. I’ve upgraded my rating to a five in spite of the sometimes setup failure.",5.0 out of 5 stars
MO,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2017","UPDATE 3/20/2017: As you'll see below the nice folks at Wemo support reached out to ask me about the issue. Support had some good questions, and I felt like they knew what they were doing. I didn't get the usual basic questions about if the Wemo is plugged in. Ultimately I just had to hunker down, and do proper troubleshooting. After about 3 hours I finally narrowed down the basic issue.

Some context first. I connect all of my IoT gizmos to an isolated guest network. The idea is if somebody hacks one, they aren't easily getting to my laptops, and other sensitive devices. I have a Netgear R700 Nighthawk router that supports firewalled guest networks to fit this purpose.

I noticed in the router logs that the Wemo was actually connecting, and getting an IP address. However the amber light on the plug would keep flashing indicating it didn't think it was connected. What's weird is exactly every 60 seconds I'd see another DHCP request. Weirder yet the first time the Wemo DHCP's it seems to be stable.

Ultimately I found that if I went into my guest network settings and checked the box - ""Allow guests to see each other and access my local network"" the Wemo was happy and worked just fine. Something about the added L2 isolation is making the Wemo very upset. Of course leaving this box checked entirely defeats the purpose of the guest network. Ultimately I signed the Wemo onto my private network; let's hope they've done their security homework.

I'll give back a star because the plug works and stays connected now, and it seems to be a little more responsive as well. Holding a star off the potential 4 star rating as I have to compromise my network to do it.

==== Original Review 3/11/2017 ====
First, I'll lead with I'm VERY savvy when it comes to IoT products. My company designs and implements hardware and mobile apps for a variety of back office providers (Amazon, Ayla, Photon...). This is my first Wemo product, and overall I'm really disappointed. Wemo was one of the first to market, and a well known brand name. I expected a lot more from a company like Belkin, and a product that has been fielded since the beginning of the IoT rave started. Especially at this price point.

All I'm really looking for is a smart plug to automatically power cycle a piece of hardware once a day. And allow me to remotely power cycle it if necessary.

Note: my Wi-Fi signal is good. Less than 10 feet from my router. And I have 50Mbps Internet service. My other gizmos and gadgets have great response times so I'm not having trouble with my Internet.

The Good:
* The product looks professionally done, and feels like good quality construction.
* Wi-Fi pairing was really easy. I'm using the iOS app. Belkin could give me a button to launch iOS Wi-Fi settings, and use a captive network to automatically redirect me to the app once you connect to the Wemo's Wi-Fi access point to save me a little work. No big deal though.
* I didn't have to create a user account. The last thing I really want is another user account somewhere.
* In general, fairly simple and clean app design
* Active user community. Belkin's knowledge base is pretty useless, but the community forums are great!

The Bad:
* Exception to app design: The schedule options were confusing at first. Specifically the ""on until"" option. After a little trial and error I figured it out.
* The first time I created a schedule it took a minute to save it. Edits are faster maybe 10 seconds.
* Toggling power from my phone is really slow - 10-15 seconds. Not the end of the world, but I hate waiting.

The Ugly:
* I needed a firmware update right away. Which is fine. Kicked off the update. It sat and spun, and spun, and spun for about an hour. Noticed the LED was blinking amber. Pull up the manual and find out that means it's not able to connect to Wi-Fi. Power cycled the mini and still no connection. Reset via the on/off button. Repaired with the app and it was fine again.
* I setup my Wemo on a plug by my desk where it's easy to access and see that it is running the schedule correctly. It's final home will be somewhere that's not as easy to access. When I moved the Wemo to it's new home it came up with the flashing amber light again. No amount of power cycling or fidgeting would get it back onto my router again. I had to reset it and repair it again.
* Did some more testing and sure enough - once the power is lost it doesn't reconnect.
* I pulled power on my router just to see what would happen and when it came back up the Wemo didn't reconnect in that case either.
* Conclusion: If you lose your Wi-Fi connection due to router loss, warm reboot, or cold reboot you have to repair. This is a scenario any IoT product is going to face. Simply unacceptable Belkin would even think of shipping units with this issue.

I found a few posts on the community forum with many other people complaining about the same Wi-Fi problem. I'm not alone.

If I had frequent power outages the Wi-Fi problem would be a non-starter 1 star rating. I can live with it so I'll go 2 stars.

If Belkin can get a firmware fix out so Wi-Fi reconnect is reliable I'd go 4 stars. -1 star for the annoying schedule UI, and slowness.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Peter Franzke,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2019","Keep trying. I have around 7 of the Wemo start plugs. Some are previous generations but the set-up process is the same. Having said that even I have had trouble adding a new plug to the Wemo app. The first check is if there is a firmware update. Secondly I reset the plug Itself by holding down the power button (follow directions in user manual) and try again. I will admit that it's taking me up to five try sometimes to get the plug to connect to the app for the first time. However, once it does I have never had an issue even when I have removed a smart plug from one wall socket waited a few days, plugged it into a different wall socket opened the appand there was. One other confusing thing occurs when you connect to the WeMo Wi-Fi for the first time . After the app had successfully connected to the Wemo' s Wi-Fi it doesn't always take you back to the WeMo app to continue the setup process. Depending on the phone you have what you often have to do is close out of your wifi settings and tbe Wemo app and then restart the app. Once you do that it will connect to the WeMo smart plug and continue the process. There's a video I put where you can see where this happens. Also when you do connect to the WeMo Wi-Fi for the first time there may be a message that pops up warning you don't have internet connection. You can ignore this message. Hit dismiss or don't worry about it till it goes away. I think sometimes people stop at that point. However even doing all of those things correctly it is true that sometimes it takes a while for it to connect the first time. That's about the only negative thing as far as function I can say about it. Once you are connected adding your plug to Alexa is fast. It's actually faster than the WeMo setup process. Setting it up with all the other Smart Home hubs is just as straight forward. Setting up widgets is simple as well once you have it up and running. . Form-factors a different thing but that's a discussion for another day.

PROS - Easy step by step setup. Excellent third party support. I've used with Samung Smarthings, IFTT, Apple Home and the native app.

New form factor allows use of second plug. I've purchased multiples of this device. When it comes to Smart plugs this one is my favorite.

CONS - it could use a second plug.

If you're looking for a small plug that's also a smart plug that works with multiple third-party vendors you can't go wrong with the WeMo product. You can plug in smart devices from other brands into this plug and have no issues.

Homekit News and Reviews,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2018","As many reading this a probably aware by now, WeMo recently announced that their Mini Smart Plug was the first ostensibly non-HomeKit compatible device to gain HomeKit compatibility, via the new Software Authentication protocol. Intrigued by this, I decided a purchase was in order, despite the fact that I’ve already got quite a few smart plugs to spare.

If you’ve read my previous reviews, you’ll be aware that I put a lot of stock into presentation (the packaging basically), and on this count I would say that WeMo have delivered admirably. As with many of the current manufacturers of smart devices, the container that the smart plug came in was super sturdy, being made of a thick recycled (?) cardboard, enclosed in a green and white outer sleeve. Green seems to be the colour of choice these days, with iHome and Vocolinc both also opting for this colour scheme. Whether this is an effort to imbue their products with some form of ‘eco-friendliness’ I’m not sure, but it certainly works on an aesthetic level.

Once you’ve taken off the outer sleeve, you can really see that WeMo have gone the extra mile, with a lovely design on the inside of the carton – something you’d only see once you had already purchased the product, so this isn’t just to entice you, it’s to encourage and excite you into taking WeMo seriously, in that they think about the smaller details.

After you’ve open the box fully to reveal the smart plug itself, you can see that it’s housed nicely within the centre of the box, giving it little chance to move around and potentially get damaged. There’s an included manual to help with quick setup along with any problems you might have with the plug, in the form of a list of troubleshooting tips.

At the end of the day, of all the categories of smart devices, smart plugs offer the most choice, and while some can do small things that others can’t do (like monitor electricity usage for example), they all basically do the same job of turning a ‘dumb’ device on or off, giving said device some level of automation. This device is no different to any of those in that basic respect. It’s fairly slim, or wide, depending on how you look at it, but being this slim it does offer the advantage of not taking up more than one wall socket, which in turn means that it can be stacked with another WeMo smart plug quite comfortably.

The design of the plug itself is quite unassuming, which would lend itself to blending into a typical, mainly white kitchen. Simple branding aside, the only other thing on the front is a rather convenient on/off switch, with a small LED that lights up in white, when there’s power going to the plug. Going back briefly to its dimensions, while it’s not quite as slim as the iHome iSPX6, it comes close, although it is slightly taller. it does beat out the iDevices Switch in the ‘skinny’ department, but once again it is wider/taller, so it really is down to the individual as to what works for them.

Onto the setup: As this device isn’t a ‘straight-out-the-box’ HomeKit product, with no HomeKit code provided – or even needed – the procedure was a little bit more involved; not necessarily complicated, but a little long-winded nonetheless. First off, you need to download the WeMo app to get things started. Once the app is downloaded and running, you simply plug the device into an outlet and let the app guide you through the process of initially setting it up to work with the WeMo app. Interestingly, even though the setup process for getting it to integrate with HomeKit comes later, the first thing you’re asked on opening the WeMo app is access to your ‘Home Data’, meaning your current Apple Home data. Once you’ve okayed this, you choose which device you want to set up, you’re then presented with a few tips as to setup process itself. This involves connecting your iPhone or iPad to the wi-fi signal of the plug itself in order to exchange you home wi-fi network settings. Once all that’s ‘in the bag’, the app will attempt to connect to the device itself, which in my case took a little bit of time.

It eventually spots the plug and asks you to name the device (if you so wish – I stuck with ‘Wemo Mini’). You’ll then be prompted to provide an email address to complete the process before it proceeds to finally connect directly to your home network. After that is complete, you then get to choose whether you’d like it to send you notifications.

As I already mentioned, this was a lengthy, if straightforward process, but once you’re at this point, you’ll see the smart plug show up as a device that can now be programmed or controlled within the WeMo app. Chances are that there will be at least one, if not two firmware updates awaiting you. One of these will be for the plug itself, which is reassuring to know that kinks are spotted and ironed out by way of these updates. The other is to enable the plug to work with HomeKit, which is the whole reason this is being reviewed of course! Once you’ve updated the firmware, you’ll finally get to the section that allows for HomeKit connectivity. You’re given options for connecting the plug to IFTTT, Nest, Alexa and finally, the Apple Home App. Google isn’t on this list for some reason, but you can connect to Google assistant via the Google Home app.

We’re on the home straight now, so it’s just connecting the plug to the Home app, which in most respects appears in the same way it would if you were adding a standard HomeKit compatible device, minus the part where you have to scan a code.

From here on in, like with a standard install, it’s simply a case of choosing which room the plug resides in, whether it appears as a Light, Powerpoint or Fan, and whether you wish to add it to your favourites. It will then appear in your standard Home app, along with any 3rd party apps you may use.

I’ve only been using it for about 24 hours, and so far I’ve found it to be as responsive as all my other plugs, with no real sign of extra lag from touching the tile in the app, to the corresponding on or off. The device itself emits a small ‘click’ when it’s turned on or off (which may be good for some and terrible for others), and the LED above the physical switch turns white or turns off respectively.

As previously stated, it does work with other platforms, and while it isn’t compatible with Wink, unlike the aforementioned iHome smart plug, it does have IFTTT, which may actually be of more use.

After setting the device up, I unplugged it from mains power briefly, to see if it would reconnect without any issues, and it did reconnect after about a minute or so. However, I did a second test, where I left it disconnected overnight, and on this occasion it took a full uninstall and reinstallation to get it back to where I had it, which in fact took two attempts, with the first take managing to somehow render the physical button unresponsive. A second full reset solved the issue and once I’d gone through the lengthy installation process again, it was all good.

In my final assessment, it’s great to see how devices are going to work with the new Software Authentication process, and I’m hoping that when other manufacturers do get on board, the set up isn’t as long as this one was, even though I can see that most steps seemed to be necessary. However, there are a ton of choices for smart plugs out there, and while this device is a little cheaper than many of them, you do find some good deals occasionally, which essentially boils this down to just another smart plug.

Pros
slim, so easy to stack with another of these if needed
relatively cheap
good support from a reputable company

Cons
long-winded set up process
not great at remembering settings if left unplugged
Still, I’d recommend it for those on a budget who also don’t want to obscure two wall outlets with one plug.",4.0 out of 5 stars
AH,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2017","I really, really wanted to like this product & technology, but the failure modes and failure rates are astoundingly high.
Relevant background to my skill levels:
I bought a couple of the plugs so that I could experiment with how to automate my home. I am neither a software or hardware engineer, however I am a (very highly) qualified engineer and I have self taught myself a lot about network hardware & application of software packages. I have an advanced router with repeater, fully LAN & WAN connected house, with network switches, POE devices etc. that I installed & runs pretty cleanly.

First of all the app - I am still on 2nd level support waiting for a response to an issue where I am patient zero. I can create a rule, but it does not give me the choice of days. It is the same rule every day or no rule at all. I have tried installing the app on 2 i devices, same issue(the even have different itunes accounts to further firewall them from each other) So the app is highly buggy. App version 1.17.1.

2nd, the switch(es) I have RMA'ed one of my 2 as I still could, the first one I am stuck with. The 2nd one experienced worse functionality issues than the first one. It had to go as this is a defective unit.
The rules limited me, so I tried anyway.
Initial first time setup was quite smooth & I was initially impressed. (Hadn't realized the rules issues yet)
Paired it to Alexa, that was pretty smooth too (Still impressed)
Ran it for a few days, had fun having Alexa switch it on & off etc.
Then we had a power outage. Big system failure on the WEMO.

After restarting power, everything else came back up properly.
I tried restarting the first switch (the still semi functional one that is not RMA'ed) several times to see if it would boot up, it actually would not boot up until I had pushed the power button several times & actually physically unplugged & replugged it several times.
The WEMO devices were not recognized by the app on my phone, until I switched it to the same wifi network as they were running on. This i snot helpful when you are trying to make a remote access switch.
So after trying & rebooting I have given up.
I cannot set up a smart house with devices that require a full factory reboot and me to delete the app, reset all rules from scratch, every time the power fails or blips.

So sadly I have to say the devices are junk, the app is junk and they need to be fully redesigned before both parts of the system become stable & reliable.

Sorry Belkin, but you also have a lot of people on your own Community pages with many similar problems & your own support is not the one finding solutions, it is other users who have more time to do this than most of the rest of us have.
So, folks, if you read this far, don't waste your time & money, these devices are great in concept, but are far from Implementation Ready for mainstream use.

I have never been paid to write a review - good or bad and I have never been given anything for a review, except for one thing that was sent to me that I didn't want & I contacted the vendor & asked for an RMA (They said donate it - so I did). What you read is my genuine experience.
Sadly 1 star reviews get pushed out of sight on Amazon & they are hard to access (even your own ones).
Thanks for your time.

Updated 3/17 to add rules screenshot showing the app issue with no days selectable. App version 1.17.1 (420001) that I am trying to deal with on 2nd level support. I still struggle with the concept that I am the only person with this issue & that it is identical on 2 unrelated Apple devices that are on different accounts.
Just a side note - when Customers are on the phone with your reps, when discussing the product, it really makes a better impression of your company when they are aware of who your major competitor(s) are. 1st level support had never even heard of TP Link (check the recording it you don't believe me).

3/30/2017 update.
I found a workaround out of sheer frustration & anger &, well, it is still strange.

I had a blank screen for the days selection when creating rules. Nothing showed up at all, ever, I have deleted & reinstalled the app 3 times, done a full hardware reset on the switches 3+ times, had Belkin 2nd level support on the phone - you name it. (That was a whole different story - see the response comments!)

So I was giving it one last try to see if it would work, I reinstalled everything from scratch.
Set up a new rule - still nothing snowing in the days area of the screen.

So I was really very angry about how much time & energy I had spent on this whole exercise & I was absentmindedly tapping my phone screen repeatedly, when I suddenly noticed that it was highlighting days of the week.

So I played around some more.

I can get it to highlight, at most, 6 of 7 days, in any combination.

I have to guess where the day is to be selected on the screen, then I can find it.

I sometimes have to tap that spot several times to get the day to select (no it is not my touchscreen, both devices have the same response)

What I then found out was, if I select a day & I can now see it, that means that day is one in which the rule will NOT work. It Will work on the days that are not selected & still invisible on the screen.

I have attached a couple of random screen shots so you can see what is going on.

Is the issue fixed - no, not at all, it is still there & the software still has a huge flaw.
Does it work enough that I want to continue to try to experiment with it - yes
Will I want to see a software update to fix this issue - yes
Do I want to continue to use this switch for the short term - yes
So in short, I will not send it back, yet. There is something going on.

I tried this workaround on 2 different Apple products (Iphone 6 & Ipad Mini 3) and the workaround works on both.

Is it still fatally flawed - yes.

Please can you pass this on to your 2nd or even higher level Engineers as there is still a problem that must get fixed, but this is a partial workaround.

By the way, I also tried changing the screen color settings to see if it was screen contrast or color related - no it is not, the Apple devices are working exactly as they should, it is your software with the bug.

If you want me to try anything else, have your engineers get in touch & we can see what we can do.

I have still lost significant confidence in the product & am very unsure if I want to invest in any more of them to automate other parts of my home at this time.",1.0 out of 5 stars
MD,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2018","Original review was Four Stars, and follows this update, which is just a few days later....

So, as noted below, after some struggles, I did manage to get it connected. BUT, it won't power my heater! It is supposed to, but, today, it started overheating and turning itself (and my heater) off. I woke up freezing cold, and saw that it was off, and learned, via a message in the app, that this stupid plug just overheats and shuts itself off! What it the point?! Very fed up now with Wemo.

Switch was also making electrical crackling sounds, not good. Fire hazard, for sure!

I am returning it, and don't care to try another one. I have ordered one of the units from TP-Link, and I'll see how that does. I did not order one of their ""Mini"" ones, since maybe they are too fragile for a space heater, but, if that's the case, then these companies should be forthright and state, up front, that the small versions are only for a 4 watt lamp, or whatever the limit is.

I found many similar complaints about this useless plug, the overheating problem, and apparently it comes down to a defective unit, since some can power a heater, just fine, and others, like mine, overheat and shut down.

Lousy quality control, minimal customer help, fire hazard, all bad. I'm done with Wemo.

ORIGINAL REVIEW, a few days previous....

Back in 2016, I ordered a Wemo Smart Plug, just to be able to remotely turn on the space heater at home, so my apartment would be nicely warmed up for my arrival, in winter. It worked so well I bought a second one, to do the same at my office. They were the ""full size"" ones, not a Mini version.

As usual, this year, I did not use them over the summer, at all, and have only just now needed them again. This year, the one at the office still works great, but, to my great frustration, the one at home simply refused to work anymore, and I wasted hours following every procedure I could find, to no avail. Wemo does a horrid job, in my opinion, on simplifying use and troubleshooting of these products. You have to hunt through basically other customer experiences and what they did, and the app itself now doesn't even have built-in help, but instead kicks you over to your browser to try and find any solution and you can't even connect to the Internet while trying to set up this thing.

For me, my original less-than-clever plug would not connect to the app anymore, and would also not do anything else after reset, it just blinked orange and would do nothing more, and refused to even go into pairing mode. I finally took a hammer to it, and felt much better!

BUT, based on how well it worked, when it did work, and based on my office one still working great, two years on, I opted to try Wemo again, this time selecting this Mini version, because it doesn't block the other outlet of the wall plug.

At first, I was getting frustrated again, and nearly reached for the trusty hammer, but it WOULD at least go into pairing mode, although it would not complete the set-up. Turns out that smart phones now annoy the smart plug, so I had to change settings on my phone so that no other network would interfere during the set up process. I just turned off 4G, and deleted all networks but one, so that the fussy little plug could complete the set up process.

Then, the app promptly forgot or deleted the plug, and it was gone, and I had to start over. As my hand almost involuntarily started creeping toward the hammer handle, I paused, took a deep breath, and began from the beginning. This time, I knew what to do at least, deleted all my networks but one, turned off 4G, let it set itself up, then added one network back to my phone, so it could talk to the plug, and, voila! Plug showed up in the app and works perfectly to turn the heater on and off.

So, definitely a star lost for very poor assistance with these things. I never did figure out why the other one stopped working, and, with this one, I was entirely on my own to figure out why it would not initially set up, beyond the mention of some ""auto connection"" feature on my phone, which I turned off, but which made no difference.

Just using guesswork, I figured too many available networks was confusing the not-so-smart plug, and that turned out to be the case. But, VERY frustrating process, and there just is not readily available (or easily applicable) help from Wemo on their products, which seems ridiculous to me, and likely is behind some of the many negative reviews.

I know there are a lot of phones and a lot of networks out there, but it seems somebody could make a product that connects more easily, or at least offer some step by step guides for troubleshooting, or something. I'm no tech or computer guy, so I probably don't have a clue how difficult that is to accomplish, and it's likely a case where it's best to just be thankful for a product that can miraculously turn on my heat from anywhere on earth (if my Internet is working, at least) but I can see where folks would give up on products like this, that are just so frustrating sometimes and refuse to do what they are supposedly made to do.

This is certainly as deep as I'll ever dive into ""smart"" products, and, no thanks, don't need my fridge monitoring me or microphones and cameras surveilling my every move. I guess people raised in this nightmare era of social media don't think it's a big deal (despite all that goes wrong due to broadcasting one's life incessantly), but, yup, a semi-smart plug is about all I want to deal with in terms of the Internet of Things or whatever it is called.

So, a star off for frustrations, but, I will say, regarding these, that when they work, they are a big help. I can figure out for myself when to order milk, but smart tech that lets me operate my heater from anywhere is pretty awesome, so four stars given, and deserved, in that regard.

I do recommend, but hide your hammer, because frustrations may come along with this item and help is definitely not easy to find.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Customer Review,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2017","I purchased this item from Amazon on January 9th, as a pre-order from when they were released as a new item on January 10th, 2017. After receiving two defective units from Amazon, and before returning the second, I decided to play around with it more and do some more research online. I am posting this to help anyone else who purchased this and is having trouble getting it to connect to your local WiFi network. I did get the unit working fine, but I removed two stars from my review because of the hassle of getting it to work. I spent over an hour with WeMo tech support, who offered no solutions, and made me jump through a bunch of hoops in the process. Cycling a reboot of my router did nothing. Changing my WiFi password did nothing. Disconnecting my phone from cellular service did nothing. The issue with these early units lies in the fact that they seem to get ""confused"" if you have other WeMo devices in your home. When trying to set up this WeMo mini, the WeMo app on my iPhone would find the device after I connected to its WiFi. The screen would show the device, ask me to name it, and click ""Next"". After clicking next, it would get stuck trying to get the device to find my home WiFi network. I have 4 other ""older"" WeMo devices (none of which ever had any issue connecting). I have a WeMo light switch, and 3 regular WeMo smart plugs. Two of the other WeMo smart plugs were easily accessible, so I tried completely unplugging them (not just turning them off). I did a factory reset on the WeMo mini I purchased, went through the app process of connecting it again, and voila! It immediately found my WiFi network and connected. And then it immediately downloaded a firmware update. So it seems like WeMo is aware of an issue, yet their tech support wasn't informed. And so far, I seem to be the only one publicly acknowledging the issue with these early release devices and buggy firmware.

So long story short, if you have other WeMo devices in your household, and have trouble getting this WeMo mini to connect, try unplugging as many of the other devices as you can (they will automatically reconnect online after you plug them back in), factory reset the mini, and go through the setup process again. It should hopefully work.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Vispian,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2017","Update: 2017-04-05
The WeMo switch continues to work well for the most part. IFTTT and Google Assistant integration continue to work well also. I wanted to expand on my comment about the App based indication of On/Off being incorrect. This is using Android, I cannot say what the results on iOS are.

Wemo Android App: Always correct when it says the switch is on or off.
Wemo Android WIDGET: Sometimes correct when it says the switch is on or off.
Google Assistant: Always correct when it says the switch is on or off.

The issue seems to be only with the Widgets. Since the switch can be turned on or off so many ways; Wemo App, Wemo Widget, a dozen different ways via IFTTT, Google Assistant, Alexa...), it seems the Widgets do not get updated. Here's an example. My Wemo switch named ""Hallway Light"" is OFF. I ask Google Assistant to turn it on, ""OK Google, turn hallway light on"". Google Assistant says it will, and the light comes on. If I now look at the Android Widget, the widget continues to show the switch as being in the OFF state. If I open the WEMO App, it will connect with each of your WEMO devices and correctly display their current state. It will also update the Widgets so they, at least for the moment, also indicate the correct state. Not a major issue really, just an annoyance making the widgets untrustable, pity as they would be really useful otherwise.

There was a firmware update posted, this is good - shows Belkin is actively updating these. The update went without issue and the switch updated itself, very good. My Wemo Insight (different product, not reviewed here) has failed to update 4 times in a row though, it seems it just will not complete the update.

Original Review:
Works great, easy to setup and the IFTTT integration is excellent. Haven't used the iOS app, but the Android App and widgets work smoothly. There are lots of ways to control WeMo, I've used just a few; WeMo App, Google Assistant, IFTTT with various triggers such as Google Assistant, weather, email, NEST Protect. Here lies the only real issue I've found. The WeMo app and widgets display the status of the switch, on or off. This status is often not correct. For example, if I turn the switch ON with the Wemo app, the app shows the switch as being ON. So far so good. Now, if I turn the switch OFF using Google Assistant, ""Ok Google, turn off basement light"", Google turns off the switch, awesome. The Wemo app and widgets still show the Wemo switch as being ON, even though it is actually off. That means I cannot trust the app to show me the correct status. That's minor actually, not a big deal - and that's the only issue I've had so far. Except for that, Wemo looks like a great system.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Joey,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2020","I purchased my Wemo back in December of 2018. At that time I wanted to make my home more ""smart"" but did not have the budget to do so. I got this little guy as a way to hold myself over until I could invest into something more.

I was disappointed from the start. The thing with Wemo products is the fact you have to use their app to run the equipment. My disappointment was not from the product, but from the Wemo app support. Back in 2018, the app was constantly crashing, struggling to pair with the Wemo product, and made it difficult to use. It got thrown in a drawer, with little likelihood to be used for some time.

Fast forward to May 31, 2020. I move into a new place in May, and I decide to setup my ""smart"" home products again. I have a couple Philips Hue Light Bulbs. Those work no problem. I then try to set up this Wemo, thinking ""no way there are still problems with the app.... It's 2020"".

I download the app. I open the app and become excited. It looks like the app has been improved. Then I get to a screen that says ""Create New Account / Log In"". I look all around for the option to skip the account creation, since I had not done that before, and I only have one product so I don't really want to create an account. No option.

So I have to make an account. After spending 15 minutes (not exaggerating) creating 2 accounts with different emails and passwords, I am having the same issues and I'm frustrated. The passwords will not save when I create the accounts. I call their support team at 7:42pm. After a 9 minute phone call, we are able to follow specific steps to create the account. I say thanks for helping me set this up, I'm pretty tech savvy so I can probably add the device. Thanks for your help.

At 8:02, I call support again. Now that I have an account and I'm in the app, I realize that my Wemo device is not linking to my account. So I can setup the Wemo in their app, but I CAN'T USE IT because it won't pair to the account WEMO MADE ME CREATE. I have had it now. I do everything I can think of, from resetting the router to deleting the app, to switching to a different account, to resetting up the Wemo. All while I'm on hold with customer support for 26 minutes (never got through to someone). I hang up, frustrated and defeated.

I turn to Google and begin trying to find an answer. I come across post after post on Reddit and other forum sites, all with similar, yet different problems with Wemo than what I am facing. This seems to be a new issue no one has had. I try again to reset the app, re-setup the Wemo, etc. Nothing is working.

At 8:56 pm, I call customer support again. I'm on hold, but not for 26 minutes (thankfully), and I talk with someone. She has me do the same steps I have already done and what do you know, it doesn't solve the problem. This time our conversation is 23 minutes and I'm left with the answer ""We will have someone call you in 24-48 hours with an answer"".

The next day I walk by the Wemo, still plugged into the wall. I am frustrated and let out a sigh. I go to the Wemo app and click on Wemo Community. There's a post from Wemo called ""Issues After Wemo update"". I begin to scroll through the comments and there are so many problems being mentioned. Then I find this post. ""I had to download Yonomi to use my Wemo's because they can make a better app for Wemo's products than Wemo can!""

I download Yonomi and not joking, within 30 sections I am able to turn my Wemo On and Off, the simple functions I was hoping the Wemo app would be able to do.

If you made it this far, congrats. I hope what you got from this rant is that I don't want you to end up like me - spending 100 minutes (1 hour 40 minutes) trying to get my Wemo device to work, only to discover there is a 3rd party app made by another company that not only works better than the Wemo app that I am told to use, but took me 30 seconds to setup, as opposed to endless steps with the Wemo app.

Save your money. Don't buy this product. Invest in something that is quality from someone other than Wemo or Belkin.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Marie,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2017","For what it is and does, the Wemo Mini Smart Plug is a great device. I have no complaints and recommend it for smart home use or even something as simple as a timer or standalone appliance or light controller.

Overview:

The Wemo mini is easy to set up, use and integrates well with other smart home devices such as Alexa and Google Assistant for voice control and Nest for device sync. Unlike some other smart home devices, the mini does not require a hub. Using the mobile app you can easily control from anywhere, expand or modify your Wemo devices to control your lights and appliances.

I really like the form factor. Unlike many similar devices, the mini allows two devices to be plugged into the same outlet.

I really got tired of dealing with individual plugin timers that sometimes work or sometimes didn't or that had very limited capabilities. You can schedule the mini in whatever way you need, you can sync them, stagger them or make them work randomly. Much better than a better than a than a standalone timer. It even works with Nest. You can sync Nest with the mini for automatic home/away control. Try doing that with a standalone wall plug timer.

WiFi Connectivity:

This is a non issue based on my personal experiences. I did have a small problem on one occasion to connect with Wi-Fi, but this was due to the placement of the Wemo Mini behind a steel table leg which interfered with the wireless signal. After moving the table momentarily while initially connecting to the Wi-Fi router, things worked fine afterward.

IFTTT Integration:

You can even expand your uses by using readily available IFTTT apps or by writing your own which is easy and doesn't require any programming knowledge.

Star Rating:

The only reason, I didn't rate the Mini Smart plug a five is it's cost. However, you can sometimes find these discounted so if you plan to get several, I suggest that you look for one of these purchasing opportunities. I purchased each of mine by waiting for one of these discount events.

Owner Observations:

While you can control lights with the Mini Smart plug, I would recommend you determine what you want to use it for before before purchasing as there may be better alternatives especially if you're considering to use for primarily controlling lights. You may want to consider purchasing something like a Hue light kit depending on how many lights you plan. If you plan to limit your light control to a single light or multiple lamps connected to a strip, then go with the Mini. I highly recommend using the Mini for non-lighting functions and to control other devices.",4.0 out of 5 stars
WellDressedBookwormDad,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2023","I had these smart plugs for a few years and they worked fairly OK with my Amazon Echo device… once I could actually get them working, that is. The version I had required me to download the app which never seems to have been updated. Linking them into my home’s Wi-Fi always took forever, it did not seem to be quick or easy at all. If I had an hour or so to spare doing this, then eventually it would work and I could get the plugs paired up with my Echo device and then they would work just fine until the next power surge or loss of signal or whatever, in which case I would have to go through the whole process again. The last time this happened I just couldn’t get them to connect to my Wi-Fi, so they have been consigned to the trashcan and I am going to buy a different product now.

And as an aside, this is not an issue with my Wi-Fi or Internet. I always pay top dollar for the fastest Internet possible because I work from home. Everything else in my house connected to Wi-Fi works just fine.

I can’t give them one star because they do actually work. But I can’t give them more than three stars, because it takes them forever to work, and as I mentioned above, now they have stopped working.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Prime member,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2017","I started with Wemo Smart Plug(bigger version) in Dec 2016 and was fairly happy with its basic functionality but always thought if it could be smaller so it won't block the other socket. I then came across Wemo mini Smart Plug and bought one. The initial setup was a bit longer as it took 15 minutes and multiple iterations to detect and connect to my Wifi network even though I was in the same room where the Wifi router was. And I have a high-end router from ASUS (RT‑AC87R Wireless‑AC2400). So I was a bit disappointed about how long it took to connect
However once connected, it works like a charm both from Wemo App from my iPhone 6S as well as from Alexa. Once initial setup was done, it automatically prompted and downloaded the latest firmware updates. I'm very happy I did buy them that I added two more. I didn't go for TP-Link or similar smart switches only because it is easy to manage all 3 Smart Plugs in one Wemo App than having to maintain two or three different Apps.
Perhaps Belkin/Wemo should work on improving the setup time and hope to see a stable connection to my Wifi network. I recommend this to anyone looking for a smart-home.

Update 07/06/2017: I purchased one more Wemo product, the WiFi Dimmer switch. It took 10 minutes for wiring the Wemo WiFi Dimmer switch. However, the initial setup took more than 2 hours where the Wemo App was having a lot of difficulties finding and connecting to my WiFi network even though I was in the same room where the WiFi router was located. It was really frustrating when the App asked me to calibrate the Dimmer brightness setting for each iteration.
One or two times it did find and connect to my WiFi network but later got stuck when detecting the Wemo device. Then I figured out the reason Wemo App got confused was due to the existing Wemo smart devices already connected (4 mini plugs and 1 Light switch). I disconnected all existing Wemo devices from the outlet and had only the new Dimmer switch hooked up and thus time the Wemo App could connect to my WiFi network and detect the device quickly.
Once connected the Dimmer switch worked nicely. Belkin technical R&D team should really fix this frustrating setup issue. Hence I knocked down one star. I knew this setup problem so I didn’t give up and return the switch as faulty. I’m sure many would have already returned thinking the device is defective.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jason P,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2017","The Mini Smart Plug's are perfectly sized (height-wise) to be able to plug 2 into a typical 2 outlet receptacle - 1 above the other. That's really nice! They seem a little wider than they'd need to be. It would be nice it they were, at maximum, the width of the wall plate. It should serve the purposes of most users/use-cases. I wish I could control my WEMO devices via a web browser -- and not just an app on my phone. I think it would be easier to program schedules via a web browser. The app is functional but, even as a tech guy, I'm not able to program things super fast through the app. I also wish WEMO had some (OOTB) integration with Synology's NAS and Surveillance Station. (I have seen some backwards ways to integrating the two.)

Setup of the WEMO SWITCH devices is a breeze! Simply plug your WEMO DEVICE into a power outlet and plug your device into the WEMO. Then, hop onto your Smartphone, download the WEMO app, connect your phone to WEMO’s temporary Wi-Fi, follow the prompts, and BAM, your WEMO is setup. You should give the WEMO a descriptive name to identify it from any other WEMO devices you may have – or purchase later when you see how helpful they are!

I have 4 WEMO devices (2 Mini Smart Plugs and 2 Insight Switches - the latter I've had for over a year). I originally bought the Insight Switches for Christmas lights. I chose the Insight Switches, in particular, because I wanted to see how much electricity my Christmas Light displays were pulling and costing me throughout the season. This was successful.

A more recent use for the WeMo devices is to control several heating devices for our HEDGEHOG's cage. We have 2 WEMO INSIGHT SWITCHES – 1 for the heating pad and 1 for the heat lamp – that allow us to turn the heating pad and heat lamp on and off from anywhere in the world! We’re able to determine when to turn on or off the heat because we have a camera setup in Harvey’s cage that also captures the current temperature of the cage. We specifically use the INSIGHT SWITCHES because I'm very concerned for our hedgehog's well being and, while I'm sure WEMO Smart Plug's are working when the ""green light"" is on in the App, I'd rather see ENERGY USAGE in real time via the INSIGHT SWITCH to KNOW that the heating pad and heat lamp are actually FUNCTIONAL and heating Harvey.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Mr. Arthur Matthews,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2018","I had two of these switches that worked very well and then I purchased a third. In trying to install it on the Wemo app it would not install. In fact I deleted my app and started to see if that would fix it. A mistake as now all three wemo mini switches failed to work ! A call to support (who are very good and based in the Philipines) determined that the firmware was out of date on my old wemo switches. These were updated and still no joy. The new wemo was returned to Amazon as faulty and replaced (super service). The new wemo arrives and I contact support for another attempt at getting these wemo’s installed. After well over an hour of resetting the switches and deleting and reinstalling apps on both an iPad and iPhone still no joy. So I was upgraded to higher support who would call the next day. Next day and after creating a WiFi hotspot and upgrading the firmware ,the switches would install when connected to this WiFi hotspot that was created on my PC, however the wemo switches would still not install using my router WiFi ! It was suggested that I use another password on my router but I explained that I had numerous devices attached and didn’t really want to change my password, after all it had worked well with my old wemo switches! After some discussion and this was after over two hours approx on a support call I was asked about my password. When I explained it contained a symbol I was told the wemo switch WOULD NOT connect to a router password that contained a symbol !!! (my old switches prior to firmware update had worked to this password !!). The support agent (who was very patient and helpful) then arranged for a support call to me the following day at 9am and if not called that day, a call for the following day at 9am to see if there was a workaround for my password. No calls were ever received ! So frustrated was I after all these hours of support that culminated in finding the culprit was my password would need changing, I ended up changing it and reconfiguring my multiple devices. Having spent hours and determined to resolve this issue I feel Belkin/Wemo should give me a medal.

All good to this point. 2nd attempt try and succeed in installing WeMo app on my Nexus 10 my favorite go to toy for last several years. App installs no issues. Appears to work but does not allow me to install the WeMo mini plugs. Hangs up at the point of connecting to my router. Time for tech support. Round and round we go. Support is nice but does not go beyond my own attempts at installation. Finally decide all lost unless my wife's phone will work. LG phone and Nexus 10 are a bust. Netgear WNR2000V3 known to work with WeMo which is the router I am using. Round 2. Have wife's Motorola Razor HD and app installs along with devices in first try. Both new mini plugs setup and working. Then I checked Nexus 10 and both devices are setup correctly in it too out of the blue. Can control them with Alexa once it is setup for new WeMo devices. All working together. All working in harmony after 9 hours of my kind of playing around and pushing the boundaries. Tech's love to toy around new toys. Now I have control of 2 outlets in my basement without out stepping a foot on the stairs down to them. Motorola Razor HD, Nexus 10 , and Alexa app all controlling 2 WeMo mini plugins.

Setup a schedule using Wife's Motorola phone and it appears to be working just fine. Will repost if things change..
Wife's phone scheduling is working great. One thing is that you should avoid using names like room one, light one, and fan one if using Alexa App. The one seem to cause issues with Alexa knowing which decided to turn on.

D. Pellegrini,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2017","So far, so good. Out of the box setup was a little buggy. You are supposed to plug it in to any plug (I suggest you plug it in somewhere easy to get to while you are doing setup) - and when the light flashes white and amber - go to your cellphone, connect to its private wifi network - then load and run the app on your phone - which connects and steps you through setup - which is very brief (name the switch and connect to wifi).

I set up two of these. The first one hung twice trying to get it to connect - after some unplugging and re-plugging - and starting/restarting the app I finally got it to connect - entered my wifi info and we were away. It then did a firmware update for a couple of minutes and now seems to work like a champ.

The second one seemed to realize that I already entered my wifi criteria and skipped that step - nice touch.

I bought one of these to set a more complex timer for a collection of old cellphones I have on chargers. I only want them to charge 3 days a week, on off peak hours. It was easy to setup that schedule, and it seems to be working well so far. I will update this review if anything changes over time.

NOTE: These seem to work fine when away from the house as well - you don't have to have your phone on the same wifi network to use them.

UPDATE [26 March 2017] - Just added a third and switch to the house - and what a royal hassle - but still worth it for me in the end. Must have had to close/reopen the app and plug/unplug this thing more than 5 times before the setup stuck. I think it was working itself through multiple Firmware updates - perhaps why it was more bumpy this time around. I ended up annoyed - and walked away to do other things for perhaps 30-60 minutes. It seems to have sorted itself out in that time.

Another oddity - with 3 switches on my home network now - sometimes one or two of them won't come up as available when my phone is on our local wifi - but then suddenly do become available if turn off wifi, run over cellular and refresh. YMMV

Despite the somewhat poor / unstable implementation, I am essentially using these as advanced timer/switches - and they seem to work flawlessly for this. In a pinch you can USUALLY connect to them from afar to manually turn things on and off - but if this feature is critical to you, be warned - these are a little flaky.

FINAL UPDATE [27 May 2017] - We just upgraded to a Mesh wifi router system - and now all of my switches show up on wifi and when away. Our older router + access point was apparently part of the problem.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Richard H,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2018","I purchased two of the WeMo Mini Smart Plugs and initially they connected and worked well with my 6+ year old router. A few weeks ago I updated my router for improved performance and security. I have about two dozen smart devices in my home and I was able to connect all of them to my new router with little fuss, that is, with the exception of the two WeMo Smart Plugs. I worked for hours doing research and doing troubleshooting with success. I called WeMo (Belkin) Tech Support who spent a 1-2 hours with me on the phone. When the plugs didn't work using my phone as a hot spot to eliminate the new router it was determined that both devices were defective. Given an RMA # I paid the postage to return the devices for new ones. When the replacements arrived I still wasn't able to get them to connect to my Wi-Fi router. I sent an email with my case number to support explaining that the problems I was experiencing. They called me back in a timely manner and we spent two hours on the phone doing troubleshooting. We were able to get the WeMos connected using my phone as a Mobile Hotspot and was even able to do a firmware update. Still no luck connecting with my Wi-Fi router. I understand this will be escalated but after spending so many hours without any results I am pretty soured on the devices. Tech Support was pretty good although a bit difficult to understand but the product is a disappointment. I have much cheaper smart plugs from another OEM that have always worked well and easily migrated to the new router using their app; just selected the new router, entered the password and was done. I do not recommend these smart plugs.

Update 2/15/2018: So WeMo Tech Support quickly responded to my follow-up email about the problems I was having with the replacement devices. The problem had been escalated and it was determined that the reason the WeMo Minis couldn't connect to my WiFI was because there was a special character in the SSID of the router!!! The SSID was valid and posed no problems for any of the two dozen or so devices that use WiFi. I selected WeMo (Belkin) because I perceived them to be a big player and have had good experiences previously. I am astounded that any device they would produce would have such a basic and simple flaw that would prevent it from working. Moreover, even with the flaw, it should not take me hours on the phone with tech support before finding the problem. Apparently they were aware of the problem and working on a firmware update to fix it. So add that to the tech support script and include a notice in the packaging for the Mini. The problem is that it is inconceivable that something as simple as special (and permissible) characters in an otherwise valid SSID would not work properly. It speaks volumes about the lack of quality control and testing of their firmware. I'll keep these WeMos but no more Wemo/Belkin wireless products for me.

Another Update 2/15/2018: OK so I changed my SSID and did all of the other things WeMo support said needed to be done and the two Minis worked for a few minutes. When I took them upstairs to use them they would not connect!!! I brought the one I was trying to use and went through the whole setup process again 4-5 times and couldn't get the device to reconnect. I plugged in the second WeMo that was only in my pocket to go up and it wouldn't connect. Basically all I did was walk upstairs with it in my pocket, bring it back down and restarted the WeMo app. I am about beside myself about these things. I reset 4 Echo Dots, 2 Ecobee thermostats and 3 other smart switches in about 10 minutes before I got to trying to use the WeMos for the last hour!! I need to go reconnect everything else with the new SSID but I am done with the WeMos. They are garbage!!!! I might hang on to them to see if there is ever a firmware version that will actually work since I spent about $60 on them but then maybe not - need to sleep on it.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Entaka,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2019","::Update:: Used these for Christmas again - had to do setup again - same issues. Now trying to set them up again to use them for under cabinet lighting control and I am running out of patience. The UI / confirmation / HomeKit integration APPEARS better but both apps constantly tell me conflicting information about connection status - I can consistently get WeMo app to control the units eventually - but all I can accomplish is the devices showing up in homekit after multiple factory resets and updates. Look elsewhere for a HomeKit outlet - perhaps the new smaller ones are better - But i wont be investing.

TLDR - I picked one up on discount circa 15$. It worked - after some fiddling and updating - so I bought another - that one required more fiddling of a different degree but eventually worked. Mine are integrated with Homekit and function with Siri without issue.

The product would be 5 stars if the easy set up stuff worked right. Out of the box it seemed both of the ones I received were not updated to a firmware that was compatible with Homekit - one of them even gave me a ""uncertified homekit device"" or something if that nature, within the Homekit app - once updated - it was fine.

Connecting to a devices WiFi is not irregular for set up - Ring does the same thing (only ring does it 100x better). The issue is partly due to the devices only using 2.4ghz networks - which can be a crowded frequency already. One of the devices hung at the setup and kept erroring - until I put my phone directly next to the unit - then set up went fine and I was able to update and add it to Homekit - eventually.

The second one I installed kept saying ""maybe try a factory restore"" - I did not do that as the lights were still indicating correctly for setup. They both just took different degrees of closing apps, opening them, reconnecting to wifi, and eventually updating prior to using the ""easy setup"" homekit QR.

Setup needs to be done with the WeMo app so you can get to the point of updating the devices so they can work with Homekit. I am an electronics repair technician and CompTia certified PC tech with above average troubleshooting skills - and technological patience - if thats a thing. There is little in the way of comforting prompts along the setup - expect to spend some time assuming it is getting set up correctly if you make it to that point.

The device would be 5 stars at the price point I paid if the setup was actually straight forward - both devices had completely different issues getting setup - but work great now that they are. Something to note is the relay within them is also quite louder than I expected it to be - think motion detector light relay in the grocery store refrigerated section loud. Not that big of deal if you click it on and it stays on - but something to note as my Philips and Lutron Caseta stuff does not have any hardware sounds. Currently using them for a garland and my christmas tree and being able to turn them off when out of the house adds some peace of mind.

I cant speak to how these work with any other smart home system - but judging from the issue being the initial setup within the proprietary app - I would assume
functionality is the same across the ecosystems.

A. Schuhmann,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2020","TLTR: Great plugs, just don't ever change the name of your Wifi network ...

First, I love my Wemo smart plugs. I have them all over the house, 12 by now. They work great and are initially easy to set up ... until you change your WiFi network.
I got a new fast 5GHz internet connection. The Wemo mini unfortunately only supports 2.4 GHz ...
So I set up a 2.4 GHz network for the plugs, no problem, right? But wait, the 2.4 GHz network needs a new name. And this is where the trouble began. I had to reset each one of them. Now, the latest generation of Wemo mini has HomeKit codes. And you must scan this code to get anywhere. But the code is on the plug side of the Wemo mini, so to scan this code you must take the Wemo off the outlet. You cannot scan the code with the Wemo mini plugged in. And whenever you unplug it to scan ... guess what happens. It naturally loses connection and the setup fails. You also cannot set up this Wemo by just connecting to the network it creates, like you can with the older generations without HomeKit. The iPhone will not let you connect without trying to use the HomeKit setup ... The HomeKit code is also on the packaging they come in, but this doesn't help you when you have to reconnect them.
I ended up unplugging them, writing down the manual code for each one, using the setup button in the Wemo App to add the plug and typing the code in manually instead of scanning. Suffice to say that you have to set up from scratch and make sure you give it the same name again ... otherwise all your rules are useless.
Overall the reconnection of the Wemo minis with all the trial and error I went through cost me probably 2h and 5 years of my life. But once they are reconnected they work great again :D",4.0 out of 5 stars
C. Perry,"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2017","Overall the product is decent and delivers functionality based on the design. In general I consider myself rather savvy with regards to general computer knowledge and network configuration. I have my own custom network configuration at home with distinct wireless networks on various bands including separated guest network, etc. My current job is in the IT industry providing end user support. I only mention all of that for background purposes and whatever it is worth for credibility sake. Overall I would say the physical plug is good quality and fairly straightforward in terms of basic functions. Where the issues lie are really within the internal firmware and the associated software application.

The initial setup is where I experienced issues, as other reviewers have noted. Establishing a connection from the plug to the wireless network seemed to be the most problematic. It would occasionally fail to recognize any network in my home, I tried multiple both hidden and visible. Typically the software would indicate incorrect credentials and refused to establish a connection. I even returned the plug in exchange for another unit. That behaved in the same manner. I eventually was able to establish a connection through the software application but only after trying for an extended period. Unfortunately I cannot definitively say what steps were successful since I tried so many different paths. One thing I would mention is you may have to try repeatedly in the app, despite how frustrating.

I would also allow the app time to connect, it seems even if it indicates failure to connect, there were times it actually established a connection from the plug to the wireless network but gave a false feedback. Indicating it had failed to connect. In my opinion the software app needs some improvement and is not as robust as is needed for this type of product. The plug itself has worked fine ever since the setup was successfully completed. I have been able to use the app to control the plug, as well as integrate with Amazon Alexa for voice control.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Trusted Reviewer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2017","This review is for the Wemo Mini Smart Plug.
I bought it on a whim, it was an Alexa deal on Prime Day and I had been wanting to try a home automation device with Alexa. I thought this device would be a good introduction to that technology, and it is.
It was very easy to set up: download the app, plug it in, connect directly to the device via WiFi, then open the app and it walks you through step by step and even updates the firmware on the device automatically. Setting up the Alexa skill was just as intuitive.
Then it worked just as expected.
The only problem I have with this type of device is that I'm finding that I don't really have an application for it, as almost nothing I own will turn on simply by applying power to it. Almost everything in my home has digital controls: my coffee pot requires that you press a button to turn on after it's plugged and it's digital controls so there's no way to leave it in the on position. Same with 2 tower fans I own, my crockpot, etc...
In fact the only thing I can think of it controlling is a simple lamp, but in my home the only 2 lamps we use are controlled by a wall switch, so that didn't quite work out either.... Just something to think about if you're considering a Smart Plug.
I'm sure it won't be long before Amazon (and other manufactures) start making appliances (fans, coffee pots, etc...) with this technology built in, then it will really be useful.
That said, it does work as described, so if you have an simple device that will turn on as soon as power is applied this could be useful.",4.0 out of 5 stars
David L.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2020","I purchased 2 older Wemo mini smart plugs in 2018. They were easy to set up and worked well, and their wi-fi had great range. So when I needed another smrt plug, I ordered another Wemo mini. This is a newer model, and setting it up using an iPhone requires use of Apple Home. I found the setup very difficult.

First, setup requires scanning a HomeKit code on the plug. The code is hidden when the Wemo is plugged into a wall. So you have to unplug the Wemo, scan the code, plug it back in, and wait for the Wemo to boot up. After repeating this process several times, I connected the Wemo to an extension cord, so I could scan the code while it was plugged in.

I tried to avoid using HomeKit by selecting the option in the Wemo iPhone app that is used for older plugs that don't support HomeKit. The instructions say to connect the iPhone to a separate wi-fi network that is created by the Wemo. As soon as I did that, the Wemo was recognized by my iPhone as a HomeKit device, and launched the Apple Home app to complete configuration. I was unable to configure the Wemo without using HomeKit.

Initially the configuration via HomeKit failed with a message ""This device is not compatible with your wi-fi network"". The self-help in the Wemo app suggested resetting the Wemo and trying again. That didn't help. A search of the web revealed that this error occurs when your house has separate wifi networks for 2.4ghz and 5 ghz, and your phone is connected to the 5ghz network. The Wemo only supports 2.4ghz, and your phone must also be connected to the 2.4ghz network for HomeKit configuration to work. Once I did that I was able to complete configuration of the Wemo. Unfortunately, the Wemo app was unable to see my newly configured plug, even though it was visible in the Home app. I did one more reset of the Wemo, deleted it from Home, reconfigured again, and this time is showed up in the Wemo app. All of this took a couple of hours, and was much more frustrating than it should be.

Once configured, the Wemo smart plug works great, just like the old ones. So I would give it 1 star for setup, and 5 stars for how it works after finally completing setup.",3.0 out of 5 stars
JO is my Name-O,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2018","I'm just getting into the whole connected home thing and so it was time to integrate a smart plug so I can control lighting around my house either by voice or via Alexa. I selected this Wemo over the other smart plugs for a couple of reasons: 1) It only takes up one plug on the outlet (larger smart plugs take up the entire outlet yet only provide for one outlet) and 2) It doesn't require a separate hub to work with either my phone or Alexa.

I purchased two and went to work setting them up around the house. One design flaw of all of these smart plugs, including this one, is that they plug in the front instead of the side, top or bottom. This makes the plug long a bit clunky to hide behind furniture. One way around this is to pair the plug with a Flat Plug extension cord to make things a little thinner if you're installing behind a piece of furniture.

Setup is simple. After you download the app, connect to the ad-hoc wifi to then connect the smart plug to your network. Then, simply name the plug and then associate it with Alexa. There's no separate hub that is required to make the lights work and the app doesn't carry a fee to use it. My favorite feature is ""Away Mode"", which allows the lights to turn on and off on schedule like an old fashioned timer. Also, unlike a timer, the switch can be bypassed by pressing the button on the outlet if talking to Alexa isn't opportune or your phone isn't nearby.

While I wouldn't hook something high wattage up to anything I couldn't personally monitor, I do trust this plug to turn the lights on and off in the house as requested without issue. With that being said, I'm ordering more plugs to expand the capability.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Drew's Reviews,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2021","I have been using SmartHome devices for over 10 years and have watched this category grow and change in incredible ways over that time. Many of the changes have been consumer driven while some have been manufacturer driven.

Nearly all SmartHome items work solely using 2.4 GHz. This signal travels farther (covering a larger area) but is not as fast (internet speed) as 5.0 GHz. This makes it perfectly suited for SmartHome applications. Nearly every WiFi router broadcasts in at minimum both of these frequencies. If you have the networks split, named different names, you’ll need to make sure your phone is connected to the 2.4 GHz network during setup.

In terms of this product I’ve absolutely loved it. Over the last few months I have thoroughly tested it and found that it has worked flawlessly. I have used WeMo brand outlets for years and have always found them solid, dependable Smart outlets. The app is well designed and the outlet is easy to setup and integrates well with all other devices.

This is an all around excellent product that I have had zero issues with and would definitely recommend.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Jean Farmer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2017","Previous to this I've been using iHome smart plugs but have had issues in the past with iHome losing connection and having to unplug and replug them in. I decided to switch over to Wemo Smart Plugs instead when I wanted to add a few more outlets. What I like about them is that they are stackable, you can have multiple in an outlet. I mostly use these on power strips and not directly in an outlet but they still work the same depending on the direction your outlets go on the power strip. The setup was a breeze. I had it plugged in and on the network and Alexa controlled in under 5 minutes. Super simple. Getting a firmware update was also easy, the Wemo app on my phone took care of it all. The integration with Alexa (I use the Echo Dots around the house) was superb. It never fails to work and I appreciate that a great deal. I was lucky to get them on sale so the price was also unbeatable. All around I am exceedingly pleased with these smart plugs.

If you are using Alexa it is great, because you can setup as many groupings as you like and include whatever assortment of plugs you want. I have a grouping for ""first floor"" and ""downstairs"" both of which are the same grouping of outlets from the first floor of the house. I make multiple groups to try and account for whatever I think someone in the family will say when they are trying to control the lights or fans. My groupings include a mix of Wemo and iHome outlets and Alexa is perfectly fine with that and controls them just the same with zero delay. I love that. I can say turn off a single light or turn off the living room or turn off the first floor and it responds in a second or two and does what I asked. I could not be more pleased with how easy these work.

The Wemo smart plug has been super solid for me so I ordered another one to expand my control. I would recommend them. I've only had this brand for a month but so far zero issues and super easy to use. Set it and forget about it really.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Erik Noren,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2019","The setup process was error prone and took a lot of Googling to figure out that the first problem was that the plugs didn’t like WiFi passwords with special characters. My WiFi router has two bands so they’re on the low and now far less secure band while all my other devices are on the high band. This seems to cause trouble with the WeMo app which most of the time reports the plugs as unresponsive until I switch my WiFi to the same network and then there’s a small chance the plugs will get picked up.

I was able to add them to my Echo fairly easily once they were set up but they would go unresponsive randomly and now for weeks they haven’t been accessible at all through it. Connecting to Apple Home failed on one of the three plugs I set up and left the it in a state where the WeMo app thought it was connected but Apple Home didn’t list it. More Googling before I finally tried a full reset on the plug and set it up again and then it worked. Now the only app that works consistently is Apple Home and that still has glitches where the devices will be unresponsive for a bit and I have to wait for them to come back online to turn them on or off.

The button on the plug to turn toggle power manually is a nice fallback but the purpose of the plugs was to make less-accessible light fixtures more easily controllable. All this did was move the switch from the light itself to the outlet which is harder to reach. At this point the only reason I’m still using them is because I paid money for them and they do give me more flexibility when they’re working right and I have hope of a firmware update coming out to fix these issues (if I can get the WeMo app to notice them again in order to update them that is). If they stopped working altogether I don’t think I’d miss them or even replace them; I’d just be mad I spent money on them in the first place.",3.0 out of 5 stars
PicklePower,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2017","The Mini Smart Plug is awesome, when it works. I have sent 3 emails to the Wemo customer service with no response. In order for this plug to work I have to constantly un-plug device, forget it on my phone, then plug it back in and start the initial install for my phone to find it. The first initial install went very smoothly with no problems and I was up and running with-in minutes.
The next day came into the office and used my phone to turn the device on (I have a desk lamp plugged into it) the light came on, everything was fine. After about 2 hours the light turned off, and I noticed that the Wemo light was blinking, no color just the ""white"" light to let you know the product is working. I went through the trouble shooting suggestions and nothing worked. So I unplugged the Wemo plug and the light from that and plugged the Wemo back in. I had my phone forget the device and reinstalled the Wemo device and everything was fine, or so I thought. I turned off the light.
The next day when I went to turn the light on again the light on the Wemo was blinking White and the device was not found on my phone. So I sent an email to the company explaining the issue that I was having. I went through the steps again of unplugging, having my phone forget the Wemo and reinstall it again. Again, Wemo worked as it should, until I shut it off, the only way I could the stupid thing to work was to keep un-installing the Wemo. This has been on going since I bought this thing, I have sent no less than 3 emails to the company asking for at least a return email to give me the illusion that they cared. Nothing!! and still to this day if I want the stupid thing to work, I have to forget the device, maybe that is the way the company hints to the buyer as to how technical issues will be resolved, just forget that you bought the device.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Shane W.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2018","The Good:
The great thing about this is that you don't need to buy all these expensive hubs and the like in order for this thing to work. Originally, I thought hey, it's worth checking it out and seeing what it's like. The plan was to use this for a lamp that we normally turn on when away, but seeing how great it is and all the options and timers and so on... I was like why not set the lamp that my grandma turns on and off everyday from sunset until bedtime. She has limited mobility and it's hard for her reach the switch, so this is great!!! What's even better based on your location it will calculate when sunset is and would turn on the light automatically.

The app is very easy to use. (And I believe no internet connection is needed if you want to access it locally). With WiFi (no hubs or any extra devices needed), you can access from anywhere.

Also works with Apple Home and quite a few others.

The cons:
It was a little troublesome setting up the outlet with Apple Home. You have limited accessibility. But, the good thing is we have a 4th gen Apple TV which you can use as a hub for all the smart devices (you can also use an iPad that is usually home as a hub as well). The trouble of course was on Apple's restrictions rather than this device itself.

Tips:
If you're connecting this with Apple Home, make sure the devices (i.e. iPad, Apple TV, or Apple speaker) have the same iCloud login for set up. (My dad was logged into the Apple TV, hence the connectivity problem).

Using an Apple TV or iPad is not required, but if you have one might as well set it up. If set up via Apple Home with the extra at home Apple device serving as a hub, you can set rules for which devices to turn on and off depending on time of day, your location, when someone from the family arrives home, or when the last person leaves, the lights can be configured to turn on or off.

I only received it yesterday, so hopefully it will continue to work! I think it was worth the ""investment risk.""",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amz Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2023","Wanna know what’s great about this? You don’t have to use their app. It just pairs directly through HomeKit and over thread so no WiFi issues and no connectivity nonsense and needing to be on 2.4 or 5Ghz or whatever. This works well because Wemo has absolutely nothing to do with its functionality. They made something with technology that their users don’t have to interact with their software which makes this priceless. Their previous smart plugs, despite working with HomeKit as well, were so unbelievably terrible I had a hard time understanding how Belkin (a pretty well known company) was letting such garbage leave their factory.

This solves all of those problems because it just doesn’t rely on anything they make software wise. Or even hardware to be honest. This having Thread solves all the issues.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Vlad R,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2017","You don't realize how useful these devices can be until after you've formed certain habits and have grown to rely on the automation and other home control features. Currently, I control most of my lights, one small space heater and an electric teapot using the voice commands with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. I've been using smart plugs from other brands before, but I've recently switched to WeMo for three main reasons: 1) IFTTT integration, 2) Google's ""Home Control"" and Amazon's Alexa ""Smart Home"" and 3) these plugs do not block the second outlet above or below it. The ability to control each plug using the voice command or Wemo's native App is nice, but in my experience I get the most out of these devices through various integration and automation. Here are a few examples:

> When motion is detected by my Oco2 camera in the main entry way, the hallway lights are turned on automatically. (Requires: WeMo Smart Plug, IFTTT, Oco2 camera)

> Every morning turn on the space heater in the bathroom and turn it off after 30 minutes (Requires: WeMo Smart Plug, WeMo App for scheduling)

> When my car's ignition is turned on in the parking lot by my apartment, turn off all lights, arm the alarm, turn on cameras (Requires: WeMo Smart Plug, IFTTT, AutoMatic Pro, Oco2 camera, Scout Alarm system)

With the Google Home control as well as Alexa smart home feature, I've create a group of lights called ""Living Room"". Using one simple ""Hey Google, turn on lving room"" command, I can turn them all on (and off) at once. (Same thing can be done with the Echo's Alexa command). Using the similar ""Alexa, turn on the teapot"" command, I can get my teapot to boil water just using my voice.

As time goes by, I'm sure I'll create even more automation ""recipes"". On the other hand I recently realized that I may rely on those too much, as one day when I had an outage with my internet service, I had to actually *gasp* walk up to the outlet and physically push its button. Perhaps it's a good thing; I could alway use some exercise.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Tim,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2017","Definitely a step up from the previous Wemo smart plug. Not only is it smaller making it able to be used in either the top or bottom of the outlet, but it seems to react faster. I have a smart plug that I purchased about 2-1/2 years ago and it frequently has issues updating the firmware. This new ""mini"" hasn't had those issues. As usual with Wemo stuff, the setup is quite painless using my Android phone (takes all of 4-5 minutes total, if even that).

Personally, I prefer the WiFi controlled outlets to Zigbee and z-wave ones. Probably because most of my other smart home devices are one of the two protocols and it's nice to balance things out. Ok, price is a factor... These are frequently a more reasonable price than the zigbee or z-wave versions.

Wemo is nice if you don't have a zigbee or z-wave hub because LOTS of other devices support it directly (like Alexa and IFTTT). I have SmartThings, and that's what I control all my Wemo devices with. Within the last few versions of SmartThings, Wemo devices became ""natively"" supported rather than requiring a ""labs"" SmartApp. Stability has much improved over the updates to SmartThings (not sure how much of that has been Wemo updates too), and I have had no issues with them in a very long time.

I do not use the Wemo rules to control my devices. Every time I've tried, something doesn't work right, so I only use the Wemo app to apply updates and add new devices. This is the reason for the 1 missing star. I wish these could automatically update themselves during non-peak hours.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Lloyd,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2020","I have several of these and they work well. I just wanted to highlight an issue I ran into when setting one of them up. I have two wireless networks in my home and by my mistake the one to which I was connected on my phone when I set up the Wemo wasn't the one I wanted it on. I spent a couple of hours following the steps for resetting the device with no success. It kept reverting to the wrong network no matter what I did, even though Wemo's support site says you should be able to assign it to a different network. I then had a 45-minute call with Wemo tech support. They also couldn't make it connect to the other network, and had me return it for replacement. I don't know if the problem was just this one unit, but I strongly suggest you make sure what network your phone or tablet is connected to when you set up the Wemo to avoid such a problem.

Although my dual wi-fi may not be common, I believe the same problem would have occurred with any change in the wi-fi setup; for example, installing a new router, maybe even simply renaming the existing networks. The setup apps for all my other smart devices show available wi-fi networks, which makes it easy to select the one you want and easy to change it to another one in the future. The Wemo app needs to do this, not select the network on its own and not have a simple way to change it to something else later.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"DGC, MO","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2019","I'm not a happy camper....The unit will not recognize my home network. None of the other wireless devices in my home have any problem. I have followed all the directions and compensatory actions provided with the plug, as well as reading through the comment section here for other tricks to try. Well, I've tried them all. In addition to the physical product not working, the software application is cumbersome. I have had to enter my email address no less than two dozen times, since each time you attempt to 'find' your network, you have to enter your email address. It is VERY frustrating to keep going through the same steps over and over with an unsatisfactory result... I question why Amazon would bundle this obviously lacking product with their Echo. It does not reflect well upon them. Another buyer warning, ""Buyer beware!!""
Update: I was contacted by customer service via email with further recommended actions. These did not work, so I answered back via email and they responded with a phone call. Final solution: Using my wife's phone to set up a hot spot, I updated the firmware on the Wemo device with my phone. Once updated, it was able to identify my wireless network. From there it was easily set up to work with Alexa. I've adjusted the rating from one star to four. I'm probably being gracious due to the hassle, but the overall function is what I was desiring and the technician was helpful and patient, proving a workable solution.",4.0 out of 5 stars
LogiP,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2019","UPDATE as of Jul 2019
After upgrading wifi routers (tri-band mimo) and new firmware releases for smart plug, decided to try again since it's good price point for HomeKit plug. Now changing review to 4 stars. Plug no longer seems to have same issues mentioned below and setup worked on first try. Interesting. Ordered a few more plugs so we'll see if this is fluke or change in quality. Fingers crossed.

-----Original Review----
Bought this as test switch to start migrating from Z-wave to Homekit. Would only connect when in direct line of sight with main router. I have access points all over house but it did not care for any of them. WeMo App vs Homekit setup was also not clear per instructions. Trial and error and resets finally did the job (hope you're techie!) Finally able to connect to network and switch worked. Moved switch to other room and replaced Z-wave device with switch. Connection was working off and on (more off than on), but stupid switch would NOT stop broadcasting wifi. Would be at home and phone would connect to stupid switch! Missed many things on phone that week plus other parts of network began to have issues where things would connect to stupid switch automatically. No amount of trouble shooting online (firmware update, power cycling, hard resets with specific setup, special network ip assignments, etc.) would prevent broadcasting by this stupid switch and having things connect to it. Finally gave up and had to return. Sad since it's good design and was good price. Will stick with Z-wave a little while longer.",4.0 out of 5 stars
D and R,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2018","I'm still sticking to my WeMo setup.. just not sure I'll invest more money in to the ecosystem. It's a great concept and remote control/timers is super convenient... WHEN IT WORKS.

New users may want to second guess themselves before going ""all-in"" on an IOT device. I own 7 WeMo devices: 2 dimmers, 3 switch, 4 plugs. Belkin support website was not super helpful. Hope these tips below help you out.

ISSUE 1: KRACK vulnerability firmware update
-This wreaked COMPLETE havoc on my WeMo setup. This *almost* made me rip out all the plugs and devices. It made remote control unusable.
-Plugs updated firmware across 2 weeks. I had to 'hard-reset' ALL DEVICES after each time update a single device updated.
-When going through setup, repeatedly got the infamous ""Password invalid"" when connecting to WiFi. It is NOT you. You are typing in the password correctly. I tried both Android and iOS phones to setup my devices. The solution? Try again in a couple hours. Magic.

ISSUE 2: Migrating to a new router and 'multicast nightmare'
After the KRACK debacle I got my setup stable again. Then, I had to replace my router. I haven't figured out which was responsible, but I had to reboot my router almost daily:
*HomeKit/AirPrint/Bonjour was usable for only an hour after a reboot
*WeMo App would always show as 'Not Connected' when connected to same WiFi. Sometimes work if I use over LTE-only.

How I Fixed:
- Belkin says ""Don't use same WiFi name. It's true, WeMo doesn't like same WiFi name from 2 different routers""
- On Asus Router:
--- Enable Enable IGMP Snooping for 2.4G and 5G wireless
--- Optimized for XBox / BG Protection
--- Set 2.4G 'Control Channel' to '11'

ISSUE 3: One of Wemo Mini Smart Plugs have died after 4 months. I used it for a water kettle rated at 1000w. The Smart Plug is supposed to handle 1800w. Going to have to reach out to Belkin support.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Richard S,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2017","These plug switches have been very frustrating. They work for a few days then stop showing up in the app (both the Android one and the iOS one!). Sometimes they seem to work great and other times, they don't, I can't figure out a pattern. It's not my wifi network, I have 4 commercial grade APs around my house in a full mesh so there's nowhere that I don't have a strong signal. We don't lose pwer either, so I don't know why they seem to fall off the network. There have been multiple firmware updates for them but it doesn't seem to have fixed the stability problems. I would probably return these if I could but I've had them too long. I have one behind my lizard cage to run the day time light, so to recover the switch and get it back on the network I have to move the cage, which isn't small! It's a pain in the butt to deal with, however the switch does seem to follow it's programming and turn on/off at the right times even when it shows as unavailable in the app, so it does seem to be doing the right things.

One other thing to note. If you use iOS with an iPad, the only app in the App Store is the phone version. There is no tablet version of the app. You can run the phone version but it will be on a phone sized screen (or 2x if you hit the enlarge button), but it won't rotate with the orientation of the tablet. It's fine if you have an iPhone (don't know about the X or other new high-res screens though). I use an Android phone (Note 8 running 7.1.1) and it mostly works, except when it shows the devices are not detected. This can happen with the Wemo light switch too, so I don't know if this is an App problem or a device (ioT) problem. Whatever it is, it sucks and is very frustrating. Tech support isn't any help either, so don't bank on them solving your problem unless you have a basic problem.

2/18/19: update - these things are so frustrating, I would not recommend them to anyone! A power outage hits us 2-3 times a year, we just had one, lasting 8 hours (a lot longer than the usual). Neither of the 2 Wemo Mini Smart plugs came back onto the network... the stupid orange flashing light of death. I had to perform the ""hold button and plug in"" reset to recover them.... again. They then wanted to do an upgrade and I started that and they died again... flashing orange light, no network connection. In case you think it's my network, I run a multi-AP network, using 4 Ubiquiti AP-AC devices with a dedicated controller. I've done a signal strength mapping around the house and these are well inside a strong signal area. They are not reliable.

5/15/19: I'm done with these. Had another power outage over the weekend (lasted 20 mins) and the one remaining until didn't come back online until I did a factory reset and had it rejoin my wireless network. I just don't understand how a company can sell such a junky product. I've ordered replacement Amazon smart plugs to replace all the Wemo plugs. Support on these it terrible and the product is unreliable. I'm not going to waste any more time with these. I've been running the Amazon plug in parallel and it hasn't had any of the same problems",1.0 out of 5 stars
Jordan R.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2019","I read one review that talks about needing to scan the barcode on the back to the plug AFTER you plug it in... that's totally correct, I don't understand how they expect you to do that unless you attach it to an extension cord or something with a low enough profile just for setup... I don't get it.

That said, I have purchased and tried all three of the primary available plugs for Homekit, I also use Alexa around the house so consistent dual-assistant compatibility is important to me. I can say that out of the three options, WeMo has been the most consistent by far. I also happen to have power flashes 2-3 times a week, and unlike my iHome plugs that I'm currently replacing, the WeMo tend to go back to their function without issue. I do understand how some feel the WeMo APP is clunky and unintuitive, but both Homekit and Alexa seem to understand where the plug is and what I want it to do even if WeMo doesn't seem sure, so other than setup I don't really bother with the App.

I should also note that I've been using the WeMo plugs (and switch for my porch lights) since Homekit required a bridge, so I've never bothered to stop using it. Additionally I have an Echo Plus in my setup which may help with connectivity and reliability. But in any case these have been my most solid performer to the point I'm replacing my remaining smart plugs with them.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Hummingbirds,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2017","UPDATE 3/25/18: Back to 1 star. We now have 7 Wemos.. some dimmer switches, some plugs. After finally getting them all working fine, we noticed there were constant firmware updates EVERY SINGLE DAY. Well one update COMPLETELY TRASHED all of our Wemos!!!!!!!! Because after our power went out briefly today, none of the Wemos will connect to WiFi now!!! They are blinking red, and not detected in the app. So now HOW do we get a firmware fix if there is one, since they can't connect to WiFi?!? They are USELESS now!!! I wish I had all the money back that I spent on all 7 of these. They were too expensive to begin with!

UPDATE (1/28/17): Rating changed from 1 star to 3 stars. For original review, please read below. Here is my updated review.
After returning the first unit and receiving the second one, I found it was still a beast to set up. However, when it finally did connect to the wi-fii, and the firmware was updated, it worked and stayed connected! It has not experienced the disconnect issue that the last one had since successful firmware update. I am glad to see they presumably fixed the issue. So I give it 3 stars now since it was still very difficult to initially set up, and the app (only on certain devices) would not show the ""Hidden Network"" option. I had to use a tablet which was the only device
I had that actually showed that option in the app. But this new one works as expected now.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I have successfully set up and use FOUR (4) of the original v1 WeMo smart plugs. So my review is based on my extensive experience with these, as well as knowledge of networking (as an IT professional). I tried setting up this new style v2 WeMo plug and had nothing but issues. It just would not connect to our wi-fi. The same wi-fi the other WeMo plugs are connected and work great with. I tried setting it up right next to the router, so distance was not an issue. I tried multiple times resetting it to factory defaults, and re-entering the router SSID & password. Still that amber light kept blinking. I actually got it to connect one time after trying for about 3 hours. Then I get a popup in the app about a firmware update. OK, so I tell it to update, and BOOM, the thing gets stuck in the middle of updating. I let it go overnight, and the next morning it's still stuck, and now won't connect again. I'm sorry, but this v2 WeMo has MAJOR problems, and from reading reviews it doesn't appear that it's just mine. I ended up sending this back. I might decide to give it a try again at some point in the future after they iron all the bugs out, because I do like the size of this device. It fits nicely into the outlet and allows for another plug in the outlet above/below it. So for the asthetics I give it one star. Other than that, it was just a major fail for me. If do I buy another one, though, I will definitely update this review with my experience with that one.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Tan68,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2020","I chose WEMO because I respected the parent company. I bought my first plug this past spring and had difficulty setting it up. During the setup process, ""location"" was presented as an option. I opted out of providing my location. After quite a time passed, I realized I would not be able to complete set-up with location disabled. Why present me with an option I can not feasibly exercise? (by location, they mean GPS and not selection of time zone or ZIP Code) A few months later, I bought a second WEMO and during the set-up process learned that I must now create an account. An account is a new security feature. WEMO did allow me to opt out of email ads and does not yet require a phone number.

The WEMO plugs are fairly easy to add and set up. There is a click when the switch is turned on or off. It is very audible but isn't an annoying type of click... It is possible to turn the plug on using the hardware switch on the WEMO itself and then have it turn off after any pre-set period of time.

umeweall,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2017","I have had this nifty little device now, in operation, for a little over three weeks. I had no issues with configuration for my Wemo. I have likewise had no problem with WiFi connection problems (I do have a very good, not cheapo, wireless router ). I have my Wemo linked into my Alexa device, and I use voice commands to control them. I also use the Alexa app to control lights, when I am away from home. I have had no issues, in any aspect.

One item I will mention is that if you use a Wemo to control a light switch in a room, there could be a partial inconvenience. If the light that you are controlling is tied into a wall on/off switch, you lose control of the light from that wall switch. The only way to turn the light on then is by manually pushing the button on the switch, or telling Alexa (if you have Alexa ) to turn the light on, or finally by using the Wemo app. If you are using Alexa, and Alexa is not in the room, Alexa is gone when you shut the door. You are then left with a manual turn on of the light, or using the Wemo application on your phone. In a kid's room, this is an issue. Even in an adult's room, having to manually turn the light on, or grab your phone to turn the light on will get tiring after a while. If the wall plug with the Wemo device is behind something, that just leaves the phone to turn the light on. If your phone has a dead battery, oh well.... You need to thing about where you want your lights controlled, and what happens when the door to the room is shut, with occupants inside, who need to turn the light on/off from inside of their room. How do they do it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
cg,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2017","So far, so good! I've had my Wemo Mini Smart Plug for a few days now. It was easy to set up, and so far, has done exactly what I've told it to do.

I bought only the one plug just to test it out and see if it is truly a piece of technology that would work for me. It is plugged into an entryway wall socket and I've plugged a lamp into it. I've schedule the lamp to turn on and off at certain times during the weekdays to coincide with my morning and evening schedule. Before I get up in the morning, the light comes on so that I don't have to stumble around in the dark. About the time I leave for work, it turns itself off. Now I have one less thing to try and remember as I scramble out the door to work. In the evenings, it is scheduled to turn on around the usual time I arrive home from work, so that I don't have to stumble around in the dark when I get home either. And since it is easily programmable, I can change this setting as the days get longer.

So far, there are no ""cons"" to the device. I can control this one outlet using my smart phone, which I think will be helpful. For instance, if I get in bed without shutting the light off manually, then I can pick up my phone and shut it off remotely. Another ""pro"" is that the device really does only take up one socket, allowing me to continue using the second socket for whatever I need it for.

Do I plan on purchasing more? Yes. There are a couple more electrical devices that I would like to have remote control over. I'm also intrigued by the other Wemo wi-fi controlled products, especially the ones that replace regular light switches.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I'm a very technical person, I have installed Schlage Sense Smart Deadbolt, Chamberlain Garage Door Opener, LIFX Lights, Sonos One, and of course Amazom Echo Show and Spot in our home to name a few. I use an Orbi 2 Satelite Mesh System to run WiFi throughout our home. Our WiFi Strength is so strong I get a signal at the furthest distance from the Orbi way in my backyard I have an older Belkin WeMo Insight Switch Smart Plug which although was a little quirky setting it up and establishing a connection, I was able to get it to work eventually. It took a couple of times and resets but since then it has worked without any problems. Even if power is lost it reconnects again when the power returns.

NOT this Wemo Mini. I bought 2 of them and after 1 1/2 hours of trying I could not get either one of them to be recognized and connect to my WiFi Network. Yes, I did all of the trouble shooting you can imagine. I Reset them to the Factory Defaults, Deleted the Wemo App (iPhone Version - I'm using the iPhone 7 Plus with the most current OS) and reinstalled the App. I restarted my iPhone. I turned off Cellular Data, I plugged them into different outlets in my home, in fact 3 feet away from my Router and Orbi.... NOTHING. At first the set up seemed to be going smoothly, I found the device under my WiFi Settings, selected it and then went through the next steps in the Wemo App. I entered a name for the device, entered my email address as required, selected my WiFi Network and then nothing. It just keeps saying it's connecting but it never does. Sometimes at this point the App just quits.

I know how usless Belkin Tech Support is so I wouldn't even bother to call them, I'm more tech savvy then they are. But I did go to their Support Forum and YES these Wemo Mini Smart Plugs are plagued with issues. Mostly just like I'm experiencing. For the lucky few who actually finally got them to connect, after hours of trying, it wasn't for long. If power was lost they would not reconnect and the process had to be started all over again. For others they would not keep a connection, they'd work for a while and then stop. Some folks the device wouldn't even appear in the App. The list of issues went on and on.

Thre trouble shooting page on Belkins web site has a long list of things to do if you can't get them to work.. REALLY Belkin you know of the many issues and you can't fix the problem. Oh they will gladly take your information and get you to a ""Level 2 Specialist"" who know less then you do! Oh an apparently it has been noted on their web site that different production runs of the Wemo Mini will have differnt results. OMG!

Anyway, I sent these back to Amazon for a full refund. I hope I save some people from having to waste their time and the aggravation with a product that just does not work as it should, especially for what they cost! I once really like them but I'm done with Belkin!",1.0 out of 5 stars
pls,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2022","I got one of these to control an air condition that was located in a very inconvenient location. Getting to the Wemo required moving stuff around, getting a ladder and climbing up to it.

When I first got this smart plug, any short power failure would knock the Wemo off line and require a reset and redoing the setup procedure to recover it. I was climbing the ladder every few weeks. After several months of this, Wemo updated the firmware and greatly reduced this happening. I was now climbing the ladder 2-3 times a summer. Much better. That's where things stayed for a while.

This year I got a new Android phone and used the Android utility to transfer data to the new phone. It transferred the Wemo app, but when I ran the app, it showed the air conditioner Wemo as disabled.

I have a script on my Windows computer that can scan for active Wemo smart plugs and control thim. This found the Wemo and could control it.

The Wemo app has a function to scan for active Wemo devices and add them to the app. This function has never worked and didn't work this time. Wemo tech support told me to reset the smart plug and go through the setup process.

That was the end of my patience with the unreliable device. The next time I'm climbing the ladder it will be to replace the Wemo with something more reliable. I'm done with it.

In summary, this is a fine device if it is easy to reset and redo the setup as you will need to do so regularly. If doing this is difficult or you don't want to deal with the need to regularly recover the device, then this Wemo is definitely NOT RECOMMENDED. Get something else.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Deborah/Martin,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2019","I bought two of these, and they worked great so I bought three more. And then they quit working. The app can no longer find the devices. I'm a pretty tech-savvy guy, but I've spent literally hours scouring the forums for answers to all these questions: Why won't the firmware update when it tells me I need to, but spins and spins and spins? Why can't I reset a device they way Wemo says I ought to? Why does it tell me there's no internet when all my other devices say there is? I've reset devices, and uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times. By the way, when you do this, it tells you to update the firmware (see debacle above), and provides no way to back out of the update's endless, pointless loop of doom. They also recommend ridiculous fixes like reconfiguring routers, etc. WTF? Are you guys serious? I should have to be a wifi wizard to use what's supposed to be a consumer product.

My recommendation? Switch to TP-Link with the KASA app. It works great! I've got 7 or 8 devices going now and have never had a single issue. I've been holding off buying more because I foolishly convinced myself I could make the Wemo work. Why can TP-Link figure out what Belkin can't? But I'm done now. $150 goes into the trash tonight.

UPDATE 4-20
I contacted Belkin after they responded to my review. They scheduled a tech call and walked me through resetting the app. The call took 25 minutes, and the tech was very courteous. The fix is one I hadn't encountered online after endless searching: for Android, go to Settings - Apps - Wemo - Storage - Clear Data and reboot. I'm upgrading my rating from one star to 3. You still shouldn't have to go through all this, but Belkin's response impressed me.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Pete D,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2017","We recently purchased a new house which does not have overhead lighting in every room yet. We were constantly leaving on of the floor lamps on in our office and decided it was bet to purchase a timer like I had on the lights in my house when I was a kid. Timers were around $10, and this Wemo showed up in the list for $30. We decided to give it a try.

Setup was super easy, pretty much the same process as setting up an Echo. You are asked to download an app, plugin the Wemo, connect your wifi to the Wemo, and run through the setup process. After you run the install, the Switch works by either pressing the button on the unit or the button on the app. I then adjusted the timer and schedule functions to turn the light on automatically at the times that we use the Office.

Even with just these features, the Wemo was already beyond worth the money. However, I went on to open the Alexa app and have Alexa search for the Outlet, again a simple setup. After this quick setup, I can now tell Alexa to turn on or off the Office light and she instantly makes the change.

With Alexa and the timer running the light, I am now determined to automate the rest of my house. I will be purchasing several of these as well as a few wall switches to control the other rooms. This is truly a Gateway product to Full home automation.

Bonus: You can also Use IFTTT.com to set up rules to trigger the light to turn on based on other events happening such as getting an email or posting on Facebook, etc. The trigger works the other way too where you can actually log every time that the light is turned on in a spreadsheet.",5.0 out of 5 stars
P. Holt,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2019","If you're an Apple Home / HomeKit user, do not purchase WiFi devices (such as this one). WiFi devices *will absolutely* work, but are another level of setup. Apple HomeKit is clearly designed to favor Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices - such as those from Elgato. If you are used to the simplicity of iOS, consider yourself warned. :)

However, BLE honestly makes sense as with BLE, you are making a direct connection to the device whereas with WiFi you are working through a proxy. Same with Android, I'm sure, but I do not own any Android devices. The executive summary is to search out BLE devices instead of WiFi devices. BLE has a range of 100M which should suffice for > 98% of homes - even with electronic and structural interference. In short, BLE is the future for closed-circuit home devices.

Other than that - and after jumping through some hurdles (circa Q1 2019) that most will not be confident with - this device is solid with HomeKit. It works both local and remote (assuming you have an iPad / AppleTV that can act as a hub when remotely operating).

Ease of setting up this WiFi device with iOS (and probably any mobile OS): 1 star

Functionality: 5 stars

Reliability: 5 stars

Low maintenance? Look for BLE devices, which will become much more common. Low short-term price? Buy this and, after some frustration, be happy. My money will go toward BLE from here forward.

UPDATE: I own two of these and they have been flawless with HomeKit over the last three months. 2,400 sq ft main level with three Apple TVs on the network. Programmable on/off always works. No complaints. Would buy again. Review upgraded from 3 to 5 stars. Two thumbs up. :)",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jon H. Greenlee,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2017","I bought four (4) of these WeMo mini smart plugs together with a couple of Echo Dots. The Dots set up easy, but I could not get the WeMo plugs set up, even after a few hours spent with Belkin support and my ISP support and hours scouring the Internet and support articles trying to overcome the issue, so I returned them. (I’m a longtime Prime member and have made very very few returns of anything I’ve purchased from Amazon, but I’ve appreciated the ease of that process). The problem wasn’t with the plugs themselves, but seemingly with the WeMo app as it just would not progress when I tried to link the plugs to my home WiFi. I wasn’t happy.

I then tried a competing product, but that didn’t work either. A friend convinced me to give WeMo another try, so I did.

Long story short, after a lot of trial and error I finally figured out that the VPN on my iPhone 6 was apparently preventing the WeMo app from progressing any further than it did. After temporarily disabling the VPN, everything worked like it was supposed to, the setup was easy and easily linked to Alexa.

I am now a happy smart home owner, and I would have given this 5 stars for these smart plugs but for all the trouble I had initially that I had to figure out for myself. I hope this helps anyone who may experience any similar setup issues.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jeff White,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2017","Nice compact unit, working well so far. It would certainly be easy to install two of these in one wall outlet, as is clearly the intent. I bought this to compliment several other WeMo wall switches in my house, and to work with my Amazon Echo & Dot. Using this one for a master bedroom Himalayan salt lamp (i.e., night light for grown-ups); except in this instance I need the soft amber lighting to not assault my eyes when I first stumble out of bed in the a.m. (a gentle wake-up light), and to put it on a schedule that doesn't wake me on weekends (thanks 'Rules' function!). Price is reasonable, I paid ~$30. I am happy with my purchase. I will update my review if it fails.

One handy trick, the Alexa app lets you assign WeMo switches to multiple groups (including groups containing only ONE device); that means if your spouse or significant other consistently calls your device the wrong name (i.e. 'family room lamp', instead of 'living room lamp', or whatever...), just create a group with that 'wrong' name and select only the switch with the right name in that group. Now Alexa will now turn on the switch using either name without complaint; argument avoided & relationship saved!! (More of an Alexa smart-home skill tip than this switch in particular, but a recent discovery on my part that I really like.) For instance, at my house the 'Porch Lights' belong to a group called 'Pizza Lights'; the kids think it is funny and it helps them remember to turn on the porch lights when they order a pizza.

After posting my original review, I was contacted by ""Belkin Cares"". They informed me that the WeMo SHOULD work fine with eero network (or any other dual band router than supports 2.4Mhz). They ultimately connected me with Belkin Engineering. The Engineering team worked with me and it appeared I had a hardware problem. They promptly shipped me a replacement unit. It arrived and I had the same problems getting it to work. I was scratching my head. I walked through all the points of Wifi and Network connection on my iPad and iPhone. I got to the point of my iOS VPN software (Cloak) and verified it was turned off. As a test, I tried uninstalling the VPN app. I re-booted my iPhone, and tried the WeMo install. Voila - it worked!! I then re-installed my VPN software, and everything still works fine.

For a $35 device, I am VERY impressed with the support from Belkin. On my initial attempt at troubleshooting I was able to easily get through to their 800 #. However, when they proactively reached out (after I posted my original review), I was really impressed. I cam away feeling that ""Belkin Cares"" is not just a tag line, but part of their culture.

I was unable to get the Wemo Mini working with a eero network.

I spoke with eero customer support and they said that they support earlier versions of Wemo and had no reports of issues with the Wemo Mini.

Thomasdoc,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2018","After spending several hours trying to set this up, reading the forums etc., I finally realized what the key requirement is to set this up: You must make sure that the only network that the Wemo can find during set up is your 2.4Ghz home network. You must turn on Airplane mode (so that Wemo cannot connect to your cellular network), forget for the time being your 5Ghz network, and then the setup should work.
Essentially during setup, you are connecting your phone or tablet directly to your Wemo via WiFi, and then the Wemo gets the information from the app how to connect to your 2.4Ghz WiFi network and it tries to find your respective home Wifi network. I hope I got the sequence right. Anyhow, IF your cellular connection or 5Ghz is an option, the app will try to connect to your cellular network first, or to the 5Ghz network, which in turn gives the Wemo device the wrong info. And then set up will fail. Also make sure to give the app the correct password for your network. Because if you don't, or have a spelling error, the app won't tell you and you never know. This is what fixed the connection issues for me.
I think it is ridiculous that the setup is so flawed and that would be a reason for me to not get those. Let's see how they work in practice and I will report back later.

Rebecca G,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2017","I used this for a night light type of lamp in my son's room knowing I could plug the lamp in and it could turn off in a set amount of time. That said, the app is missing a couple rules that could've made it better for me and how I'm using it. First off, it has a timer rule that allows you to set the amount of time you want it on, ok great. Then there's another rule you can set to specify exactly what times you want it on, also great. Not great, these cannot be used in conjunction with each other. In my case, I want to use the set times to turn on the lamp for the same time every night (7:15-8), however, when we're running late and it's after 8, I'd like to turn on the lamp and then use the timer rule for it to be on for 30 minutes. If I select this, it disables the set time rule and I have to remember to set it back. It's not the end of the world, but still. I also don't like the fact that I NEED my phone to turn the lamp on and off since the plug is hidden behind a dresser.

Original Review

Bad me for not reading deep enough in the description that these are not Z-wave, nor are they Zigbee. Therefore, they do not work with Wink. These require you to install (yet another) app on your phone to setup. I did not want yet another app to install on my phone, or another hub, or another skill... and its my fault I didn't read too closely that it's not Z-Wave or Zigbee.

Why use Z-Wave or Zigbee? Because they work with so many smart home hubs as well as Alexa and Google. WiFi devices require you to install yet another resource-hungry app on your phone or another skill to Alexa or Google. WiFi devices like WeMo also only carry as far as your WiFi signal carries - thats it. Zigbee and Z-Wave devices talk to each other - sort of a ""mesh"" that pass along commands from one to another. In my house I have Zigbee devices that far outreach any of my four WiFi networks.

So how does this unit compare? Eh... slow start up compared to my Zigbee outlet. It took this WeMo about a minute after plugging it in to an outlet before it would start working. Compare that to about 15 seconds on my Zigbee outlet. Also, I can place my Zigbee outlet in the fringe areas of my WiFi networks and know it will work because it talks to the other Zigbee devices that are nearer to it. This WeMo does not play well on the 5ghz networks, and thus has a hard time getting commands from floors away.

It seems to work great line-of-sight and on the same floor as my WiFi router.

I like that it doesn't consume more than one outlet space in real estate on the outlet. The button is right there on the front, no searching the sides to turn the device on.

In all, I'm sure these WiFi devices are fine for those who do not have a complex smart home setup, rather they just want something simple, maybe a few devices and not much more. If you own a Wink Hub and need something Z-wave or Zigbee, don't stop here, keep moving along. Again, my own fault for not reading the description closely enough, however I think I have justified above why it deserves the ""It's okay"" rating.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2018","I am replacing my old X10 plugs with wifi/web app managed smart plugs. I read a good review of the Wemo mini, but didn't do much on-line research before I decided to buy one -- just one, to test it myself. If the price is in an acceptable range, that is the best way after all. Besides, I've always been a little wary of Belkin products. They sometimes just haven't worked very well for me in the past.

The packaging was waaay too big for the item itself. A real waste of cardboard! Come-on marketing. You can do better.

The installation instructions were simple enough - 6 steps in all, maybe the part about changing your wifi router to ""Wemo.Mini"" is a little confusing to a total non-geek (I've been doing computer stuff since before the first PC). Anyway, the sheet also includes a troubleshooting section on the back. Good thing! The Wemo app would not connect the Wemo mini to my dirt standard stock comcast Xfi wifi router (there must be millions of these around the country.) Then, after about 8 tries, just when I'm about to send it back, it connected for no apparent reason.

Moving on, I have read since that the app itself has an old tired interface, but I have an iPhone 7, so I'm used to old tired interfaces. No matter, it's simple enough. I was able to set up rules and they actually worked. That's really all I wanted...except... I also want remote access. It simply won't connect. I have studied on-line resources, opened ports on my router (which is BTW very clunky with XFi) to no avail. I have no intention of spending hours and hours figuring out how to do this -- I'll simply try another product for another US$30 - $40 and see if it works better. You hear that, Belkin?",3.0 out of 5 stars
The Reviewer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2017","Overall it is a good product and I would recommend it.

I originally bought it hoping to eliminate the use of a power strip as this plug has a narrower profile than the TP-link plug it replaced and doesn't cover both outlets. Even though it didn't accomplish the goal (due to the other item plugged into the outlet, which is no fault of the device), it is an attractive well designed switch that has more capabilities that the switch it replaced.

The Pros are:
1. Narrow profile that doesn't cover the second plug in the outlet.
2. Easy setup (Wemo outlets have a kind of unique setup where you have to select the outlet first in the wifi settings section of your phone before you can complete your install. However, as long as you follow the directions it seems pretty easy.)
3. Easy integration with IFTTT, Samsung Smartthings and Alexa.

The Cons are:
1. Doesn't work with Apple Homekit.
2. It seems to loose its device settings if the power is turned off for an extended period of time, which means that you then have to resetup the outlet again.

Ordinarily I would give it a five star, but for the lack of Homekit connectivity and the fact that it drops off the network if it looses power for a while I felt that I had to knock off a star. However, that being said, its probably one of the best smartplugs on the market right now.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Michelle,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2017","We got an Amazon Echo for Christmas and started toying with smarthome options. We haven't delved too far into the smart bulbs because they are so expensive and you have to buy the silly bridge things. So we figured we'd try out the plug options to control our main corner lamp in our living room as a stepping stone. This mini option being the newest thing on the market was a risk but it was also compact and easily added to our existing map of electronics and cords in the corner. If it failed we weren't out too much money and could return it if need be. However! This mini was SUPER easy to install, just plug it in, let it blink white and orange, tap on its wifi network, name it in the app on your smartphone, and connect it to your existing home wifi network, BOOM! Connected. Took me all of 45 seconds. Instructions were clear. And I added it to our Alexa smart devices in 20 seconds so even my 4 year old can control the lamp. Definitely will be buying more of these mini plugs for other outlets around the house.
Info that helps: the plug is less than 8-10ft from our router and 2-3 ft from Alexa. I sat right next to all 3 on our couch when programming. AND I bought this out of pocket, not a freebie :)
Edit:
After a year we bought a 2nd switch and added another floor lamp because we moved to a new home with no overhead light. I easily renamed our lamps to LR1 & LR2 in the wemo app. I had Alexa rediscover our wemo switches and she recognized the name switch. I created a fast group name of ""the lights"" and ""BOOM"" once again both lights turn on at the same time.

You can set routines, you can have something turned on at sunset or a certain time turn off at sun up or turn off at a certain time. You can pick the days a week that you want. You can also control it through your phone with a widget on your screen or app. I have about eight or nine of these in my home. Along with a couple let wall switches. I've been using WeMo for probably about 5 years now. Have not had any problems. Don't think I wish, that it had auto update. I use echo ecosystem. And I used Google ecosystem.

Overall I think it's an outstanding product and works absolutely flawless. I would definitely recommend getting one and picking it up I just always stick with the same brand instead of mix matching other brands into my system. I know other friends that have used other brands and mixed in with a bunch of different brands. What happens is you have all these different frequencies running it messes up your Wi-Fi speeds.

Glowplugv,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2017","I started to build a smart home around the Amazon Echo and needed smart plugs to control various lamps. I was only interested in devices that connect directly to Alexa not indirectly through a hub. I originally looked at the TP-link version of a mini smart plug, but after reading the 1 star views (highly recommended) and seeing several reports of electrical issues I switched to the Wemo version. Installation of the first plug took a few tries but it installed within 10 minutes of fussing with it. That plug went into a firmware upgrade that took awhile but required nothing from me. The remaining that I added were easily done as the app remembered the network password and then they asked permission to do the firmware upgrade too. Connecting to Alexa was simple as asking Alexa to scan for smart devices. She found the three installed plugs and their names and that was that. The Wemo app is very simple and for me the lights turn on/off almost simultaneously when I press the button in the app for a lamp. Of course I use Alexa most of the time but I wanted to state that because some reviews have complained about the slow performance of the app. I have them set up on an on/off schedule. I could have set them also to be on sunset to sunrise (you put in your location information).

Amz631,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2021","A couple of years ago, I ordered several of these based on a favorable (non-Amazon) review. I have used them since then, but they don't work very well.

Pros: They do work and it is possible to integrate them with Alexa.

Cons: About every week, at least one of them ""forgets"" how to work. Most of the time I have to unplug the device, wait a bit (sometimes overnight) and plug it back in. Most of the time that works. About 10% of the time, I have to factory reset the plug and re-introduce it to the network. If I power down my router for any period of time, one or more will require the same reset process. Many months ago, a firmware update that should have been one on the app, required me to find an undocumented process on-line and then fiddle with every plug, multiple times, to get them all working again.

By comparison: I have two Amazon-branded plugs which I have also used for a long time. I plugged them in and forgot about them. They just worked. No setup. No weekly maintenance for lights that suddenly stopped working.

In my opinion, wemos are twitchy and hobbyist grade at best. However, every network is different, and it is possible these problems are to my network. I suppose it is also possible that these problems were corrected with more recently manufactured wemos, and it may not be fair to judge current production on older models. I can only speak for my experience.)",3.0 out of 5 stars
Ampazon,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2019","I purchased These to use with HomeKit. I bought 3 new ones (2nd gen) and 2 refurbished ones (1st gen). I will say that the HomeKit set up on the new ones was a little bit tricky but now that I have them all set up properly they work fantastic. They DO NOT completely reset when they lose power like numerous people have stated in old reviews. While that may have been an issue in the past, it is no longer an issue with the latest firmware updates. My recommendation for setting them up would be to install the Wemo app and set them up through the Wemo app 1st, then immediately update the firmware. Then factory reset it by unplugging it, holding down the power button on the front and plugging it back in until it shows a blinking white light. Then set it up for HomeKit. Also I would recommend only having one of these plugged in in your home at a time while setting them up so as you get one set up and working I would unplug Until you add the rest. I am using Google Wi-Fi mesh router system, so I cannot turn off the 5 GHz frequency Wi-Fi but it was not at issue at all for me which was another thing people have mentioned being a problem in the past that was likely fixed with the latest firmware. I will say I spent an hour trying to set up the first 2 initially (new 2nd gens) and it was quite frustrating but once I got the hang of it it was simple I really like these. There are a few points/steps during setup where it takes a few seconds and you need to be patient.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Claire & Nanami,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2019","These Wemo mini smart plugs are really easy to install. Install the Wemo app on your phone and you can start adding switches to it pretty easily. They make your regular electronic devices behave like smart home devices. You can use them for lamps, coffe pots, water boilers, etc. If you use them for your coffee pot, just make sure it is filled with water before you start it up.

I bought these for my lamps, and LED lights because I can use whatever lightbulb I want and still make my lamps smart. The switches don't use up much space when plugged on the wall, compared to the older ultra bulky version that would block any other electric plug. I upgraded to the mini switches because of that.

These switches integrate with Alexa, which is the main reason why I got them. You can give them names on your Alexa app and even group them by room. For example, I created a group in Alexa, called living room, which controls all the light switches in the living room. So turning the lights on is as easy as saying ""Alexa, living room lights on"". Another cool thing you can do is add them to an Alexa routine. For example, if you want to make sure all your lights are off before going to bed, you can create a routine where you say ""Alexa, good night"" and have Alexa turn off all groups of lights in your home.

If you don't have an amazon smart device or another compatible device for voice control. You can always use the Wemo app to control these switches.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Michael Head,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2018","So this is my 4th WEMO product and until yesterday a very happy customer. I have 2 older style wall outlets and one light switch. Easy setups and all work with Alexa. So yesterday I get my WEMO mini in the mail, plug in, go to the app to add, all goes well except the device never showed in the list of devices, did a restart, loaded again, same result. Off to customer service and downhill from there. After checking I have the latest app version, that the mini did not show up in the hardware list and then a 5 minute hold of elevator music - what were my options - delete and reinstall the app, the catch, some of my devices might not show up. True to fashion, I cleared the cache and data from the app (did not delete), and guess what - the WEMO mini showed up, but my 3 previous devices were gone. Get the 2 wall switches reloaded and then put back in my routines with Alexa. Regarding the wall switch, no luck in getting it added back, WiFi for the WEMO showed up, but for some reason my phone reverted back to my home WiFi. Here's the catcher, although the wall switch does not show as a device, Alexa still works with the wall switch - so until it stops I guess I don't care that its not listed. Based on this experience I have no plans to add any further WEMO devices to my house and have to start from scratch. Maybe you have a better experience than I did, but this was too much of a pain to add a wall switch",3.0 out of 5 stars
Nomiworld,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2018","I have six of these operating in my house at the entrance porch, front entrance room, master bedroom, living room, tv and guest bedroom. I love the ability to turn lights on and off remotely. I have lights on the timers every evening so that I never return to a dark house. I use the commands to turn on and off with Amazon Alexa. The best switch is the one I use at the front porch light where you can have it automatically turn on at 30 minutes before sunset until sunrise. Even with a time change, I will never have to adjust since the device knows the local sunrise and sunset times. This product is simple to install. Literally takes a minute or less except for the switch which required me to get my electrician to do it. I know it’s not difficult to put wires together for a switch, but I wanted to make sure it was done correctly. I have not tried the dimmer switch model but would like to try. It’s terrific having a smart home that I can simply light all my rooms in a moment remotely before I enter my home or put everything on a timer to do same. I can turn on and off remotely for my dog who will never be in the dark waiting for my return. I have a couple on timers inside to always give the appearance that the house is occupied. It’s a great device for sure especially if you own a voice comand device like Alexa or Google. Highly recommend and it really has changed my life for the better and makes me enjoy my home more!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Hitome,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2017","I use this to restart my super fancy litter box, that sometimes likes to get stuck on its side while sifting. The cats really hate it when I'm gone all day, and the litter box is stuck! So I keep tabs on it with the security camera, and can operate the outlet from anywhere I can get a phone signal. My cats are thankful for that!

Downside! Sometimes the plug shuts itself off on its own! If it needs an update, or maybe it's just Thursday, it could randomly turn off sometimes. (Another reason why I have a camera watching it...) I haven't played with the scheduled settings though, so I could possibly remedy that by having scheduled on/off times. I am afraid to have it reset while a cat is in there though... LOL!
It will also not turn back on if there has been a power outtage, even after power has been restored. You'll have to push the button, or turn it back on in the app. (When you suddenly realize ""Oh no, the cat box is still off!"") Again, having a schedule programmed will probably remedy this issue.

I'm thinking of ordering another one, to have my modem/router on a schedule. Not only would it be useful for ""No internet after 10pm!"" but nobody can hack an offline router either. Though it means I'll be using my cameras less...",4.0 out of 5 stars
Reiggin Hilderbrand,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2018","I purchased two of these plugs because they were on sale with the Echos I bought at the same time. The price was great but the support isn't. I learned quickly that the plugs lose connection easily and often. After googling around for a bit, I discovered others that have the same issue. Turns out, it's a problem with the Alexa skill. And thankfully, I was able to disable the skill and use the native Alexa support to operate the plugs. But this shouldn't be the case and you would think that Wemo would address this issue. However, they do not and finding the support was nearly impossible.

And that lack of support by Wemo is more frustrating than the device issues themselves. I opened a support ticket with Wemo and it was immediately closed. I got an email basically saying, ""Thanks, we've closed your ticket."" No one reached out to me and nothing was done to address my concerns/questions.

So for those that have similar issues, just know that you need to disable/remove the Wemo skill from the Alexa app. From there, ask Alexa to discover your devices and she'll find the plug(s) without the skill being installed. Since doing this, I haven't had any issues.

Beyond the flaky (e.g. completely absent) support by Wemo, the installation of the plugs felt more complicated than other smart devices I've installed. I bought an outdoor plug by Meross around the same time and it was simple (and reliable) to set up with Alexa. The Wemo app is far less intuitive and nothing is really explained for you. The small instructions with the plug are okay but it just feels like it could have been simpler.

I also installed the device with my HomeKit (Apple) services to be able to use with Siri. That's where most of the complications with the app and directions came from. It just wasn't explained well and it took some trial and error to figure out. Once I got it set up, it works fine with HomeKit and Siri, though.

At full price, these certainly aren't worth it. I would have returned them and went with the AmazonBasics plugs instead if it wasn't for the great deal I got on them. That's the reason for the two stars instead of a one star -- the price was right. But my final advice is to shop around and, if you do choose to go with the Wemo devices, be ready to do some troubleshooting -- on your own and with no support from Wemo.",2.0 out of 5 stars
MKES,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2019","I've had a number of these running in an Apple HomeKit environment. Initial setup is simple. I added via HomeKit directly and then used the Wemo APP for firmware updates. All scheduling/naming was executed in HomeKit, not the Wemo APP. These have worked flawlessly for many months now. Would recommend this smart plug for HomeKit users.

There are the occasional wifi drops (""not responding"" in HomeKit) common amongst these types of accessories, but these plugs have consistently come back online without any effort. And this issues is happening less and less as time goes on and updates are applied.

Couple of things that could be better. There's an audible ""click"" sound when these turn on/off. If you're used to other bulbs and/or in-wall dimmers operating in complete silence, this will be a noticeable difference and a step down in overall experience. Also, it would be better if there was an outlet on the side instead of the front. Wall outlets are often behind furniture or curtains. The thickness of the outlet added to the lamp plug itself requires a decent amount of space in front of the outlet. Ideally this device would have a front AND side plug so the user could choose the best option for their situation.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Charles C.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2017","This 'Smart Plug' is great if you know HOW to use it and WHAT to use it for...the problem with this Smart Plug is it only works they way you probably want/envision if you pair with DUMB APPLIANCES. Example: If you pair it with a TV - yes you can turn off the TV from your phone (which by the way why wouldn't you just use the remote?!) or by voice such as Amazon Alexa. However, if you ask Alexa to turn the TV back on it will simply return the power the TV but as far as switching the TV display ON that is something different entirely. With that said this type of device works best with SIMPLE on/off appliances i.e. a fan, a lamp, Christmas lights you still have up in the summer, a cotton candy machine that you bought for yourself and live with the guilt of every single day save for the 5 minutes you treat yourself to some freshly spun cotton candy...The phone app is relatively simple to navigate and the pairing with Alexa is just as simple as well.

Aramat,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2017","Update 7/19 PM: I tried it a few more times, checked some settings on my router (changed my wireless network setting from 11 to Auto), tried it a few more times . . . and it worked. I do not know for how long, but tonight, I can turn my stereo on and off with the power of my voice. We'll see how it goes, but for now, Wemo wouldn't be my first choice in mini smart plugs.

Update 7/19 AM: I would hesitate to purchase again. It would no longer respond to the Echo commands this morning. I reset the device, but it still wouldn't show up as an available network. I walked away for a while, and came back to find it finally showed up. Took a few times to connect to the device, but when I did, it told me I might not be connected to the internet (I was) and it wouldn't connect to my home network router. I'll try it again later, when I'm less frustrated, but this is not something I'd buy again. I'll follow up . . .

Original review:
Actually ordered by mistake. It looked like the TP-LINK that I already have, so I jumped in to get another. I tried to cancel the order when I realized my mistake. But, it came today, so I figured I'd give it a try.

Setup was easy, both connecting to the network and to Echo took 5 minutes, tops. I have this one controlling the stereo. On/off works just as it should.

So, I have another smart device app on my phone, but Wemo didn't make me create an account.

Robert Jones,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2017","This is my first ""smart home"" purchase.

It's really nice to be able to hit a button, as I walk to the bedroom at night, to turn it off rather than strain my reach to turn the little knob thing.

Setup was pretty easy, just follow the instructions. The only thing that scared me was when I setup my wife's phone. I had assumed I would be making an account to log into. But when I went to setup my wife's account, all I had to do was open the WeMo app and our device showed up ready for her to manipulate, no login necessary. The reason this worries me, is because it basically means that anyone who knows we have WeMo products, and knows that they can just access the app on our wifi, can get access to our home devices.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2019","My expectations were low after reading all the negative reviews. This is my first smart home device, setup using an Android phone. I did what the flyer in the box said: Download app, plug in Wemo mini and wait for lights to do their thing, plugged a lamp in (leave the lamp on) and opened the Wemo app to complete setup. There was a important point during setup about disabling Google Location Wi-Fi Scanning on Android. After that I had control of the lamp from the app. Perhaps keeping my phone updated helped. Using att router. Getting Alexa to work was a bit more involved. There is a good tutorial on tomzguide how to connect a Wemo Switch smart plug to Alexa. I followed it and it also worked. Now I can turn the lamp on and off a la startrek. I setup under Automation an away rule. I did not realize it will not turn on when the rule time is reached, it will turn on after a random period of time when the rule begins. I got impatient, sitting in the dark so I asked Alexa to turn the lamp on. Evidently this disables the rule. I then manually disabled the rule until I need it and setup a schedule rule for convenience. I did not live through a power outage with this thing, so I can't speak of its recovery. I wonder for the folks that have several smart devices if it would complicate setup? Perhaps temporarily unplugging the other devices while setting up the new one would help?",5.0 out of 5 stars
M S T,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2017","I wanted a device where I didn't have to spend 10 seconds crawling under my desk hunting for the cord every day when I get home.

What I get is a device where I spend 10 seconds watching an enormous amount of initialization activity take place on the Wemo app on my phone. (Every time the app opens in fact, it takes 7-10 seconds on my phone to load.) Arguably a downgrade. I was under the impression that sending the signal over the network, not opening the app would have been the bottleneck. Overall, considering how much time in this day and age we spend waiting for our phones to load things, I think that this solution needs to be more well thought out.

I have tried this UI both on an LG g4 and Google Pixel 2 - it has the same glitches, so it is not a phone hardware issue.

Additionally: WeMo should add support for Google Assistant (and Siri and Alexa?) to control this device not from devices, but from phones. This would also get rid of the lost 10 seconds I spend waiting for my phone's UI.

Edit: I have updated this review after 2 months and deducted 2 stars.

First off, on Android you can set widgets on your home screen, but they are laughably terrible in terms of whether they work. They theoretically show you at a glance whether the light is on or off, but it is stupidly inaccurate and shows a false state. I have a higher rate of success just opening the app. So that was a headache.

But even in the app, devices just straight up don't work. They don't load and clicking on them leads not to any type of troubleshooting help, but an insulting option to ""hide the disabled device until it shows up again"". Why the hell would I want to do that when I need it to be working? So I can, you know, toggle it? What a dissappointment.

It's a dream come true about 20% of the time. Down from my expectations of 100%. I have a package of 2 of these plugs to give my dad for his birthday next week (which comes on Thanksgiving) -- I am seriously considering shipping these back and finding something else.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Now we can wake up and say, ""Alexa, turn on the heater."" Snooze a few minutes and walk into our preheated bathroom. During Christmas, I'll be putting this in my garage where I have our Christmas lights plugged. Typically, I have to plug them in at night, when I get home from work, and then it's the last thing that I unplug before bed. Last Christmas, every night ended with me walking to bed and seeing the lights still on outside. It's a first world problem, but I knew it would be great to ask Alexa to turn them off. I can see this as a great option for crockpot cooking too. One frustration for me is the recipes usually ask for 4-6 hours of cooking. I work 8 hours and I'm gone close to 10 hours a day. I will now be able to turn it on, from anywhere, 4 or 6 hours from when I'm home. Or even cook it for 4 hours, turn it off from anywhere, then turn it back on for 30mins-1hr before I return.

Bootsie,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2018","I picked this smart plug because I thought from other reviews that I would still be able to use other outlet in the receptacle, but that is not the case. If the other cord has even a small transformer (looks like slightly oversized plug), it will not fit in the same outlet as this smart plug. However, if it is a simple small two or three prong plug, it will fit. Two of the WEMO smart plugs will fit in same outlet. They were fairly easy to set up on Android cell phone (Samsung). I had hoped they could be controlled by voice, but it does not look like they are voice activated. I did successfully set up on phone so I just click the app, then click the device I want to turn on or off. I also set up a schedule to randomly turn lights on and off. I park my car in garage, so potential intruders will not know if I am home or not. With lights going on and off at odd times, I feel like my house is less of a target.

Steve H,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2017","Overall I'm really not happy with this product. I'll say the few good parts about it were how easy it was to install, upgrade the firmware, and I like the design and the fact that I can use two on a single outlet. I think it's fair to give it 2 stars for that.

The whole reason I purchased these was so that I could use them with voice-activated smart device like Alexa. In order for that to work, I need them to stay connected to the WiFi network. Every few hours they would just randomly disconnect and they wouldn't reconnect until I unplugged them and plugged them back in. I went to their support forums and found that some people had some workarounds, like setting my WiFi channel statically and turning off my 5GHz network, but neither of them solved the problem. Oh and I rebooted all involved devices several times. Even if all that did solve the problem, I don't want to buy a product that tells me how I need to set up my network. If you claim to have WiFi enabled device, then you should make sure it easily works with WiFi.

A note about my WiFi setup: it's super simple. I have a single wireless access point and the two WeMo minis are less than 20ft away on the same floor and in the same room, both plugged into the same outlet. I have not done anything fancy with my access point. I have a Nest Thermostat, Nest Protect, a Nest indoor camera, an Echo Dot as well as a couple phones and an iPad all connected to the WiFi. I don't feel like that should be enough devices to cause significant interference.

The other reason why I find this silly is because after connecting the Dot and the Nest products they just worked. I've never had a problem with network connectivity. So that means someone solved this problem years ago and I don't see why this should be one for the Minis.

I fully admit I never called their support, but I'm pretty sure they're working as intended since I have two that are behaving identically and terribly.

Overall I would not recommend this product unless you're very network savvy and like playing around with that stuff.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Erin,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2020","FINAL REVIEW: It's December 2021, and after having more and more problems with my WEMO app and Google Home's integration, I decided I was done with WEMO. My husband bought six TP-Link Kasa plugs instead, and we love those because they work, the app works with more features, and we were able to get these installed and working in about five minutes each. At this point, I wouldn't recommend WEMO to anyone.

ORIGINAL REVIEW (READ FURTHER FOR FIRST UPDATE): I've ordered three of these so far, one in 2017, two during the same week in 2020. The one in 2017 has been good in some ways but a hassle in others. The installation was a pain, and on my iPhone 7, I still have to refresh the app home page multiple times to find out how many minutes are left on the timers (my husband's iPhone 6 doesn't have this problem). But overall, I've found this plug helpful for turning lamps on and off during vacations and scheduling lights to turn on and off at Christmas. In fact, I've had just two larger issues with the 2017 WEMO; the first was easily resolved by a helpful employee at WEMO, and the other was resolved (as were other problems with devices that connect to wifi) when we moved to our new house and switched Internet providers.

That said, I bought two more WEMO plugs this past week. They are now installed and working well so far. But the two plugs I received this week were in different packaging (neither frustration-free, I assure you), and the one that appears to be newer was a 3-minute install compared to the one that appears to be older, which required a lot more jumping through hoops. I would recommend these regardless because after you get them set up, they are worth the money.

One more thing: I connected these switches to Alexa for the first time this afternoon. I had to Google how to do it, but in about 7 minutes, I had all three switches successfully connected.

ETA (10/23/2020): I woke up this morning to all non-working WEMO switches. In about an hour, I was able to fix all but one by myself. I waited on hold about 10 minutes before reaching someone who spent another hour helping me reset, unlink, and reassociate the last switch, but then we reintegrated with Google Home and had to reset, unlink, and reassociate all of them all over again. I still like these, but if I were buying such a product again, I'd research for a better option and, if I found one, I would likely buy that instead. The process is just a little too tedious, especially when you have a lot of other tasks on your plate.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Jim Clack,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2018","Actually a decent e-switch but suffers from one simple problem: The instructions leave out one very important step. The quick-start sheet says nothing about it. The online instructions say nothing about it. The FAQs/help say nothing about it. They would need half as many support people and would get much better feedback if they would fix their instructions. The missing step? ""Make sure that Mobile Data is turned off on all nearby mobile devices before configuring.""
When I installed my first Wemo I had to wait on hold over an hour to get through to somebody that told me this. The next Wemo installed fine because I remembered this. When I bought my third one, I remembered that there was a missing step but I couldn't recall what it was. I spent another hour on the phone with them, this time trying a lot of different things, before I realized that my wife's phone was nearby and had mobile data turned on. Ugh. Their support guy told me that this is a really common issue and most of their support calls that last more than a minute or two are due to this. Why can't they fix their instructions? Just add it to the troubleshooting steps online.
There's another setup caveat as well... Once it connects to your Wifi you have less than a minute to complete the next step or it will disconnect. In many cases that is not enough time so you might have to try it a few times to get it done quickly enough.

Jehjeh,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2019","I have several Wemo switches and all work really well. There is a feature for turning the device on and off at different times that can be set up through the ""Rules"" section of the app. There is also a feature that allows you to have the switch go on and/or off at sunrise or sunset with the option of a time interval before or after sunrise or sunset. This means that you don't have to change the timer as the days get longer or shorter.

Just thought I'd layout the instructions as it can be confusing for some people.

On the iPhone app there is a way to choose from 15 to 45 minutes before or after sunrise or sunset and also a custom time setting for each. It knows when sunrise or sunset is based on the internet feed that the device is getting through your IP and it will tell you what that time is during step 6 of the following instructions.

I'm so glad I did and actually wish I had bought more! I have a Google Home Mini and a Chromecast, but my TV is so old that it's not only not ""smart,"" but it doesn't even CEC, so I can't use my Chromecast to turn it on and off. I plugged the TV into one of these smart plugs, and now I can turn it on and off with my voice through Home and from anywhere with the app. I used the other plug to make a lamp turn on at sunset at off at 11:30 pm. I turn all my lights off when I leave for work in the morning, so my pets end up hanging out in the dark for a while this time of year and I walk into a dark home when I get back from work. Not anymore! The plugs were easy to set up and the app is really easy to use. I linked it to my Nest, so I can use Nest's home/away functionality to control the plugs if I want. I have relatively new LED bulbs throughout my house, so I'm reluctant to replace them with smart bulbs.

Don Draper,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2017","This smart switch is a neat way to control your electric devices via your phone, tablet, or through voice with Alexa. There is a decorative salt lamp in my living room that has the switch on the cord. Before Wemo Mini I had to get down on my knees and reach under a table to turn it on. Now all I have to do is say ""Alexa, Salt Lamp On"" and she turns it on for me!

The compact size leaves the other outlet accessible which is an improvement from the original Wemo plug design. Another feature that is nice about the Wemo switches is that you can control your lights from anywhere even when you are not at home. The app has an ""Away Mode"" which automatically runs a lights on/lights off program to give your house that lived-in look when you are away. There is also a scheduler function to turn lights on and off at preset times. If you have a Nest thermostat you can link it, but I don't have one of those so I can't comment.

The setup was kind of tricky. I had to fiddle with my WiFi settings to get it to connect to the network, but I eventually found the right combination of settings to make it work. I would advise going to the Belkin Wemo website and reading their troubleshooting documents if you have difficulty getting it setup. So far so good. I may get one or two more to control other devices around the house.

UPDATE 12/09/18

I feel like it is my duty as an informed consumer to warn buyers before they purchase these switches. They are great when they work, but they don't always work. App and firmware updates sometimes mess up the connections and the troubleshooting process is time consuming. I've been living with them for 9 months. I'm invested in this brand with a total of 6 switches so I'm kind of stuck. If I had it to do over again, I would go with a different brand.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Onur Baykal,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2018","This is a great plug, great quality. The app however, especially on Android, has been an extremely unpleasant experience to say the least. The app tends to ""forget"" that the plug exists on my home network. Other times, remote access will just disable itself, and refuse to re-enable, causing issues with the Google Assistant. Let's also not forget to mention that the app is the slowest of the the three smart home apps that I've had to deal with, I mean seriously, the Android App will have you asking questions all over, as to why it was designed/implemented the way it was. Lastly, be aware that the wemo app has no login (username/password) system in place, in contrast to some other systems and their apps. Yes it may be a bit more convenient to not have to deal with another user account, but I've noticed that having a user account in place tends to result in greater reliability for smart plugs, especially when it comes to remote access control for the plugs/switches. Also, I'm here only referring to the wemo Android App, I've read some other accounts by others, of having greater success and reliability through the ios app, so I'd best suggest buying it and trying out to see how it works out for you.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Bob Loblaw,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2017","When Wemo plugs work, they're fine. And they're also probably the most widely supported plug on the market today, which is nice. What's especially nice about *this* plug, compared to their original model, is its size. While not as small as those offered by competitors (e.g., iHome), it's certainly much nicer than the original Wemo.

Why 2 stars? Because, in my experience, Wemo makes some of the most hit-and-miss smart products out there. I just spent 3 hours trying to get this brand new plug working, following each and every bit of advice offered by their techs, by fellow consumers on message boards, etc. This is on top of me literally spending days upon days trying to get my two original Wemo plugs to consistently work

In fact, that's why I bought this one. I hoped that perhaps a brand new plug would ""simply work"", and I could throw the others in a closet or something, never to have to curse at them again. Well, my hopes were dashed...

The two originals actually did seem to work fine, until a recent firmware update. From that point out, no amount of resetting, reinstalling of apps, changing wifi channels or rebooting the router, assigning fixed IP addresses, disabling cellular signals, moving plugs right next to routers, unplugging every single Wemo device save the one I'm trying to install, trying IOS then Android, etc. would reliably work. Most fixes did nothing. When they did work, the fix was fleeting. Wemos appear and disappear, whether using the Wemo app or my Amazon Echos.

The fix that worked for me? Switching my phones/tablets to my wifi's Guest network, and installing Wemo there. Fwiw, my router: Asus RT-AC88U. It played nicely w/ my two original switches until the firmware update. (Coincidence? No idea. I just know that that's when my troubles began.) I can't use my Echos to control my Wemos anymore, since they're on different networks (Guest vs. Main network). But at least they're not totally useless anymore.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Kevin,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2017","Received 2 WeMo minis yesterday. First one setup with no problems. Second one was a real pain. It kept saying connection failed no matter where I put the plug. Close to the router, away from it, near my phone, away from it, didn't matter. After about 10 times of cycling between the Wemo Wi-Fi and my home Wi-Fi I unplugged the first Wemo and tried again, this time it connected and setup with no problem. Plugged the first one back in and there they both were. Then it said there was a firmware upgrade required. The second Wemo took an hour to upgrade, the first ran all night and still showed upgrading. Out of frustration I turned off the app and unplugged the Wemo, plugged it into the outlet where the other was plugged in and started the app. Then it showed upgrade complete. Go figure! Then there are the rules. These are the applets the app uses to turn off and on at specified times. When I click on the rules icon it takes about 5 minutes of ""looking for rules"" before it comes up. So after the second Wemo had upgraded I set a rule for it to come on at 5:45 am. When I got up this morning it wasn't on and when I looked in the rule it wasn't there . On the plus side Alexa had no problem detecting both plugs. The Wemo is a great concept and I like that the Mini is small enough that you can still use the other outlet, but they still have some work to do to make it really user friendly and frustration free.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Stevie,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2017","Update November 2020. I have had constant disconnects with these for months, or even though I've paired with both Google Assistant and Alexa, they disassociate and neither assistant can control the devices. I don't have this issue with any other devices integrated with my digital assistants. Wemo pushes software updates, but the performance doesn't get any better. It started off good but has become a really unreliable and frustrating product. I had three of these and am down to only using one, and will likely get rid of that one, too. I had issues with both Eero and Nest as my routers and no other client issues, so it's not a router issue.

Really handy devices. I have three of them, and use them to remotely turn lamps on and off while I'm gone. They have generally worked very well with few issues, though they can take a long time to connect to WIFI after setup or rebooting. I did have issues with one of them not staying connected but since I unplugged and rebooted it, it's been fine. Setup is pretty easy. These do not block the second outlet for normal-sized plugs. You can toggle devices on and off through the app, both on your LAN and remotely, or physically press the button on the device. They have stayed connected to my wifi now for a couple weeks ago with no unintended disconnects.

You can also set it up to work with voice commands via Google Home units or Amazon Echo & Alexa, and I have found that works very well. The Google app seems more reliable; I have had a few occasions where Alexa could not communicate with the device where Google could. Overall, very happy with the performance. You can also set up timers and schedules, so it's pretty versatile.

The app also has an option to associate it with your Nest account so you can make thermostat changes within the WEMO app, or sync your switches to shut off when the thermostat is in ""away"" mode. I haven't tried that yet, though.",2.0 out of 5 stars
JC,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2017","Well, so far, so good. I have been skeptical about trying this kind of product because there are just so many out there and so many brands that it was difficult to narrow down. I mainly bought this one because it only blocks one outlet and you don't need an additional hub or controller device to go with it. Just plug it in the wall, plug in your lamp/fan/whatever and go. The app is free and straightforward to use and so far we have no issues with it working.

My only disappointment, and it is not with the product exactly, is that it would be much more useful to have a wi-fi lightbulb or light switch (although the switch would not be plug and go) as it is hard to find a single lamp that I need to turn on when out of the room or not at home. I can see this being useful in an apartment maybe but in a house, it just doesn't do enough to make me excited. I wish there were high watt bulbs out there that could standalone (sans hub) and then you could put them in more meaningful places.

Overall, no complaints, product works reliably as advertised at a not too expensive cost. Works with Alexa and other such devices. Does not monitor energy usage. Unlike many other reviewers, we had no issue with setup, done in a few minutes and has been working fine for months.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Evan Upshall,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2018","The Wemo Mini Smart Plugs are a fantastic evolution from their predecessors. Unlike the older versions and similar models, these neatly fit in just one socket and leave the bottom or top open for use without obstructing the space. It is easy enough to install, too - especially if you already have experience with other WiFi enabled devices and Echo/Alexa. The app is fairly intuitive; setting up schedules is a breeze.

My only complaint (or suggestion, really) is that the app should allow you to ""batch"" multiple plugs together with the Echo/Alexa - similar to how you can batch them in the app's scheduling feature. I purchased a bunch of these, and two of them are specifically controlling lamps at either end of a couch. However, each lamp is plugged into a different Wemo Smart Plug, so I have to name them separately and call out two commands to Alexa, instead of just one. It would be far more fluid to just say ""Alexa, turn on the living room lamps"" than ""Alexa, turn on the living room lamp"" and ""Alexa, turn on living room lamp 2"". It's possible this feature is accessible and I've just missed it, but I don't think that's the case. Happy to be wrong on that, though.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Andrea,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2017","I just bought and installed. I received it from a prime day purchase and I'm totally sold already! My installation was very simple and straight forward. I added an Alexa dot and this product in one quick sitting. No issue whatsoever. Here is the problem and the reason for 4 rather than 5 stars. I want more. I want them in each room for lights, I want one on my coffee maker so when I wake up - u guessed it ""alexa turn on the coffee""!! I bought a Dot for my mother and want one or two of these for her to speak her lights on. BUT the retail price is so high. I see the regular price. There are NO multi packs and how can the average person buy 4 or 5?? Other sellers are half price or sell two for about this price. So sorry WEMO I won't be outfitting my house and moms with more.

Edit - I signed on and WEMO price is $5 off - so not a huge improvement but one that makes it a little less costly so at least they are listening. A multipack of 2, 3, or 4 at a discounted rate would be a good option too. How do you make your house smart without multiples.

Jesse Reviews Stuff,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2017","Pros:

-Their smaller size makes them much sleeker, I never notice them
-Incredibly easy to set up
-Work very well, never have connection issues
-I honestly don't notice them. I just say ""Hey Google, do this"" and it happens, I forget these are the reason why
-Work with Google Home via IFTTT

Cons:

-Can't think of any for me, but some people may not like having something sticking out from their wall socket at all times

There's not much more for me to say here. When I bought these I was just starting to experiment with home automation. They worked so well I started researching every other possible thing I could buy, and interestingly ultimately decided that for now these were enough and just what I needed. In the future I may invest more into lighting switches.

I would say if you can get over the fact that these will add an inch or so of depth to your wall socket, and have been considering them, please go ahead and buy them. You absolutely will not regret it!

Bonus: I had originally bought some TP-Link smart plugs as well. I did really like those (they worked great, and their minis were SUPER sleek), but at the time they did not have IFTTT support meaning I couldn't use them with Google Home. I believe they do work with Amazon products, so I'd check those out as another option if you use Amazon products.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Neil,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2017","I offer a conditional apology for my previous one star review. I attempted to install Wemo originally with the app on my Nexus 6 phone, which led to the initial one star review. Subsequently I've gotten an iPad. Installation of the Wemo app on my iPad solved all my problems. Works like a charm setting it up was a breeze, etc., etc., etc. The only remaining question is why it doesn't work with android. I have seen the same happen with other apps I have both on android and iPad. Night and day difference.

OLD REVIEW-
I bought this as a test hoping I could use it for a hard to reach place for my living room lights. So far I've used up several hours messing around with router passwords, resetting, plugging in and plugging out, online searches for ""wemo won't this"" and ""wemo won't that"", uninstalling app, reinstalling app, all with zero effect.

At this point I've spent $35.00 on something that has soft ware so poorly designed it's impossible to use. In a way I'm glad it didn't work initially. Many of the online comments indicate wemos stopped working or worked sporadically. This would be a disaster for the lighting system I plan on installing.

Beware the internet of things!

p.s. I will set the device aside for a while and try reinstalling at a later date to see if the firmware has been updated to ""workable"".",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kingsley Elbert,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2017","I have two homes. My second home is in an area with unreliable commercial power. Recent storms brought frequently interrupted power. My security lights on mechanical timers were about 12 hours off schedule. I had to make an unplanned drive of 3 hours round trip just to reset them. WeMo Mini Smart Plugs have solved that problem. However, another problem has surfaced. I set the routers at each of my homes to the same SSID and password, so that whenever I show up, my electronics hook right up. The problem is that when I am present at one home network, I can only view the WeMos on that network and not the WeMos at the other home. If I switch off the WIFI on the smartphone and use my cellular data, I see them all. If I go to a remote WIFI, such as Starbucks, I can see them all. I assume that If I changed the SSID's to unique names, this would not be a problem, but I have not tested it. Here is the good news, I am especially happy with Belkin's telephone technical help line. When I phoned to resolve this issue, the line was immediately answered by a live technician. I explained the problem and she provided the answers. If there is any down side, it is that there is not any PC access, only the smartphone app. I love them, wonderful devices.

Paul D Harjung,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2017","Not bad but leaves room for improvement. The plug on the back should be able to rotate so I can place this in a vertical or horizontal position. The plug should also be at one end of the switch, rather than the middle. The switch is so wide and takes up so much real estate that I was very limited on where I could place it.

It was very easy to set up initially. The app on the iPhone is intuitive and good. However, the ""away"" mode is completely random and can not be managed; it is either on or off. I would prefer the ability to set my own schedule. I really don't need my lights to come on at noon if I am away; but I would like to know that they came on at 5pm, 8pm and 10 pm (or similar). Unfortunately, when creating a manual rule you are limited to a single on/off time.

This is my first automation tool to work with Amazon echo. That functionality works well. I started with WeMo because it was less expensive and could be easily expanded.

Kit10,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2017","This is my third Wemo device. I have two light switches, and this Smart Plug. I've used the light switches for the past couple of years now, with great success. I mostly use the Android app to turn on and off the lights. Initially, when I first purchased the switches years ago, it would take a few seconds to toggle the lights from the app, however, that has been vastly improved to fractions of a second. That was my only real complain at the time; now that it's worked out for the last two to four years, I decided I wanted to add to the control.

I purchased three of these at once; my confidence being high in the product. I bought new lamps (with awkward switches on the power cable, that end up behind the bedside tables), and hooked them up to this with a spliter (two lights). This is my one critique, two side-by-side plugs would have been nice; makes sense to me.

Robert G. Coach,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2017","Update to my review 27 Nov 2018
The Wemo app finds NONE of my 24 remaining devices. Yet the Wemo server continues to automatically turn on and off two rooms. Go figure. Yesterday, 7 of the 24 remaining Wemos left and cant be found by anything. I have been using Alexa to control them while I go through the COSTLY process of replacing them all, but even SHE cant find these lost sheep. I am accelerating the replacement process. I cant wait to be Wemo free and look forward to the day when I can delete the Wemo app from my life. On a happier note, the Amazon smart plugs have worked flawlessly since installed and are currently on SALE!
Update to my review 7 November 2018.
After a LOT of effort I managed to get the 30 Wemo's connected and working. I just had my cable modem die and since replacing it the Wemo app no longer finds Any OF THE 30 active devices. ""Not Found"" Which is very odd because they are all connected to my wireless network and they are all WORKING via Alexa voice command. And they still turn on and off according to the preset schedule. But none are accessible or controllable by the Wemo app.

I ran a test with the Amazon wireless plug. It set up first try and has worked every time reliably. I am in the process of replacing all my Wemo devices with Amazon wireless plugs because they work and the Wemo has been nothing but trouble since I began installing it several years ago. If you are considering the purchase of a Wemo device I recommend you buy a goat and inspect its entrails prior to completing your purchase.

Update to my review. Yesterday, 3/5/2018 all my Wemo devices went off line. All of them. Not found. Not by Alexa nor by the Wemo app. I restarted all my devices. Nada. Not found. Restarted the wireless hub, no joy. NONE OF MY WEMO DEVICES ARE FOUND since the update.

I am now in full up manual mode. And looking for a different solution. I cannot say this LOUD enough. Belkin devices are CRAP and they just dont work. They have been nothing but painful since I installed them two years ago. At least once a month they just go away and now apparently they are not coming back. DONT buy this if you are truly into home automation. Find another solution. I am

I bought one last year and liked it. I went all in and now have most of the house on Wemo switches and outlets. They worked fine for many months until the latest firmware update. Now most of them are continually off line. I have reset, restarted and performed all the recommended updates including adding multiple wireless extenders throughout the house. They are performing so poorly that I am considering going back to pre Wemo days. Its just very frustrating. Had they left them alone I suspect that they would still be operating just fine. Now they are worthless and I can no longer recommend them.

November 2017 update. For the past two months the Wemo app will not find any of my devices. Fortunately I have been able to control them using Alexa else I would have backed the truck up and recycled them all.

This first happened when Belkin did a firmware update. The last three firmware updates have killed connectivity. The first time I reconnected all 22 devices. It took a full day. I contacted Belkin support and got a terse replay ""not our fault"" basically don't call us we will call you NEVER.

The second time I managed to get the devices to connect after two days of resetting them by cycling the power. What a huge pain in the butt. Again, Belkin support said ""Not our fault, move along we are not interested in your little problems""

Yesterday I was forced to do another firmware update cause I lost half the devices. You guessed it, they all went away again. I contacted Belkin support again. They told me to go away I was obviously not getting the message. They do not support their devices.

I used to buy Belkin wireless but went away from them several years ago because they are unreliable, inconsistent and not supported.

I tried to update the Wemo app. No update available. I tried controlling them through Alexa, but got the server not responding error message from Alexa. Interesting but for half the devices I could command them individually but not collectively via Alexa. Other room groups worked through Alexa normally but none worked through the Wemo app which did not find ANY of their own devices.

I tried to enable the Wemo skill in Alexa but of course Wemo did not find my wireless network. Nuts. Alexa was turning them on and off using the new Alexa built in hub, but Wemo did not find them while connected to the same freaking network. Belkin is junk in my opinion only matched by their lack of support. Can I go with half a star?.

I started going through the Wemo app trying different things. It was connected to my local wireless network but I deleted and reconnected it again. Like magic all of a sudden the devices showed up only three hours later!

I highly recommend that if you do decide to go with Belkin you place the switches in a location where you can easily access it manually because I can guarantee that you will need to do so.

Unless and until Belkin starts to support their devices and the reliability improves I recommend to my friends and family that they look at alternative solutions.

AH,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2017","I really, really wanted to like this product & technology, but the failure modes and failure rates are astoundingly high.
Relevant background to my skill levels:
I bought a couple of the plugs so that I could experiment with how to automate my home. I am neither a software or hardware engineer, however I am a (very highly) qualified engineer and I have self taught myself a lot about network hardware & application of software packages. I have an advanced router with repeater, fully LAN & WAN connected house, with network switches, POE devices etc. that I installed & runs pretty cleanly.

First of all the app - I am still on 2nd level support waiting for a response to an issue where I am patient zero. I can create a rule, but it does not give me the choice of days. It is the same rule every day or no rule at all. I have tried installing the app on 2 i devices, same issue(the even have different itunes accounts to further firewall them from each other) So the app is highly buggy. App version 1.17.1.

2nd, the switch(es) I have RMA'ed one of my 2 as I still could, the first one I am stuck with. The 2nd one experienced worse functionality issues than the first one. It had to go as this is a defective unit.
The rules limited me, so I tried anyway.
Initial first time setup was quite smooth & I was initially impressed. (Hadn't realized the rules issues yet)
Paired it to Alexa, that was pretty smooth too (Still impressed)
Ran it for a few days, had fun having Alexa switch it on & off etc.
Then we had a power outage. Big system failure on the WEMO.

After restarting power, everything else came back up properly.
I tried restarting the first switch (the still semi functional one that is not RMA'ed) several times to see if it would boot up, it actually would not boot up until I had pushed the power button several times & actually physically unplugged & replugged it several times.
The WEMO devices were not recognized by the app on my phone, until I switched it to the same wifi network as they were running on. This i snot helpful when you are trying to make a remote access switch.
So after trying & rebooting I have given up.
I cannot set up a smart house with devices that require a full factory reboot and me to delete the app, reset all rules from scratch, every time the power fails or blips.

So sadly I have to say the devices are junk, the app is junk and they need to be fully redesigned before both parts of the system become stable & reliable.

Sorry Belkin, but you also have a lot of people on your own Community pages with many similar problems & your own support is not the one finding solutions, it is other users who have more time to do this than most of the rest of us have.
So, folks, if you read this far, don't waste your time & money, these devices are great in concept, but are far from Implementation Ready for mainstream use.

I have never been paid to write a review - good or bad and I have never been given anything for a review, except for one thing that was sent to me that I didn't want & I contacted the vendor & asked for an RMA (They said donate it - so I did). What you read is my genuine experience.
Sadly 1 star reviews get pushed out of sight on Amazon & they are hard to access (even your own ones).
Thanks for your time.

Updated 3/17 to add rules screenshot showing the app issue with no days selectable. App version 1.17.1 (420001) that I am trying to deal with on 2nd level support. I still struggle with the concept that I am the only person with this issue & that it is identical on 2 unrelated Apple devices that are on different accounts.
Just a side note - when Customers are on the phone with your reps, when discussing the product, it really makes a better impression of your company when they are aware of who your major competitor(s) are. 1st level support had never even heard of TP Link (check the recording it you don't believe me).

3/30/2017 update.
I found a workaround out of sheer frustration & anger &, well, it is still strange.

I had a blank screen for the days selection when creating rules. Nothing showed up at all, ever, I have deleted & reinstalled the app 3 times, done a full hardware reset on the switches 3+ times, had Belkin 2nd level support on the phone - you name it. (That was a whole different story - see the response comments!)

So I was giving it one last try to see if it would work, I reinstalled everything from scratch.
Set up a new rule - still nothing snowing in the days area of the screen.

So I was really very angry about how much time & energy I had spent on this whole exercise & I was absentmindedly tapping my phone screen repeatedly, when I suddenly noticed that it was highlighting days of the week.

So I played around some more.

I can get it to highlight, at most, 6 of 7 days, in any combination.

I have to guess where the day is to be selected on the screen, then I can find it.

I sometimes have to tap that spot several times to get the day to select (no it is not my touchscreen, both devices have the same response)

What I then found out was, if I select a day & I can now see it, that means that day is one in which the rule will NOT work. It Will work on the days that are not selected & still invisible on the screen.

I have attached a couple of random screen shots so you can see what is going on.

Is the issue fixed - no, not at all, it is still there & the software still has a huge flaw.
Does it work enough that I want to continue to try to experiment with it - yes
Will I want to see a software update to fix this issue - yes
Do I want to continue to use this switch for the short term - yes
So in short, I will not send it back, yet. There is something going on.

I tried this workaround on 2 different Apple products (Iphone 6 & Ipad Mini 3) and the workaround works on both.

Is it still fatally flawed - yes.

Please can you pass this on to your 2nd or even higher level Engineers as there is still a problem that must get fixed, but this is a partial workaround.

By the way, I also tried changing the screen color settings to see if it was screen contrast or color related - no it is not, the Apple devices are working exactly as they should, it is your software with the bug.

If you want me to try anything else, have your engineers get in touch & we can see what we can do.

I have still lost significant confidence in the product & am very unsure if I want to invest in any more of them to automate other parts of my home at this time.",1.0 out of 5 stars
MD,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2018","Original review was Four Stars, and follows this update, which is just a few days later....

So, as noted below, after some struggles, I did manage to get it connected. BUT, it won't power my heater! It is supposed to, but, today, it started overheating and turning itself (and my heater) off. I woke up freezing cold, and saw that it was off, and learned, via a message in the app, that this stupid plug just overheats and shuts itself off! What it the point?! Very fed up now with Wemo.

Switch was also making electrical crackling sounds, not good. Fire hazard, for sure!

I am returning it, and don't care to try another one. I have ordered one of the units from TP-Link, and I'll see how that does. I did not order one of their ""Mini"" ones, since maybe they are too fragile for a space heater, but, if that's the case, then these companies should be forthright and state, up front, that the small versions are only for a 4 watt lamp, or whatever the limit is.

I found many similar complaints about this useless plug, the overheating problem, and apparently it comes down to a defective unit, since some can power a heater, just fine, and others, like mine, overheat and shut down.

Lousy quality control, minimal customer help, fire hazard, all bad. I'm done with Wemo.

ORIGINAL REVIEW, a few days previous....

Back in 2016, I ordered a Wemo Smart Plug, just to be able to remotely turn on the space heater at home, so my apartment would be nicely warmed up for my arrival, in winter. It worked so well I bought a second one, to do the same at my office. They were the ""full size"" ones, not a Mini version.

As usual, this year, I did not use them over the summer, at all, and have only just now needed them again. This year, the one at the office still works great, but, to my great frustration, the one at home simply refused to work anymore, and I wasted hours following every procedure I could find, to no avail. Wemo does a horrid job, in my opinion, on simplifying use and troubleshooting of these products. You have to hunt through basically other customer experiences and what they did, and the app itself now doesn't even have built-in help, but instead kicks you over to your browser to try and find any solution and you can't even connect to the Internet while trying to set up this thing.

For me, my original less-than-clever plug would not connect to the app anymore, and would also not do anything else after reset, it just blinked orange and would do nothing more, and refused to even go into pairing mode. I finally took a hammer to it, and felt much better!

BUT, based on how well it worked, when it did work, and based on my office one still working great, two years on, I opted to try Wemo again, this time selecting this Mini version, because it doesn't block the other outlet of the wall plug.

At first, I was getting frustrated again, and nearly reached for the trusty hammer, but it WOULD at least go into pairing mode, although it would not complete the set-up. Turns out that smart phones now annoy the smart plug, so I had to change settings on my phone so that no other network would interfere during the set up process. I just turned off 4G, and deleted all networks but one, so that the fussy little plug could complete the set up process.

Then, the app promptly forgot or deleted the plug, and it was gone, and I had to start over. As my hand almost involuntarily started creeping toward the hammer handle, I paused, took a deep breath, and began from the beginning. This time, I knew what to do at least, deleted all my networks but one, turned off 4G, let it set itself up, then added one network back to my phone, so it could talk to the plug, and, voila! Plug showed up in the app and works perfectly to turn the heater on and off.

So, definitely a star lost for very poor assistance with these things. I never did figure out why the other one stopped working, and, with this one, I was entirely on my own to figure out why it would not initially set up, beyond the mention of some ""auto connection"" feature on my phone, which I turned off, but which made no difference.

Just using guesswork, I figured too many available networks was confusing the not-so-smart plug, and that turned out to be the case. But, VERY frustrating process, and there just is not readily available (or easily applicable) help from Wemo on their products, which seems ridiculous to me, and likely is behind some of the many negative reviews.

I know there are a lot of phones and a lot of networks out there, but it seems somebody could make a product that connects more easily, or at least offer some step by step guides for troubleshooting, or something. I'm no tech or computer guy, so I probably don't have a clue how difficult that is to accomplish, and it's likely a case where it's best to just be thankful for a product that can miraculously turn on my heat from anywhere on earth (if my Internet is working, at least) but I can see where folks would give up on products like this, that are just so frustrating sometimes and refuse to do what they are supposedly made to do.

This is certainly as deep as I'll ever dive into ""smart"" products, and, no thanks, don't need my fridge monitoring me or microphones and cameras surveilling my every move. I guess people raised in this nightmare era of social media don't think it's a big deal (despite all that goes wrong due to broadcasting one's life incessantly), but, yup, a semi-smart plug is about all I want to deal with in terms of the Internet of Things or whatever it is called.

So, a star off for frustrations, but, I will say, regarding these, that when they work, they are a big help. I can figure out for myself when to order milk, but smart tech that lets me operate my heater from anywhere is pretty awesome, so four stars given, and deserved, in that regard.

I do recommend, but hide your hammer, because frustrations may come along with this item and help is definitely not easy to find.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Joey,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2020","I purchased my Wemo back in December of 2018. At that time I wanted to make my home more ""smart"" but did not have the budget to do so. I got this little guy as a way to hold myself over until I could invest into something more.

I was disappointed from the start. The thing with Wemo products is the fact you have to use their app to run the equipment. My disappointment was not from the product, but from the Wemo app support. Back in 2018, the app was constantly crashing, struggling to pair with the Wemo product, and made it difficult to use. It got thrown in a drawer, with little likelihood to be used for some time.

Fast forward to May 31, 2020. I move into a new place in May, and I decide to setup my ""smart"" home products again. I have a couple Philips Hue Light Bulbs. Those work no problem. I then try to set up this Wemo, thinking ""no way there are still problems with the app.... It's 2020"".

I download the app. I open the app and become excited. It looks like the app has been improved. Then I get to a screen that says ""Create New Account / Log In"". I look all around for the option to skip the account creation, since I had not done that before, and I only have one product so I don't really want to create an account. No option.

So I have to make an account. After spending 15 minutes (not exaggerating) creating 2 accounts with different emails and passwords, I am having the same issues and I'm frustrated. The passwords will not save when I create the accounts. I call their support team at 7:42pm. After a 9 minute phone call, we are able to follow specific steps to create the account. I say thanks for helping me set this up, I'm pretty tech savvy so I can probably add the device. Thanks for your help.

At 8:02, I call support again. Now that I have an account and I'm in the app, I realize that my Wemo device is not linking to my account. So I can setup the Wemo in their app, but I CAN'T USE IT because it won't pair to the account WEMO MADE ME CREATE. I have had it now. I do everything I can think of, from resetting the router to deleting the app, to switching to a different account, to resetting up the Wemo. All while I'm on hold with customer support for 26 minutes (never got through to someone). I hang up, frustrated and defeated.

I turn to Google and begin trying to find an answer. I come across post after post on Reddit and other forum sites, all with similar, yet different problems with Wemo than what I am facing. This seems to be a new issue no one has had. I try again to reset the app, re-setup the Wemo, etc. Nothing is working.

At 8:56 pm, I call customer support again. I'm on hold, but not for 26 minutes (thankfully), and I talk with someone. She has me do the same steps I have already done and what do you know, it doesn't solve the problem. This time our conversation is 23 minutes and I'm left with the answer ""We will have someone call you in 24-48 hours with an answer"".

The next day I walk by the Wemo, still plugged into the wall. I am frustrated and let out a sigh. I go to the Wemo app and click on Wemo Community. There's a post from Wemo called ""Issues After Wemo update"". I begin to scroll through the comments and there are so many problems being mentioned. Then I find this post. ""I had to download Yonomi to use my Wemo's because they can make a better app for Wemo's products than Wemo can!""

I download Yonomi and not joking, within 30 sections I am able to turn my Wemo On and Off, the simple functions I was hoping the Wemo app would be able to do.

If you made it this far, congrats. I hope what you got from this rant is that I don't want you to end up like me - spending 100 minutes (1 hour 40 minutes) trying to get my Wemo device to work, only to discover there is a 3rd party app made by another company that not only works better than the Wemo app that I am told to use, but took me 30 seconds to setup, as opposed to endless steps with the Wemo app.

Save your money. Don't buy this product. Invest in something that is quality from someone other than Wemo or Belkin.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Richard H,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2018","I purchased two of the WeMo Mini Smart Plugs and initially they connected and worked well with my 6+ year old router. A few weeks ago I updated my router for improved performance and security. I have about two dozen smart devices in my home and I was able to connect all of them to my new router with little fuss, that is, with the exception of the two WeMo Smart Plugs. I worked for hours doing research and doing troubleshooting with success. I called WeMo (Belkin) Tech Support who spent a 1-2 hours with me on the phone. When the plugs didn't work using my phone as a hot spot to eliminate the new router it was determined that both devices were defective. Given an RMA # I paid the postage to return the devices for new ones. When the replacements arrived I still wasn't able to get them to connect to my Wi-Fi router. I sent an email with my case number to support explaining that the problems I was experiencing. They called me back in a timely manner and we spent two hours on the phone doing troubleshooting. We were able to get the WeMos connected using my phone as a Mobile Hotspot and was even able to do a firmware update. Still no luck connecting with my Wi-Fi router. I understand this will be escalated but after spending so many hours without any results I am pretty soured on the devices. Tech Support was pretty good although a bit difficult to understand but the product is a disappointment. I have much cheaper smart plugs from another OEM that have always worked well and easily migrated to the new router using their app; just selected the new router, entered the password and was done. I do not recommend these smart plugs.

Update 2/15/2018: So WeMo Tech Support quickly responded to my follow-up email about the problems I was having with the replacement devices. The problem had been escalated and it was determined that the reason the WeMo Minis couldn't connect to my WiFI was because there was a special character in the SSID of the router!!! The SSID was valid and posed no problems for any of the two dozen or so devices that use WiFi. I selected WeMo (Belkin) because I perceived them to be a big player and have had good experiences previously. I am astounded that any device they would produce would have such a basic and simple flaw that would prevent it from working. Moreover, even with the flaw, it should not take me hours on the phone with tech support before finding the problem. Apparently they were aware of the problem and working on a firmware update to fix it. So add that to the tech support script and include a notice in the packaging for the Mini. The problem is that it is inconceivable that something as simple as special (and permissible) characters in an otherwise valid SSID would not work properly. It speaks volumes about the lack of quality control and testing of their firmware. I'll keep these WeMos but no more Wemo/Belkin wireless products for me.

Another Update 2/15/2018: OK so I changed my SSID and did all of the other things WeMo support said needed to be done and the two Minis worked for a few minutes. When I took them upstairs to use them they would not connect!!! I brought the one I was trying to use and went through the whole setup process again 4-5 times and couldn't get the device to reconnect. I plugged in the second WeMo that was only in my pocket to go up and it wouldn't connect. Basically all I did was walk upstairs with it in my pocket, bring it back down and restarted the WeMo app. I am about beside myself about these things. I reset 4 Echo Dots, 2 Ecobee thermostats and 3 other smart switches in about 10 minutes before I got to trying to use the WeMos for the last hour!! I need to go reconnect everything else with the new SSID but I am done with the WeMos. They are garbage!!!! I might hang on to them to see if there is ever a firmware version that will actually work since I spent about $60 on them but then maybe not - need to sleep on it.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Richard S,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2017","These plug switches have been very frustrating. They work for a few days then stop showing up in the app (both the Android one and the iOS one!). Sometimes they seem to work great and other times, they don't, I can't figure out a pattern. It's not my wifi network, I have 4 commercial grade APs around my house in a full mesh so there's nowhere that I don't have a strong signal. We don't lose pwer either, so I don't know why they seem to fall off the network. There have been multiple firmware updates for them but it doesn't seem to have fixed the stability problems. I would probably return these if I could but I've had them too long. I have one behind my lizard cage to run the day time light, so to recover the switch and get it back on the network I have to move the cage, which isn't small! It's a pain in the butt to deal with, however the switch does seem to follow it's programming and turn on/off at the right times even when it shows as unavailable in the app, so it does seem to be doing the right things.

One other thing to note. If you use iOS with an iPad, the only app in the App Store is the phone version. There is no tablet version of the app. You can run the phone version but it will be on a phone sized screen (or 2x if you hit the enlarge button), but it won't rotate with the orientation of the tablet. It's fine if you have an iPhone (don't know about the X or other new high-res screens though). I use an Android phone (Note 8 running 7.1.1) and it mostly works, except when it shows the devices are not detected. This can happen with the Wemo light switch too, so I don't know if this is an App problem or a device (ioT) problem. Whatever it is, it sucks and is very frustrating. Tech support isn't any help either, so don't bank on them solving your problem unless you have a basic problem.

2/18/19: update - these things are so frustrating, I would not recommend them to anyone! A power outage hits us 2-3 times a year, we just had one, lasting 8 hours (a lot longer than the usual). Neither of the 2 Wemo Mini Smart plugs came back onto the network... the stupid orange flashing light of death. I had to perform the ""hold button and plug in"" reset to recover them.... again. They then wanted to do an upgrade and I started that and they died again... flashing orange light, no network connection. In case you think it's my network, I run a multi-AP network, using 4 Ubiquiti AP-AC devices with a dedicated controller. I've done a signal strength mapping around the house and these are well inside a strong signal area. They are not reliable.

5/15/19: I'm done with these. Had another power outage over the weekend (lasted 20 mins) and the one remaining until didn't come back online until I did a factory reset and had it rejoin my wireless network. I just don't understand how a company can sell such a junky product. I've ordered replacement Amazon smart plugs to replace all the Wemo plugs. Support on these it terrible and the product is unreliable. I'm not going to waste any more time with these. I've been running the Amazon plug in parallel and it hasn't had any of the same problems",1.0 out of 5 stars
Hummingbirds,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2017","UPDATE 3/25/18: Back to 1 star. We now have 7 Wemos.. some dimmer switches, some plugs. After finally getting them all working fine, we noticed there were constant firmware updates EVERY SINGLE DAY. Well one update COMPLETELY TRASHED all of our Wemos!!!!!!!! Because after our power went out briefly today, none of the Wemos will connect to WiFi now!!! They are blinking red, and not detected in the app. So now HOW do we get a firmware fix if there is one, since they can't connect to WiFi?!? They are USELESS now!!! I wish I had all the money back that I spent on all 7 of these. They were too expensive to begin with!

UPDATE (1/28/17): Rating changed from 1 star to 3 stars. For original review, please read below. Here is my updated review.
After returning the first unit and receiving the second one, I found it was still a beast to set up. However, when it finally did connect to the wi-fii, and the firmware was updated, it worked and stayed connected! It has not experienced the disconnect issue that the last one had since successful firmware update. I am glad to see they presumably fixed the issue. So I give it 3 stars now since it was still very difficult to initially set up, and the app (only on certain devices) would not show the ""Hidden Network"" option. I had to use a tablet which was the only device
I had that actually showed that option in the app. But this new one works as expected now.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I have successfully set up and use FOUR (4) of the original v1 WeMo smart plugs. So my review is based on my extensive experience with these, as well as knowledge of networking (as an IT professional). I tried setting up this new style v2 WeMo plug and had nothing but issues. It just would not connect to our wi-fi. The same wi-fi the other WeMo plugs are connected and work great with. I tried setting it up right next to the router, so distance was not an issue. I tried multiple times resetting it to factory defaults, and re-entering the router SSID & password. Still that amber light kept blinking. I actually got it to connect one time after trying for about 3 hours. Then I get a popup in the app about a firmware update. OK, so I tell it to update, and BOOM, the thing gets stuck in the middle of updating. I let it go overnight, and the next morning it's still stuck, and now won't connect again. I'm sorry, but this v2 WeMo has MAJOR problems, and from reading reviews it doesn't appear that it's just mine. I ended up sending this back. I might decide to give it a try again at some point in the future after they iron all the bugs out, because I do like the size of this device. It fits nicely into the outlet and allows for another plug in the outlet above/below it. So for the asthetics I give it one star. Other than that, it was just a major fail for me. If do I buy another one, though, I will definitely update this review with my experience with that one.",1.0 out of 5 stars
FON,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2018","I want to give you a full report so you don't waste your time. I'm a very technical person, I have installed Schlage Sense Smart Deadbolt, Chamberlain Garage Door Opener, LIFX Lights, Sonos One, and of course Amazom Echo Show and Spot in our home to name a few. I use an Orbi 2 Satelite Mesh System to run WiFi throughout our home. Our WiFi Strength is so strong I get a signal at the furthest distance from the Orbi way in my backyard I have an older Belkin WeMo Insight Switch Smart Plug which although was a little quirky setting it up and establishing a connection, I was able to get it to work eventually. It took a couple of times and resets but since then it has worked without any problems. Even if power is lost it reconnects again when the power returns.

NOT this Wemo Mini. I bought 2 of them and after 1 1/2 hours of trying I could not get either one of them to be recognized and connect to my WiFi Network. Yes, I did all of the trouble shooting you can imagine. I Reset them to the Factory Defaults, Deleted the Wemo App (iPhone Version - I'm using the iPhone 7 Plus with the most current OS) and reinstalled the App. I restarted my iPhone. I turned off Cellular Data, I plugged them into different outlets in my home, in fact 3 feet away from my Router and Orbi.... NOTHING. At first the set up seemed to be going smoothly, I found the device under my WiFi Settings, selected it and then went through the next steps in the Wemo App. I entered a name for the device, entered my email address as required, selected my WiFi Network and then nothing. It just keeps saying it's connecting but it never does. Sometimes at this point the App just quits.

I know how usless Belkin Tech Support is so I wouldn't even bother to call them, I'm more tech savvy then they are. But I did go to their Support Forum and YES these Wemo Mini Smart Plugs are plagued with issues. Mostly just like I'm experiencing. For the lucky few who actually finally got them to connect, after hours of trying, it wasn't for long. If power was lost they would not reconnect and the process had to be started all over again. For others they would not keep a connection, they'd work for a while and then stop. Some folks the device wouldn't even appear in the App. The list of issues went on and on.

Thre trouble shooting page on Belkins web site has a long list of things to do if you can't get them to work.. REALLY Belkin you know of the many issues and you can't fix the problem. Oh they will gladly take your information and get you to a ""Level 2 Specialist"" who know less then you do! Oh an apparently it has been noted on their web site that different production runs of the Wemo Mini will have differnt results. OMG!

Anyway, I sent these back to Amazon for a full refund. I hope I save some people from having to waste their time and the aggravation with a product that just does not work as it should, especially for what they cost! I once really like them but I'm done with Belkin!",1.0 out of 5 stars
E. Austin,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2017","UPDATE

Please dont EVER try and update the WiFi on these... you will BRICK THEM. I have now tried several times, over... and over... and over... just like it says on the device itself... over... and over... and over...

They will not show up in my app. So I visit wemo.com and what do they tell me? Re-install the app. Um... ok Wemo, I now reinstalled the app and your stuff STILL WONT WORK!!!!!!!!!

These are not good for even paperweights anymore. Just take a hammer to them. Else, buy something else.

Original Review

Bad me for not reading deep enough in the description that these are not Z-wave, nor are they Zigbee. Therefore, they do not work with Wink. These require you to install (yet another) app on your phone to setup. I did not want yet another app to install on my phone, or another hub, or another skill... and its my fault I didn't read too closely that it's not Z-Wave or Zigbee.

Why use Z-Wave or Zigbee? Because they work with so many smart home hubs as well as Alexa and Google. WiFi devices require you to install yet another resource-hungry app on your phone or another skill to Alexa or Google. WiFi devices like WeMo also only carry as far as your WiFi signal carries - thats it. Zigbee and Z-Wave devices talk to each other - sort of a ""mesh"" that pass along commands from one to another. In my house I have Zigbee devices that far outreach any of my four WiFi networks.

So how does this unit compare? Eh... slow start up compared to my Zigbee outlet. It took this WeMo about a minute after plugging it in to an outlet before it would start working. Compare that to about 15 seconds on my Zigbee outlet. Also, I can place my Zigbee outlet in the fringe areas of my WiFi networks and know it will work because it talks to the other Zigbee devices that are nearer to it. This WeMo does not play well on the 5ghz networks, and thus has a hard time getting commands from floors away.

It seems to work great line-of-sight and on the same floor as my WiFi router.

I like that it doesn't consume more than one outlet space in real estate on the outlet. The button is right there on the front, no searching the sides to turn the device on.

In all, I'm sure these WiFi devices are fine for those who do not have a complex smart home setup, rather they just want something simple, maybe a few devices and not much more. If you own a Wink Hub and need something Z-wave or Zigbee, don't stop here, keep moving along. Again, my own fault for not reading the description closely enough, however I think I have justified above why it deserves the ""It's okay"" rating.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Erin,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2020","FINAL REVIEW: It's December 2021, and after having more and more problems with my WEMO app and Google Home's integration, I decided I was done with WEMO. My husband bought six TP-Link Kasa plugs instead, and we love those because they work, the app works with more features, and we were able to get these installed and working in about five minutes each. At this point, I wouldn't recommend WEMO to anyone.

ORIGINAL REVIEW (READ FURTHER FOR FIRST UPDATE): I've ordered three of these so far, one in 2017, two during the same week in 2020. The one in 2017 has been good in some ways but a hassle in others. The installation was a pain, and on my iPhone 7, I still have to refresh the app home page multiple times to find out how many minutes are left on the timers (my husband's iPhone 6 doesn't have this problem). But overall, I've found this plug helpful for turning lamps on and off during vacations and scheduling lights to turn on and off at Christmas. In fact, I've had just two larger issues with the 2017 WEMO; the first was easily resolved by a helpful employee at WEMO, and the other was resolved (as were other problems with devices that connect to wifi) when we moved to our new house and switched Internet providers.

That said, I bought two more WEMO plugs this past week. They are now installed and working well so far. But the two plugs I received this week were in different packaging (neither frustration-free, I assure you), and the one that appears to be newer was a 3-minute install compared to the one that appears to be older, which required a lot more jumping through hoops. I would recommend these regardless because after you get them set up, they are worth the money.

One more thing: I connected these switches to Alexa for the first time this afternoon. I had to Google how to do it, but in about 7 minutes, I had all three switches successfully connected.

ETA (10/23/2020): I woke up this morning to all non-working WEMO switches. In about an hour, I was able to fix all but one by myself. I waited on hold about 10 minutes before reaching someone who spent another hour helping me reset, unlink, and reassociate the last switch, but then we reintegrated with Google Home and had to reset, unlink, and reassociate all of them all over again. I still like these, but if I were buying such a product again, I'd research for a better option and, if I found one, I would likely buy that instead. The process is just a little too tedious, especially when you have a lot of other tasks on your plate.",1.0 out of 5 stars
adamg,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2020","**Original review, scroll down for 3 week update. **
I’ve been using Wemo for Christmas light control, both indoors and now outdoors. I have 3 Wemo outlets that I bought in 2016 or so (pre-homekit) and I just bought 3 more of the latest indoor outlets and an outdoor outlet. I also moved recently so the old outlets would need to be set up again. I tried to get them set up but the process is extremely buggy. I finally got my old 3 outlets set up, but only 2 show up in the Wemo app and only 1 is actually usable from there. However, my Alexa app finds all three switches and I can at least reliably control them from there. Fine. So then I go to set up the new (HomeKit ready) switches, and the Wemo app simply will not recognize these things exist. Sometimes it’ll show them in the list, but select it to turn on/off and it just says not connected. Well my router app shows all switches are definitely connected to wifi. Funny thing is I CAN set the new ones up in HomeKit no problem, but the Alexa app won’t find the new ones since the Wemo app won’t find them. so at the moment I’m stuck controlling half my Wemo outlets with the Alexa app and half with HomeKit, which I had to set up an iPad on just so I could do a scheduled routine. And only one of 7 actually work within the Wemo app. I remember a couple years ago the Wemo app being buggy, but not this bad. You’d think Belkin would have it figured out by now. Don’t get these, find something more reliable.

**3 week update:
I was eventually able to get all 7 of my Wemo plugs (3 old, 3 new, 1 outdoor) working in the Wemo app and Amazon Alexa. Good thing I have Alexa because for whatever reason the schedules in the Wemo app just don’t work. I want my Christmas lights on from 5pm to 10pm. Schedule is there, Wemo says it’s active, I can control the lights in the app manually, but they just don’t turn on/off when the schedule activates/deactivates. I was able to get the Alexa app to accomplish this via a routine and that worked fine for a couple weeks, but yesterday my 3 newer Wemo plugs stopped following that as well so now they just have to be manually controlled (Alexa app says “server is unresponsive” but I can still control the old wemos from Alexa??). Next year I plan to trash all my Wemos and get something that actually works reliably. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2017","I've already got an Alexa/Echo in the house with a Phillips Hue setup going, so I'm trying to extend my smart home options. I wanted the wemo mini for the simple task of shutting down the entertainment center in the family room at night to save some vampire energy.

I simply cannot get this thing to work. I've got two routers in the house and I've tried both so I don't think it's an issue of weak signal (one router is literally in the same room I'm trying to get working). The printed quick start instructions are useless, saying ""connect to the device wifi and then start the app"". Ok, fine - but then the app says ""cannot connect to the device, connect to your home wifi and start the app."" Ok, fine. Then the app says, ""Go into settings, connect to the device wifi, and restart the app."" How many times am I expected to do this? I tried various combinations for over half an hour before packing it in for the night.

I see other reviewers saying ""some problems connecting"". no kidding. What I'm wondering is, once it's connected, how am I supposed to have any faith at all that I'll be able to connect to it when I need it? Sometimes it tells me it's trying to connect to Cellular. What's that all about? That's never mentioned anywhere in the setup.

The app is weak as well, too slow for modern acceptable standards, and no clear feedback about what you're supposed to do at various points. Sometimes I see ""looking for devices"" and then just a black screen with a pen and a settings icon in the corner. It should recognize that it's found no devices and show me what to do next, not just give me a blank screen where there's nothing to edit.

I'm a geek and I hate wasting my money so I'll probably give it another shot to get it working, but even if I do I'm not coming back to update my review. Any average user who expects to take it out of the box and for it to just work is going to be sadly out of luck. You're not supposed to have to fight with your devices.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Mike,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2017","I am currently in the process of outfitting my home with a number of smart products. Currently, the core ""drivers"" of my setup include Philips Hue , Logitech Harmony , Yonomi, and Amazon Alexa for voice control (via multiple Echos and Echo Dots ). After seeing the multitude of excellent reviews for this product, and the fact that it's listed as a #1 Best Seller on Amazon, I decided to give the Wemo Mini Smart Plug a try. I ordered 3 of these. 2 of the plugs I received were Rev. B00 (green box) and one was Rev. A00 (blue box).

Unfortunately, this product is a NIGHTMARE to setup for households with modern home networking solutions. The device has multiple undocumented requirements your home network must meet in order to use this product. This product has issues with detecting and connecting to 5 Ghz bandwidths; however, it did work correctly with a 2.4 GHz bandwidth. Be sure to check your router's capabilities before purchasing this product.

This product also DOES NOT SUPPORT WIFI PASSWORDS WITH SPECIAL CHARACTERS. This is quite inexplicable in 2017. Nearly every security expert recommends that you secure your home WiFi with a strong password that includes special characters. Despite being unable to support strong passwords, the biggest frustration with this issue is that it was not documented anywhere in the product's packaging, manual, or app. After spending hours trying to complete the initial setup on these plugs, I had to discover both of these undocumented requirements by scouring web forums before finally finding out why the plugs would not complete setup.

PROS:
- Small form factor is a superior design to many other smart plugs out there
- Works with Amazon Echo devices

CONS:
- Setup is a NIGHTMARE if your router broadcasts a 5 GHz bandwidth
- Incompatible with strong/complex WiFi passwords that use special characters
- No dimming feature

If you have a home network running on a 2.4 GHz bandwidth that does not have any special characters in your WiFi password, this product may work well for you. If you do purchase these plugs and happen to have an Android device, I found that the HomeInTouch(WeMo) app is far more responsive and quicker to use than the official Belkin app.",1.0 out of 5 stars
M. LaPlante,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2017","I was excited to try out this product. It was one of the best sellers on Amazon and seemed to have a decent rating as far as smart plugs go. What I wound up getting was one of the most disappointing tech experiences I can ever recall having.

Out of the box, there are effectively no instructions other than to check out the Wemo website, which is basically an ad for more Wemo products. Once you figure out that you need to install the mobile app, you can start *attempting* to get this thing to connect to wifi. I say attempting, because, despite sitting in the same room as the access point, it consistently refuses to connect to anything.

After Googling and finding a lot of similar problem reports (blinking amber light, no connectivity), I quickly mastered the ""reset"" technique. I was able to achieve a wifi connection after resetting and reconfiguring, and at one point after a number of attempts, got it fully working (I thought). It sat for maybe an hour or two, until I went to show my spouse the new gadget... and found it had fallen off the network. Back to square one.

The app at one point managed to tell me there was a firmware update available. It didn't offer this the first few times through setup, and there's no way to check directly, but it didn't matter, because the firmware update never successfully installed. It would start installing, then inevitably wind up back in ""no network"" blinking mode until you again reset it and started the whole process over again. Maybe the firmware update would have made it work better... no way to tell.

As far as the (Android) app goes, it's fairly awful in and of itself. Clunky UI, hard to navigate, lots of freezing, and just severely buggy. The poor rating in the Play Store suggests I'm not alone in feeling this way.

Despite a successful career in technology that includes mobile support and networking, after several hours I could not get this device to work. It's shocking to me that they would bring such a poorly executed product to market. I'm not the kind of person who returns products after purchasing, but I returned this as unusable. I'll be avoiding Wemo products in the future.",1.0 out of 5 stars
J. Hannah,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2019","I found it easy to setup with Apple Homekit. I also have Alexa through out the house so I rely on it for voice commands. Alexa seems to rely on a cloud server to relay commands to this outlet to make it work. It’s spotty at best but most of the time it just doesn’t work with Alexa. When Alexa fails I can ask Siri and it works every time. Why can’t there be any plugs that are compatible with both Homekit and Alexa without issue? This shouldn’t be so hard. Looking forward to the new plugs from Philips Hue that connect via Zigbee. My Philips lighting work flawlessly with both Alexa and Homekit so I’m guessing that their new plugs will too.

Edit 2-2-2020: I switched out all WeMo Mini plugs for iHome iSP6 plugs and now Alexa and HomeKit work perfectly. I’ve had several iHome plugs for a few years and they just work. They also have a way to check the status of the cloud service if they ever drop out and you want to know what’s going on. Win win for me. Fail for WeMo

Edit 5-18-23: Belkin WeMo has announced that they are not going to support the new Matter standard that they previously committed to. This has basically rendered the new Thread enabled smart plug useless and for those of us who bought several of these plugs (10 in my case) we are out of luck and they got our money. NEVER again will I buy anything from Belkin. Going to look at competing manufacturers for hardware that will be supported and who seem to actually care about their promises and their customers.

Edit 6-1-23: I settled on Kasa Smart Plugs with Matter support. So far they are much cheaper, more reliable and offer many customizable options like Auto-Off Timer, Power Protection, LED Control and Default State among others. Matter support allows me to connect to both HomeKit Siri and Alexa natively without relying on a cloud server relay. Belkin could have added these features to WeMo and put some effort into their firmware to make them reliable but they chose to take our money and ghost us. Promising Matter support and then backing down from it months later is just lame. Shame on Belkin!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Artem S,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2020","I purchased 3 Wemo Smart Plugs 3 years ago and used them diligently, on a daily basis since.
They were decent for their time. VERY bulky (which can cause various problems with sockets), decent connectivity, fair integration into smart apps (set up can be somewhat tedious).
However Wemo started to ship out Firmware updates a year ago and these have been causing MASSIVE issues for me (and frankly many other users). They brick the smart plugs and force you to go through the set up again (tedious), and most recently, they required you to assign an email address to your account so you can control your smart devices. This is presumably to datamine data from you, but the company will sell it as ""seamless integration for other smart devices"".
Normally, wouldn't be a problem. Except the verification email never come. And the smartplugs cannot be used and updated without your account verified. Which means this new update bricks your smartplugs and smart home completely. Once again, one would think ""surely this can't be that big of a deal, let's chat with customer support and get it fixed"".
Oh but wait. There isn't any. Your options, and I cannot believe this is real, are from 3 choices: Phone number (was on hold for 2 hours with no indication how ""many more people"" were ahead or an estimated time to speak to someone - i.e. there is nobody, just a permanent on hold line), Facebook, and Twitter. I am not kidding. Social media is the recommended medium to contact Wemo for technical support. They themselves recommend this.
At this point, I knew this company was trash. I reached out and they half-assedly got back to me 10 hours later. ""Did you check your spam folders? Send us a screenshot of the issue."" I mean really guys? This isn't how you trouble shoot technical issues.
Anyway, my smart plugs still don't work, never got a verification email, and no indication this problem will be resolved quickly. I purchased smart plugs from another company.
Take my review as a warning. Wemo is done. They've recently shut down a line of products. The company isn't doing well and has no support for existing products, which they WILL break.

David,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2017","UPDATE: After trying many times to reconnect only to have it disconnect from the wifi (yes, even with the updated 1.18.2 Wemo app) I'm throwing in the towel and retuning this. It can never stay connected for more than a few hours while my TP-Link plug had 0 problems since day 1 of owning it. Disappointed in Wemo and this product.

Packaging -- As good as it comes. Protects the device, and makes it aesthetically pleasing while unboxing

Setup -- Long story short, it's a pain. My TPLink smart plug was a breeze to set up in comparison. However, here are some tips that worked for me (iOS):
1. Download the Wemo app
2. Plug in the mini smart plug
***3. Turn on airplane mode on your iPhone*** --> this solved all my issues of the app losing signal to the plug!
4. Turn on wifi, and connect to your plug once it blinks green/amber color
5. Open the Wemo app and go through the setup process
If you previously tried to setup the plug and failed, forget the plug on your wifi list, and uninstall/reinstall the Wemo app, then go back to step 2
Hope that helps anyone who got frustrated like me

Alexa -- connects easily to it and works as intended. It seems to work better with Alexa than TPLink's smart plug in terms of performing the task it should be doing. I'll be switching to Google Home Mini, so hopefully it'll work fine with that as well.

Wemo App -- Setup was terrible and the app (version 1.18.1) crashed a few times trying to get it working, however once it does work, the app works as intended. It is also slower than TPLink's app, which is not saying much to be honest since their app is slow as well. I have it currently setup to turn on/off my christmas lights on a schedule and it has been working so far.

Overall, not bad for the $20 I spent. I'll keep updating this review if problems arise. Would I buy this again? If they can update the app to simplify their setup process, then yes. However if they do not, I think I would stick with TPLink.",1.0 out of 5 stars
D. J. Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2021","I've had a number of WeMo plugs for >3 years, including 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gen plugs. These things started off OK, but have gotten less and less reliable over time as they've tried to ""improve"" them. They cost 2-3x what other smart plugs cost, but they are way worse.

What works:
These are probably acceptable if you want to use them out of the box with Apple HomeKit.

What doesn't work:
Everything else.

My 1st gen plugs do not have the scan code on them, so setting them up now is a bit of a manual process. That being said, I was able to get them to connect to the WeMo app, and from there, configured automation and was able to use them within the Google Home application.

More recent plugs, with the HomeKit QR code on them, are a different story. You start by setting them up in the WeMo app, but then the iOS scanning hijacks the entire process and force-connects you to HomeKit. While it will set the plug up in HomeKit, it does NOT gracefully add the device to the WeMo app- which then means there's NO WAY for Google Home to get to it.

One might wonder why I want to put it into the Google Home app if I'm an iOS/iPhone user. Simple - I have a number of other automation devices (including Nest Thermostats, Google Assistants, etc.) that all reside in the Google Home application. GH has it's own issues, but it is at least functional. HomeKit clearly is designed in the Apple ""walled garden"" approach, making it all but impossible to get it working with other devices.

One last rant: In May 2020, Belkin switched their systems to a new security protocol. Unfortunately, when they did this, they scrapped all of the old accounts. They did NOT make any effort to port the old information into a new account for you. In my case, I have about 8 plugs, each with a fairly involved automation setup. Lost all of that work when converting to the new ""secure"" account setup. [And if you're betting on HomeKit to be secure, you're a very trusting soul.]",1.0 out of 5 stars
ebayamazondealshopper,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2020","I purchased four more of these units to maintain parity with the one legacy wemo outlet I had been given as a gift. All I wanted was to automate three more lamps as I had done with my old wemo outlet. We are an Apple family for many purposes but not home automation. I did not know we would be forced to use it with Apple Home if we registered the plugs with an iPhone. Once I got that sorted, I was informed that they would need a dedicated device that is always at home (not a choice- a requirement). The new outlets wouldn't even work without moving to the Home App- I couldn't just use the old Wemo app. I also had to keep the old Wemo app because the Apple Home can't perform device updates without the Wemo app. The Apple Device you need at home has to be on OS 10 or higher, so that eliminated the old junkers that I was happy to dedicate. I CAN'T use any of our iphones because the app won't allow it. FINALLY, I have all new outlets loaded on an apple device running OS 10 that is always at my house. I have apple home and wemo on this dedicated device. I select to run the product updates in Home that redirect me to WEMO and WEMO doesn't recognize or find my devices that it showing ""might be around"". Moreover, Apple ""scenes"" or ""automation"" stink by comparison to a simple on/off timer with the old WEMO app. I can get the lamps to automatically turn on when they are recognized in my Home app but I can't get them to turn off on timer. I believe that if I were to carry around the legacy ipad dedicated to WEMO outlets, I could get the rooms to recognize me when I walked in or out. If that worked, what about the rest of my family not carrying the legacy dedicated device...? I think people get my point - NOT SMART. IT CREATES A NIGHTMARE OF HEADACHES AND STILL DOESN'T DO SIMPLE ON/OFF. I purchase almost everything on Amazon. I rarely write reviews but this is unacceptable.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Robert R.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2019","I have a small two story house. The wi-fi router is upstairs. Everything works intermittently with Alexa, but the two downstairs Wemo smart plugs lose connection almost daily.

I replaced them with Amazon Smart Plugs and no more issues at all, so I'm now going to replace ALL the Wemo devices with Amazon Smart Plugs and get Wemo and the ongoing aggravation it brings me out of my life once and for all.

I've struggled with this ridiculous product (as have my friends) for years now.

The superiority of the Amazon Smart Plug was driven home just by how simple and quick it was to reset the plug and change it to work where the Wemo plug had been working. It was a couple minutes. To then struggle and reset and try to get the Wemo plug working again upstiars with something else was a nightmare anew. Thirty five minutes of trying over and over before finally it worked, but to get it to work I had to delete the Wemo app from my phone, reboot the wi-fi, reset the Wemo devices, and so on over and over.

Even then it's precarious.

And delete a name and change it to something new and it's never really deleted.

Bedroom 1 Lamps still works after I changed it to Master Bedroom Lamps, and even though I've deleted that name in the app, it still works. This inability to EVER clear these devices out FOR REAL leads to problems getting them to work with other devices.

Just say NO instead of WEMO.

It's absolutely awful, always has been, and they've had years to improve it but can't or won't.

Much as I hate to send anymore money Amazon's way, the Amazon Smart Plug is infinitely superior to investing in Wemo -- unless you like hours and hours of your time lost, maddening ongoing problems simply trying to turn off and on a light, and so on.

tom faulkner,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2018","Half of the time it doesn't respond to the app button. The app itself is slow, hangs frequently with no way to back out without closing and re-opening the app. The app is terribly broken when setting up a device.

I want to expand on that last point. Android devices don't like to be attached to networks that don't have internet connectivity, and in many versions of Android the user can't prevent the phone from disconnecting from a network that doesn't have internet. The setup process for these switches, and presumably the entire Wemo line, requires connecting to the device's own WiFI network, which of course has no internet access. When the app sees that the network has disconnected, rather than either waiting to see what the phone does, or telling the user to switch back, the app closes and re-opens, starting the already slow process over again. Because of this there is a good chance the user will never be able to setup the device.

I tried to reset the device because it doesn't do anything with the rules set for it 95% of the time. I had a simple rule, when I'm home, based on Nest, and the time is after 6PM turn on the light, but this only worked a few times in the three months I've had it. Frustrated with this, and not being able to connect the Wemo to Google Home due to an error with no explanation from the Wemo site, I reset it and had to deal with the issue above again.

It's going in the trash if Amazon won't give a refund. I wish I knew what to recommend instead. I'm going to shop for an alternative, and if I don't find one it is trivial to do with an Arduino or Raspberry Pi for anyone that has the knowledge to do so.

I would definitely recommend against this, especially for people who use the Android ecosystem or Google Home. I don't have an iOS device, so I don't know if they also dislike being connected to WiFi without internet, but I would guess they have similar behavior.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Robin,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2017","Update 1-2-18
Lost power last night and am still trying to get the Wemo Mini Smart Plug reconnected. I have a TP-Link Bulb that also needed to be reconnected and it was simple with no issues, took a couple of minutes. I have spent several hours today trying to get the Wemo reconnected, multiple reboots of the router, multiple resets of the plug and even tried multiple devices to try to configure it. This has been a complete waste of my day. Terrible product.

Update 10-16-17
Continued connectivity issues. If it's unplugged, a power outage or just a simple router reboot and looses wifi connectivity it can take hours if not days for it to reconnect. Nothing can force it to reconnect it's just a wait and see how long it will take this time situation. I've never had a piece of hardware have this many issues reconnecting to wifi after a disconnect.

First off, the quick set up instructions are deceiving as it's not as easy to set up as they claim. It is by no means difficult but the simple set up is misleading. Second, you WILL need to provide an email to complete the set up process. Third, if an update is available it will automatically update and it will take forever even with a fast 25MB fiber connection. Once it was set up it worked as expected for several days until I decided to unplug it to move some cords around. After being unplugged it would not see my wifi, the same wifi it was just connected to in the exact same location. After many hours of trouble shooting and 3 days later it finally recognized my wifi and I was able to set it up again. So far it seems to be working as expected but the wifi recognition issues appear to be pretty common. I found MANY forum posts describing the same situation I was experiencing and the same resolution that it just randomly started working again.

Lyle's Grandpa,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2019","Received this product last November. After finally getting it set up it worked for about a month, but with a few glitches like having to restart it or unplug it and try again. That would usually get it to work. Then you would get ""lights are not responding, please check your network"". Our router is withing 10 feet of both the Echo Dot and the WEMO switch. You could control it with the WEMO app on the phone but not through Echo Dot. Jump through more hoops and sometime you were able to get it working again for a short while, then in February 2019 it quit completely and we just unplugged it and went back to the light switch on the wall.
Finally in March on the advice of our son, we purchased the tp-link Wi-Fi mini plugs. The install was very simple and have never given us an issues at all. We even have the smart plugs controlling lights in the upstairs bedrooms without any issues which is amazing considering the fact that the Wi-Fi router is located in the living room downstairs.
I tried to go through the warranty process for the WeMo plug and that was a real pain. You could barely understand the person at the help desk and after repeated attempts to get it working, she finally told me that customer service would be calling me back to set up the RMA. 2 days later, I get an email telling me they thought it was too late to call me because of the time difference and suggested I call back. I would have to pay shipping to return the product as well. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN! I'm just going to through this thing in the trash. Why go through all these headaches only to get another unreliable product when you can but the TP-Link Mini plug for $17.99 or a two pack at Target for $34.99 and have what has so far proven to be a vastly superior product.

George B.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2019","At first it was relatively easy to integrate this product. I had two of them in my house. The problems started when I tried to integrate the third unit.

The third unit got stuck in Updating and no amount of coaxing could get it to budge. I tried resetting, powering down my phone, powering down the unit all to no avail. Finally I followed some suggestions, made by WeMo to power down my router and reset the devices, and I plugged the problem device into a socket next to the router and the unit finally updated.

However, the router power down broke the connection of the previously good devices. Now they can't reconnect to the network and just flash amber. If I reset them, unplug and plug them back in they will flash two colors, and I try to add them back in. Now things get really iffy, sometimes the app tells me my device is working on the network, but the device never connects and sits there flashing two colors; or other times no amount of reentering the password will reconnect the device.

I'm not sure what the problem is, whether the app maxes out at 2 devices or whether the resets and power cycles broke something in the unit; but the bottom line is that these two things will no longer connect to the network.

With software and hardware this shoddy, I have to wonder whether I'm better off just unplugging all this junk and risking a hacker getting into my network through the device.

I would save your money and avoid this unit. You may get lucky and then again you may not. I imaging Nest will come out with a product like this in the near future, if they haven't already. I own two nest thermostats and 4 nest alarms. Never had a problem, never had a connectivity issue (unless the router was legitimately down).

Tony S.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2020","I started installing Wemo devices about 6 or 7 years ago. Over the years, I bought and deployed about 40 of the various devices, including the in-wall switch, plugs, bulbs and even a couple of Wemo Maker's. For years, I gave Belkin a chance to fix the various problems with their devices and most of all, the app. I have given these guys lots of time and lots of ""benefit of doubt"" that the issues would eventually be fixed. I made a huge investment in these products, and I was a strong advocate and supporter of the product. I'm done waiting, and no longer a supporter...

The biggest issue is the app itself. It constantly crashes, sometimes takes 3 or 4 launches to get it to stay up. Beyond that, the devices basically work fine, aside from a few botched firmware upgrades, after which I had to factory reset every device and reconfigure them one by one (a time consuming task when you have 40+ of them). Add to that, the fact that they all work ONLY in the 2.4Ghz WiFi band, and there are a lot of potential reasons for their instability.

If you are considering home automation, DON'T go with Wemo. You'll make a huge investment, and will eventually be sorry you did.

I have started installing a competing product, the ""Leviton Decora Smart"" product line. So far (it's still early), I have been quite happy with them. The app has NEVER crashed, not once, and the devices work in the 5Ghz band where there is a lot less interference. Price is comparable for the in-wall products (like the swith and dimmer), and way less for the plug product (about $15 for the plug).

Do yourself a favor, DON'T make the same mistake I did. AVOID WEMO and go with Leviton! You will be much happier in the long run!

QSFYC - Support Guy,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2017","Just got off the phone with WeMo Support. They are sending out an RMA replacement stating that the new device I purchased from Amazon is defective. What is strange is I own four other WeMo devices and this is the first one that failed.

I will add additional comments once the new device arrives,,..

***Update***

The new WEMO device from Belkin Support arrived this weekend and I attempted to set it up on my network. Unfortunately it took failed to join my network. So, instead of digging through Belkin's Help Forums I did a simple google search and found there is a known issue with the WeMo Mini Device. The problem is the device does not like special characters in your Wifi password. So, just for grins I changed my wifi password temporally to ""thisisatest"" and the device connected! So, I did more digging and also found that Belkin was aware of this issue and release a firmware update to address this problem. So, I left the device online for a few moments and the firmware update kicked off. Once the WeMo Mini completed the update. I tried to reset the password back to my secure password that includes special characters and it failed to connect to my network. Like before when I switch it to ""thisisatest"" it connected just fine.

To make a long story short, I have shipped back the WeMo Mini and decided to purchase WeMo Switch Smart Plug. I currently own two of them and neither had a problem with special characters. It's currently unavailable on Amazon, but I am sure once the negative reviews flow in concerning WeMo mini's limitation with wifi passwords. It will probably pop back up on Amazon's site. Until then if you use special characters in your WiFi password stay away from the WeMo Mini until they address this issue. Now if you would like to get your hands on a WeMo Switch Smart Plug that works with Amazon Alexa. You can find them on Ebay and Newegg around the same price as Amazon.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Boomer1950,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2018","I need to re-visit the review I wrote originally. The timer aspect of the plugs & their ability to conduct electricity work fine. It's their primary purpose that doesn't work - remote control.

The WEMO Mini failure to remain connected to mu iPhone app is only exceeded by the WEMO Insight plug. Somewhere between 10% (for the Insight) & 50% (for the Mini) of the time the plugs ""aren't detected"" by their app - I gave up using Apply Homekit some time ago. If the WEMO app can't see the plugs, what chance does the Apple app have?

Totally unreliable tech. Completely. Worst tech product I've ever purchased. I would recommend against purchase until WEMO figures out how to make the ""remote"" part of remote control work.

I have 4 Minis & 1 Insight - none of them are reliable. NONE.

Old review that turned out to be WRONG.

<<I really like my new WEMO smart plugs. Being able to schedule lights to come on & off without a timer is great. I always have my lights turning on & off irregularly when I'm out of town.

My only complaint so far is that Apple Homekit occasionally loses contact with the plugs. Opening the WEMO app quickly restores the connection. I don't know if this is a flaw in the WEMO plugs or the Homekit app. Slightly bothersome, but not a big issue.

I wish the WEMO plugs were a little less expensive, but I'm hoping you get what you pay for.>>

You do NOT get what you pay for with WEMO. I haven't tried the less expensive plugs, but it's not possible they are worse than these expensive WEMO plugs. If they conduct electricity & can be controlled by the button on the plug, they're as good as a WEMO. If a cheaper model will control the plug using an iPhone app, then they're infinitely better than WEMO.",1.0 out of 5 stars
amazon_addict,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2018","I have an older Wemo plus and switch that we’ve had for close to two years with really no issues. I wanted to expand on my smart house set up and preferred to stay with Wemo to avoid another interface and go with a brand I had previous experience with. I have to say, what a MISTAKE! I’ve never had such an issue or so much frustration from a product that really should not be relatively straightforward! The set up seems very simple yet I spent hours trying to get this operational and it just would not connect to my network. I read a helpful review here that I needed to unplug my older style Wemo plug. So after hours of annoyance, I tried this and it immediately worked. Unfortunately, I had to move it to another outlet (literally just 2 minutes later) and it could no longer be detected. I tried to repeat the set up, reset to factory settings about 30 times and still no luck. I finally called tech support. I spent almost 2 HOURS on the phone with them and got no where! In fact the steps their tech support told me to take caused my older Wemo plug and light switch completely disappear from my app — to the point it looked like I had just installed their app. The support agent was no longer able to help and had to escalate to level 2 - telling me I will get a call in 24-48 hours. I spent another hour trying to get my devices back and while i see them now, they still show not detected about every other time I login. Bottom line, this product lacks quality and a stable and mature software to support it. Their support, while they tried, was not much help. It is absolutely not worth the frustration and as a previous Wemo customer, I am super disappointed. I returned the newer plug to Amazon, and won’t be buying ANY Wemo products again.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Bob,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2019","I made a huge commitment to wemo about 3 years ago. I have 7 in-wall units, 3 outdoor units and 2 plug attachments. I am very sorry I went with wemo. The setup is terrible. You connect to homekit 6 times and it rarely makes it into the wemo app. You try to connect it to wifi and it fails. Even once you have it connect, it will mysteriously drop the connection after a couple months. On some wall outlets, the scheduling worked and on others it never did. Sometimes the scheduling randomly shifts a couple hours. Correct interval, wrong start time.

It's horrible. Stay away.

Original review below:
I installed 3 of these. They worked in the end, but it was a bit frustrating along the way. Sadly, all the instructions are in the documentation so I have no one but myself to blame.

A few tricks:

1. Make sure you are on the 2.4 ghz network
2. I set up my Wemos on the guest network, but had to disable the guest policies during the setup
3. If you reboot the Wemo, it won’t connect to the internet unless you first disable the guest network
4. It needs to connect to the internet to get the time so your schedules work
5. It works fine on the guest network as you are connecting “remotely”
6. In settings, connect directly to the wifi, don’t go through Home Data setup. There are 2 choices on the wifi page.
7. In settings, make sure that the wemo app can access Home Data. This was the trickiest thing to figure out because it isn’t obvious like the other things are (in retrospect). When the Wemo app installs, it asks if you want to let the app access Home Data. I just automatically hit “no”, because I don’t use iOS Home Data. But the app needs to connect to Home Data to setup the WiFi.",1.0 out of 5 stars
LegoDude,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2018","Original review was below, a 5 star review. I've since changed it to 1 star, since I'm fed up with what happens when one decides to lose its settings, whether from a power outage, or you moving a plug, or just losing its settings on its own. Right now of the 8 of these I have, three don't show up in the app anymore although Alexa controls them just fine still. Usually you have to reset them, then re-add them, but I can't even do that anymore, asking me for homekit junk I don't use, or wanting to scan a code on the BACK of them that you can't even SEE during setup since it's plugged in and that is against the wall. So after all the stupidity of trying to keep them working, I've replaced them with a better option and am throwing them not, not even going to try to sell for a couple bucks or give to someone else, they're that useless.

If these were more consistent, I'd give 5 stars. I love that they work well (when they work) and I absolutely love the Amazon Alexa voice integration. Nothing better Telling Alexa to turn on the Lego table, or anything else, and have them turn on via voice. And the smart phone control is handy for things since I have this on the master ethernet over power brick for my Logitech alert systems, so I can power cycle that to reboot it if needed, and in the summertime I use one for a fan that shoots cold air up from the basement into my great room.

But Two of the five I currently have randomly drop off. They're plugged in, they work if hit the power button physically, but the app shows them disconnected... If they could fix that, this would easily be 5 stars.",1.0 out of 5 stars
MLS,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2018","Final straw has come since it’s obvious someone else is controlling my devices and they must find it funny to turn off/on baby lights and sound machines at terrible hours in the morning. I finally saw today that they set up a rule to shut off the baby’s sound machine every Sunday morning! Yes I can rename the devices so maybe they’ll target other non baby devices but I shouldn’t have to worry about what I name something if they made it secure in the first place.

After almost 3.5 years of using Belkin wemo products i can no longer recommend them. I have 5 led bulbs, 6 smart plugs, 1 light switch, and the wemo air purifier.

You start with one or two and think wow this is great. Then you get more and then you add them to multiple devices. Great you think. Then you get rid of a device or 2 and even reset it as recommended. But guess what... those devices are still able to control them because you didn’t go into the wemo app and remove remote access for that device before you sold it or traded it in. The full phone/device reset doesn’t remove your devices! And who remembers to go into the settings of your dozens or hundreds of apps to double check something like this?

There is no security login setup for the wemo app so no way to control what’s in their cloud so you’re stuck with those devices.

I have 4 old devices that are listed in my remote access section i can disable them but somehow they get reenabled. I went to look it up and you’ll see even though this has been an issue since 2015, it’s still not fixed! Unacceptable!

No issues with my Phillips or Amazon or Logitech devices or any other of the dozens of smart home devices turning themselves on or off.

Jon P.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2020","There was a time I liked these plugs. The app was never very good but they worked with HomeKit and that was how I used them so I could overlook the useless app Wemo app. Then I received a notice in HomeKit that an update was available for all my Wemo plugs and I made the HUGE mistake of trying to update them. The Wemo app kept telling me to check my Internet connection because it would not connect to the Wemo / Belkin cloud. I thought it was odd that I could surf the web, receive and send email, use Siri and do everything else with my phone “without an Internet connection”. The only sign that I didn’t have an Internet connection was that I could not connect to the Wemo cloud which made me believe the problem was with Wemo and not my phone or Internet connection.

After spending some time online I found out that Wemo decided to create and implement an account system And my problem was NOT my Internet connection as the app had been telling me for weeks but the fat that they never told me I needed to create an account to continue using devices I had purchased and been using for over a year. I went ahead and created an account then learned that none of my devices could be found by the app.

I am sure if I spent another 6-10 hours screwing around with it, I could probably get everything working again... until Wemo decided to make another unannounced change. All my Wemo devices are now resting peacefully in the bottom of my trash bin and I have new Eve plugs on order to replace them. I will not be purchasing any Wemo / Belkin products again.",1.0 out of 5 stars
SDWA,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2022","Wemo was good back in the day, but it’s integration with Belkin has ruined its functionality. Conflicts with Apple Home app keeping it from registering correctly, so you’re forced to use the Home app (that “install with Wi-Fi only” option is a dead end…) and that’s where the miserable setup begins the end of the process. Won’t let you install without Home App (forces you to add when iOS recognizes it as an automation device when you select the built-in Wi-Fi setup SSID from the wireless setting screen) and then if you try to use Home app, it insists on you scanning the setup QR while it’s plugged in and the status light is flashing. Guess where the QR code is?? It’s on the back of the plug where you can’t get to it while it’s plugged in. If you unplug it, that halts the install process. 🤦🏻‍♂️ Yep, I even tried while it was plugged into an extension cord so I could scan the back of it. App would act like it installed correctly, but return you to the main screen where there are no devices listed. Multiple app closures, re-installs and phone reboots with no luck. Just a loop of madness and frustration. I’m a seasoned automation integrator, and I couldn’t get this thing to work after 90 minutes. Back it goes.

S. Briggs,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2018","I have attempted to use my echo, harmony and wemo to control my stereo, my lights, my TV etc. All I can EVER do with some reliability is get the time and weather.
I have found the following:
1 - If you have a 2g and 5G network, you will have problems. ATT is doing a thing where they want you to have the SSIDs the same so that you can bounce between the networks but if you do that, your home automation will crater. So after all my devices kept going stupid after a few days, I broke the traffic shaping nonsense that ATT was doing and put all my home automation on 2g.
2 - My wemo mini plugs would still fall off the network every few days
3 - My wemo switch would lose it's config altogether and have to be reconfigured about once a week
4 - I tried Lightify, that switch was more reliable but the lights were hit and miss. I had one light that wouldn't change colors in a specfic lamp even though it is the same model as the other lamp that works fine with a lightify bulb.
5 - My harmony home hub also falls off the network every few days
6 - When my echo can see the sonos, it can really only play a radio station because it usually can't get the harmony to start my stereo even though i bought a new Pioneer 1131 VSX SPECIFICALLY because it has wifi and bluetooth and should work with all this other stuff.

All of this means that when I ask Alexa to turn on something, she says ""I cannot connect to blah blah"" so I don't get to say ""Alexa, watch Netflix"" or ""Alexa, listen to metallica on sonos"" or ""Alexa, turn off the bedroom lights"". But I can say ""Alexa, what time is it"".",1.0 out of 5 stars
BWLee,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2019","I had six Belkin Wemo devices and had depended upon them for several years; they had been reliable. But, recently they all failed with the Alexa Wemo skills though the Wemo app by themselves works. The issue seemed to have been unresolved for several days with no apparent resolution by users who spent time trying to make them work. No notice came from the manufacturer as to nature of the why they went down. Myself and other apparent users who experienced the failure received no notice from the manufacturer as to why. Good customer service would have informed users of the problem and that issue is being worked on; customers are less inclined to be dissatisfied knowing that the manufacturer is by their side to resolve.

If buying with expectations to work reliably with Alexa, it would be wise to read the reviews of the Wemo skill on Alexa app. The device, the device app, and the Alexa skill need to work collectively together. The ratings on the device and its Alexa skill need to be considered together.

After hours trying to get my six devices to work, I went to the expense to swap them all out for a different brand which I have used; the other brand’s device setup and link with Alexa are easier. I have elderly depending on the devices to work reliably with Alexa; consequently, there was some urgency. The Wemo devices and the quality of their customer service/support did not meet my expectations.

I hope Wemo gets their act together. Though I am disappointed, I have a vested interest for their success — I have six Wemo devices which are currently useless stored in a dark corner of a cabinet. I am awaiting a time to utilize them again without frustration.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Beltway Jim,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2022","The v3 and an older v2 one we have finally refuse to work with Apple HomeKit. Worse, they don't even phone home to their native Wemo app anymore. So they are in a pile of electronics set aside for the electronics recycling day coming up in our city.

I used to be able to get them to work, but only after a LOT of trial-and-error. I learned early on to turn off the 5Ghz band on my router so it can only talk to 2.4GHz band to avoid confusion. But the native app now uses the HomeKit process of capturing the HomeKit QR code by camera. The problem is Wemo put that QR code on the BACK of the outlet, so you have to unplug it. And then it can't connect because it's not powered, of course. I have the code written down but the setup isn't accepting typed codes anymore.

These are SUPER finicky. If you have a power outage or even just move the smart plug to a different receptacle, you have to start the whole trial-and-error setup process all over again.

The Wemo app makes you create a user login these days. That's not helpful when you're having to delete the app from your smart phone and reinstall it in order to forget everything so you can start fresh. Now the app insists on helpfully remembering devices you are trying to neutralize.

In this day and age, stuff like this should simply be set-it-and-forget-it. A device demanding this much attention just does not qualify as ""smart"", in my opinion.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Edgar,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2018","I returned mine, so not a purchase on Amazon, but I still have (am stuck with) another mini I got at Christmas from another retailer. Too late to return and tried to service with Belkin, they just replaced with another that works no better.

I have been able to install the mini on one router/cable modem but not another, but I have not been able to get beyond that. The Regular Wemo smart plug does not seem to install ok and works fine, but I tried to add the mini to the same network as my other two (Netgear 3500 router SB6121 cable modem) and the mini fails setup. On my other network (separate location, SB6141 modem, AC1750 router) it connects on maybe the second try. Unfortunately the apps for Wemo only let you have all your wemo devices on the same network, so some on one and some on the other does not work (other systems let you do this). Those of use using this in two locations have an issue as a result. When I returned this I even asked if Belkin could just replace it with the less expensive regular smart plug, but they would not.

On the plus side the regular version of the smart plugs work with Alexa, Google home, have programmable away mode and are pretty reliable. The mini however is flakier, I've seen it lose connection and require resetting, and am unsure if I trust it like others. Gone through three now, one returned to Amazon, one returned to Belkin and their replacement I am stuck with.

Until Belkin fix their mini to work on all current routers, and fix their app to support multiple locations, I cannot recommend this product. Hope the manufacturer is listening and takes this advice to heart.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Agon,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2018","Belkin has a long way to go before these devices are ready for actual use. The firmware updates rarely install correctly on the first try. And the only way to update them after that is to unplug all of the successfully updated devices and force the firmware update again.

Custom schedules for turning the device on and off disappear from the app when you try to save them. I've tried 4 times now to recreate the schedules I""m looking for only to find that the schedule no longer exists when I look to see why it didn't trigger.

Getting the devices set up initially is equally painful. Most of the time when the devices go through setup and collect your wifi information they will connect to your home wifi. But as part of the installation, the Wemo app tries to reconnect to outlet device and it fails. Making you think the set up failed. But when you go back into the app it shows that it was installed correctly.

And then the latest issue. I noticed some general slowness on my home local network. So I checked my router logs and found that every couple of minutes the devices are SYN flooding my LAN. For your non-techy types. This means they're basically doing a denial of service attack on my home network. This seems to happen any time you have more than 1 Wemo smart plug connected to the wifi at the same time. As soon as I go down to a single unit, the flooding stops.

I've ordered some TP Link Kasa devices to replace these and plan on taking them to the electronics recycling location as soon as the replacements arrive.

Maynard Handley,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2020","Yeah these plugs are cheap. But since they are worthless, that's not saying much!
Things start off badly, with a somewhat rocky set up procedure, but after that you think you're OK. Hah!

The very special power of these plugs is that they randomly loose network connectivity. It's not WiFi strength -- my plug is a few feet from the WiFi base station. And it's not even total connectivity loss -- I can still ping this WeMo plug. It's just lost connectivity to HomeKit. And of course I blame the crappy Belkin SW -- I have a large number of different HomeKit devices in my house and this is the ONLY one that randomly loses connectivity this way.
So far connectivity seems to disappear randomly when the plug has been powered off for 12 hours or more, and to reappear about ten min after it has been (manually) switched on. But this is clearly useless for a smart device -- if I want to toggle switches off and on, why am I buying a smart plug?

BTW, I'm running the latest firmware as of May 2020, so it's not like that's an excuse --- Belkin have been trotting out the old ""the firmware will be fixed next quarter"" excuse for two years now, and their devices still can""t actually function. So I think it's time to just accept that they DO NOT HAVE A CLUE WHAT THEY ARE DOING!

Maybe it's OK for Alexa use? No idea.

I replaced an older, larger WEMO switch that had been working perfectly. To be fair, the new mini switch worked flawlessly for 3 1/2 months. I started having some minor issues and deleted the mini switch to add it back fresh to the network. So I thought. The switch fails to connect to my network, either one of them. To add insult to injury, it implies that my password is wrong. I am well aware of what my passwords are and I'm entering them correctly. Dig a bit deeper in the forums and find this is a problem that a number of people are having. Calling Belk in support line is a joke. If you can find them, get the older style swith and you might be able to avoid these issues. Many people think this might be associated to firmware updates, but I don't think mine is. My switch went from working perfectly to unusable in the space of an hour or less. I have no proof that Wemo is being underhanded with their customers, but it seems a bit strange that these mini switches are now available for under $40, but the refurbished old style (larger) switches are selling for $60 or more dollars.

I arrogantly thought that the troubles folk were having was due to a lack of their experience - Ha! Eventually I hit upon the arcane sequence of rebooting and running the setup required and it connected. The jubilation was tangible, but then ....NO....It demanded a firmware upgrade. It upgraded and the app could never see it again. Thinking I must have a defective product I tried number two, this time using a lamp plugged in right next to the router so I could juggle the rebooting and resetting. I connected and was running within 20 minutes. I thought I'd better check numbers 3&4, and alas during this three hour long episode I had to uninstall and reinstall the app. Well that was the last I ever saw of switch number two, it just would not reappear in the app again no matter what I tried.

After trying many times, I finally got past that phase and got to the point of connecting the WeMo to my wifi network, which continuously said ""Connecting to Network...please wait"" until it timed out. This happened on multiple occasions. After yet another factory reset of the device, and reinstall of the app, it went right back to crashing and reopening over and over again.

At this point, I frustratingly pulled the plug and immediately requested a return. It's not even worth my time and effort to call their customer support...especially when there are other smart plugs on the market that won't crash before the thing is even set up.

Every time I give Belkin the benefit of the doubt and try one of their new products, I realize what a junk company they really are. I don't understand why they're still in business. One thing is for sure, they will never get mine ever again.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Kristian,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2017","Update 12/16/2017:
One switch completely stopped working. In the last week I've had to say voice commands multiple times before the switches were found and activated. They're going back. Bought some TP link switches to replace them which were easy to set up out of the box without any issues.

Original review:
I had a significant number of issues getting them to work (wouldn't connect, couldn't find the switches after setting them up, etc, etc), now that I have the switches sorted out they've been good. In order to get them to work I did the following:

- sett them up in an outlet very close to your WiFi router then move them to the outlet of your choice once they're set up
- if you have a 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz Wifi network, temporarily remove the 5Ghz network from the phone you're using to set them up.
- unplug any repeaters or secondary access points in your home network, only the primary WiFi router should be active during setup.
- don't use the remember my network option when setting up the switches.

I would buy them again on special (I paid $20 each), but would consider trying an alternative at current prices.

Also, I received what appeared to be a used unit from Amazon. There were scuff marks on the face of the switch and the protective film was missing, so be sure to check your merchandise.",1.0 out of 5 stars
DamienChaos,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2019","I don’t typically write bad reviews; I recognize that sometimes products can have a bad run or a particular user can have a poor experience. However, I’ve attempted to use enough of these Wemo Mini outlets to confirm they are awful. Setup is a ridiculous chore, particularly on iOS; one that has become near-impossible for me since the setup process integrated HomeKit setup. Out of the four outlets I’ve tried over a 6mo period, three took more than 1hr of trial and error to set up and the other absolutely would not complete the setup process. I’ve tried different routers, different distances from the router, and even setting up using Android (which is how I got 3 of the 4 working); it is seemingly a random chance of whether after a reset the actual install experience will succeed. Then, as if that weren’t frustrating enough, the WiFi signal strength on these is barely passable. Be sure your outlet is in the wide open and, ideally, within line-of-sight of the router if you want reliable control of the powered device.

If you’re looking at smart outlets, take some time to shop around other options; even if you have other Berlin Wemo devices. I’m not sure why this product is so awful when compared next to fantastic Wemo wall switches and dimmers; but it is definitely not worth the time, effort, and expense when so many other similar competing solutions exist.",1.0 out of 5 stars
David P.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2017","Where to start…

The threads “standard” is just a bad idea. It locks you into needing a home hub and it makes it more expensive if you have a mixed ecosystem in your house. I have Alexa and Apple devices. Since o have an old Alexa device I would need new ones to be a hub for Alexa to use it and an AppleTV or Homelod for Siri/Home to use it. So that just means this device would end up costing an additional $150-200 to for Apple and Amazon devices. Their old devices before threads (I have 3 of them) work great without the need for a hub.

The fact that this device is HomeKit only is another issue. Why do I have to be limited to a single technology? Standards were supposed to make things easier and more compatible but this is less compatible compared to their previous generation.

Setup was horrible. Nowhere on the device or in the instruction manual was there the QR code to scan to add the device. As a result it was a hassle to hit more options, have the device error out multiple times and repeat the steps over and over, and finally be able to add it after jumping through hoops manually typing in the code.

I am not sure what happened to Wemo. They used to be my go to company for remote devices like this and I recommended them to friends and even clients I support (I work in IT) but I won’t be doing that any longer.",1.0 out of 5 stars
L Gates,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2019","I bought Wemo mini’s and light switch’s from Amazon in August 2018. I use Google Home to operate them or I should say I used to. In December 2018 the remote access through Wemo, which is necessary to work with Google Home quit working. I and many others complained with no solution from Wemo customer service. They promised to fix, but never did nor followed up with me as promised. They fixed the remote access, but in the process changed something that no longer allows Google Home and Wemo to talk directly to each other. I configured everything to work through IFTTT, but that is not using the two products to their full capability. You lose some functionality with IFTTT if Google Home is not directly connected Wemo.
Now it is February 2019 and Wemo released a firmware update for the Wemo mini plugs and I installed hoping it would fix my December problem. Not only did it not fix the problem, all of my Mini’s are completely inoperable. The firmware installed and they all quit working immediately.
I do not understand how this company stays in business or why people keep buying their product, unless it works better with Alexa. It is a lot of money to fork out for a product that works less than six months and I own five mini’s and seven switches which are now inoperable.

WeMo is incredibly difficult to set up. It’s temperament is like a toddler and the ability to set it up is 1/4 knowledge, 3/4 luck.
I changed my password on my WiFi today (I do it once every year or two) and I have spent two hours re-setting up three WeMo minis and the third one is still giving me a hard time. I have three more to do... The code to set it up is also on the back of the outlet, and you need to scan it during set up; not sure who the genius was behind that. Be sure to write down the numbers or take a photo before plugging in before manually setting it up.

These devices are reliable once they’re up and running — IF you have the time and patience AND if they work for you.

Customer service is little to none and the help section lacks. You may need to check Reddit for actual help.

But I would like to do more, so I tried to set up a schedule to turn the plug on and off at a certain time. What a nightmare! The app has one of the worst user interfaces imaginable, but that would not be so bad if it didn't freeze up all the time. I can't tell you how many times I had to force stop and restart trying to do this. After an hour of this I simply gave up.

u2beal999,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2020","I’ve owned and used three Wemo mini smart plugs for three years. Setup was initially pretty easy, but it went downhill from there. I placed the three smart plugs on two floors, one literally on the same power strip as my router, one in the same room, and one a floor down. In these three years, it’s been a crapshoot if they connect to my network. And they all won’t work great at the same time. Usually one or more can’t be found on the app or using Alexa. The app is a dumpster fire. The controls are clunky and there’s no way to troubleshoot only one of the plugs in the app. You physically have to either button hold soft reset on the plug itself or unplug the damn thing entirely! Why not give us the capability to force restart via the app? Their refresh button literally does nothing except spin in circles before informing you that, yes, those plugs STILL aren’t detected on the network. Yes, even after you power cycle your router multiple times.

Thank god I had my daughter's S8 so that I could spend a few hours and get out of that mess! I have GoSund, Meross, Kasa and other plugs and NEVER have issues with them.

The whole process takes 10+ minutes - every single time the power goes off.

God forbid you try and do a firmware update (which it asks for), it will totally screw it up. The app mentioned something about a firmware update one day, and I thought ""Oh sure, maybe that will make this awful little thing better"". Nope, firmware update never made it all the way through. I tried several times. Not sure why, but I had to ""factory restore"" and set it up as new.

Long story short: the app and the device refused to pair and get on my WiFi network and the app crashed constantly.

I cannot tell you the number of times that I uninstalled and reinstalled the app to try and get the setup to work after the app crashed in the process (I have the most recent iOS, so according to their app page it should be fine).

I restarted my router, my modem, my phone, and reset the WeMo to factory defaults (at least 10 times). Nothing could get this thing to go through its own setup process successfully.

I have Echo Dots and Philips Hue Lights in my Home and those go through a similar setup process (the device broadcasts a WiFi network and then once you connect to it, uses that to transfer to your actual WiFi). Those took 15 minutes to set up, max. Maybe that’s a high bar, but 3.5 hours is at least 3 hours too long, in my opinion.

Since I primarily bought them to act as timers, they became useless to me.

Another issue occurs when setting them up.

None of my devices had a QR code or numeric code, and holding it near the device did nothing at all. Instead I had to cancel the set up and restart it, sometimes up to 6 or so times, at which point the Home Kit stepped seemed to be bypassed.

I would not recommend these at all for use as a timer. I would suggest purchasing a standard digital timer instead.

1) during the setup, you enter the wifi password in their app. Due to a bug in the app, I found in the forums that you had to enter an extra character for it to accept the wifi password (otherwise it would drop the last letter and fail to connect). This was the half-baked iPhone app.
2) the plug keeps disconnecting from wifi. It will work for a day and then blink orange. I tried power cycling and then even doing a full reset, and neither of those worked. Now all my wemo mini plugs are basically paperweight.

Note that I have many other smart devices, and my Lutron wall switches work just fine 99.9% of the time with both Siri and Google Home! The most frustrating thing is I bought their stupid hub as well to get the switches to work with Siri, and now it's just lying there doing nothing.

In short, I would rather WALK UP to the switch than use wemo.

PS: Customer service was as smart as a dodo. They basically wanted me to do the same things I'd already done, and even when those were exhausted, they had no other ideas.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Benician,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2017","There is an old joke about a police recruit in a Mediterranean country, sent by his more experienced partner to check the turn signals on the squad car - recruit goes around behind the car, and as the blinker lights go on then off then on, he shouts to the partner, ""Si!"" ""No"" ""Si"", thus capturing in his mind the state of the blinkers - sometimes they work, then not, then work, then not. The Wemo is great when it works (much of the time), maddeningly difficult when it doesn't (too much of the time), and it's hard to reconnect to Alexa. It's expensive and should work all the time - much more inexpensive, imported outlets work consistently well (I've gone to them). BTW, Belkin creates a user-unfriendly challenge if you wish to have the company honor the one-year warranty: First step: ""No warranties will be honored unless the purchaser provides, at purchaser's expense, the product for inspection."" OK, so that's on you - you buy the product, the product is bad, and then you pay again. Then, it's either telephone or snail mail - no online for Belkin. And so on. So, if your experience is like mine, you will pay a premium price for a product that, eventually, may succumb to quality issues and have to be returned. I hope your luck is better than mine, though.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Dan,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2019","This is probably the worst product I have ever tried to use for years! For a smartplug it is very DUMB! I have been using these plugs in my home for well over a year and have been struggling with them since. Every time we have a momentary power outage these plugs have to be re-established with the network (and even sometimes that doesn't work and the plug has to be junked). The app is the worst I have ever used … seriously. You never really know if these plugs will work. And recently they made some horrible changes to the app so you can't even add new plugs (a reported bug by many, but the supplier doesn't seem to care). WeMo customer service is (apparently) horrible too, although I never tried to contact them directly because most of the forums I referenced stated it was a waste of time!

I am also using Gosung mini's and they work great, no need to worry about power failures as these seem robust enough to handle network outages and are very inexpensive compared to WeMo. Plus they don't take up as much wall space. And the SmartLife app is simple to use.

Amazon's plugs are useless; they lose WiFi signal literally 5 minutes after they are installed...sitting no further than 10 feet in direct line-of-sight distance from my brand new (2-day old) router. I next tried the WeMo plugs on the advice of a friend. I tried installing them through Alexa...which told me to install the WeMo app. The WeMo app then told me to install the Apple Home app. The Apple Home app then told me that I had to enable iCloud for Home to install the Apple Home app. This is absolutely ridiculous. I don't want or need a stupid plug to have access to my life and schedule -- I just want it to turn off and on on a schedule.

Raptor,"Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2018","I like the concept and would think a company like Belkin could get their act together on software updates. The equipment is unstable and cannot be depended upon to be accessible when you need them. Each software update that comes out makes the plugs worse. It’s like they don’t actually do any testing, just push out the software and wait for their customers to figure out what is not working. They have ongoing issues with difficulty to initially connect the equipment. Once connected they often disappear. Most recently they had issues with the list of devices in their app changing list order. Also, though some people have clammored for Apple HomeKit support they finally added it, BUT, if you chose not to use HK the app would constantly ask to allow access. Supposedly these two issues have been fixed in their latest update, though unconfirmed. Who wants to risk making the equipment worse by trying another update! Belkin needs to get a handle on this quickly. Solve ALL of the problems and stop releasing updates until they can stop breaking things. As such, I CANNOT recommend these products.

IanLim,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2017","Easy enough to configure initially, but the entire software and cloud services to allow you to control the switches remotely is very poorly executed.

During the initial configuration, all that's required was to connect to the device, open the WeMo app, and enter your wireless configuration settings. Getting another phone to work with it was also surprisingly easy, they just have to be on the same wifi network when you open the WeMo app, after which, this new phone will also work remotely. There isn't even a need to configure for remote access, no account settings etc(problem alert!). What I'm guessing is that the device config and app id are now stored on Belkin's servers, which are completely invisible to users.

Now here's the problem, if for whatever reason, these ids were lost or messed up, there's no way a user could reset or remove a device/app from the account. If you reset your device, there's no other option other than to contact Belkin to remove the device from their servers (this is from Belkin's support website). If you lose your phone, who knows what can be done. You never have any idea if a new account/id is created or if you are adding devices to an existing account, or if new apps are connected to you devices.

Its success-rate with my google home was maybe 10-20% at best???

The first thing I absolutely loved about the design of this product was the QR code that must be scanned on the INSIDE of the plug to set up the product. It's important to note that the plug must be PLUGGED IN to set up the device, therefore the QR code you're supposed to scan is FACING THE WALL AND NOT VISIBLE. This leads me to believe that they failed to test the setup of the product even once before putting it on the market. Honestly, that part was just funny in that it's some of the dopiest chicken-and-egg dumbassery design I've ever encountered 😂

I have many Apple HomeKit devices from other manufacturers among which include smart switches, smart plugs, smart sensors, etc. Many of them also use WiFi to connect and whereas they require access to my network information on iOS to setup the device they DO NOT require access to my location services and all of their apps will function just fine with location services disabled.

• it has a relatively huge 4 inch horizontal footprint so if you’re working with multiple horizontally placed outlets, yes can kiss them goodbye. That’s some poor design; you’d think for $20+ you could swivel it or something (or they could just make it smaller!)

• to operate and setup the device you need to give them your email address. Come on... for a “smart plug?”

• integration with HomeKit was ok, but not intuitive (it involved a firmware upgrade, the app unexpectedly quit, and then you had to manually quit and reopen to activate the HomeKit connection).

Originally, I gave it a positive review when I bought several over the past few years.

Slowly, however, I learned what an unreliable piece of garbage these plugs are.

They always go off-line. To correct the problem one has to sign into the Wemo app. However, many times that is also off-line, as well as their cloud service. I am beginning to think that the performance of this plug is based on the cloud service it is attached to and many times I find it not available when I try and log into their site.

I have set schedules for this plug to work in accordance with my coffee maker. Sometimes it works. Often it does not.

I have another Wemo plug attached to an electric bug zapper in our home that we turn on and off with voice commands. I can't begin to tell you how many times the device failed to turn on due to the plug not relaying the proper power command.

Entaka,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2019","::Update:: Used these for Christmas again - had to do setup again - same issues. Now trying to set them up again to use them for under cabinet lighting control and I am running out of patience. The UI / confirmation / HomeKit integration APPEARS better but both apps constantly tell me conflicting information about connection status - I can consistently get WeMo app to control the units eventually - but all I can accomplish is the devices showing up in homekit after multiple factory resets and updates. Look elsewhere for a HomeKit outlet - perhaps the new smaller ones are better - But i wont be investing.

TLDR - I picked one up on discount circa 15$. It worked - after some fiddling and updating - so I bought another - that one required more fiddling of a different degree but eventually worked. Mine are integrated with Homekit and function with Siri without issue.

The product would be 5 stars if the easy set up stuff worked right. Out of the box it seemed both of the ones I received were not updated to a firmware that was compatible with Homekit - one of them even gave me a ""uncertified homekit device"" or something if that nature, within the Homekit app - once updated - it was fine.

Connecting to a devices WiFi is not irregular for set up - Ring does the same thing (only ring does it 100x better). The issue is partly due to the devices only using 2.4ghz networks - which can be a crowded frequency already. One of the devices hung at the setup and kept erroring - until I put my phone directly next to the unit - then set up went fine and I was able to update and add it to Homekit - eventually.

The second one I installed kept saying ""maybe try a factory restore"" - I did not do that as the lights were still indicating correctly for setup. They both just took different degrees of closing apps, opening them, reconnecting to wifi, and eventually updating prior to using the ""easy setup"" homekit QR.

Setup needs to be done with the WeMo app so you can get to the point of updating the devices so they can work with Homekit. I am an electronics repair technician and CompTia certified PC tech with above average troubleshooting skills - and technological patience - if thats a thing. There is little in the way of comforting prompts along the setup - expect to spend some time assuming it is getting set up correctly if you make it to that point.

The device would be 5 stars at the price point I paid if the setup was actually straight forward - both devices had completely different issues getting setup - but work great now that they are. Something to note is the relay within them is also quite louder than I expected it to be - think motion detector light relay in the grocery store refrigerated section loud. Not that big of deal if you click it on and it stays on - but something to note as my Philips and Lutron Caseta stuff does not have any hardware sounds. Currently using them for a garland and my christmas tree and being able to turn them off when out of the house adds some peace of mind.

I cant speak to how these work with any other smart home system - but judging from the issue being the initial setup within the proprietary app - I would assume
functionality is the same across the ecosystems.

pls,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2022","I got one of these to control an air condition that was located in a very inconvenient location. Getting to the Wemo required moving stuff around, getting a ladder and climbing up to it.

When I first got this smart plug, any short power failure would knock the Wemo off line and require a reset and redoing the setup procedure to recover it. I was climbing the ladder every few weeks. After several months of this, Wemo updated the firmware and greatly reduced this happening. I was now climbing the ladder 2-3 times a summer. Much better. That's where things stayed for a while.

This year I got a new Android phone and used the Android utility to transfer data to the new phone. It transferred the Wemo app, but when I ran the app, it showed the air conditioner Wemo as disabled.

I have a script on my Windows computer that can scan for active Wemo smart plugs and control thim. This found the Wemo and could control it.

The Wemo app has a function to scan for active Wemo devices and add them to the app. This function has never worked and didn't work this time. Wemo tech support told me to reset the smart plug and go through the setup process.

That was the end of my patience with the unreliable device. The next time I'm climbing the ladder it will be to replace the Wemo with something more reliable. I'm done with it.

In summary, this is a fine device if it is easy to reset and redo the setup as you will need to do so regularly. If doing this is difficult or you don't want to deal with the need to regularly recover the device, then this Wemo is definitely NOT RECOMMENDED. Get something else.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Reiggin Hilderbrand,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2018","I purchased two of these plugs because they were on sale with the Echos I bought at the same time. The price was great but the support isn't. I learned quickly that the plugs lose connection easily and often. After googling around for a bit, I discovered others that have the same issue. Turns out, it's a problem with the Alexa skill. And thankfully, I was able to disable the skill and use the native Alexa support to operate the plugs. But this shouldn't be the case and you would think that Wemo would address this issue. However, they do not and finding the support was nearly impossible.

And that lack of support by Wemo is more frustrating than the device issues themselves. I opened a support ticket with Wemo and it was immediately closed. I got an email basically saying, ""Thanks, we've closed your ticket."" No one reached out to me and nothing was done to address my concerns/questions.

So for those that have similar issues, just know that you need to disable/remove the Wemo skill from the Alexa app. From there, ask Alexa to discover your devices and she'll find the plug(s) without the skill being installed. Since doing this, I haven't had any issues.

Beyond the flaky (e.g. completely absent) support by Wemo, the installation of the plugs felt more complicated than other smart devices I've installed. I bought an outdoor plug by Meross around the same time and it was simple (and reliable) to set up with Alexa. The Wemo app is far less intuitive and nothing is really explained for you. The small instructions with the plug are okay but it just feels like it could have been simpler.

I also installed the device with my HomeKit (Apple) services to be able to use with Siri. That's where most of the complications with the app and directions came from. It just wasn't explained well and it took some trial and error to figure out. Once I got it set up, it works fine with HomeKit and Siri, though.

At full price, these certainly aren't worth it. I would have returned them and went with the AmazonBasics plugs instead if it wasn't for the great deal I got on them. That's the reason for the two stars instead of a one star -- the price was right. But my final advice is to shop around and, if you do choose to go with the Wemo devices, be ready to do some troubleshooting -- on your own and with no support from Wemo.",2.0 out of 5 stars
M S T,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2017","I wanted a device where I didn't have to spend 10 seconds crawling under my desk hunting for the cord every day when I get home.

What I get is a device where I spend 10 seconds watching an enormous amount of initialization activity take place on the Wemo app on my phone. (Every time the app opens in fact, it takes 7-10 seconds on my phone to load.) Arguably a downgrade. I was under the impression that sending the signal over the network, not opening the app would have been the bottleneck. Overall, considering how much time in this day and age we spend waiting for our phones to load things, I think that this solution needs to be more well thought out.

I have tried this UI both on an LG g4 and Google Pixel 2 - it has the same glitches, so it is not a phone hardware issue.

Additionally: WeMo should add support for Google Assistant (and Siri and Alexa?) to control this device not from devices, but from phones. This would also get rid of the lost 10 seconds I spend waiting for my phone's UI.

Edit: I have updated this review after 2 months and deducted 2 stars.

First off, on Android you can set widgets on your home screen, but they are laughably terrible in terms of whether they work. They theoretically show you at a glance whether the light is on or off, but it is stupidly inaccurate and shows a false state. I have a higher rate of success just opening the app. So that was a headache.

But even in the app, devices just straight up don't work. They don't load and clicking on them leads not to any type of troubleshooting help, but an insulting option to ""hide the disabled device until it shows up again"". Why the hell would I want to do that when I need it to be working? So I can, you know, toggle it? What a dissappointment.

It's a dream come true about 20% of the time. Down from my expectations of 100%. I have a package of 2 of these plugs to give my dad for his birthday next week (which comes on Thanksgiving) -- I am seriously considering shipping these back and finding something else.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Steve H,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2017","Overall I'm really not happy with this product. I'll say the few good parts about it were how easy it was to install, upgrade the firmware, and I like the design and the fact that I can use two on a single outlet. I think it's fair to give it 2 stars for that.

The whole reason I purchased these was so that I could use them with voice-activated smart device like Alexa. In order for that to work, I need them to stay connected to the WiFi network. Every few hours they would just randomly disconnect and they wouldn't reconnect until I unplugged them and plugged them back in. I went to their support forums and found that some people had some workarounds, like setting my WiFi channel statically and turning off my 5GHz network, but neither of them solved the problem. Oh and I rebooted all involved devices several times. Even if all that did solve the problem, I don't want to buy a product that tells me how I need to set up my network. If you claim to have WiFi enabled device, then you should make sure it easily works with WiFi.

A note about my WiFi setup: it's super simple. I have a single wireless access point and the two WeMo minis are less than 20ft away on the same floor and in the same room, both plugged into the same outlet. I have not done anything fancy with my access point. I have a Nest Thermostat, Nest Protect, a Nest indoor camera, an Echo Dot as well as a couple phones and an iPad all connected to the WiFi. I don't feel like that should be enough devices to cause significant interference.

The other reason why I find this silly is because after connecting the Dot and the Nest products they just worked. I've never had a problem with network connectivity. So that means someone solved this problem years ago and I don't see why this should be one for the Minis.

I fully admit I never called their support, but I'm pretty sure they're working as intended since I have two that are behaving identically and terribly.

Overall I would not recommend this product unless you're very network savvy and like playing around with that stuff.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Don Draper,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2017","This smart switch is a neat way to control your electric devices via your phone, tablet, or through voice with Alexa. There is a decorative salt lamp in my living room that has the switch on the cord. Before Wemo Mini I had to get down on my knees and reach under a table to turn it on. Now all I have to do is say ""Alexa, Salt Lamp On"" and she turns it on for me!

The compact size leaves the other outlet accessible which is an improvement from the original Wemo plug design. Another feature that is nice about the Wemo switches is that you can control your lights from anywhere even when you are not at home. The app has an ""Away Mode"" which automatically runs a lights on/lights off program to give your house that lived-in look when you are away. There is also a scheduler function to turn lights on and off at preset times. If you have a Nest thermostat you can link it, but I don't have one of those so I can't comment.

The setup was kind of tricky. I had to fiddle with my WiFi settings to get it to connect to the network, but I eventually found the right combination of settings to make it work. I would advise going to the Belkin Wemo website and reading their troubleshooting documents if you have difficulty getting it setup. So far so good. I may get one or two more to control other devices around the house.

UPDATE 12/09/18

I feel like it is my duty as an informed consumer to warn buyers before they purchase these switches. They are great when they work, but they don't always work. App and firmware updates sometimes mess up the connections and the troubleshooting process is time consuming. I've been living with them for 9 months. I'm invested in this brand with a total of 6 switches so I'm kind of stuck. If I had it to do over again, I would go with a different brand.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Bob Loblaw,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2017","When Wemo plugs work, they're fine. And they're also probably the most widely supported plug on the market today, which is nice. What's especially nice about *this* plug, compared to their original model, is its size. While not as small as those offered by competitors (e.g., iHome), it's certainly much nicer than the original Wemo.

Why 2 stars? Because, in my experience, Wemo makes some of the most hit-and-miss smart products out there. I just spent 3 hours trying to get this brand new plug working, following each and every bit of advice offered by their techs, by fellow consumers on message boards, etc. This is on top of me literally spending days upon days trying to get my two original Wemo plugs to consistently work

In fact, that's why I bought this one. I hoped that perhaps a brand new plug would ""simply work"", and I could throw the others in a closet or something, never to have to curse at them again. Well, my hopes were dashed...

The two originals actually did seem to work fine, until a recent firmware update. From that point out, no amount of resetting, reinstalling of apps, changing wifi channels or rebooting the router, assigning fixed IP addresses, disabling cellular signals, moving plugs right next to routers, unplugging every single Wemo device save the one I'm trying to install, trying IOS then Android, etc. would reliably work. Most fixes did nothing. When they did work, the fix was fleeting. Wemos appear and disappear, whether using the Wemo app or my Amazon Echos.

The fix that worked for me? Switching my phones/tablets to my wifi's Guest network, and installing Wemo there. Fwiw, my router: Asus RT-AC88U. It played nicely w/ my two original switches until the firmware update. (Coincidence? No idea. I just know that that's when my troubles began.) I can't use my Echos to control my Wemos anymore, since they're on different networks (Guest vs. Main network). But at least they're not totally useless anymore.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Stevie,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2017","Update November 2020. I have had constant disconnects with these for months, or even though I've paired with both Google Assistant and Alexa, they disassociate and neither assistant can control the devices. I don't have this issue with any other devices integrated with my digital assistants. Wemo pushes software updates, but the performance doesn't get any better. It started off good but has become a really unreliable and frustrating product. I had three of these and am down to only using one, and will likely get rid of that one, too. I had issues with both Eero and Nest as my routers and no other client issues, so it's not a router issue.

Really handy devices. I have three of them, and use them to remotely turn lamps on and off while I'm gone. They have generally worked very well with few issues, though they can take a long time to connect to WIFI after setup or rebooting. I did have issues with one of them not staying connected but since I unplugged and rebooted it, it's been fine. Setup is pretty easy. These do not block the second outlet for normal-sized plugs. You can toggle devices on and off through the app, both on your LAN and remotely, or physically press the button on the device. They have stayed connected to my wifi now for a couple weeks ago with no unintended disconnects.

You can also set it up to work with voice commands via Google Home units or Amazon Echo & Alexa, and I have found that works very well. The Google app seems more reliable; I have had a few occasions where Alexa could not communicate with the device where Google could. Overall, very happy with the performance. You can also set up timers and schedules, so it's pretty versatile.

The app also has an option to associate it with your Nest account so you can make thermostat changes within the WEMO app, or sync your switches to shut off when the thermostat is in ""away"" mode. I haven't tried that yet, though.",2.0 out of 5 stars
GC,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2019","Use the Leviton DW15P-1BW ($31) instead.

I bought one of these WeMos and liked it, so I bought another for my vacation home. FAIL

I learned a HACK to get around their programming and ended up with 5 of these and there was happiness throughout the kingdom. Using a subnet, e.g., 192.168.1.xxx, and 192.168.2.xxx with the same SSID used to work. Say you had a place in City 1 and a vacation home in City 2. If you set the SSID the same in both places but used different subnets they worked fine. Then I did a remote FW update and had to redo the whole shebang. I stopped the remote FW updates and started only doing them when connected to the local LAN and they all worked again. The last FW killed that also. Now there is no hack. These are a one-site show. Lots of places inside one-site? Sure. Multiple sites? NO.

Am I complaining about them closing the hack? No. I'm complaining about them being disrespectful of their customer base and too lazy to address this issue, but unwilling to tell us, ""No, we're not going to do that"" and instead saying they would — someday. Well, it's been years and someday has just never come. It's like prosperity during the Depression, it's always, ""Just around the corner"" (FDR).

Wemos are made for only ONE site with ONE SSID and ONE subnet. Belkin refuses to address this behavior although users have been clamoring for years.

If you only have one site, i.e., one home or one office or one building, then these are very nice devices. They work pretty well, recover on their own after power failures depending on how your network is setup, are well-made and reliable for many years.

If you have multiple sites, do not buy these or any similar Belkin/WeMo product. Instead, use the Leviton DW15P-1BW ($31). From their info: ""Download the free My Leviton app to control up to 20 residences, 99 smart devices, 50 rooms, 50 scenes, 50 activities, and 50 schedules per account, plus adjust fade rates, LED activity, and more.

Bam Bam,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2017","Update: After Google updated their Assistant service in early 2017, they required people to re-connect their smart devices (including these Wemo mini plugs) to remain functional with the service. However, during this process, I was no longer able to re-add my existing plugs, and I was also not able to add a brand-new one- the setup would always fail partway through the process.

Scouring the Wemo support forums, many other people have encountered this issue- and Wemo's response so far has been that it is a problem with Google, and not their plugs. That sucks, because guess what- Google is not going to change their entire Assistant platform to stay compatible with this one device.

The workaround is effective, but complicated: you can use a free third-party service called If-This-Then-That (IFTTT.com) instead. You link your Google Home and your Wemo smart plugs to the IFTTT service, and then set up command hotwords within IFTTT that will turn off the relevant switches. The result is the same in the end, but it's ironic that I had to use yet another service to be the broker between these supposedly-smart plugs, and the Google Home.

For standalone use without voice control, the app is 'good enough'. It walks you through first-time setup, and it allows you to do things like set On/Off timers or configure IFTTT/nest integration. Some of the configuration dialogs are a little messy or confusing, with a lot of hand-off to a webpage, to authenticate with third-party services (and sometimes that hand-off falls through and you have to start over).

If you don't plan on remote-controlling the plug from outside the home, I would recommend going into the app settings, and disabling 'Remote Access.' That will prevent your smart-plug from taking commands over the internet (and kudos to Wemo for offering this feature!) Historically, smart-devices have very poor security, and they are easy pickings for a hacker if they are exposed to the internet.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Carm,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2018","Below the line, you'll see my original review. When I first got the item, it kept disconnecting from the wifi and then wouldn't work until I physically unplugged/replugged it in. Totally useless. I contacted customer service and they were not helpful. They gave general advice amounting to ""hmm, that's odd, it should work. Check your router"".

Doing my own research online, other owners were complaining that a recent firmware update broke the devices. I brought this to customer service's attention, but was met with confusion. They hadn't heard anything like that. I got a replacement item just in case my first one was a lemon. Funny enough, when I finally decided to test out the replacement, I saw both items were eligible for a firmware update on my app. I only updated the first one, and it started working. I tested out the second one without the update and it of course kept failing. Only after I updated that one as well did it start working.

So, these things work. They are a little bulky, and it makes it hard, if not impossible, to plug in something below it. But it works. It's still losing a few stars because of the poor customer service. Don't send out a terrible firmware update that breaks your device. If you do, be aware of it and tell customers you will fix it soon. Then fix it soon. Simple stuff.

John Whitley,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2020","I ordered three Wemo Mini Smart Plugs, and followed the straightforward directions for setup via my iPhone, with the goal of adding them to my existing HomeKit devices. As it turns out, none of these devices could successfully be added as HomeKit devices, either directly or via the Wemo app – they’d just hang forever with a spinner in Apple’s dialog. After hours of fiddling around, all three Smart Plugs ultimately required a firmware update to work correctly with HomeKit. Critically, the app only automatically detected out of date firmware for one device, and only after a partially failed attempt to add it via the app. That’s strike one – if your device has a platform-critical firmware update, your app had better make sure that happens FIRST in the entire user workflow. Worse, the app never autodetected the required firmware update for two out of the three switches. When one device autodetects, but others do not, it creates the impression that some have up-to-date firmware. Strike two: for a massive firmware update red-herring, since I wasted a ton of time looking for other solutions to devices that wouldn’t add, that better app UI and UX could have resolved quickly. Strike three: Each switch required an inconsistent sequence of fighting with the Wemo app, hard resetting the switch, updating the firmware, then finally successfully adding the device. I’m a software and device firmware developer, I have good mental models for how this kind of thing works, and this still wasted enormous amounts of my time. This user experience was an embarrassment to my entire profession.

Jamazon,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2020","Spoiler Alert: I really do not like products that force you to use an app to install the product just so you can use it in Apple Home Kit. They want your data and access to you when they could have made Home Kit adoption work in the first place.

I called WEMO to ask if I needed to have their app to use Home kit. They said no I could just adopt the device in Home kit but I might miss a few features like automatic firmware updates. Which if it turns the lights on or off I don't really care what the firmware version is. The support person was pushing me to use their app. Even though he admitted twice it would not be necessary to install or use the product. Desperation became apparent when he said, well sometimes even new products come out of the box and won't work right without a firmware upgrade.

That was the first clue I should have just bought another Phillips Hue Smart Outlet and saving $10 bucks getting the Wemo would not be worth the trouble. I won't make that mistake again.

Well, it would not connect to Home kit. So, in spite of their TOS which allows them to share your data; I downloaded the Wemo app, reset the device to factory, accepted the egregious insistence to have access to my Home Data and other data and it would not connect to Wemo app either.

Phineas Gage,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2019","Unfortunately, these devices do not work with MESH networks or homes with access points. The app logs on to the device and your phone at a given address. If you (and your phone) move to a new location and change access points/MESH node you lose your connection. Resetting the device and restarting your phone will work to re-establish connection, but plan on doing this every time. Perhaps a firmware upgrade will help. Otherwise, not ready for modern homes.

UPDATE FOR MESH NETWORK USERS:
I originally gave 2 stars for lack of information, documentation and support for MESH network users. Credit to ""duthrowayahey"" on reddit for solution. The WeMo devices can only connect to a 2.4 GHz network. Mesh networks change from 2.4/5.1/5.2 GHz based on number of clients/physical location/bandwidth usage which is why WeMos lose connectivity.

To Get WeMo to work with MESH network:
1. Go to your router's settings and activate Guest network. Most routers default to off for guest networks (it is ok to use a robust password if desired).
2. On your handheld device used to logon to WeMo: logoff your Mesh Network WiFi ssid and logon to your Guest Network Wifi ssid account (the WeMo uses your handheld device's logon credentials to logon to your network).
3. Set up WeMo(s) per the instruction manual
4. Use your guest network Wifi to logon to Wemo(s) and control them. When not using handheld device to directly control WeMo(s), you can logon back to your MESH network. However, if you need to control or turn on/off WeMo(s) you need to log back on to your Guest account Wifi again.

Eric Hwang,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2019","We have four of these ""smart"" plugs. Bought them all at the same time, but only one works most of the time. The rest are hit or miss. At first I thought the WiFi signal wasn't strong enough. After all, my routers are a decade old. So I upgraded those and still the same issues. I even put the router in the same room as three of these plugs and only one ever seems to work.

Set up is average and similar to other smart devices we have—it requires a smartphone. The phone app works most of the time, but I can't figure out why some of the plugs don't respond. As far as working with Alexa, we would have been better off with Amazon's own plug. Alexa can never control the device. I'll ask to find the devices or use the Alexa app on my phone and it finds them, but if I ask Alexa to turn it on or off, it'll say that it's having problems connecting to that device. I don't think it's my network since other smart bulbs and plugs work fine. I'm pretty sure it's the WEMO skill in Alexa that doesn't work, but without any way to troubleshoot, it's hard to know exactly what the problem is.

Scheduling seems to work reliably, but I'm sure WEMO will find some way to mess that up. It comes in a really impressive overpackaged box. If they spent as much on making a reliable product as they did on packaging, this could have been a great product.",2.0 out of 5 stars
J. Smalley,"Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2017","I've got a handful of the older (larger) style WEMO plugs and love them. Easy to set up, work anywhere in my house, etc. This little bugger was nearly impossible to set up. Didn't like my WIFI settings (even though the other switches had no issue with them). I ended up having to change a bunch of things on my router via trial and error while reading message board suggestions. I did finally get it to connect and set up, but the WIFI range on it is sub-par when compared to the older models. I think i'll be able to swap it out with one of the larger ones that's closer to my router in the house to solve the issue, but you'd think with iterative ""improvements"" being made that this would be a superior product to the older model, but so far the only benefit this one has over the older model is the form factor.

Belkin/WMO, You all might also consider making the plug for these on the sides of the switch. One thing I don't like about any of these is that it adds a tremendous thickness to the wall-plate causing some potential issues with furniture placement against walls. A built-in dimmer function would be welcome as well. I use two of these in my kids rooms to control their night lights and would love to be able to adjust the brightness as well as the on-off time.

1. When it works, the Wemo Mini Smart-Plug does turn on and off devices remotely.
2. I also like being able to connect through the Amazon Alexa.

CONS:
1. The mini-plug has stopped working (the light flashes red on the plug and becomes unresponsive) on three separate occasions during week I have owned these (3) plugs.
2. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS POOR. I sent an e-mail request for help through the Wemo app and have YET to receive a satisfactory response (I received an automated response prompting me to go to their FAQ page on their website).
3. HAD TO RESOLVE ISSUE MYSELF. I found on my own that I had to unplug and restart the app and eventually the plugs (I bought three) started working. I believe that unless there is a constant,strong wireless signal (ours is strong, but has had issues the last few days), the Wemo will stop working and won't reconnect itself unless you manually unplug and replug it in.
4. I am MOST disappointed by the fact that should this malfunction occur on a regular basis, I won't be able to use this as a security device when I am away from home. I had planned on using these plugs to turn my lights automatically when I travel.

First problem: 2.4 GHz connection. I realize that all these mini devices do this. But for the longest time the 2.4 in my house didn't reach down to where I needed it to be. I managed to tweak the router to enhance its MIMO capabilities, solving some of this. But it took quite some time to realize that the wireless strength was that bad, because of...

Second problem: The app that comes with it is somewhere between buggy and uninformative. It crashes with some amount of regularity when trying to connect to or update the device. It took going into the app after the device had connected to the wireless network to determine the signal was bad.

Newest problem: After a power flicker, it seemed to not be able to connect to Alexa. I basically removed it entirely and reset its settings, but now it's caught in a situation where the app is refusing to connect to it either on my wireless network or on the device's wireless network (which is on right now after I reset it).

The WeMo Insights are completely reliable, have never failed to turn off or on according to their routines. I now own 2 Mini plugs that I have been struggling to justify. The Mini plugs were great at first and worked as expected, but in the past 3 months have proved nothing but difficult. The first signs of trouble were the fact that they had difficulties maintaining a connection to the WeMo app. Not a bid deal, just unplug them and plug them back in and it is solved... at least for the next 24 hours or so. They would still adhere to their schedule, which is my biggest concern. A pain, but manageable.

Thomas Paine,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2017","As others have noted, the units do NOT allow you to program them to go on/off at specific times, and yes, I've tried all of the suggested ""fixes"" recommended here, they accomplished nothing. This included updating firmware, resetting the part, trying it with/without wifi on on my cell phone, trying while at/away from house, nothing works. In each and every case, it pops up a window saying ""Rule can not be saved. Having trouble saving this rule now. Please check the status of all your WeMo devices.""

Well, the status is fine, WeMo folks: they are online and I am able to turn them on/off remotely, so whatever it is that is causing this BUG that you refuse to fix, it is utterly and completely unrelated to any ""status"" issue, the devices are online and accessible each and every time this happens.

This is a major QC bug and the lack of attention to it by manufacturer is most troubling; I suspect they are refusing to admit/fix the issue because firmware updates cannot accomplish it so they would have to redesign/replace the parts, better for them to try and sweep it user the carpet than to take I suppose.

I've ordered a few parts from competitors, if they work out these go back. It is sad because other than this they work fine, I'm able to control them remotely etc, but I want programmability and they simply will not allow one to program on/off times.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Will Keim,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019","This switch was appealing because it’s slim design allowed both outlets on an outlet box to be used. Many of its competitors, which I have installed all over my house, are bulkier and the other outlet’s plug gets covered up so I can’t use it.

Unfortunately, I’ll take function over form. This thing pairs easily enough, but after that it’s all downhill. I had to redo the pairing with Homekit several times. And then the device kept trying to do a firmware update. But it won’t update. It just sits there spinning and spinning and not dining anything. I found some help forums with other people all having the same problem and the tech support just said to reboot it and do a factory reset and try it again. Well I tried that many times and it did not remedy the issue.

Sometimes the Wemo app can’t even find and control this device - when the apple Home app can. So I know it’s paired and connected, why can’t the wemo app talk to its own devices? If you can’t turn the switch on and off, why would I think the app could do a firmware update?

My first clue about them should have been that it took about 45 minutes to install EACH; multiple attempts to connect and switching between the ad hoc and my wireless for the connect process to failed at some point and to start all over again; after 3-5 tries it would finally finish the setup and I got all 3 online. All seemed OK and they were working, and then after a month my network would no longer let any offline device reconnect but anything that was online was OK -- and the 3 plugs were off line. All with the router looked OK, but I did a router reboot and the rest of the network comes back and is behaving normally. Three plugs off line and looks like they are in setup mode; app says they aren't connected. An hour of trying with one to reconnect it to the network -- power cycle, reset, reinstall the app, … and it still gets partially through the connect process and stops, again trying multiple times and it stopping and resetting at different parts in the process. Gave up and they all were returned -- too flaky, too time consuming. Got something else that took a couple minutes to install",2.0 out of 5 stars
Todd,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2017","On the plus side, I like the form factor (nice skinny plug), and the packaging was nice.

On the down side, my set-up process consisted of watching the app's ""wait"" screen for several minutes, after which it performed one of the following actions, apparently at random:

- Hang when trying to connect to the device, until I force-quit and re-ran the device it
- Hang when trying to connect to the device, until I unplugged the device and plugged it back in again
- Hang when trying to connect to the device, until I uninstalled and reinstalled the app
- Connect to the device, then be unable to connect to the wifi
- Connect to the device, then be unable to connect to the wifi and then crash
- Connect to the device, then connect to my wifi and then crash
- Connect to the device, then connect to my wifi and then search for other Wemo devices, and then tell me I need to restart the app
- Connect to the device, then connect to my wifi and then search for other Wemo devices, and then crash

After about an hour of this, I decided that I'd probably spent more total time trying to get the smart-plug working than I probably ever would have if I added up all the hours in my life in which I decided to turn on and off the lamp. So I decided it wasn't worth it.

J. Berkus,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2018","If you just need a timer for one device, for example to auto-brew coffee in the morning, you don't want a WeMo. It's just way too complicated for the task.

Maybe I'm not the right market for this. Maybe it's really meant for people kitting out a whole ""smart home"";. That would make more sense. As it was, it took me more than 1/2 hour just to set it up to turn on at 6:45 in the morning. Whoever is in charge of their app design should be sent back to user experience class. Simple tasks, like changing the time, require a truly absurd amount of clicking and back-and-forth navigation. Also, a simple little card in the box guiding me through the initial setup would have been nice; Belkin expects this device to be intuitive and it's not.

Once I did get it set up, it worked as advertised -- mostly. However, over the last year it simply fails to turn on about 1/8th of the time, for no apparent reason, which is a problem since this controls my early-morning coffee.

It does fit neatly into an outlet without crowding the other outlets. And manual on/off for it is easy.

But, overall: get a basic digital or mechanical timer instead. You'll be better off.

Next time, though, I'll buy a lower-tech digital timer device instead.",2.0 out of 5 stars

The problem I have had with this product is it won't connect to my Wi-Fi. I have attempted several times to reset the device with no success, and any success was later met with the device timing-out. I've rebooted my Wi-Fi, I've moved the device around the house to see if that area of the house just has a bad connection, and I even looked online to make sure I""m setting it up correctly. I tried the Wemo Mini Smart Plug and had the same problem. Only two of the six devices I purchased work. I finally donated the device. I currently have on order a different product which has better review. If this product works better I will replace all of my Wemo Smart Plugs with the new devices.

I would have given this product one star, but out of all the Wemo Smart Plugs I purchased, only two of them are still working. I feel if you order six Wemo devices, all six should work. I could see if one didn't but four out of the six is not a good indicator of a good product.",2.0 out of 5 stars
MediaMan,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2019","I use a variety of smart outlets, and this one in particular gives me more issues than any other brand I've used. The app, for one, is absolutely awful. When trying to set up via the wifi of the unit itself it is atrocious. I spent half an hour messing with it one time after a power outage (they don't recover well unlike my other smart outlets), and had a newer phone (Galaxy Note 9) and it took me that long to figure out that I needed to turn off mobile data for the WEMO app to work. There was nothing online about this issue.
But that's my main issue. I'll set up the WEMO correctly, and over time, for no apparent reason, it will get messed up. It will suddently become ""not found"" in its own app, and subsequently, disconnect from Alexa. Luckily, the timer and schedule settings saved to the device still work when this happens, so my heater (I bought this one because it could handle the power requirements of a space heater) will still shut off when required.

I Purchase,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2018","It now currently works with Google Assistant but that's about the only good thing I can say about them.

Setting them up for the first time took multiple tries. In the end I don't know why it worked when it did. I was following the same instructions over and over. Updating the firmware also took multiple tries and it just worked at some point for inexplicable reasons.

IFTTT integration is unreliable and that's an understatement. I have one applet that I use with this plug and it works maybe 1 out of 10 times. Most of the time when trying to edit my IFTTT applet or just create a new one to troubleshoot the problem, it can't even find the plug. Everything else I have works with IFTTT just fine.

No Stringify integration. This would not be a problem for me if the IFTTT integration worked since I can trigger an IFTTT applet from Stringify.

You can google all these problems and will find that they are very common and have gone without a solution for months/years.

Daniel G.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2020","Accessibility Devices are such trash when they force you to do the very thing you bought them in order to avoid!

We use smartplugs because it’s inconvenient to physically access the device we’re hoping to control.

I kid you not: upon being plugged in, the set-up STARTS A TIMER & GIVES YOU 1:59 TO TOGGLE YOUR SMART-PLUG!!!

(In my case, I’m OCD, and this meant a rushed hand-washing & quite uncomfortable hustle into the very area I’d hoped the plug would help me avoid, moving forward.)

It precedes this by requiring you to get on the smartplug’s own WiFi network,
then follows it up by having you log *it* BACK into your *own* WiFi,
following which, you’ll have to return your mobile device to your regular WiFi network.

THEN,
you add it to Alexa,
by enabling the WeMo skill.

There is a smartplug from Amazon that’s $10 cheaper, works without an additional skill/app, and sets up by scanning a QR code.

Cons: the setup is absolute cancer. I'm a technically savvy 25 y/o with experience in IT, computer science, programming, you name it. The app included to help you set up the WEMO plug is atrocious. You can follow the instructions step by step and it just won't work. The app closes & has to restart every time you open a new screen. Each page takes close to a minute to load (on a 2019 android phone). My particular problem was that the app wouldn't recognize my home WiFi (neither the 2.4 GHz or the 5 GHz bands). The solution after screwing around for over 1.5 hours was to try my wife's phone for setup, and it magically worked. Did absolutely nothing different, and we both use new(ish) Samsung android devices. Go figure.

Note: they have a terrible design flaw. They provide a QR code to scan for easy set up. But where did they place the QR code? On the -back- of the plug where it's invisible when plugged in. It has to be plugged in before setup. Just dumb. I had to photograph and print out the QR codes so I could scan them during set up. Even that wasn't enough to get them working again recently.

As a added benefit your tv (and everything else connected to the switch) won't consume any energy if you're not using it. The switch will though but still.. Some devices really suck up alot of energy even when not using them (read sony ps4!)

A couple of days ago, within 2 months of purchase one of these switches fails to connect the network. I've tried countless solutions (there are a lot of threads about this on belkins website), but nothing seems to work. 2 months is just way too fast for a device like this to fail!

Phillip M Masters,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2020","Like most Belikin products the wemo line continues the tradition of pure, unaltered garbage. I own five wemo products, and should be judged accordingly for purchasing four products after the catastrophe of setting up the first. I can’t say that the setup never works, but I can say that zero of five have been setup as depicted in the tutorial videos or the provided instructions. Mix in Apple HomeKit and you are in for a truly frustrating experience (can’t place that blame on Belkin).

Once you finally get it setup, in my experience, they work pretty well, until they just decided to disappear from the network for an undisclosed amount of time, and then randomly reappearing whenever it feels right. On the plus side, they have continued to work while being ghosts of my network.

Then you can attempt to update the firmware, when requested, and you have a 50/50 chance at it taking, or having to factory reset the device and head down the gauntlet of setting it up once again. Take this review for what it’s worth, I’m the idiot with five of them.",2.0 out of 5 stars

You cannot really put these on your guest wifi, because when their cloud service is down, controlling them over your local non-guest wifi is the only option. I absolutely hate putting IOT devices that I cannot control on my non-guest wifi network. I am repeatedly having to unplug these to reboot them and re-connect to my wifi. They are just 10' away from my router, but anytime I reboot the router (firmware updates) these things have like a 50/50 shot of not reconnecting. The setup process was pretty tedious.

JB,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2017","These devices are phone once you get them paired up or are only planning to use them on a single device. You are requested to provide an email address during setup however you don't actually create an account. You will then continue through the setup phase and provide your SSID (network name) and password. Once that has been completed it will work on your device. Supposedly once the wemo devices are connected to the specified SSID, you should then be able to open the wemo app on the second device (assuming that the second device is on the same SSID as the wemo device) and it should scan and find your wemo devices that are on the SSID which you are using. It hasn't worked that way for me, even though I'm connected to the same SSID, the app takes me to a ""Let's get started"" screen rather than detecting the wemo devices.

I’m using three switches in conjunction with Alexa, and while the voice functionality works fairly well (I’d say 70% of the time) if I want to control them through the WeMo app, it almost never works and I’m told the devices are not detected (screenshot attached) despite the lights being on/responding to Alexa voice commands. That is extremely frustrating when you’re out of range of an echo device or trying to simply turn off the lights without shouting. The short lived novelty of “smart home” features is difficult the justify when weighed against the inconsistent functionality and high price tag. Given that the intended purpose of these switches is to make home control easier, I’d say they fall tragically short when you take into consideration the amount of time inevitably wasted troubleshooting the devices or navigating the buggy app. Sincerely hope the tech gets there soon, but unfortunately it’s still very underwhelming.",2.0 out of 5 stars

After struggling to get it detected and set it up in the room I planned it initially, I had to move it around and get it setup close the Router to even detect and complete the setup. All my other wireless devices have a good range but not this one. Even after setup, this one has a brain of its own, I tried setting it up with both Google Home and Alexa and once a while they both cant detect this damn thing. I have to unplug and replug for this piece to work. I felt irritated since my wife bought a similar smart plug from bestbuy with Insignia brand and that one works better than this so called Belkin Wemo. Bad product for the price paid.

Using cellular data with wifi supposibly keeps it from working so I turned it off, but the app crashes over and over until you toggle that setting like 2 or 3 times then it let's you setup your plug. It also doesn't give you the option to use a new network when resetting up existing plugs I had to wait 2 - 4 minutes for the dang thing to realize the network it was looking for is 40 minutes away and isn't reachable before it would let me connect to my new network.

JackLumber,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2019","I got hooked on wemo products a few years ago, including the plugs and light switches. At first everything worked like a dream. I could control everything remotely and set programs for different lights. But then came the dark times. Literally. For no reason I can pinpoint, everything went bad. First one plug or light switch would go offline. Then another. I would reboot them but it became a game of whack-a-mole as a different switch or plug would go offline and soon I was caught in an endless cycle of fixing the things. That combined with the terrible customer service and crappy primitive interface has forced me to give up and explore other options, including Phillips Hue Lights and Amazon plugs.

EDIT: Found the ultimate workaround to make this thing work without interfering with my iDevices switches. The trick was to add this to HomeKit without the Wemo app (through Home app directly). The Wemo app must not be on any device inside your network, if it is, then even if you add it through the Home app, the problem will come back.

Placeholder,"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2019","I purchased two additional Wemo plugs since the original 2 plugs were reliable. After setting up the new plugs into the network and the app , Wemo consistently lost the network connevtion. The app displayed a Device Not Connected screen.
This started happening with increased frequency after downloading the suggested firmware updates.

Technical support's advice was to unplug then plug the devices , clear the app's data and even force stop the app.

This reminded me if ctrl alt delete. When all else fails, reboot. Ugh.

The attraction of these plugs is the ability to control devices in a remote location. The technical support steps require you to be there and essentially reboot the plugs and app and router.

If I was always at this location, I would manually turn the lights on and off.

Raysc77,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2017",I bought this back in January. They have a much smarter design than the original wemo switches. There's 1 button vs 2. It's much smaller not blocking other outlets. But it did cost $5 more or so when I bought it. Unfortunately something I did not know was that there was going to be a firmware upgrade in the future that would cause all of my newer WeMo switches to constantly break down and stop working. Sometimes plugging them from the wall and starting Discovery again with Amazon Alexa will fix it. Sometimes it does not. Massive pain in the ass. I'm about to throw them all out. If I knew that spending an extra $5 would cause me this headache I would have never done it.

Its installation went far more smoothly but it too eventually lost its connection with Alexa. While waiting to receive the replacement I got 3 TP-Link Mini HS105 smart plugs.

Then the party was over and the lights came on, er well....didn't.
Alexa tells you the device is not responding, so you walk over and observe the Wemo lights showing no connection to WiFi. Curious, as Alexa was still connected to WiFI. Unplug the Wemo, plug it back in. Wait 60 seconds. Works again.
Prepare to repeat this dance every 3-4 days until your frustration gets the better of you and you resort to the tried and true method of plugging it in yourself.

If I had to guess what is happening, it seems like the connection between the application and the network stops after a period of time, and you have to touch the on off button more than once to get a response. It’s more than just tapping it twice. You have to tap once, wait a few seconds for it to try to turn the light on or off, only to see it time out, the repeat a second time.

The B unit saw so many more WiFi access points and eventually, after several crashes, got through the setup procedure. It still would only connect to my Apple AirPort Extreme, and not the two other b/g/n networks on different channels that I usually use for devices like this.

My guess is the jumping back and forth across wifi networks gets the phone and the device out of sync and it is hard to troubleshoot and figure out what is wrong.
I'll probably continue to buy them for myself, when they make sense, but I hate trying to deal with them at friends and families homes. I've wasted hours with these products.",2.0 out of 5 stars

MO,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2017","UPDATE 3/20/2017: As you'll see below the nice folks at Wemo support reached out to ask me about the issue. Support had some good questions, and I felt like they knew what they were doing. I didn't get the usual basic questions about if the Wemo is plugged in. Ultimately I just had to hunker down, and do proper troubleshooting. After about 3 hours I finally narrowed down the basic issue.

Some context first. I connect all of my IoT gizmos to an isolated guest network. The idea is if somebody hacks one, they aren't easily getting to my laptops, and other sensitive devices. I have a Netgear R700 Nighthawk router that supports firewalled guest networks to fit this purpose.

I noticed in the router logs that the Wemo was actually connecting, and getting an IP address. However the amber light on the plug would keep flashing indicating it didn't think it was connected. What's weird is exactly every 60 seconds I'd see another DHCP request. Weirder yet the first time the Wemo DHCP's it seems to be stable.

Ultimately I found that if I went into my guest network settings and checked the box - ""Allow guests to see each other and access my local network"" the Wemo was happy and worked just fine. Something about the added L2 isolation is making the Wemo very upset. Of course leaving this box checked entirely defeats the purpose of the guest network. Ultimately I signed the Wemo onto my private network; let's hope they've done their security homework.

I'll give back a star because the plug works and stays connected now, and it seems to be a little more responsive as well. Holding a star off the potential 4 star rating as I have to compromise my network to do it.

==== Original Review 3/11/2017 ====
First, I'll lead with I'm VERY savvy when it comes to IoT products. My company designs and implements hardware and mobile apps for a variety of back office providers (Amazon, Ayla, Photon...). This is my first Wemo product, and overall I'm really disappointed. Wemo was one of the first to market, and a well known brand name. I expected a lot more from a company like Belkin, and a product that has been fielded since the beginning of the IoT rave started. Especially at this price point.

All I'm really looking for is a smart plug to automatically power cycle a piece of hardware once a day. And allow me to remotely power cycle it if necessary.

Note: my Wi-Fi signal is good. Less than 10 feet from my router. And I have 50Mbps Internet service. My other gizmos and gadgets have great response times so I'm not having trouble with my Internet.

The Good:
* The product looks professionally done, and feels like good quality construction.
* Wi-Fi pairing was really easy. I'm using the iOS app. Belkin could give me a button to launch iOS Wi-Fi settings, and use a captive network to automatically redirect me to the app once you connect to the Wemo's Wi-Fi access point to save me a little work. No big deal though.
* I didn't have to create a user account. The last thing I really want is another user account somewhere.
* In general, fairly simple and clean app design
* Active user community. Belkin's knowledge base is pretty useless, but the community forums are great!

The Bad:
* Exception to app design: The schedule options were confusing at first. Specifically the ""on until"" option. After a little trial and error I figured it out.
* The first time I created a schedule it took a minute to save it. Edits are faster maybe 10 seconds.
* Toggling power from my phone is really slow - 10-15 seconds. Not the end of the world, but I hate waiting.

The Ugly:
* I needed a firmware update right away. Which is fine. Kicked off the update. It sat and spun, and spun, and spun for about an hour. Noticed the LED was blinking amber. Pull up the manual and find out that means it's not able to connect to Wi-Fi. Power cycled the mini and still no connection. Reset via the on/off button. Repaired with the app and it was fine again.
* I setup my Wemo on a plug by my desk where it's easy to access and see that it is running the schedule correctly. It's final home will be somewhere that's not as easy to access. When I moved the Wemo to it's new home it came up with the flashing amber light again. No amount of power cycling or fidgeting would get it back onto my router again. I had to reset it and repair it again.
* Did some more testing and sure enough - once the power is lost it doesn't reconnect.
* I pulled power on my router just to see what would happen and when it came back up the Wemo didn't reconnect in that case either.
* Conclusion: If you lose your Wi-Fi connection due to router loss, warm reboot, or cold reboot you have to repair. This is a scenario any IoT product is going to face. Simply unacceptable Belkin would even think of shipping units with this issue.

I found a few posts on the community forum with many other people complaining about the same Wi-Fi problem. I'm not alone.

If I had frequent power outages the Wi-Fi problem would be a non-starter 1 star rating. I can live with it so I'll go 2 stars.

If Belkin can get a firmware fix out so Wi-Fi reconnect is reliable I'd go 4 stars. -1 star for the annoying schedule UI, and slowness.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Customer Review,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2017","I purchased this item from Amazon on January 9th, as a pre-order from when they were released as a new item on January 10th, 2017. After receiving two defective units from Amazon, and before returning the second, I decided to play around with it more and do some more research online. I am posting this to help anyone else who purchased this and is having trouble getting it to connect to your local WiFi network. I did get the unit working fine, but I removed two stars from my review because of the hassle of getting it to work. I spent over an hour with WeMo tech support, who offered no solutions, and made me jump through a bunch of hoops in the process. Cycling a reboot of my router did nothing. Changing my WiFi password did nothing. Disconnecting my phone from cellular service did nothing. The issue with these early units lies in the fact that they seem to get ""confused"" if you have other WeMo devices in your home. When trying to set up this WeMo mini, the WeMo app on my iPhone would find the device after I connected to its WiFi. The screen would show the device, ask me to name it, and click ""Next"". After clicking next, it would get stuck trying to get the device to find my home WiFi network. I have 4 other ""older"" WeMo devices (none of which ever had any issue connecting). I have a WeMo light switch, and 3 regular WeMo smart plugs. Two of the other WeMo smart plugs were easily accessible, so I tried completely unplugging them (not just turning them off). I did a factory reset on the WeMo mini I purchased, went through the app process of connecting it again, and voila! It immediately found my WiFi network and connected. And then it immediately downloaded a firmware update. So it seems like WeMo is aware of an issue, yet their tech support wasn't informed. And so far, I seem to be the only one publicly acknowledging the issue with these early release devices and buggy firmware.

So long story short, if you have other WeMo devices in your household, and have trouble getting this WeMo mini to connect, try unplugging as many of the other devices as you can (they will automatically reconnect online after you plug them back in), factory reset the mini, and go through the setup process again. It should hopefully work.",3.0 out of 5 stars
WellDressedBookwormDad,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2023","I had these smart plugs for a few years and they worked fairly OK with my Amazon Echo device… once I could actually get them working, that is. The version I had required me to download the app which never seems to have been updated. Linking them into my home’s Wi-Fi always took forever, it did not seem to be quick or easy at all. If I had an hour or so to spare doing this, then eventually it would work and I could get the plugs paired up with my Echo device and then they would work just fine until the next power surge or loss of signal or whatever, in which case I would have to go through the whole process again. The last time this happened I just couldn’t get them to connect to my Wi-Fi, so they have been consigned to the trashcan and I am going to buy a different product now.

And as an aside, this is not an issue with my Wi-Fi or Internet. I always pay top dollar for the fastest Internet possible because I work from home. Everything else in my house connected to Wi-Fi works just fine.

I can’t give them one star because they do actually work. But I can’t give them more than three stars, because it takes them forever to work, and as I mentioned above, now they have stopped working.",3.0 out of 5 stars
David L.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2020","I purchased 2 older Wemo mini smart plugs in 2018. They were easy to set up and worked well, and their wi-fi had great range. So when I needed another smrt plug, I ordered another Wemo mini. This is a newer model, and setting it up using an iPhone requires use of Apple Home. I found the setup very difficult.

First, setup requires scanning a HomeKit code on the plug. The code is hidden when the Wemo is plugged into a wall. So you have to unplug the Wemo, scan the code, plug it back in, and wait for the Wemo to boot up. After repeating this process several times, I connected the Wemo to an extension cord, so I could scan the code while it was plugged in.

I tried to avoid using HomeKit by selecting the option in the Wemo iPhone app that is used for older plugs that don't support HomeKit. The instructions say to connect the iPhone to a separate wi-fi network that is created by the Wemo. As soon as I did that, the Wemo was recognized by my iPhone as a HomeKit device, and launched the Apple Home app to complete configuration. I was unable to configure the Wemo without using HomeKit.

Initially the configuration via HomeKit failed with a message ""This device is not compatible with your wi-fi network"". The self-help in the Wemo app suggested resetting the Wemo and trying again. That didn't help. A search of the web revealed that this error occurs when your house has separate wifi networks for 2.4ghz and 5 ghz, and your phone is connected to the 5ghz network. The Wemo only supports 2.4ghz, and your phone must also be connected to the 2.4ghz network for HomeKit configuration to work. Once I did that I was able to complete configuration of the Wemo. Unfortunately, the Wemo app was unable to see my newly configured plug, even though it was visible in the Home app. I did one more reset of the Wemo, deleted it from Home, reconfigured again, and this time is showed up in the Wemo app. All of this took a couple of hours, and was much more frustrating than it should be.

Once configured, the Wemo smart plug works great, just like the old ones. So I would give it 1 star for setup, and 5 stars for how it works after finally completing setup.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Erik Noren,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2019","The setup process was error prone and took a lot of Googling to figure out that the first problem was that the plugs didn’t like WiFi passwords with special characters. My WiFi router has two bands so they’re on the low and now far less secure band while all my other devices are on the high band. This seems to cause trouble with the WeMo app which most of the time reports the plugs as unresponsive until I switch my WiFi to the same network and then there’s a small chance the plugs will get picked up.

I was able to add them to my Echo fairly easily once they were set up but they would go unresponsive randomly and now for weeks they haven’t been accessible at all through it. Connecting to Apple Home failed on one of the three plugs I set up and left the it in a state where the WeMo app thought it was connected but Apple Home didn’t list it. More Googling before I finally tried a full reset on the plug and set it up again and then it worked. Now the only app that works consistently is Apple Home and that still has glitches where the devices will be unresponsive for a bit and I have to wait for them to come back online to turn them on or off.

The button on the plug to turn toggle power manually is a nice fallback but the purpose of the plugs was to make less-accessible light fixtures more easily controllable. All this did was move the switch from the light itself to the outlet which is harder to reach. At this point the only reason I’m still using them is because I paid money for them and they do give me more flexibility when they’re working right and I have hope of a firmware update coming out to fix these issues (if I can get the WeMo app to notice them again in order to update them that is). If they stopped working altogether I don’t think I’d miss them or even replace them; I’d just be mad I spent money on them in the first place.",3.0 out of 5 stars

In order for this plug to work I have to constantly un-plug device, forget it on my phone, then plug it back in and start the initial install for my phone to find it. The first initial install went very smoothly with no problems and I was up and running with-in minutes.
The next day came into the office and used my phone to turn the device on (I have a desk lamp plugged into it) the light came on, everything was fine. After about 2 hours the light turned off, and I noticed that the Wemo light was blinking, no color just the ""white"" light to let you know the product is working. I went through the trouble shooting suggestions and nothing worked. So I unplugged the Wemo plug and the light from that and plugged the Wemo back in. I had my phone forget the device and reinstalled the Wemo device and everything was fine, or so I thought. I turned off the light.
The next day when I went to turn the light on again the light on the Wemo was blinking White and the device was not found on my phone. So I sent an email to the company explaining the issue that I was having. I went through the steps again of unplugging, having my phone forget the Wemo and reinstall it again. Again, Wemo worked as it should, until I shut it off, the only way I could the stupid thing to work was to keep un-installing the Wemo.

D and R,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2018","I'm still sticking to my WeMo setup.. just not sure I'll invest more money in to the ecosystem. It's a great concept and remote control/timers is super convenient... WHEN IT WORKS.

New users may want to second guess themselves before going ""all-in"" on an IOT device. I own 7 WeMo devices: 2 dimmers, 3 switch, 4 plugs. Belkin support website was not super helpful. Hope these tips below help you out.

ISSUE 1: KRACK vulnerability firmware update
-This wreaked COMPLETE havoc on my WeMo setup. This *almost* made me rip out all the plugs and devices. It made remote control unusable.
-Plugs updated firmware across 2 weeks. I had to 'hard-reset' ALL DEVICES after each time update a single device updated.
-When going through setup, repeatedly got the infamous ""Password invalid"" when connecting to WiFi. It is NOT you. You are typing in the password correctly. I tried both Android and iOS phones to setup my devices. The solution? Try again in a couple hours. Magic.

ISSUE 2: Migrating to a new router and 'multicast nightmare'
After the KRACK debacle I got my setup stable again. Then, I had to replace my router. I haven't figured out which was responsible, but I had to reboot my router almost daily:
*HomeKit/AirPrint/Bonjour was usable for only an hour after a reboot
*WeMo App would always show as 'Not Connected' when connected to same WiFi. Sometimes work if I use over LTE-only.

How I Fixed:
- Belkin says ""Don't use same WiFi name. It's true, WeMo doesn't like same WiFi name from 2 different routers""
- On Asus Router:
--- Enable Enable IGMP Snooping for 2.4G and 5G wireless
--- Optimized for XBox / BG Protection
--- Set 2.4G 'Control Channel' to '11'

Deborah/Martin,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2019","I bought two of these, and they worked great so I bought three more. And then they quit working. The app can no longer find the devices. I'm a pretty tech-savvy guy, but I've spent literally hours scouring the forums for answers to all these questions: Why won't the firmware update when it tells me I need to, but spins and spins and spins? Why can't I reset a device they way Wemo says I ought to? Why does it tell me there's no internet when all my other devices say there is? I've reset devices, and uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times. By the way, when you do this, it tells you to update the firmware (see debacle above), and provides no way to back out of the update's endless, pointless loop of doom. They also recommend ridiculous fixes like reconfiguring routers, etc. WTF? Are you guys serious? I should have to be a wifi wizard to use what's supposed to be a consumer product.

My recommendation? Switch to TP-Link with the KASA app. It works great! I've got 7 or 8 devices going now and have never had a single issue. I've been holding off buying more because I foolishly convinced myself I could make the Wemo work. Why can TP-Link figure out what Belkin can't? But I'm done now. $150 goes into the trash tonight.

UPDATE 4-20
I contacted Belkin after they responded to my review. They scheduled a tech call and walked me through resetting the app. The call took 25 minutes, and the tech was very courteous. The fix is one I hadn't encountered online after endless searching: for Android, go to Settings - Apps - Wemo - Storage - Clear Data and reboot. I'm upgrading my rating from one star to 3. You still shouldn't have to go through all this, but Belkin's response impressed me.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Thomasdoc,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2018","After spending several hours trying to set this up, reading the forums etc., I finally realized what the key requirement is to set this up: You must make sure that the only network that the Wemo can find during set up is your 2.4Ghz home network. You must turn on Airplane mode (so that Wemo cannot connect to your cellular network), forget for the time being your 5Ghz network, and then the setup should work.
Essentially during setup, you are connecting your phone or tablet directly to your Wemo via WiFi, and then the Wemo gets the information from the app how to connect to your 2.4Ghz WiFi network and it tries to find your respective home Wifi network. I hope I got the sequence right. Anyhow, IF your cellular connection or 5Ghz is an option, the app will try to connect to your cellular network first, or to the 5Ghz network, which in turn gives the Wemo device the wrong info. And then set up will fail. Also make sure to give the app the correct password for your network. Because if you don't, or have a spelling error, the app won't tell you and you never know. This is what fixed the connection issues for me.
I think it is ridiculous that the setup is so flawed and that would be a reason for me to not get those. Let's see how they work in practice and I will report back later.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2018","I am replacing my old X10 plugs with wifi/web app managed smart plugs. I read a good review of the Wemo mini, but didn't do much on-line research before I decided to buy one -- just one, to test it myself. If the price is in an acceptable range, that is the best way after all. Besides, I've always been a little wary of Belkin products. They sometimes just haven't worked very well for me in the past.

The packaging was waaay too big for the item itself. A real waste of cardboard! Come-on marketing. You can do better.

The installation instructions were simple enough - 6 steps in all, maybe the part about changing your wifi router to ""Wemo.Mini"" is a little confusing to a total non-geek (I've been doing computer stuff since before the first PC). Anyway, the sheet also includes a troubleshooting section on the back. Good thing! The Wemo app would not connect the Wemo mini to my dirt standard stock comcast Xfi wifi router (there must be millions of these around the country.) Then, after about 8 tries, just when I'm about to send it back, it connected for no apparent reason.

Moving on, I have read since that the app itself has an old tired interface, but I have an iPhone 7, so I'm used to old tired interfaces. No matter, it's simple enough. I was able to set up rules and they actually worked. That's really all I wanted...except... I also want remote access. It simply won't connect. I have studied on-line resources, opened ports on my router (which is BTW very clunky with XFi) to no avail.

Amz631,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2021","A couple of years ago, I ordered several of these based on a favorable (non-Amazon) review. I have used them since then, but they don't work very well.

Pros: They do work and it is possible to integrate them with Alexa.

Cons: About every week, at least one of them ""forgets"" how to work. Most of the time I have to unplug the device, wait a bit (sometimes overnight) and plug it back in. Most of the time that works. About 10% of the time, I have to factory reset the plug and re-introduce it to the network. If I power down my router for any period of time, one or more will require the same reset process. Many months ago, a firmware update that should have been one on the app, required me to find an undocumented process on-line and then fiddle with every plug, multiple times, to get them all working again.

By comparison: I have two Amazon-branded plugs which I have also used for a long time. I plugged them in and forgot about them. They just worked. No setup. No weekly maintenance for lights that suddenly stopped working.

In my opinion, wemos are twitchy and hobbyist grade at best. However, every network is different, and it is possible these problems are to my network. I suppose it is also possible that these problems were corrected with more recently manufactured wemos, and it may not be fair to judge current production on older models.

Michael Head,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2018","So this is my 4th WEMO product and until yesterday a very happy customer. I have 2 older style wall outlets and one light switch. Easy setups and all work with Alexa. So yesterday I get my WEMO mini in the mail, plug in, go to the app to add, all goes well except the device never showed in the list of devices, did a restart, loaded again, same result. Off to customer service and downhill from there. After checking I have the latest app version, that the mini did not show up in the hardware list and then a 5 minute hold of elevator music - what were my options - delete and reinstall the app, the catch, some of my devices might not show up. True to fashion, I cleared the cache and data from the app (did not delete), and guess what - the WEMO mini showed up, but my 3 previous devices were gone. Get the 2 wall switches reloaded and then put back in my routines with Alexa. Regarding the wall switch, no luck in getting it added back, WiFi for the WEMO showed up, but for some reason my phone reverted back to my home WiFi. Here's the catcher, although the wall switch does not show as a device, Alexa still works with the wall switch - so until it stops I guess I don't care that its not listed.

Actually ordered by mistake. It looked like the TP-LINK that I already have, so I jumped in to get another. I tried to cancel the order when I realized my mistake. But, it came today, so I figured I'd give it a try.

Setup was easy, both connecting to the network and to Echo took 5 minutes, tops. I have this one controlling the stereo. On/off works just as it should.

So, I have another smart device app on my phone, but Wemo didn't make me create an account.

I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Jim Clack,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2018","Actually a decent e-switch but suffers from one simple problem: The instructions leave out one very important step. The quick-start sheet says nothing about it. The online instructions say nothing about it. The FAQs/help say nothing about it. They would need half as many support people and would get much better feedback if they would fix their instructions. The missing step? ""Make sure that Mobile Data is turned off on all nearby mobile devices before configuring.""
When I installed my first Wemo I had to wait on hold over an hour to get through to somebody that told me this. The next Wemo installed fine because I remembered this. When I bought my third one, I remembered that there was a missing step but I couldn't recall what it was. I spent another hour on the phone with them, this time trying a lot of different things, before I realized that my wife's phone was nearby and had mobile data turned on. Ugh. Their support guy told me that this is a really common issue and most of their support calls that last more than a minute or two are due to this. Why can't they fix their instructions? Just add it to the troubleshooting steps online.
There's another setup caveat as well... Once it connects to your Wifi you have less than a minute to complete the next step or it will disconnect. In many cases that is not enough time so you might have to try it a few times to get it done quickly enough.
Anyway, now you know; so it shouldn't be a problem for you.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Kevin,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2017","Received 2 WeMo minis yesterday. First one setup with no problems. Second one was a real pain. It kept saying connection failed no matter where I put the plug. Close to the router, away from it, near my phone, away from it, didn't matter. After about 10 times of cycling between the Wemo Wi-Fi and my home Wi-Fi I unplugged the first Wemo and tried again, this time it connected and setup with no problem. Plugged the first one back in and there they both were. Then it said there was a firmware upgrade required. The second Wemo took an hour to upgrade, the first ran all night and still showed upgrading. Out of frustration I turned off the app and unplugged the Wemo, plugged it into the outlet where the other was plugged in and started the app. Then it showed upgrade complete. Go figure! Then there are the rules. These are the applets the app uses to turn off and on at specified times. When I click on the rules icon it takes about 5 minutes of ""looking for rules"" before it comes up. So after the second Wemo had upgraded I set a rule for it to come on at 5:45 am. When I got up this morning it wasn't on and when I looked in the rule it wasn't there . On the plus side Alexa had no problem detecting both plugs. The Wemo is a great concept and I like that the Mini is small enough that you can still use the other outlet, but they still have some work to do to make it really user friendly and frustration free.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I don't like how the connectivity is shown on the cell phone looks. One time I can see the WeMo Mini then the next time it was there. I had to do a hard reset a few times.

J. Lee,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2017","I bought 3 of these about 2 months ago. I haven't had a chance to explore using them until recently. As many other reviewers have stated, my Wemo mini plugs will not allow me to save any rules. I did a web search, and many other users have been having the same problem, particularly from iPhones. There is no way to try to make rules on the website or on an iPad. So the plugs have pretty much become an expensive way to remotely turn on/off my lamps. Without being able to save rules, I cannot have them turn on automatically according to a schedule or according to sunset or turn off according to bedtime, etc. What a waste of money. I can't even return them now. Belkin technical support gives people the run around (usual...reset the password, reset router, reset phone) and they have yet to come up with a firmware solution.

UPDATE 10-11-2017. Okay, I think I figured out how to get the thing to work properly. After installing the Wemo and getting the app up and running, the Wemo will do a firmware update. You would think that this is the end of the install process but it isn’t. After the firmware update, unplug the Wemo, and plug it back in while holding the power button. This will do a factory reset. After doing this process, the device now allows me to save rules. Finally!",3.0 out of 5 stars
KarteMann,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2022","Belkin does not seem to support these anymore. I would not buy them.

There are known security issues iwht these and Belkin has not provided firmware upgrades for these.

What I have is a Smart Things hub and Zwave outlets. It's more secure and a little quicker than the wemo plugs.

WIFI smart devices can take a toll on your wifi network performance. Every smart bulb, switch, plug, etc adds up. Many routers starts to slow down after about 30 devices connect.

I like that the smart plug can be do it's thing: be remotely activated/deactivated. This is pretty reliable when directly controlled through the app.

Where it starts to get horrible is trying to use more advanced features like rules:
- frequently, cannot access Rules at all, endless spinner with 'Looking for rules'. Restart the app and try again.
- If trying to override the app, as in the plug is 'On' per the rule but you go in and turn it off via app, you get confusing messages: 'Rule is disabled' . Does this mean permanently disabled or just overridden this time? It seems erratic, sometimes the rule will not work again the next cycle and sometimes it will.
- timer: I have the rule set for the same time on/off per day. It seems to be 'close' but not exact, as in 6:15 might mean the plug turns off at 6:15 or 6:30 or somewhere in between. Not a big deal... but why?
- firmware updates: the app keeps suggesting firmware updates so I say OK but it has been failing for the last 2 months.
- location permission : small complaint, but why does the app want to know my location?",3.0 out of 5 stars
Andrea S. Reback Shmueli,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2017","This is our seventh Wemo device. We use them, together with IFTTT.com, to automate lights and heaters in two locations. We use switches, wall light switches, and finally this mini switch, which fits neatly inside our landscaping lights low-voltage transformer box and controls our outdoor lighting. Another set of wemos controls heating in our vacation location, and together with an inexpensive ThermoPeanut and a couple of IFTTT rules, can function as an internet-based whole house thermostat. The devices are work just fine and deserve five stars. I'm taking one star off for the fact that the app will only work in one location. We use automation precisely because we need to control a remote location. Having to install the Wemo app on multiple devices, and control each location on a different device, is a serious hurdle (we also had to create two accounts on IFTTT to deal with this.) And taking a second start off for the app in general. IFTTT has proven more reliable than the app in setting up and executing rules (although only the app allows you to specify ""15 minutes before / after sunset"". Nothing in IFTTT allows provides that at the moment.) And if there is a networking problem and your devices, for any reason, lose contact, you cannot fix it remotely and must go back on location to fix the issue.

I picked up a smart switch/smart plug bundle on closeout at Home Depot for less than $30 and intended to use them at our summer cabin. However, after installing the switch, the WEMO app couldn't find it. Turns out it can only control WEMO devices in one location (connected to the same router). No remote operation at a second location. That's crazy. I am able to control the switch using a third-party app as long as I'm connected to the wifi network at my cabin, but I can't control it remotely. That's really all I need for that situation, but I'm glad I discovered that limitation before I bought more WEMO devices to use at the cabin. I guess I have to go to a completely different brand if I want to have automation at the cabin.

So I would give it five stars if you only need to control at on location. But that limitation is enough to downgrade it to three stars until Belkin gets its act together.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Geko,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2018","Connecting the Wemo outlet to my home WiFi network and to the Wemo app on the phone was reasonably easy, although not completely straightforward. However, the integration with the Google Home app was far from rock solid. I was able to include the outlet in the list of devices in my Google Home app without too much difficulty. However, the connection was dropped a number of times and when I spoke the ""Hey Google ..."" command to turn on the lamp that was attached to the outlet, Google Home informed me it could find the device. This was despite being listed as one of the devices in the Google Home app. In fact, I was able to turn on the lamp by clicking the ON button for the outlet in my app. It just could not find it when I spoke the command.

To be fair, this might be an issue with Google Home, rather than with Wemo. But at any rate, the two systems need to be better integrated.

The ""Connect to Wemo Wifi, then back to your regular Wifi"" was a mess. It kept interrupting itself and trying to connect to my cell. The link they gave on how to adjust the Android settings was outdated as I have a Nexus 6P with the latest Android and it didn't have their options.

To me this is a fairly major gotcha, which I can only hope will be remedied by a future firmware update. However, since Belkin appears to have no means of receiving user product feedback, the odds are that this problem will not be addressed soon, if ever.

Also, it should be noted that the refurb units that I have did not come with the HomeKit firmware update installed, which made the installation process cumbersome.

Also the WEMO app provides no means of creating and printing the QR Code for the device, which would have been handy.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I tried everything I could think of. Reset everything, but the switch would tell me incorrect password for the wifi every time. I double checked the password and even made the internet accessible without a password to see if that helped. No luck. I gave up and put it back in the box to see how to return it.

It may turn on with an Alexa comand but it won’t shut off. It it will randomly only to turn on again on its own a few hours later. Not fun when you are trying to sleep.

I was one try away from either packing the device up and shipping it back or stomping on it and throwing it in the trash.

This eliminates the confusion that the WEMO app has when trying to connect to the device through your local wifi. You would think, Belkin, a networking company, would better design their software so that the wifi handoff would go smoother.

C. Brookes,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2017","This is a great update for the Wemo plug. The physical design of this update is far superior to the bulky older version of the smart plugs. The only issue i have is that at least in my case, the two i bought to add to my smart home seem to have a weaker connection to wifi networks. I originally bought this one to add my aquarium lights to my smart home set up. The problem was that both of the smart plugs i purchased couldn't dependably maintain a connection to the wifi from inside of the cabinetry. Then just switched in one of my older model Wemo plugs and that just works just fine. Then i used the newer ones in place of where I had the older plugs beforehand.

Crapshoot_101,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2017","It does the job - functionally, for ~$20 (I like gadgets). But as many a reviewer here has pointed out, its a horrific setup process, with the app timing out multiple times, almost randomly deciding which wi-fi networks were viable options (leaving one digging into router settings - if you can set it up on your 2.4ghz network, do so). Its certainly not plug-and-play or anywhere close to it (setting up the 2nd one took just as long, for a different myriad set of reasons).
Its frustrating as hell, and I probably would not buy a WeMo Smart Plug, despite the Wirecutter recommendation - the app and on boarding experience is exactly what you'd expect from a bigger company. That being said, I can now turn on my lights with a voice command due to the Google Home, which is cool!",3.0 out of 5 stars

Unfortunately it was such a pain in the butt to install/reinstall after I changed wifi set up at home that I wanted to throw it out the window. Even following the directions exactly. You can't just copy and paste the info for your wifi into it. Then I made the mistake of updating the firmware. It never could get it downloaded all the way and then it no longer worked after that.

2. You may have to adjust your router settings (channel, security) to get it set up.

Once it launches, it’s 50-50 if your products will actually show up in the item list.
Once added to HomeKit...don’t exactly know how since the instructions were completely unhelpful, every time I launch HomeKit, it either shows “updating” and can’t use it or “unavailable” and can’t use it.

John,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2017","Can only give a max of 3 stars as it does not support 5GHz WiFi, just 2.4 GHz. This is terrible in my opinion since a 5 GHz only (802.11a/n/ac) wireless network is becoming the “best practice” approach for homes if it isn't already and 2.4GHz devices slow down your WiFi network. The packaging does say 2.4 only, but was not totally clear and was not mentioned on the Amazon listing for the product. And since everything now is 5GHz one assumes a newly introduced product from Belkin would support 5GHz.

Firmware is up to date, app is up to date; there's no reason that the rules don't work.

The setup procedure is a perfect example of this, with a buggy, confusing, and slow process to only receive one form of issue or another.

Allison M.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2017","We now have 8 wemo devices and they work great... but they have limitations. I would give them 5 stars if they'd finally figure out an option to switch between multiple homes. Presently, you can really only configure wemo switches to work on 1 device for 1 residence. The work around is that you would have to setup another wemo account on a separate device (i.e. ipad, second phone, etc).

Gadget Guru,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2019","I have 4 Wemo minis that I use in tandem with 3 of the original plug switches, 1 Wemo insight plug and several light switches. I guess you could say I'm pretty well entrenched in the Wemo universe at this point.

All devices work great over my older wireless G router which is on the first floor in the kitchen of my home built in 1875. Not only do I have to contend with thick plaster and lathe walls (and perhaps some lead paint I'd rather pretend isn't there), thick hardwood framing and floors, 3 stories (including the finished attic, but I also have a metal tile ceiling in the kitchen. It's literally the worst case scenario, aside from maybe masonry.

Despite this, all my Wemo components across all three floors and even the detached garage manage to connect and show up in the app, both on the local and outside networks. I do see a lot of reviews that have an issue with this, but despite all the obstacles, I've had no issues. I do make the initial connection to the network on my first floor, but even after relocating the devices, they still show in the app with no issue.

I like using these switches for multiple reasons:

1) Automation: I can turn lights on and off based on sunset and sunrise times, exact time or any combination or sunset/sunrise and specific times. That means my porch light comes on at dusk and turns off at dawn and other lights turn on at dusk and turn off at the time I normally head to bed. This is especially great for holiday decorating.

2) Remote control: I can turn lights or other devices on or off from anywhere the internet exists.

3) Security camera control: I have several outdoor security cameras, but never wanted to have them inside since I didn't want to risk someone getting into the DVR and being able to view me indoors. With a Wemo switch, I can automate the cameras being on only when I'm not home or manually turn them on remotely at other times rather than activate or deactivate them through the security DVR. That means a hacker would need to have access to both the DVR and the Wemo switch to spy on me indoors. Granted, they would only see ""public"" areas on the first floor, but it's nice to have that extra security measure with two systems.

4) Access to lighting controls from anywhere in the house: It's nice to be able to turn on outside lighting from my bedroom using the app to investigate a noise I might hear outside. Whether it's a raccoon or a human prowler, it's nice to say ""get off my lawn"" from the safety of a lockable upstairs room using outdoor lighting.

Overall, installation, updates and use are pretty painless. I make it harder on my self by having MAC Address filtering turned on in my router, so I have to manually add each device address in before it will connect. Most people don't do this, so it's a problem I made for myself, not an issue for the device. Once I manually add in the MAC Address, things go pretty smoothly.

I have a password with special characters in it, so I can conform there is no issue with using them. The devices also see unfazed my using the newer WPA2 security.

Once you have one device connected, you can save those credentials to make adding more devices easier.

Overall, things are easy, but it's not entirely peaches and cream. Here are the reasons for only 4 stars:

1) The overall installation could be far easier if the app could simply read a QR code on the device and add it directly to the home network using the saved credentials that way. It's silly to have to connect to the device, send the credentials to it (or enter them manually if it's the first device), then connect back to the home WiFi network to use it with the other devices. Seriously: scan QR code through the app using the camera, input WiFi credentials (or select already saved WiFi network), plug in the device, then wait for it to connect and appear in the app. It should be that simple. It's not unworkable the way it is, but there's no reason for it not to be easier.

2) You can't change your WiFi password on all the devices using the app. That means if you update your router password periodically (as you should), you have to first deprogram ALL the Wemo devices, change the router password, then manually add them all back in. Seriously. What moron thought that was a good way to do it? The app lets you save the Wifi properties for adding additional properties. You should be able to go into the settings and change it and have all the devices update in one shot. That's, like, how everything else in the world works. Stupid, stupid, stupid....

3) Switches don't resume their previous on state if power is lost, then restored. They seem to reconnect to my network fine, but it's annoying my outside light remains off after power is restored instead of remembering the state it was on (or comparing the current state to the running program) and turning on if it should be on. If Belkin is worried something could trip a breaker or do something else bad if the switch somes back on unattended, simply make it a check box function for each individual switch. That way I can decide what should come back on following a power failure and what should remain off. Further, they can program in a delay to ensure the system is no longer at risk of brown-outs to avoid the effects of multiple power drops.

4) These things aren't cheap. In comparison to other similar devices on the market, the price of the Belkin devices is becoming more out of line with the market reality. Fortunately, occasional sales make that less of an issue, but Belkin really needs to price their products more competitively to ward off competition from the cheap Chinese knock-offs.

5) Belkin seems to take far too long to respond to new feature demands. It's only recently as last year they finally added a dimmable light switch, for example. Other manufacturers were already out with options for that long before Belkin came out with their product. Likewise, companies like Lutron not only have app controlled switches, but have options for adding additional switches to lights without the need for a direct connection with them. While the Belkin WiFi based system would likely at least need a power connection to an add on switch, they absolutely need to create ""add-on"" switches that can control a main switch, essentially creating a 3-way switch option to lighting. These add on switches would read the state of the main switch and show the the state in the app, and merely trigger the on/off press on that main switch they connect to. In short, they would only act as a remote control for the main switch. Belkin already has the ability to do this, as evidenced by the addition of the ""long press"" rule, but they need an option for a dedicated add-on switch to avoid the cumbersome ""long-press"" option that is really a complete pain to use.

6) Belkin needs more options for the rules. Right now, the rules only let you set one on/off event for days that you choose. If you want a second or third on/off event, you need another rule. That means you need separate rules for work days and weekends, morning and evening, home and away, home and vacation, holidays and literally every single thing else you can think off. My thermostat lets me set all those options that can be accessed in an unattended manner for most (work day/day off, morning/evening, etc.) , and two touches for others (vacations, holidays, time of year, etc.). I should be able to use on rule to turn a light on in the evening and off at bed time, turn on in the morning and turn off when I leave for work and have separate times for my days off. There should then be a check box to enable whatever vacation or holiday rules I might have set. If you're like me and have a lot of devices, having individual rules for each occasion for each device means a whole lot of rules.

Now, some of these negatives I can live with because there is at least a work around, even if it's more cumbersome. In some cases, I choose not to use a Wemo switch unless or until that option becomes available (such as my foyer light that has a three way switch). In the case of making it a pain when changing my WiFi password, I took off a star for making me jump through unnecessary hoops a couple of times a year. That star also includes the somewhat cumbersome method of adding switches.

The fact is, once added, the switches do work great (for me, anyway). Belkin just needs to get on the ball and bring their product a few steps further to make them stand out from the competition that is in danger of eating their lunch.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Homekit News and Reviews,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2018","As many reading this a probably aware by now, WeMo recently announced that their Mini Smart Plug was the first ostensibly non-HomeKit compatible device to gain HomeKit compatibility, via the new Software Authentication protocol. Intrigued by this, I decided a purchase was in order, despite the fact that I’ve already got quite a few smart plugs to spare.

If you’ve read my previous reviews, you’ll be aware that I put a lot of stock into presentation (the packaging basically), and on this count I would say that WeMo have delivered admirably. As with many of the current manufacturers of smart devices, the container that the smart plug came in was super sturdy, being made of a thick recycled (?) cardboard, enclosed in a green and white outer sleeve. Green seems to be the colour of choice these days, with iHome and Vocolinc both also opting for this colour scheme. Whether this is an effort to imbue their products with some form of ‘eco-friendliness’ I’m not sure, but it certainly works on an aesthetic level.

Once you’ve taken off the outer sleeve, you can really see that WeMo have gone the extra mile, with a lovely design on the inside of the carton – something you’d only see once you had already purchased the product, so this isn’t just to entice you, it’s to encourage and excite you into taking WeMo seriously, in that they think about the smaller details.

After you’ve open the box fully to reveal the smart plug itself, you can see that it’s housed nicely within the centre of the box, giving it little chance to move around and potentially get damaged. There’s an included manual to help with quick setup along with any problems you might have with the plug, in the form of a list of troubleshooting tips.

At the end of the day, of all the categories of smart devices, smart plugs offer the most choice, and while some can do small things that others can’t do (like monitor electricity usage for example), they all basically do the same job of turning a ‘dumb’ device on or off, giving said device some level of automation. This device is no different to any of those in that basic respect. It’s fairly slim, or wide, depending on how you look at it, but being this slim it does offer the advantage of not taking up more than one wall socket, which in turn means that it can be stacked with another WeMo smart plug quite comfortably.

The design of the plug itself is quite unassuming, which would lend itself to blending into a typical, mainly white kitchen. Simple branding aside, the only other thing on the front is a rather convenient on/off switch, with a small LED that lights up in white, when there’s power going to the plug. Going back briefly to its dimensions, while it’s not quite as slim as the iHome iSPX6, it comes close, although it is slightly taller. it does beat out the iDevices Switch in the ‘skinny’ department, but once again it is wider/taller, so it really is down to the individual as to what works for them.

Onto the setup: As this device isn’t a ‘straight-out-the-box’ HomeKit product, with no HomeKit code provided – or even needed – the procedure was a little bit more involved; not necessarily complicated, but a little long-winded nonetheless. First off, you need to download the WeMo app to get things started. Once the app is downloaded and running, you simply plug the device into an outlet and let the app guide you through the process of initially setting it up to work with the WeMo app. Interestingly, even though the setup process for getting it to integrate with HomeKit comes later, the first thing you’re asked on opening the WeMo app is access to your ‘Home Data’, meaning your current Apple Home data. Once you’ve okayed this, you choose which device you want to set up, you’re then presented with a few tips as to setup process itself. This involves connecting your iPhone or iPad to the wi-fi signal of the plug itself in order to exchange you home wi-fi network settings. Once all that’s ‘in the bag’, the app will attempt to connect to the device itself, which in my case took a little bit of time.

It eventually spots the plug and asks you to name the device (if you so wish – I stuck with ‘Wemo Mini’). You’ll then be prompted to provide an email address to complete the process before it proceeds to finally connect directly to your home network. After that is complete, you then get to choose whether you’d like it to send you notifications.

As I already mentioned, this was a lengthy, if straightforward process, but once you’re at this point, you’ll see the smart plug show up as a device that can now be programmed or controlled within the WeMo app. Chances are that there will be at least one, if not two firmware updates awaiting you. One of these will be for the plug itself, which is reassuring to know that kinks are spotted and ironed out by way of these updates. The other is to enable the plug to work with HomeKit, which is the whole reason this is being reviewed of course! Once you’ve updated the firmware, you’ll finally get to the section that allows for HomeKit connectivity. You’re given options for connecting the plug to IFTTT, Nest, Alexa and finally, the Apple Home App. Google isn’t on this list for some reason, but you can connect to Google assistant via the Google Home app.

We’re on the home straight now, so it’s just connecting the plug to the Home app, which in most respects appears in the same way it would if you were adding a standard HomeKit compatible device, minus the part where you have to scan a code.

From here on in, like with a standard install, it’s simply a case of choosing which room the plug resides in, whether it appears as a Light, Powerpoint or Fan, and whether you wish to add it to your favourites. It will then appear in your standard Home app, along with any 3rd party apps you may use.

I’ve only been using it for about 24 hours, and so far I’ve found it to be as responsive as all my other plugs, with no real sign of extra lag from touching the tile in the app, to the corresponding on or off. The device itself emits a small ‘click’ when it’s turned on or off (which may be good for some and terrible for others), and the LED above the physical switch turns white or turns off respectively.

As previously stated, it does work with other platforms, and while it isn’t compatible with Wink, unlike the aforementioned iHome smart plug, it does have IFTTT, which may actually be of more use.

After setting the device up, I unplugged it from mains power briefly, to see if it would reconnect without any issues, and it did reconnect after about a minute or so. However, I did a second test, where I left it disconnected overnight, and on this occasion it took a full uninstall and reinstallation to get it back to where I had it, which in fact took two attempts, with the first take managing to somehow render the physical button unresponsive. A second full reset solved the issue and once I’d gone through the lengthy installation process again, it was all good.

In my final assessment, it’s great to see how devices are going to work with the new Software Authentication process, and I’m hoping that when other manufacturers do get on board, the set up isn’t as long as this one was, even though I can see that most steps seemed to be necessary. However, there are a ton of choices for smart plugs out there, and while this device is a little cheaper than many of them, you do find some good deals occasionally, which essentially boils this down to just another smart plug.

Pros
slim, so easy to stack with another of these if needed
relatively cheap
good support from a reputable company

Cons
long-winded set up process
not great at remembering settings if left unplugged
Still, I’d recommend it for those on a budget who also don’t want to obscure two wall outlets with one plug.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Vispian,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2017","Update: 2017-04-05
The WeMo switch continues to work well for the most part. IFTTT and Google Assistant integration continue to work well also. I wanted to expand on my comment about the App based indication of On/Off being incorrect. This is using Android, I cannot say what the results on iOS are.

Wemo Android App: Always correct when it says the switch is on or off.
Wemo Android WIDGET: Sometimes correct when it says the switch is on or off.
Google Assistant: Always correct when it says the switch is on or off.

The issue seems to be only with the Widgets. Since the switch can be turned on or off so many ways; Wemo App, Wemo Widget, a dozen different ways via IFTTT, Google Assistant, Alexa...), it seems the Widgets do not get updated. Here's an example. My Wemo switch named ""Hallway Light"" is OFF. I ask Google Assistant to turn it on, ""OK Google, turn hallway light on"". Google Assistant says it will, and the light comes on. If I now look at the Android Widget, the widget continues to show the switch as being in the OFF state. If I open the WEMO App, it will connect with each of your WEMO devices and correctly display their current state. It will also update the Widgets so they, at least for the moment, also indicate the correct state. Not a major issue really, just an annoyance making the widgets untrustable, pity as they would be really useful otherwise.

There was a firmware update posted, this is good - shows Belkin is actively updating these. The update went without issue and the switch updated itself, very good. My Wemo Insight (different product, not reviewed here) has failed to update 4 times in a row though, it seems it just will not complete the update.

Original Review:
Works great, easy to setup and the IFTTT integration is excellent. Haven't used the iOS app, but the Android App and widgets work smoothly. There are lots of ways to control WeMo, I've used just a few; WeMo App, Google Assistant, IFTTT with various triggers such as Google Assistant, weather, email, NEST Protect. Here lies the only real issue I've found. The WeMo app and widgets display the status of the switch, on or off. This status is often not correct. For example, if I turn the switch ON with the Wemo app, the app shows the switch as being ON. So far so good. Now, if I turn the switch OFF using Google Assistant, ""Ok Google, turn off basement light"", Google turns off the switch, awesome. The Wemo app and widgets still show the Wemo switch as being ON, even though it is actually off. That means I cannot trust the app to show me the correct status. That's minor actually, not a big deal - and that's the only issue I've had so far. Except for that, Wemo looks like a great system.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Marie,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2017","For what it is and does, the Wemo Mini Smart Plug is a great device. I have no complaints and recommend it for smart home use or even something as simple as a timer or standalone appliance or light controller.

Overview:

The Wemo mini is easy to set up, use and integrates well with other smart home devices such as Alexa and Google Assistant for voice control and Nest for device sync. Unlike some other smart home devices, the mini does not require a hub. Using the mobile app you can easily control from anywhere, expand or modify your Wemo devices to control your lights and appliances.

I really like the form factor. Unlike many similar devices, the mini allows two devices to be plugged into the same outlet.

I really got tired of dealing with individual plugin timers that sometimes work or sometimes didn't or that had very limited capabilities. You can schedule the mini in whatever way you need, you can sync them, stagger them or make them work randomly. Much better than a better than a than a standalone timer. It even works with Nest. You can sync Nest with the mini for automatic home/away control. Try doing that with a standalone wall plug timer.

WiFi Connectivity:

This is a non issue based on my personal experiences. I did have a small problem on one occasion to connect with Wi-Fi, but this was due to the placement of the Wemo Mini behind a steel table leg which interfered with the wireless signal. After moving the table momentarily while initially connecting to the Wi-Fi router, things worked fine afterward.

IFTTT Integration:

You can even expand your uses by using readily available IFTTT apps or by writing your own which is easy and doesn't require any programming knowledge.

Star Rating:

The only reason, I didn't rate the Mini Smart plug a five is it's cost. However, you can sometimes find these discounted so if you plan to get several, I suggest that you look for one of these purchasing opportunities. I purchased each of mine by waiting for one of these discount events.

Owner Observations:

While you can control lights with the Mini Smart plug, I would recommend you determine what you want to use it for before before purchasing as there may be better alternatives especially if you're considering to use for primarily controlling lights. You may want to consider purchasing something like a Hue light kit depending on how many lights you plan. If you plan to limit your light control to a single light or multiple lamps connected to a strip, then go with the Mini. I highly recommend using the Mini for non-lighting functions and to control other devices.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Prime member,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2017","I started with Wemo Smart Plug(bigger version) in Dec 2016 and was fairly happy with its basic functionality but always thought if it could be smaller so it won't block the other socket. I then came across Wemo mini Smart Plug and bought one. The initial setup was a bit longer as it took 15 minutes and multiple iterations to detect and connect to my Wifi network even though I was in the same room where the Wifi router was. And I have a high-end router from ASUS (RT‑AC87R Wireless‑AC2400). So I was a bit disappointed about how long it took to connect
However once connected, it works like a charm both from Wemo App from my iPhone 6S as well as from Alexa. Once initial setup was done, it automatically prompted and downloaded the latest firmware updates. I'm very happy I did buy them that I added two more. I didn't go for TP-Link or similar smart switches only because it is easy to manage all 3 Smart Plugs in one Wemo App than having to maintain two or three different Apps.
Perhaps Belkin/Wemo should work on improving the setup time and hope to see a stable connection to my Wifi network. I recommend this to anyone looking for a smart-home.

Update 07/06/2017: I purchased one more Wemo product, the WiFi Dimmer switch. It took 10 minutes for wiring the Wemo WiFi Dimmer switch. However, the initial setup took more than 2 hours where the Wemo App was having a lot of difficulties finding and connecting to my WiFi network even though I was in the same room where the WiFi router was located. It was really frustrating when the App asked me to calibrate the Dimmer brightness setting for each iteration.
One or two times it did find and connect to my WiFi network but later got stuck when detecting the Wemo device. Then I figured out the reason Wemo App got confused was due to the existing Wemo smart devices already connected (4 mini plugs and 1 Light switch). I disconnected all existing Wemo devices from the outlet and had only the new Dimmer switch hooked up and thus time the Wemo App could connect to my WiFi network and detect the device quickly.
Once connected the Dimmer switch worked nicely. Belkin technical R&D team should really fix this frustrating setup issue. Hence I knocked down one star. I knew this setup problem so I didn’t give up and return the switch as faulty. I’m sure many would have already returned thinking the device is defective.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jason P,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2017","The Mini Smart Plug's are perfectly sized (height-wise) to be able to plug 2 into a typical 2 outlet receptacle - 1 above the other. That's really nice! They seem a little wider than they'd need to be. It would be nice it they were, at maximum, the width of the wall plate. It should serve the purposes of most users/use-cases. I wish I could control my WEMO devices via a web browser -- and not just an app on my phone. I think it would be easier to program schedules via a web browser. The app is functional but, even as a tech guy, I'm not able to program things super fast through the app. I also wish WEMO had some (OOTB) integration with Synology's NAS and Surveillance Station. (I have seen some backwards ways to integrating the two.)

Setup of the WEMO SWITCH devices is a breeze! Simply plug your WEMO DEVICE into a power outlet and plug your device into the WEMO. Then, hop onto your Smartphone, download the WEMO app, connect your phone to WEMO’s temporary Wi-Fi, follow the prompts, and BAM, your WEMO is setup. You should give the WEMO a descriptive name to identify it from any other WEMO devices you may have – or purchase later when you see how helpful they are!

I have 4 WEMO devices (2 Mini Smart Plugs and 2 Insight Switches - the latter I've had for over a year). I originally bought the Insight Switches for Christmas lights. I chose the Insight Switches, in particular, because I wanted to see how much electricity my Christmas Light displays were pulling and costing me throughout the season. This was successful.

A more recent use for the WeMo devices is to control several heating devices for our HEDGEHOG's cage. We have 2 WEMO INSIGHT SWITCHES – 1 for the heating pad and 1 for the heat lamp – that allow us to turn the heating pad and heat lamp on and off from anywhere in the world! We’re able to determine when to turn on or off the heat because we have a camera setup in Harvey’s cage that also captures the current temperature of the cage. We specifically use the INSIGHT SWITCHES because I'm very concerned for our hedgehog's well being and, while I'm sure WEMO Smart Plug's are working when the ""green light"" is on in the App, I'd rather see ENERGY USAGE in real time via the INSIGHT SWITCH to KNOW that the heating pad and heat lamp are actually FUNCTIONAL and heating Harvey.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Mr. Arthur Matthews,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2018","I had two of these switches that worked very well and then I purchased a third. In trying to install it on the Wemo app it would not install. In fact I deleted my app and started to see if that would fix it. A mistake as now all three wemo mini switches failed to work ! A call to support (who are very good and based in the Philipines) determined that the firmware was out of date on my old wemo switches. These were updated and still no joy. The new wemo was returned to Amazon as faulty and replaced (super service). The new wemo arrives and I contact support for another attempt at getting these wemo’s installed. After well over an hour of resetting the switches and deleting and reinstalling apps on both an iPad and iPhone still no joy. So I was upgraded to higher support who would call the next day. Next day and after creating a WiFi hotspot and upgrading the firmware ,the switches would install when connected to this WiFi hotspot that was created on my PC, however the wemo switches would still not install using my router WiFi ! It was suggested that I use another password on my router but I explained that I had numerous devices attached and didn’t really want to change my password, after all it had worked well with my old wemo switches! After some discussion and this was after over two hours approx on a support call I was asked about my password. When I explained it contained a symbol I was told the wemo switch WOULD NOT connect to a router password that contained a symbol !!! (my old switches prior to firmware update had worked to this password !!). The support agent (who was very patient and helpful) then arranged for a support call to me the following day at 9am and if not called that day, a call for the following day at 9am to see if there was a workaround for my password. No calls were ever received ! So frustrated was I after all these hours of support that culminated in finding the culprit was my password would need changing, I ended up changing it and reconfiguring my multiple devices. Having spent hours and determined to resolve this issue I feel Belkin/Wemo should give me a medal. A great product but messed up by a firmware upgrade that caused me many hours to resolve.",4.0 out of 5 stars

It recognizes that my LGL39C cell phone and will not run its app and will not allow me to install it on my phone. All good to this point. 2nd attempt try and succeed in installing WeMo app on my Nexus 10 my favorite go to toy for last several years. App installs no issues. Appears to work but does not allow me to install the WeMo mini plugs. Hangs up at the point of connecting to my router. Time for tech support. Round and round we go. Support is nice but does not go beyond my own attempts at installation. Finally decide all lost unless my wife's phone will work. LG phone and Nexus 10 are a bust. Netgear WNR2000V3 known to work with WeMo which is the router I am using. Round 2. Have wife's Motorola Razor HD and app installs along with devices in first try. Both new mini plugs setup and working. Then I checked Nexus 10 and both devices are setup correctly in it too out of the blue. Can control them with Alexa once it is setup for new WeMo devices. All working together. All working in harmony after 9 hours of my kind of playing around and pushing the boundaries. Tech's love to toy around new toys. Now I have control of 2 outlets in my basement without out stepping a foot on the stairs down to them. Motorola Razor HD, Nexus 10 , and Alexa app all controlling 2 WeMo mini plugins. Round 3...As of 1/28/2017 I can not setup schedules that work using my Nexus 10 but can simply turn on or off the plugs. You can setup a schedule using the Nexus 10 but it will work some days and others it does not work at all. Not sure what is going on. Setup a schedule using Wife's Motorola phone and it appears to be working just fine. Will repost if things change..
Wife's phone scheduling is working great. One thing is that you should avoid using names like room one, light one, and fan one if using Alexa App. The one seem to cause issues with Alexa knowing which decided to turn on. Best to just say fan, room, and light. It means thinking about names and future expansion of devices for good names.",4.0 out of 5 stars
A. Schuhmann,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2020","TLTR: Great plugs, just don't ever change the name of your Wifi network ...

First, I love my Wemo smart plugs. I have them all over the house, 12 by now. They work great and are initially easy to set up ... until you change your WiFi network.
I got a new fast 5GHz internet connection. The Wemo mini unfortunately only supports 2.4 GHz ...
So I set up a 2.4 GHz network for the plugs, no problem, right? But wait, the 2.4 GHz network needs a new name. And this is where the trouble began. I had to reset each one of them. Now, the latest generation of Wemo mini has HomeKit codes. And you must scan this code to get anywhere. But the code is on the plug side of the Wemo mini, so to scan this code you must take the Wemo off the outlet. You cannot scan the code with the Wemo mini plugged in. And whenever you unplug it to scan ... guess what happens. It naturally loses connection and the setup fails. You also cannot set up this Wemo by just connecting to the network it creates, like you can with the older generations without HomeKit. The iPhone will not let you connect without trying to use the HomeKit setup ... The HomeKit code is also on the packaging they come in, but this doesn't help you when you have to reconnect them.
I ended up unplugging them, writing down the manual code for each one, using the setup button in the Wemo App to add the plug and typing the code in manually instead of scanning. Suffice to say that you have to set up from scratch and make sure you give it the same name again ... otherwise all your rules are useless.
Overall the reconnection of the Wemo minis with all the trial and error I went through cost me probably 2h and 5 years of my life. But once they are reconnected they work great again :D",4.0 out of 5 stars
C. Perry,"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2017","Overall the product is decent and delivers functionality based on the design. In general I consider myself rather savvy with regards to general computer knowledge and network configuration. I have my own custom network configuration at home with distinct wireless networks on various bands including separated guest network, etc. My current job is in the IT industry providing end user support. I only mention all of that for background purposes and whatever it is worth for credibility sake. Overall I would say the physical plug is good quality and fairly straightforward in terms of basic functions. Where the issues lie are really within the internal firmware and the associated software application.

The initial setup is where I experienced issues, as other reviewers have noted. Establishing a connection from the plug to the wireless network seemed to be the most problematic. It would occasionally fail to recognize any network in my home, I tried multiple both hidden and visible. Typically the software would indicate incorrect credentials and refused to establish a connection. I even returned the plug in exchange for another unit. That behaved in the same manner. I eventually was able to establish a connection through the software application but only after trying for an extended period. Unfortunately I cannot definitively say what steps were successful since I tried so many different paths. One thing I would mention is you may have to try repeatedly in the app, despite how frustrating.

I would also allow the app time to connect, it seems even if it indicates failure to connect, there were times it actually established a connection from the plug to the wireless network but gave a false feedback. Indicating it had failed to connect. In my opinion the software app needs some improvement and is not as robust as is needed for this type of product. The plug itself has worked fine ever since the setup was successfully completed. I have been able to use the app to control the plug, as well as integrate with Amazon Alexa for voice control.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Trusted Reviewer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2017","This review is for the Wemo Mini Smart Plug.
I bought it on a whim, it was an Alexa deal on Prime Day and I had been wanting to try a home automation device with Alexa. I thought this device would be a good introduction to that technology, and it is.
It was very easy to set up: download the app, plug it in, connect directly to the device via WiFi, then open the app and it walks you through step by step and even updates the firmware on the device automatically. Setting up the Alexa skill was just as intuitive.
Then it worked just as expected.
The only problem I have with this type of device is that I'm finding that I don't really have an application for it, as almost nothing I own will turn on simply by applying power to it. Almost everything in my home has digital controls: my coffee pot requires that you press a button to turn on after it's plugged and it's digital controls so there's no way to leave it in the on position. Same with 2 tower fans I own, my crockpot, etc...
In fact the only thing I can think of it controlling is a simple lamp, but in my home the only 2 lamps we use are controlled by a wall switch, so that didn't quite work out either.... Just something to think about if you're considering a Smart Plug.
I'm sure it won't be long before Amazon (and other manufactures) start making appliances (fans, coffee pots, etc...) with this technology built in, then it will really be useful.
That said, it does work as described, so if you have an simple device that will turn on as soon as power is applied this could be useful.",4.0 out of 5 stars
JO is my Name-O,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2018","I'm just getting into the whole connected home thing and so it was time to integrate a smart plug so I can control lighting around my house either by voice or via Alexa. I selected this Wemo over the other smart plugs for a couple of reasons: 1) It only takes up one plug on the outlet (larger smart plugs take up the entire outlet yet only provide for one outlet) and 2) It doesn't require a separate hub to work with either my phone or Alexa.

I purchased two and went to work setting them up around the house. One design flaw of all of these smart plugs, including this one, is that they plug in the front instead of the side, top or bottom. This makes the plug long a bit clunky to hide behind furniture. One way around this is to pair the plug with a Flat Plug extension cord to make things a little thinner if you're installing behind a piece of furniture.

Setup is simple. After you download the app, connect to the ad-hoc wifi to then connect the smart plug to your network. Then, simply name the plug and then associate it with Alexa. There's no separate hub that is required to make the lights work and the app doesn't carry a fee to use it. My favorite feature is ""Away Mode"", which allows the lights to turn on and off on schedule like an old fashioned timer. Also, unlike a timer, the switch can be bypassed by pressing the button on the outlet if talking to Alexa isn't opportune or your phone isn't nearby.

While I wouldn't hook something high wattage up to anything I couldn't personally monitor, I do trust this plug to turn the lights on and off in the house as requested without issue. With that being said, I'm ordering more plugs to expand the capability.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Drew's Reviews,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2021","I have been using SmartHome devices for over 10 years and have watched this category grow and change in incredible ways over that time. Many of the changes have been consumer driven while some have been manufacturer driven.

Nearly all SmartHome items work solely using 2.4 GHz. This signal travels farther (covering a larger area) but is not as fast (internet speed) as 5.0 GHz. This makes it perfectly suited for SmartHome applications. Nearly every WiFi router broadcasts in at minimum both of these frequencies. If you have the networks split, named different names, you’ll need to make sure your phone is connected to the 2.4 GHz network during setup.

In terms of this product I’ve absolutely loved it. Over the last few months I have thoroughly tested it and found that it has worked flawlessly. I have used WeMo brand outlets for years and have always found them solid, dependable Smart outlets. The app is well designed and the outlet is easy to setup and integrates well with all other devices.

This is an all around excellent product that I have had zero issues with and would definitely recommend.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Tim,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2017","Definitely a step up from the previous Wemo smart plug. Not only is it smaller making it able to be used in either the top or bottom of the outlet, but it seems to react faster. I have a smart plug that I purchased about 2-1/2 years ago and it frequently has issues updating the firmware. This new ""mini"" hasn't had those issues. As usual with Wemo stuff, the setup is quite painless using my Android phone (takes all of 4-5 minutes total, if even that).

Personally, I prefer the WiFi controlled outlets to Zigbee and z-wave ones. Probably because most of my other smart home devices are one of the two protocols and it's nice to balance things out. Ok, price is a factor... These are frequently a more reasonable price than the zigbee or z-wave versions.

Wemo is nice if you don't have a zigbee or z-wave hub because LOTS of other devices support it directly (like Alexa and IFTTT). I have SmartThings, and that's what I control all my Wemo devices with. Within the last few versions of SmartThings, Wemo devices became ""natively"" supported rather than requiring a ""labs"" SmartApp. Stability has much improved over the updates to SmartThings (not sure how much of that has been Wemo updates too), and I have had no issues with them in a very long time.

I do not use the Wemo rules to control my devices. Every time I've tried, something doesn't work right, so I only use the Wemo app to apply updates and add new devices. This is the reason for the 1 missing star. I wish these could automatically update themselves during non-peak hours.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Lloyd,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2020","I have several of these and they work well. I just wanted to highlight an issue I ran into when setting one of them up. I have two wireless networks in my home and by my mistake the one to which I was connected on my phone when I set up the Wemo wasn't the one I wanted it on. I spent a couple of hours following the steps for resetting the device with no success. It kept reverting to the wrong network no matter what I did, even though Wemo's support site says you should be able to assign it to a different network. I then had a 45-minute call with Wemo tech support. They also couldn't make it connect to the other network, and had me return it for replacement. I don't know if the problem was just this one unit, but I strongly suggest you make sure what network your phone or tablet is connected to when you set up the Wemo to avoid such a problem.

Although my dual wi-fi may not be common, I believe the same problem would have occurred with any change in the wi-fi setup; for example, installing a new router, maybe even simply renaming the existing networks. The setup apps for all my other smart devices show available wi-fi networks, which makes it easy to select the one you want and easy to change it to another one in the future. The Wemo app needs to do this, not select the network on its own and not have a simple way to change it to something else later.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"DGC, MO","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2019","I'm not a happy camper....The unit will not recognize my home network. None of the other wireless devices in my home have any problem. I have followed all the directions and compensatory actions provided with the plug, as well as reading through the comment section here for other tricks to try. Well, I've tried them all. In addition to the physical product not working, the software application is cumbersome. I have had to enter my email address no less than two dozen times, since each time you attempt to 'find' your network, you have to enter your email address. It is VERY frustrating to keep going through the same steps over and over with an unsatisfactory result... I question why Amazon would bundle this obviously lacking product with their Echo. It does not reflect well upon them. Another buyer warning, ""Buyer beware!!""
Update: I was contacted by customer service via email with further recommended actions. These did not work, so I answered back via email and they responded with a phone call. Final solution: Using my wife's phone to set up a hot spot, I updated the firmware on the Wemo device with my phone. Once updated, it was able to identify my wireless network. From there it was easily set up to work with Alexa. I've adjusted the rating from one star to four.

LogiP,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2019","UPDATE as of Jul 2019
After upgrading wifi routers (tri-band mimo) and new firmware releases for smart plug, decided to try again since it's good price point for HomeKit plug. Now changing review to 4 stars. Plug no longer seems to have same issues mentioned below and setup worked on first try. Interesting. Ordered a few more plugs so we'll see if this is fluke or change in quality. Fingers crossed.

-----Original Review----
Bought this as test switch to start migrating from Z-wave to Homekit. Would only connect when in direct line of sight with main router. I have access points all over house but it did not care for any of them. WeMo App vs Homekit setup was also not clear per instructions. Trial and error and resets finally did the job (hope you're techie!) Finally able to connect to network and switch worked. Moved switch to other room and replaced Z-wave device with switch. Connection was working off and on (more off than on), but stupid switch would NOT stop broadcasting wifi. Would be at home and phone would connect to stupid switch! Missed many things on phone that week plus other parts of network began to have issues where things would connect to stupid switch automatically. No amount of trouble shooting online (firmware update, power cycling, hard resets with specific setup, special network ip assignments, etc.) would prevent broadcasting by this stupid switch and having things connect to it. Finally gave up and had to return. Sad since it's good design and was good price. Will stick with Z-wave a little while longer.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jordan R.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2019","I read one review that talks about needing to scan the barcode on the back to the plug AFTER you plug it in... that's totally correct, I don't understand how they expect you to do that unless you attach it to an extension cord or something with a low enough profile just for setup... I don't get it.

That said, I have purchased and tried all three of the primary available plugs for Homekit, I also use Alexa around the house so consistent dual-assistant compatibility is important to me. I can say that out of the three options, WeMo has been the most consistent by far. I also happen to have power flashes 2-3 times a week, and unlike my iHome plugs that I'm currently replacing, the WeMo tend to go back to their function without issue. I do understand how some feel the WeMo APP is clunky and unintuitive, but both Homekit and Alexa seem to understand where the plug is and what I want it to do even if WeMo doesn't seem sure, so other than setup I don't really bother with the App.

I should also note that I've been using the WeMo plugs (and switch for my porch lights) since Homekit required a bridge, so I've never bothered to stop using it. Additionally I have an Echo Plus in my setup which may help with connectivity and reliability. But in any case these have been my most solid performer to the point I'm replacing my remaining smart plugs with them.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Tan68,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2020","I chose WEMO because I respected the parent company. I bought my first plug this past spring and had difficulty setting it up. During the setup process, ""location"" was presented as an option. I opted out of providing my location. After quite a time passed, I realized I would not be able to complete set-up with location disabled. Why present me with an option I can not feasibly exercise? (by location, they mean GPS and not selection of time zone or ZIP Code) A few months later, I bought a second WEMO and during the set-up process learned that I must now create an account. An account is a new security feature. WEMO did allow me to opt out of email ads and does not yet require a phone number.

The WEMO plugs are fairly easy to add and set up. There is a click when the switch is turned on or off. It is very audible but isn't an annoying type of click... It is possible to turn the plug on using the hardware switch on the WEMO itself and then have it turn off after any pre-set period of time. Once set up with timers, they seem happy enough operating without the WEMO app being opened for weeks. Set them up, let them go. 4.5 stars for the hardware. 3.5 stars for the increased requirement to provide personal information to WEMO.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jon H. Greenlee,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2017","I bought four (4) of these WeMo mini smart plugs together with a couple of Echo Dots. The Dots set up easy, but I could not get the WeMo plugs set up, even after a few hours spent with Belkin support and my ISP support and hours scouring the Internet and support articles trying to overcome the issue, so I returned them. (I’m a longtime Prime member and have made very very few returns of anything I’ve purchased from Amazon, but I’ve appreciated the ease of that process). The problem wasn’t with the plugs themselves, but seemingly with the WeMo app as it just would not progress when I tried to link the plugs to my home WiFi. I wasn’t happy.

I then tried a competing product, but that didn’t work either. A friend convinced me to give WeMo another try, so I did.

Long story short, after a lot of trial and error I finally figured out that the VPN on my iPhone 6 was apparently preventing the WeMo app from progressing any further than it did. After temporarily disabling the VPN, everything worked like it was supposed to, the setup was easy and easily linked to Alexa.

I am now a happy smart home owner, and I would have given this 5 stars for these smart plugs but for all the trouble I had initially that I had to figure out for myself. I hope this helps anyone who may experience any similar setup issues.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Rebecca G,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2017","I used this for a night light type of lamp in my son's room knowing I could plug the lamp in and it could turn off in a set amount of time. That said, the app is missing a couple rules that could've made it better for me and how I'm using it. First off, it has a timer rule that allows you to set the amount of time you want it on, ok great. Then there's another rule you can set to specify exactly what times you want it on, also great. Not great, these cannot be used in conjunction with each other. In my case, I want to use the set times to turn on the lamp for the same time every night (7:15-8), however, when we're running late and it's after 8, I'd like to turn on the lamp and then use the timer rule for it to be on for 30 minutes. If I select this, it disables the set time rule and I have to remember to set it back. It's not the end of the world, but still. I also don't like the fact that I NEED my phone to turn the lamp on and off since the plug is hidden behind a dresser. That really stinks during the times we're running late and I can't turn the lamp on if I've left my phone somewhere else in the house.",4.0 out of 5 stars
The Reviewer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2017","Overall it is a good product and I would recommend it.

I originally bought it hoping to eliminate the use of a power strip as this plug has a narrower profile than the TP-link plug it replaced and doesn't cover both outlets. Even though it didn't accomplish the goal (due to the other item plugged into the outlet, which is no fault of the device), it is an attractive well designed switch that has more capabilities that the switch it replaced.

The Pros are:
1. Narrow profile that doesn't cover the second plug in the outlet.
2. Easy setup (Wemo outlets have a kind of unique setup where you have to select the outlet first in the wifi settings section of your phone before you can complete your install. However, as long as you follow the directions it seems pretty easy.)
3. Easy integration with IFTTT, Samsung Smartthings and Alexa.

The Cons are:
1. Doesn't work with Apple Homekit.
2. It seems to loose its device settings if the power is turned off for an extended period of time, which means that you then have to resetup the outlet again.

Ordinarily I would give it a five star, but for the lack of Homekit connectivity and the fact that it drops off the network if it looses power for a while I felt that I had to knock off a star. However, that being said, its probably one of the best smartplugs on the market right now.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Hitome,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2017","I use this to restart my super fancy litter box, that sometimes likes to get stuck on its side while sifting. The cats really hate it when I'm gone all day, and the litter box is stuck! So I keep tabs on it with the security camera, and can operate the outlet from anywhere I can get a phone signal. My cats are thankful for that!

Downside! Sometimes the plug shuts itself off on its own! If it needs an update, or maybe it's just Thursday, it could randomly turn off sometimes. (Another reason why I have a camera watching it...) I haven't played with the scheduled settings though, so I could possibly remedy that by having scheduled on/off times. I am afraid to have it reset while a cat is in there though... LOL!
It will also not turn back on if there has been a power outtage, even after power has been restored. You'll have to push the button, or turn it back on in the app. (When you suddenly realize ""Oh no, the cat box is still off!"") Again, having a schedule programmed will probably remedy this issue.

MKES,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2019","I've had a number of these running in an Apple HomeKit environment. Initial setup is simple. I added via HomeKit directly and then used the Wemo APP for firmware updates. All scheduling/naming was executed in HomeKit, not the Wemo APP. These have worked flawlessly for many months now. Would recommend this smart plug for HomeKit users.

There are the occasional wifi drops (""not responding"" in HomeKit) common amongst these types of accessories, but these plugs have consistently come back online without any effort. And this issues is happening less and less as time goes on and updates are applied.

Couple of things that could be better. There's an audible ""click"" sound when these turn on/off. If you're used to other bulbs and/or in-wall dimmers operating in complete silence, this will be a noticeable difference and a step down in overall experience. Also, it would be better if there was an outlet on the side instead of the front. Wall outlets are often behind furniture or curtains. The thickness of the outlet added to the lamp plug itself requires a decent amount of space in front of the outlet.

The app however, especially on Android, has been an extremely unpleasant experience to say the least. The app tends to ""forget"" that the plug exists on my home network.

Let's also not forget to mention that the app is the slowest of the the three smart home apps that I've had to deal with, I mean seriously, the Android App will have you asking questions all over, as to why it was designed/implemented the way it was. Lastly, be aware that the wemo app has no login (username/password) system in place, in contrast to some other systems and their apps. Yes it may be a bit more convenient to not have to deal with another user account, but I've noticed that having a user account in place tends to result in greater reliability for smart plugs, especially when it comes to remote access control for the plugs/switches.

Evan Upshall,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2018","The Wemo Mini Smart Plugs are a fantastic evolution from their predecessors. Unlike the older versions and similar models, these neatly fit in just one socket and leave the bottom or top open for use without obstructing the space. It is easy enough to install, too - especially if you already have experience with other WiFi enabled devices and Echo/Alexa. The app is fairly intuitive; setting up schedules is a breeze.

My only complaint (or suggestion, really) is that the app should allow you to ""batch"" multiple plugs together with the Echo/Alexa - similar to how you can batch them in the app's scheduling feature. I purchased a bunch of these, and two of them are specifically controlling lamps at either end of a couch. However, each lamp is plugged into a different Wemo Smart Plug, so I have to name them separately and call out two commands to Alexa, instead of just one. It would be far more fluid to just say ""Alexa, turn on the living room lamps"" than ""Alexa, turn on the living room lamp"" and ""Alexa, turn on living room lamp 2"". It's possible this feature is accessible and I've just missed it, but I don't think that's the case. Happy to be wrong on that, though.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Paul D Harjung,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2017","Not bad but leaves room for improvement. The plug on the back should be able to rotate so I can place this in a vertical or horizontal position. The plug should also be at one end of the switch, rather than the middle. The switch is so wide and takes up so much real estate that I was very limited on where I could place it.

It was very easy to set up initially. The app on the iPhone is intuitive and good. However, the ""away"" mode is completely random and can not be managed; it is either on or off. I would prefer the ability to set my own schedule. I really don't need my lights to come on at noon if I am away; but I would like to know that they came on at 5pm, 8pm and 10 pm (or similar). Unfortunately, when creating a manual rule you are limited to a single on/off time.

This is my first automation tool to work with Amazon echo. That functionality works well. I started with WeMo because it was less expensive and could be easily expanded.

Kit10,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2017","This is my third Wemo device. I have two light switches, and this Smart Plug. I've used the light switches for the past couple of years now, with great success. I mostly use the Android app to turn on and off the lights. Initially, when I first purchased the switches years ago, it would take a few seconds to toggle the lights from the app, however, that has been vastly improved to fractions of a second. That was my only real complain at the time; now that it's worked out for the last two to four years, I decided I wanted to add to the control.

I purchased three of these at once; my confidence being high in the product. I bought new lamps (with awkward switches on the power cable, that end up behind the bedside tables), and hooked them up to this with a spliter (two lights). This is my one critique, two side-by-side plugs would have been nice; makes sense to me.

So far, so good! I haven't set up the other two Mini Smart Plugs yet (need more lamps for living room), but I have just added (as of today) an Echo Dot to round off the whole home control thing. And I must say, I am VERY happy!",4.0 out of 5 stars

After spending an hour trying to get setup to work I called Belkin Support. After around 45 minutes on the phone with them I was able to get the switch up and running and responsive to Amazon Echo. I had gone through the same routine a few months ago with another of the Belkin Wemo switches, but I didn't call Belkin that time. I ended up returning that unit because I couldn't find the app on iTunes, and I had absolutely no luck setting it up with the Android app. Even with Belkin's help, we couldn't get the Android app to work on setup, although it works fine now after setup. I have no iphone but two iPad minis. Turns out you have to specify iPhone when searching for the app on iTunes, and the iPhone app works fine on my wireless iPads. I had no way of knowing that in advance. Anyway, once I downloaded the iPhone app to my iPad and installed it the setup went smoothly. Belkin really needs to add detail to their installation/setup instructions. The switch works perfectly in conjunction with Amazon Echo.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Benjamin Eavey,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2017","I'm hesitant to give this 4 stars, because the firmware it ships with is terrible. The setup takes forever, and I almost gave up at one point. I bought 2 of these, and each one took multiple tries (we're talking 10-20 attempts here) before it would connect to my wifi, even when I plugged it into an outlet a few feet from my access point. Eventually, they both connected, and they both downloaded a firmware update - I wonder if it would have been less painful if they'd shipped with the new firmware installed... maybe newer batches of these won't have the setup problems I experienced.

Anyway, since they've been up and running on the network, they've both been great. Easy to use via the app, and easy to integrate with the Alexa ecosystem. They respond quickly, and I haven't had a single problem. The form factor is good, too, as you can stack two of these on adjacent outlets and they don't interfere with each other. Very nicely done.

1 star for the initial setup process, and 5 stars for how they operate once they're configured. Overall, 4 stars (the setup is a one-time pain, and I care more about how they've run since then).",4.0 out of 5 stars
Alexander E Quiros,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2017","Setting up the Wemo was challenging. The app is very well designed and guides you through the process, but for some reason, it had a hard time finding my home WiFi network. It would pick up the neighbors across the yard, but not my own signals. I had to go through the troubleshooting pages online, but eventually it worked. I'm not sure though why or what was different from my previous attempts. Once it was set up though, it was easy to pair up with my Echo Show and I have been using it everyday for the last week. So far no problems with the connections.

The compact design (compared to other smart plugs) is great and I like that I can still control the power to devices with the hardware button. I'm not sure yet if I'll buy another one yet. I want more smart plugs, but I wasted a lot of time trying to get this one to work.

1PickyWoman😋,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2019","It does what it is supposed to - it allows me turn on a lamp via Alexa. But getting to the point where it would work was quite a hassle. I wouldn't buy this brand again.
It came to me via a combo pack when I purchased my Amazon Echo. However, when I went back and checked my charges, they charged me full price for it instead of the advertised $10. Since Amazon is so easy to deal with, I just had them call me and they adjusted the price immediatly.
The WEMO app is just as bad as the other reviewers say. I'm fairly tech savy, but this was far from intuitive. I just kept trying this, that and the other thing until something finally worked. I have no idea what I actually did or how I'd do it again. Therefore, I won't make another purchase from WEMO.

Alexa W,"Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2018","I love the automation these allow me with my Google Home. I've got one on a timer that adjusts for sunset every day, and I can turn them all off across the entire house with one command. I used a second in for a lamp that has a switch that's hard to reach and on an outlet that's behind some furniture. Voice control (or app control as needed) are much more convenient.

The Wemo app setup wasn't hard but it was a little buggy. Sometimes the automation or commands don't work, either because of random loss of wifi connection to my router, because IFTTT is having server problems, or some other random reason that may as well be ghosts. I can always manually turn the switch on or off on the hardware, though, so I'm not stuck when things go astray.

Would be 5 stars if I didn't have to rely on IFTTT to get these to work with Google Home, but the upside is that I can have the Google AI respond with any phrase of my choosing when confirming commands.",4.0 out of 5 stars
JT D'Alessandro,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2018","I have tried 2 of these and the Wemo Insight. The first smart plug configured right away. It was more of a novelty than useful but I purchased the insight in order to monitor power usage and so began the problems. The Wemo app on my android os is just not good. It quite often does not find the devices and when it does, it loses connection too often. I have read that Belkin acknowledges issues with the newer android os's. Keep that in mind before purchase.

Revised Review: I was able to use an older version of Android OS to configure the devices and get them onto my wi-fi. From then I was able to monitor and control the plugs from my newer OS. Still a 3 because this is a rather large issue.

Further Revised Review: After some time and updates control of the devices have been stable and the scheduling has been working as expected. I have changed to 4 Stars and hope the software continues to stay working.",4.0 out of 5 stars

After a couple of years, either the platform has gotten better or because I updated my WiFi to a mesh network I have much better reliability. The app is still clunky, but it works.

This was my second purchase in the IoT 'smart home' world (my first being a Nest Thermostat). I bought two of these primary for use while we were out of town, but also because I thought it would be cool to schedule the lights to come on automatically when it gets dark. From the first day, these things have been truly awful. The Wemo app is a giant steaming pile of hot garbage and is slow, unresponsive, and often crashes. The devices stop communicating with my WiFi network everyday and need to be unplugged and plugged back in. My home network isn't complicated at all, they are connected directly to my wireless router and there is no reason that they should drop connection daily.

Trying to set these up is also a nightmare. The app and the devices just don't communicate well, so you will have problems with the app even finding your device in the first place.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Kimberley H.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2017","I am currently running 12 WeMo switches and 2 outlets. All of them are either controlled remotely or using Alexa.

The devices themselves are easy to setup once you have the smart phone app. Setting up your first switch takes the longest as you are pawing your way through the app. However, once you get the hang of it, installing a device takes a few minutes and that is all.

So far I am pleased with the products. I have taken advantage of the timers, long press and combining devices together. Sort of like having a dynamic electrician allowing you to change how switches interface with the homeowner.

There have been some quirks with devices failing to respond (later they fix themselves) or when I upgraded my router, these things went into manual mode for a few hours. I tried emailing support but heard nothing. Later, each device was back online. The WiFi name never changed, only the IP changed, go fugue. So if that is the only negative I have with WeMo, it’s trivial.

It ""asked"" me to put in my password again, which I had to do three times. On the third attempt, even though the app still indicated that it did not connect, boom, it suddenly connected! It was a little bit of a hassle, but all-in-all, it only took about 10 minutes to connect the WEMO Mini Smart Plug to the WiFi.

The other situation appears to be ""user"" used to turning the light off via the switch, so when I turn it back on, I have to manually hit the WEMO plug switch again. ""User"" needs to retrain this ""habit.""

I would give it five stars, but it is missing two features, one is easy to fix through a software update. My first issue is that this device is not HomeKit compatible, this is by no means a dealbreaker, but it does prevent some functionality that HomeKit users get from their other devices. The second issue, that could be fixed with an update, is the inability to set either an ON or Off timer. The only timer option with specific times is an On/Off setup only; otherwise, you can set a countdown timer. I wanted to ensure the heater would shut off if I forgot to turn it off. With the current timers available I was able to set a very short On/Off timer (ex. On at 7:59AM Off at 8:01AM) to ensure the heater will always be off by 8:02AM.

PNW cat,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2017","The good: I love this thing. I set it to turn on a living-room lamp at sunset, which in the Pacific Northwest is a rapidly moving target (sun sets at 4 p.m. in the winter, at 9 p.m. in the summer, so this requires a lot of adjustments with a conventional timer). Because it's hooked to the web, it knows when the sun sets here, so no more fiddling around. And I also have it turn on the light just before I get up in the morning on weekdays, so I don't have to stumble around in the dark when I go downstairs.

The bad: I can't tell you how I set it up the first time, but the setup directions bore no relationship to reality. Then we bought a new router, and once again, the directions for how to set up a new router didn't work, so I fumbled through a setup all over again.

This makes it stick out a bit from the wall, but not the end of the world. I plan on upgrading the plug to 3 prong soon.

The set up seems straightforward, but is really buggy. The WeMo app crashed the first time I tried to open it, sending me in a spiral of resets. Then, everything seemed to be fine, but one switch suddenly became inaccessible over wifi - but over cellular, I could control it. I tracked this down to being due to only one switch getting updated during the firmware update. Unfortunately, the WeMo app can't handle updating just one switch when another on the system is up to date, so you have to unplug the up to date switches. Of course, after that, the unplugged switches were undiscoverable. After resetting and reinstalling several times, I think we're in good shape. But what the heck?

In addition, the Wemo is located behind a cabinet, so resetting it requires moving furniture and crawling around on hands and knees -- not fun.

It's great that two fit in a single outlet. The size of the previous two models prevented that.

Another downside is lack of FAQ on the included guide or on their website that, if the scheduler doesn't work, make sure you check your router's date/time setting is correct (I don't set mine because I don't use it). Apparently, the scheduler uses the time on the wifi router rather than the location you specify on the wemo setting.

Shine TYC,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2019","This plug was great once I got it set up. I have an iphone so it kept defaulting to apple home but we have a Samsung Smart Things home. I had to reset apple home app and then the wemo app recognized the plug. If you have a hub, you have to download the wemo app and connect that first. Then, you can connect to your SMART THINGS hub. It took me a minute to figure the apple home part out but once I did, it was simple to set up. I use it for me coffee maker so that it automatically starts before I come downstairs in the morning. #winning This is a great plug and the mini doesn’t block the other outlet so I can use the “dumb” outlet for larger appliances.",4.0 out of 5 stars
V. Biggs,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2017","So far so good. The only issue I had was during the set up getting the Alexa to recognize it. I have a dual router with bothe 2.4 and 5.0 wireless networks. The Wemo will only connect to the 2.4. Once I realized that I changed Alexa to my 2.4 network. As a separate note to figure out how to change the Alexa network I simply asked her how to change her network, she brought up the menu to select a different wireless SSID and prompted for the password. I also had to go into the Alexa app and add the Wemo skill. Once I did that Alexa recognized the Wemo device and will turn the tv off and on with voice commands. The reason for the 4 stars is that it advertised it works with Alexa but did not provide any info on how to make it work. I had to figure it out on my own.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Christopher Conner,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2020","Great device is made even better with HomeKit integration. I have several of these and they have been pretty reliable so far and the timer setup is easy. I just have two complaints that keep it from five stars. First, the app doesn’t seem to automatically refresh the state of the switches. I often open the app and then have to pull to refresh to get the accurate state of the plugs. I shouldn’t have to do this. Second, and this is more minor, the QR code is on the back of the device. It’s also available in the instruction manual that comes with each device. Each code is unique and you need it for setup. The problem is that you need the plug plugged in for setup which blocks the QR code on the back so you’re forced to hang on to the instruction manuals in case you ever have to set it up again.",4.0 out of 5 stars
jiism Sherman,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2017","Fantastic product. Worked right out of the box to turn room light on or off [remotely] for security purpose while out of home. Serves the purpose.

Three points to note:

1. The cost is high. It was on sale on black Friday for $20. Should have snapped the deal.
2. I am always concerned about security. Wemo must be storing my router password either in their cloud or in the outlet itself. Pretty much anything can be hacked if somebody is really serious. Do such products make my home network vulnerable to cyber attack?
3. The outlet plugged in the room far side of the house. Sometimes, it just looses connection to router and I am no longer able to operate through cell phone. This could pose a problem if I am out and not able to operate the plug. The cell signal at that location shows 3-4 bars (good). I may need to additional access point to make the signal stronger.",4.0 out of 5 stars
J. Townsend,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2017","Once you figure out how to set it up, it works great. Getting it to connect to your WiFi is more of a chore than it should be, though. The trick: do a hard-reset as soon as you open the package. To do this (according to included directions) you hold the power button down while plugging it in and continue to hold it until the status light blinks white.
I have four of these and three of the four required this in order to get the wifi to connect. Before I did this, it would detect my wifi but was unable to connect after entering my password. I tried four half an hour with the first one before I did the reset I mention above. After that, it connected and has worked fine since.
So, long story short: Open the box, do a hard-reset, and then follow the setup directions.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Until you are connected, there are no directions to help you trouble shoot. No directions come with the gismo. There is simply a picture and they tell you to plug it into the outlet. After several attempts to get a connection, I googled WEMO and found an online chat option. I then did an on line chat with a WEMO representative. He walked me through the steps to set up. When finished I asked him where I could go for a detailed set of directions. His response was to look in the app itself on my phone. I also asked for a print out of our chat. He said that he would send it once our chat had concluded. I did not receive one.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Katie T.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2018","I’ve got to dock a star for the setup process. I’m tech-savvy and I have other plenty of other smart devices that I set up without issue. It was really frustrating. The app couldn’t see the plug no matter how many times I restarted it, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, switched it around to different plugs, and restarted my router. Over an hour, lots of Googling, and a colorful collection of curse words later, I decided I was going to return it if restarting my phone didn’t work. It did the trick, and about 30 seconds later I had it up and running.

It works without any trouble now, and turns my lamp on when I arrive home. No connectivity problems, easy to program, and works well with my other smart devices on HomeKit. I’ll definitely buy a few more even after the initial frustration.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Kansas Coyote,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2019","This works perfectly.

I have some dumb lights using this plug, and my television.

Using Alexa, I can command the lights to turn on when I come in the door with my hands full, and set routines for sleep and waking in the morning.

I have also used it on my television which is an energy vampire, and use the plug to completely shut off my television when I go to sleep.

It's a P.I.T.A. to try to unplug or switch off a powerstrip by crawling around on the floor, and I can shut town energy vampire electronics with ease.

Combined with the smart bulbs I have saved 20% on my electricity bill.

On the minus side, they are big, and take up a lot of real estate on powerstrips, depending on the orientation of the plugs.",4.0 out of 5 stars
James B Greer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2017","I've used X-10 products in the past but am trying out WiFI enabled plugs. These are fairly compact and do allow use of the other outlet. They are pretty easy to setup via an iPhone, especially if you already have the Wemo app downloaded from a previous installation; otherwise there are just a couple of extra steps but nothing complicated. I've already downloaded firmware updates to my plugs, so Wemo must be making changes.

I do wish these plugs had a way to support both manual and automatic operation of lights, from what I can tell they don't. That's one thing my X-10 modules support that is handy.

JHS,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2018","The plug works as it should - if its the first time you are hooking up the smart plugs etc, you will need to download the app, which isnt a big deal at all, just kind of redundant because alot of the ""smart home"" devices require different apps. Once the apps were installed and the plug was connected through Alexa/Echo Dot, then it worked. I was using it to have my fan plugged into it. The fan it is connected to is too ""smart"" for the plug, meaning you have to turn the fan on with a push of a button on the fan, it doesnt stay on the ""on"" position. So keep that in mind.

Michael O'Neil,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2017","This plug is attractive, works, and leaves the second outlet usable. I work in software and had a few hiccups on setup (I wouldn't recommend this product for folks who have trouble setting up and operating a printer) but they were easily solvable, and I was on my way. I think if Belkin used Bluetooth (or some NFC) to setup rather than a private WiFi it would iron out the problems (e.g., one switch connected itself to the local semi-public ""xfinitywifi"" network, and generally my Android wanted to find a connection that could reach the Internet while I was trying to run the setup). The Belkin WeMo app is a bit clunky and slow but it gets the setup job done and then you can use IFTTT and Google Assistant for regular control.

Daniel E. Kleinert Jr.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2017","I use this product to turn my living room reading light on and off. The device itself appears to be well made and optimally designed.

The failure to secure 5 stars is due to the app. It takes some fiddling to get it to do exactly what you want it to do. If you only wish to program and never change it is probably fine but since it's fairly user unfriendly, it makes you not want to reprogram for special occasions and the like.

But given the price and apparent quality of the device I can recommend buying it and I intend to purchase more of their products and hope for app improvements over time.

The guy,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2018","I split my time between 2 different locations, and of course I only have 1 smartphone. When I got this for the first location, it worked wonderfully. I ordered another one for the second location, but after it didn't work and I called Wemo support, I found this is an inherent design problem -- the Wemo app is not set up to accept Wemo's from more than 1 physical location with 1 Wi-fi router. So now I have to return the 2nd Wemo and look for a Wemo competitor!

I understand the Wemo people made this to work seamlessly with minimal technical problems, but it seems they could have made the app have a username and password so that people could control multiple Wemo's from multiple locations. An unfortunate flaw -- otherwise I loved it!",4.0 out of 5 stars

Turns out the root cause to my issues is crowding on the 2.4 wi-fi network in my condo building. We changed the channel to 6 (they suggested 1, 6 or 11) and everything is working great now.

E. Caggiani,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2017","Just got two of these to use with my Google Home.

They seem pretty stable now, but there's definitely a little bug somewhere that can cause a disconnection at times when you have multiple minis in the house.

I tried using a Hue lamp in my home office, but it just wasn't bright enough, so I went back to my old, not smart halogen lamp. But now I plugged that lamp into the mini and I can control it with my voice or an app on my phone. Instant smart lamp.",4.0 out of 5 stars

It took multiple refreshes and opening and closing of the app to get them to work properly the first time. Not much has changed since the old style style plug unfortunately. I found that I was most successful if I put my phone right by the plug to set it up so it would receive the best possible signal and not be confused by the wifi signal from my router.

It's not a ""necessity,"" but it is a cool gadget. I'd check out the IFTTT recipes before you buy.

Colin McGraw,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2017","I've used the WeMo system since its inception: it's nice in that it is relatively inexpensive and works with your existing (sometimes decorative) hardware! Heck, it could even be hooked up to an air purifier or white-noise generator as easily as a lamp!

Granted, the system doesn't allow for custom lighting colors like Hue bulbs, but it's great that you can, for example, hook a single WeMo switch into a power strip that powers several lights at once.

Couple the system with Alexa voice control via an Amazon Echo, and you've got a very powerful system!

However, a flaw with WeMo v1 is that each switch was so tall, it took up an entire, 2-port power outlet. This version fixes that problem by maintaining a narrow vertical profile. Fantastic!",4.0 out of 5 stars

They are good quality with some decent size relays incorporated inside. They handle higher loads better than some of the cheaper ones in the long run. So far they have great reliability, however you need to have a good strong WiFi signal to ensure you don't lose contact briefly. The firmware update process is very picky. Update them up very close to the router, because a tiny hiccup can stall them out and make them inoperable until you do a hard factory reset on them.

Other than that they do work well, I just tell Alexa to shut thing off/on, they also have predetermined timers and a feature that lets you set your smart devices for ""vaction"" meaning the lights and switched will turn on/off at ""random"" times. (computers can't be random)

Melster,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2017","I have bought three of these so far and definitely plan on purchasing a couple more, all are working well and as expected. I purchased one a couple months ago, loved it, and so I bought two more just this past week. I have the three of them set up to turn on/off four lights twice a day (three hours in the morning and 5+ hours in the evening) and also have them hooked up to Alexa with two commands. They are fairly easy to setup initially via the app and also simple to pair with Alexa, just follow the instructions and you're golden.

I'm not going to lie though, I did encounter a couple minor, super small hiccups during the setup but nothing that I couldn't figure out or would cause me to rate this any lower than a 5 star (maybe a 4.5 but since half stars aren't allowed we will round up). First tiny hiccup: the first wemo I purchased took a few tries in getting the app to recognize it but with some persistence, a dash of patience, and a couple of restarts of the wemo, wemo app, and iPad and it was good to go in less than 15 minutes and it hasn't given me any trouble since (the two other wemos I purchased a week or so after and together they took less than 5 minutes to setup). Second and last little hiccup (solved in less than 10 mins but still something for users to be aware of): getting Alexa to turn my two newest wemos on at the same time by saying one command, I thought I could be clever and name both wemos with the same name and Alexa would know to turn both on/off when I said their name, however, it turns out that you have to instead create a ""group"" within Alexa's app containing the wemos you want to turn on/off together and the caveat is they cannot have the same name within the wemo app. If anyone figured out how to side step this (besides creating a group or asking Alexa more than one command) let me know, but naming two wemos the same name just did not work for me (or Alexa).

Use one wemo for two lights! - My third wemo works double and controls our two small lights on either side of our tv, just plug a multi-socket plugin into the wemo plug and wah-la, a one plug wemo became a two plug wemo. :)

Lastly, and most importantly, our cat Snickers is a HUGE FAN of these wemos and appreciates them very much because it makes her feel like we are home if we get home late or go away for the weekend. And yes, Snickers told me this herself, she also said that her and Alexa get along great and that they talk at least a few times a day. I have not witnessed any of their interaction because she says they only chat when we aren't home, and trust me I've tried asking Alexa if she talk with Snickers and she just outright denies knowing who Snickers is altogether. I have also tried looking into Alexa's app for the conversations but to no avail, I suspect either Snickers is going onto my iPad and deleting their convos or Alexa is not recording them. I contemplated getting a security camera but as much as I want proof of their friendship I would just never forgive myself if I ruined it.

In any case, these are great and I definitely recommend purchasing more than one, at least enough to control all the lamps you turn on daily or even periodically because the wemo app also lets you set which days you want it to turn on/off.",5.0 out of 5 stars
R. B.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2017","I was somewhat alarmed at the number of negative reviews of the Wemo mini smart plug switch. I decided to take it slowly, ordering one or two at a time. I now have six with a seventh coming.
Set up was effortless. The process of connecting to Wi-Fi, naming the switch, connecting to Alexa, setting up single lamps, joining a group, and testing it took five minutes for the first lamp and with practice now takes three minutes. I easily set up groups of lamps controlled by a single command.
I have not tried timed lamps but it looks simple. I have not tried IFTTT. I did not download the firmware update since everything was working.
However, I did try causing trouble. I unplugged a switch and plugged it back in. I changed the name of a switch. I turned off the Wi-Fi and then turned it back on. I set up switches on different floors of the house than the router or the Echo. At no time could I get any of the switches to fail.
The oldest one I have is less than two weeks old, so there is the possibility of failure in the long run. Otherwise I am truly baffled at why some people have had so much trouble.

Update: I ordered two more plugs, numbers 8 and 9. This time I had problems. They would not detect the Wi-Fi. I recycled the plugs and the Wi-Fi to no avail. I unplugged all of the previous 7 plugs, as recommended by another reviewer, but still could not get the new ones to connect. I tried several more times over a period of six hours. I saw why others gave up at this point but i was encouraged to persist because the first 7 worked. Suddenly the new ones connected. I'm truly not sure why. However, a month has gone by and all 9 are operating perfectly. Once again I recycled the Wi-Fi and unplugged the plugs but could not get anything to fail. Clearly these plugs have quirks, but now everything works: Alexa, the Wemo app and the rules. My only sure advice is to persist and you will be rewarded with eventual success.",5.0 out of 5 stars
The Suburban Experimentalist,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2019","UPDATE: So I initially started using these in April, and it is now October 10th. I have had no problems with these, and at one point I was gone from the house for a month, turning the lights on and off, and have had no problem with this at all. Firmware has been updated at least twice since installing them, with no issues. It still works with Apple Home kit on my phone. I still rate them at this point great!

So i just recently starting using smart devices in my home. I do not want something that is always listening to me, so I do not want an Alexa, or Google Hub.

I set this smart plug up using the Wemo app in just a few minutes. This is contrast to another manufacturer I tried.

Can this work with Apple Homekit on your phone?
See the video, but the video, but the answer is yes! I was able to to use Apple Home kit to control this smart plug after I used the Wemo app to do a firmware update on the plug. At this time however, I was not able to do so on the Wemo light switch.

After doing the firmware update using the Wemo App, the Wemo smart plug simply showed up when I clicked on the Home app on my phone.

From that point, I could just push the home button and ask Siri to turn the light on our off.

Responsiveness of the Wemo app:
The app is instantaneous as far as I am concerned. That again is in contrast to another manufacturer that has a lot of lag(delay) in turning the decide on and off.

What can you do from the Wemo app:
You can schedule the device to turn on and off at certain times, you can program an auto off timer, You can use a motion detector to turn devices on and off, but you need to install a Wemo Sensor, or Netcam to do so. There is Away mode, for vacation, and you can get motion alerts (again if you have a sensor). You can do firmare updates to your devices, you can see who has access to your devices, and disconnect those you don't want on your system, and you can setup control to Alexa, Google assistant, nest, etc. You can also use the app to get in touch with the makers of Wemo.

Reliability:
My Wemo devices will occasionally become disconnected for a few minutes, but I am not sure what the issue is. It doesn't happen often, and it is not troublesome to me.

I really like the Wemo devices over the other smart devices I have used.

I hope this is helpful!

Lazyboy,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2018","I had asked the question as to whether or not this device will operate simultaneously with both Alexa and HomeKit. The answer I got was yes and it was true (I think) what I wasn’t told was that in order to work with Homekit it was necessary to update the firmware. Not really a big deal but if you’re installing eight of them it does take some time. With that said, I did get all the devices to show up in the Homekit app (although one stubborn unit took a total restart to do so) and I can operate through both the Homekit and Wemo apps. I have not yet had the chance to work our automation on HomeKit nor the chance to blend them into Alexa (I’m trying to make this really easy for someone else) but my first impressions are -
It’s a fairly simple setup once you get the first one
It does what it should.
Check back for an update on the grouping, voice automation (a single device at a time has worked as hoped) and finally voice control on two separate OS’s, HomeKit and Alexa. Probably a weekend adventure.

An add on update. I set up two scenes through HomeKit (very simple to do btw) and both worked with either the phone scene tab on the app and with Siri. With that said and as I have read elsewhere, three devices dropped from the network and had to be found again. For the mathematically inclined, that’s nearly a forty percent drop rate on the second day. I’ll attribute that for now to the new programming but am not encouraged that issues have showed up so quickly.

Final edition- have had the plugs three weeks now. Working flawlessly and will buy a few more (running eight now) based on my experience. Please note that I have only run them with HomeKit but I would expect the same results from Alexa.
Final final edition. I have added two more of these to my network to now total ten. My caveat remains that set up and integration into HomeKit can still be frustrating but....
I didn’t need a hub and the HomeKit scenes I have set up have performed without fail. Just remember you need to update the firmware to make it work. Once brought into the HomeKit network, it works with my tv remote, my phone, my Mac laptop.....you get the picture. My wife loves coming home this time of year and turning on lights all around the house with only asking for it. Nice feature to have. You cannot dim lamps (yet?) but on and off based on the scene you define is all we really wanted. I’ve upgraded my rating to a five in spite of the sometimes setup failure.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Peter Franzke,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2019","Keep trying. I have around 7 of the Wemo start plugs. Some are previous generations but the set-up process is the same. Having said that even I have had trouble adding a new plug to the Wemo app. The first check is if there is a firmware update. Secondly I reset the plug Itself by holding down the power button (follow directions in user manual) and try again. I will admit that it's taking me up to five try sometimes to get the plug to connect to the app for the first time. However, once it does I have never had an issue even when I have removed a smart plug from one wall socket waited a few days, plugged it into a different wall socket opened the appand there was. One other confusing thing occurs when you connect to the WeMo Wi-Fi for the first time . After the app had successfully connected to the Wemo' s Wi-Fi it doesn't always take you back to the WeMo app to continue the setup process. Depending on the phone you have what you often have to do is close out of your wifi settings and tbe Wemo app and then restart the app. Once you do that it will connect to the WeMo smart plug and continue the process. There's a video I put where you can see where this happens. Also when you do connect to the WeMo Wi-Fi for the first time there may be a message that pops up warning you don't have internet connection. You can ignore this message. Hit dismiss or don't worry about it till it goes away. I think sometimes people stop at that point. However even doing all of those things correctly it is true that sometimes it takes a while for it to connect the first time. That's about the only negative thing as far as function I can say about it. Once you are connected adding your plug to Alexa is fast. It's actually faster than the WeMo setup process. Setting it up with all the other Smart Home hubs is just as straight forward. Setting up widgets is simple as well once you have it up and running. . Form-factors a different thing but that's a discussion for another day.

PROS - Easy step by step setup. Excellent third party support. I've used with Samung Smarthings, IFTT, Apple Home and the native app.

New form factor allows use of second plug. I've purchased multiples of this device. When it comes to Smart plugs this one is my favorite.

CONS - it could use a second plug.

If you're looking for a small plug that's also a smart plug that works with multiple third-party vendors you can't go wrong with the WeMo product. You can plug in smart devices from other brands into this plug and have no issues.

D. Pellegrini,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2017","So far, so good. Out of the box setup was a little buggy. You are supposed to plug it in to any plug (I suggest you plug it in somewhere easy to get to while you are doing setup) - and when the light flashes white and amber - go to your cellphone, connect to its private wifi network - then load and run the app on your phone - which connects and steps you through setup - which is very brief (name the switch and connect to wifi).

I set up two of these. The first one hung twice trying to get it to connect - after some unplugging and re-plugging - and starting/restarting the app I finally got it to connect - entered my wifi info and we were away. It then did a firmware update for a couple of minutes and now seems to work like a champ.

The second one seemed to realize that I already entered my wifi criteria and skipped that step - nice touch.

I bought one of these to set a more complex timer for a collection of old cellphones I have on chargers. I only want them to charge 3 days a week, on off peak hours. It was easy to setup that schedule, and it seems to be working well so far. I will update this review if anything changes over time.

NOTE: These seem to work fine when away from the house as well - you don't have to have your phone on the same wifi network to use them.

UPDATE [26 March 2017] - Just added a third and switch to the house - and what a royal hassle - but still worth it for me in the end. Must have had to close/reopen the app and plug/unplug this thing more than 5 times before the setup stuck. I think it was working itself through multiple Firmware updates - perhaps why it was more bumpy this time around. I ended up annoyed - and walked away to do other things for perhaps 30-60 minutes. It seems to have sorted itself out in that time.

Another oddity - with 3 switches on my home network now - sometimes one or two of them won't come up as available when my phone is on our local wifi - but then suddenly do become available if turn off wifi, run over cellular and refresh. YMMV

Despite the somewhat poor / unstable implementation, I am essentially using these as advanced timer/switches - and they seem to work flawlessly for this. In a pinch you can USUALLY connect to them from afar to manually turn things on and off - but if this feature is critical to you, be warned - these are a little flaky.

FINAL UPDATE [27 May 2017] - We just upgraded to a Mesh wifi router system - and now all of my switches show up on wifi and when away. Our older router + access point was apparently part of the problem.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Dope AF,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2017","We got our hands on one of our wished list product from Amazon and we can't be happier. The Wemo mini smart plug is the new product in the WeMo smart plug product line. With Wemo Mini, you can set worry-free schedules for you lights and appliances. Using the free Wemo app, you can schedule a lamp to turn on at sunset, or keep your house comfortable by scheduling a fan to turn on at noon. When you use 'Away Mode,' Wemo Mini will turn plugged-in lights on and off randomly to to create the illusion that you’re home even when you’re not. Featuring a sleek new form-factor that allows you to stack two Mini Smart Plugs in the same outlet, the WeMo Mini gives you control of your lights and small appliances whenever you want, wherever you choose, with tons of options for scheduling and automation. Paired with Amazon Alexa, you can control your lamps and appliances with just the power of your voice. When WeMo works with Nest Thermostat, you can set your lights to turn off automatically when you leave the house, and on when you get home again. No central hub or subscription is required.

The Wemo Mini Wi-Fi Smart Plug uses your existing home Wi-Fi network to provide wireless control of your lights and appliances. No subscription or hub is required: simply plug Wemo Mini into an electrical outlet, connect a device to the Smart Plug, and wirelessly control your device using a tablet or phone. Using the free Wemo app, you can turn your devices on and off and set worry-free schedules from anywhere in the world.

Our answers to the frequently asked questions below:

Can the switch control a ceiling fan?

Absolutely if the ceiling fan can be routed to the mini smart plug.

Can this switch dim lights

Unfortunately no. It does not have a dimming functionality. You can only turn it on and off within wifi and remotely.

Does this work with the google home?

Yes it does. You can directly control it with Google Home.

Overall, a beautiful and functional product that we can't live without. We highly recommend this product for any Smart Home fanatics or someone who is interested in getting into the Smart Home hype.

Jean Farmer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2017","Previous to this I've been using iHome smart plugs but have had issues in the past with iHome losing connection and having to unplug and replug them in. I decided to switch over to Wemo Smart Plugs instead when I wanted to add a few more outlets. What I like about them is that they are stackable, you can have multiple in an outlet. I mostly use these on power strips and not directly in an outlet but they still work the same depending on the direction your outlets go on the power strip. The setup was a breeze. I had it plugged in and on the network and Alexa controlled in under 5 minutes. Super simple. Getting a firmware update was also easy, the Wemo app on my phone took care of it all. The integration with Alexa (I use the Echo Dots around the house) was superb. It never fails to work and I appreciate that a great deal. I was lucky to get them on sale so the price was also unbeatable. All around I am exceedingly pleased with these smart plugs.

If you are using Alexa it is great, because you can setup as many groupings as you like and include whatever assortment of plugs you want. I have a grouping for ""first floor"" and ""downstairs"" both of which are the same grouping of outlets from the first floor of the house. I make multiple groups to try and account for whatever I think someone in the family will say when they are trying to control the lights or fans. My groupings include a mix of Wemo and iHome outlets and Alexa is perfectly fine with that and controls them just the same with zero delay. I love that. I can say turn off a single light or turn off the living room or turn off the first floor and it responds in a second or two and does what I asked. I could not be more pleased with how easy these work.

The Wemo smart plug has been super solid for me so I ordered another one to expand my control. I would recommend them. I've only had this brand for a month but so far zero issues and super easy to use. Set it and forget about it really.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Shane W.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2018","The Good:
The great thing about this is that you don't need to buy all these expensive hubs and the like in order for this thing to work. Originally, I thought hey, it's worth checking it out and seeing what it's like. The plan was to use this for a lamp that we normally turn on when away, but seeing how great it is and all the options and timers and so on... I was like why not set the lamp that my grandma turns on and off everyday from sunset until bedtime. She has limited mobility and it's hard for her reach the switch, so this is great!!! What's even better based on your location it will calculate when sunset is and would turn on the light automatically.

The app is very easy to use. (And I believe no internet connection is needed if you want to access it locally). With WiFi (no hubs or any extra devices needed), you can access from anywhere.

Also works with Apple Home and quite a few others.

The cons:
It was a little troublesome setting up the outlet with Apple Home. You have limited accessibility. But, the good thing is we have a 4th gen Apple TV which you can use as a hub for all the smart devices (you can also use an iPad that is usually home as a hub as well). The trouble of course was on Apple's restrictions rather than this device itself.

Tips:
If you're connecting this with Apple Home, make sure the devices (i.e. iPad, Apple TV, or Apple speaker) have the same iCloud login for set up. (My dad was logged into the Apple TV, hence the connectivity problem).

Using an Apple TV or iPad is not required, but if you have one might as well set it up. If set up via Apple Home with the extra at home Apple device serving as a hub, you can set rules for which devices to turn on and off depending on time of day, your location, when someone from the family arrives home, or when the last person leaves, the lights can be configured to turn on or off.

I only received it yesterday, so hopefully it will continue to work! I think it was worth the ""investment risk.""",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amz Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2023","Wanna know what’s great about this? You don’t have to use their app. It just pairs directly through HomeKit and over thread so no WiFi issues and no connectivity nonsense and needing to be on 2.4 or 5Ghz or whatever. This works well because Wemo has absolutely nothing to do with its functionality. They made something with technology that their users don’t have to interact with their software which makes this priceless. Their previous smart plugs, despite working with HomeKit as well, were so unbelievably terrible I had a hard time understanding how Belkin (a pretty well known company) was letting such garbage leave their factory.

Vlad R,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2017","You don't realize how useful these devices can be until after you've formed certain habits and have grown to rely on the automation and other home control features. Currently, I control most of my lights, one small space heater and an electric teapot using the voice commands with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. I've been using smart plugs from other brands before, but I've recently switched to WeMo for three main reasons: 1) IFTTT integration, 2) Google's ""Home Control"" and Amazon's Alexa ""Smart Home"" and 3) these plugs do not block the second outlet above or below it. The ability to control each plug using the voice command or Wemo's native App is nice, but in my experience I get the most out of these devices through various integration and automation. Here are a few examples:

> When motion is detected by my Oco2 camera in the main entry way, the hallway lights are turned on automatically. (Requires: WeMo Smart Plug, IFTTT, Oco2 camera)

> Every morning turn on the space heater in the bathroom and turn it off after 30 minutes (Requires: WeMo Smart Plug, WeMo App for scheduling)

> When my car's ignition is turned on in the parking lot by my apartment, turn off all lights, arm the alarm, turn on cameras (Requires: WeMo Smart Plug, IFTTT, AutoMatic Pro, Oco2 camera, Scout Alarm system)

With the Google Home control as well as Alexa smart home feature, I've create a group of lights called ""Living Room"". Using one simple ""Hey Google, turn on lving room"" command, I can turn them all on (and off) at once. (Same thing can be done with the Echo's Alexa command). Using the similar ""Alexa, turn on the teapot"" command, I can get my teapot to boil water just using my voice.

As time goes by, I'm sure I'll create even more automation ""recipes"". On the other hand I recently realized that I may rely on those too much, as one day when I had an outage with my internet service, I had to actually *gasp* walk up to the outlet and physically push its button. Perhaps it's a good thing; I could alway use some exercise.",5.0 out of 5 stars
umeweall,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2017","I have had this nifty little device now, in operation, for a little over three weeks. I had no issues with configuration for my Wemo. I have likewise had no problem with WiFi connection problems (I do have a very good, not cheapo, wireless router ). I have my Wemo linked into my Alexa device, and I use voice commands to control them. I also use the Alexa app to control lights, when I am away from home. I have had no issues, in any aspect.

One item I will mention is that if you use a Wemo to control a light switch in a room, there could be a partial inconvenience. If the light that you are controlling is tied into a wall on/off switch, you lose control of the light from that wall switch. The only way to turn the light on then is by manually pushing the button on the switch, or telling Alexa (if you have Alexa ) to turn the light on, or finally by using the Wemo app. If you are using Alexa, and Alexa is not in the room, Alexa is gone when you shut the door. You are then left with a manual turn on of the light, or using the Wemo application on your phone. In a kid's room, this is an issue. Even in an adult's room, having to manually turn the light on, or grab your phone to turn the light on will get tiring after a while. If the wall plug with the Wemo device is behind something, that just leaves the phone to turn the light on. If your phone has a dead battery, oh well.... You need to thing about where you want your lights controlled, and what happens when the door to the room is shut, with occupants inside, who need to turn the light on/off from inside of their room. How do they do it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
cg,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2017","So far, so good! I've had my Wemo Mini Smart Plug for a few days now. It was easy to set up, and so far, has done exactly what I've told it to do.

I bought only the one plug just to test it out and see if it is truly a piece of technology that would work for me. It is plugged into an entryway wall socket and I've plugged a lamp into it. I've schedule the lamp to turn on and off at certain times during the weekdays to coincide with my morning and evening schedule. Before I get up in the morning, the light comes on so that I don't have to stumble around in the dark. About the time I leave for work, it turns itself off. Now I have one less thing to try and remember as I scramble out the door to work. In the evenings, it is scheduled to turn on around the usual time I arrive home from work, so that I don't have to stumble around in the dark when I get home either. And since it is easily programmable, I can change this setting as the days get longer.

So far, there are no ""cons"" to the device. I can control this one outlet using my smart phone, which I think will be helpful. For instance, if I get in bed without shutting the light off manually, then I can pick up my phone and shut it off remotely. Another ""pro"" is that the device really does only take up one socket, allowing me to continue using the second socket for whatever I need it for.

Do I plan on purchasing more? Yes. There are a couple more electrical devices that I would like to have remote control over. I'm also intrigued by the other Wemo wi-fi controlled products, especially the ones that replace regular light switches.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Pete D,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2017","We recently purchased a new house which does not have overhead lighting in every room yet. We were constantly leaving on of the floor lamps on in our office and decided it was bet to purchase a timer like I had on the lights in my house when I was a kid. Timers were around $10, and this Wemo showed up in the list for $30. We decided to give it a try.

Setup was super easy, pretty much the same process as setting up an Echo. You are asked to download an app, plugin the Wemo, connect your wifi to the Wemo, and run through the setup process. After you run the install, the Switch works by either pressing the button on the unit or the button on the app. I then adjusted the timer and schedule functions to turn the light on automatically at the times that we use the Office.

Even with just these features, the Wemo was already beyond worth the money. However, I went on to open the Alexa app and have Alexa search for the Outlet, again a simple setup. After this quick setup, I can now tell Alexa to turn on or off the Office light and she instantly makes the change.

With Alexa and the timer running the light, I am now determined to automate the rest of my house. I will be purchasing several of these as well as a few wall switches to control the other rooms. This is truly a Gateway product to Full home automation.

Bonus: You can also Use IFTTT.com to set up rules to trigger the light to turn on based on other events happening such as getting an email or posting on Facebook, etc. The trigger works the other way too where you can actually log every time that the light is turned on in a spreadsheet.",5.0 out of 5 stars
P. Holt,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2019","If you're an Apple Home / HomeKit user, do not purchase WiFi devices (such as this one). WiFi devices *will absolutely* work, but are another level of setup. Apple HomeKit is clearly designed to favor Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices - such as those from Elgato. If you are used to the simplicity of iOS, consider yourself warned. :)

However, BLE honestly makes sense as with BLE, you are making a direct connection to the device whereas with WiFi you are working through a proxy. Same with Android, I'm sure, but I do not own any Android devices. The executive summary is to search out BLE devices instead of WiFi devices. BLE has a range of 100M which should suffice for > 98% of homes - even with electronic and structural interference. In short, BLE is the future for closed-circuit home devices.

Other than that - and after jumping through some hurdles (circa Q1 2019) that most will not be confident with - this device is solid with HomeKit. It works both local and remote (assuming you have an iPad / AppleTV that can act as a hub when remotely operating).

Ease of setting up this WiFi device with iOS (and probably any mobile OS): 1 star

Functionality: 5 stars

Reliability: 5 stars

Low maintenance? Look for BLE devices, which will become much more common. Low short-term price? Buy this and, after some frustration, be happy. My money will go toward BLE from here forward.

UPDATE: I own two of these and they have been flawless with HomeKit over the last three months. 2,400 sq ft main level with three Apple TVs on the network. Programmable on/off always works. No complaints. Would buy again. Review upgraded from 3 to 5 stars. Two thumbs up. :)",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jeff White,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2017","Nice compact unit, working well so far. It would certainly be easy to install two of these in one wall outlet, as is clearly the intent. I bought this to compliment several other WeMo wall switches in my house, and to work with my Amazon Echo & Dot. Using this one for a master bedroom Himalayan salt lamp (i.e., night light for grown-ups); except in this instance I need the soft amber lighting to not assault my eyes when I first stumble out of bed in the a.m. (a gentle wake-up light), and to put it on a schedule that doesn't wake me on weekends (thanks 'Rules' function!). Price is reasonable, I paid ~$30. I am happy with my purchase. I will update my review if it fails.

One handy trick, the Alexa app lets you assign WeMo switches to multiple groups (including groups containing only ONE device); that means if your spouse or significant other consistently calls your device the wrong name (i.e. 'family room lamp', instead of 'living room lamp', or whatever...), just create a group with that 'wrong' name and select only the switch with the right name in that group. Now Alexa will now turn on the switch using either name without complaint; argument avoided & relationship saved!! (More of an Alexa smart-home skill tip than this switch in particular, but a recent discovery on my part that I really like.) For instance, at my house the 'Porch Lights' belong to a group called 'Pizza Lights'; the kids think it is funny and it helps them remember to turn on the porch lights when they order a pizza.

After posting my original review, I was contacted by ""Belkin Cares"". They informed me that the WeMo SHOULD work fine with eero network (or any other dual band router than supports 2.4Mhz). They ultimately connected me with Belkin Engineering. The Engineering team worked with me and it appeared I had a hardware problem. They promptly shipped me a replacement unit. It arrived and I had the same problems getting it to work. I was scratching my head. I walked through all the points of Wifi and Network connection on my iPad and iPhone. I got to the point of my iOS VPN software (Cloak) and verified it was turned off. As a test, I tried uninstalling the VPN app. I re-booted my iPhone, and tried the WeMo install. Voila - it worked!! I then re-installed my VPN software, and everything still works fine.

For a $35 device, I am VERY impressed with the support from Belkin. On my initial attempt at troubleshooting I was able to easily get through to their 800 #. However, when they proactively reached out (after I posted my original review), I was really impressed. I cam away feeling that ""Belkin Cares"" is not just a tag line, but part of their culture.

Michelle,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2017","We got an Amazon Echo for Christmas and started toying with smarthome options. We haven't delved too far into the smart bulbs because they are so expensive and you have to buy the silly bridge things. So we figured we'd try out the plug options to control our main corner lamp in our living room as a stepping stone. This mini option being the newest thing on the market was a risk but it was also compact and easily added to our existing map of electronics and cords in the corner. If it failed we weren't out too much money and could return it if need be. However! This mini was SUPER easy to install, just plug it in, let it blink white and orange, tap on its wifi network, name it in the app on your smartphone, and connect it to your existing home wifi network, BOOM! Connected. Took me all of 45 seconds. Instructions were clear. And I added it to our Alexa smart devices in 20 seconds so even my 4 year old can control the lamp. Definitely will be buying more of these mini plugs for other outlets around the house.
Info that helps: the plug is less than 8-10ft from our router and 2-3 ft from Alexa. I sat right next to all 3 on our couch when programming. AND I bought this out of pocket, not a freebie :)
Edit:
After a year we bought a 2nd switch and added another floor lamp because we moved to a new home with no overhead light. I easily renamed our lamps to LR1 & LR2 in the wemo app. I had Alexa rediscover our wemo switches and she recognized the name switch.

Brent,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2019","WeMo plug is very simple to use. Easy to set up. Changing WiFi is the only pain. If you change your Wi-Fi password you'll have to go through each one update the password. Pretty quick but still pain. You can set routines, you can have something turned on at sunset or a certain time turn off at sun up or turn off at a certain time. You can pick the days a week that you want. You can also control it through your phone with a widget on your screen or app. I have about eight or nine of these in my home. Along with a couple let wall switches. I've been using WeMo for probably about 5 years now. Have not had any problems. Don't think I wish, that it had auto update. I use echo ecosystem. And I used Google ecosystem. It works on both. some things Alexa does better than Google and there's a lot more things that Google does better. But mainly use Google ecosystem over Alexa any day.

Overall I think it's an outstanding product and works absolutely flawless. I would definitely recommend getting one and picking it up I just always stick with the same brand instead of mix matching other brands into my system. I know other friends that have used other brands and mixed in with a bunch of different brands. What happens is you have all these different frequencies running it messes up your Wi-Fi speeds. So try to keep your products the same whatever you go with. Whether it's Philips hue WeMo stick to the same brands.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Glowplugv,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2017","I started to build a smart home around the Amazon Echo and needed smart plugs to control various lamps. I was only interested in devices that connect directly to Alexa not indirectly through a hub. I originally looked at the TP-link version of a mini smart plug, but after reading the 1 star views (highly recommended) and seeing several reports of electrical issues I switched to the Wemo version. Installation of the first plug took a few tries but it installed within 10 minutes of fussing with it. That plug went into a firmware upgrade that took awhile but required nothing from me. The remaining that I added were easily done as the app remembered the network password and then they asked permission to do the firmware upgrade too. Connecting to Alexa was simple as asking Alexa to scan for smart devices. She found the three installed plugs and their names and that was that. The Wemo app is very simple and for me the lights turn on/off almost simultaneously when I press the button in the app for a lamp. Of course I use Alexa most of the time but I wanted to state that because some reviews have complained about the slow performance of the app. I have them set up on an on/off schedule. I could have set them also to be on sunset to sunrise (you put in your location information). I also found I could turn them on and off during the scheduled window with no effect to the overall schedule programmed. I am very satisfied with them so far and expect to add more of them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Ampazon,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2019","I purchased These to use with HomeKit. I bought 3 new ones (2nd gen) and 2 refurbished ones (1st gen). I will say that the HomeKit set up on the new ones was a little bit tricky but now that I have them all set up properly they work fantastic. They DO NOT completely reset when they lose power like numerous people have stated in old reviews. While that may have been an issue in the past, it is no longer an issue with the latest firmware updates. My recommendation for setting them up would be to install the Wemo app and set them up through the Wemo app 1st, then immediately update the firmware. Then factory reset it by unplugging it, holding down the power button on the front and plugging it back in until it shows a blinking white light. Then set it up for HomeKit. Also I would recommend only having one of these plugged in in your home at a time while setting them up so as you get one set up and working I would unplug Until you add the rest. I am using Google Wi-Fi mesh router system, so I cannot turn off the 5 GHz frequency Wi-Fi but it was not at issue at all for me which was another thing people have mentioned being a problem in the past that was likely fixed with the latest firmware. I will say I spent an hour trying to set up the first 2 initially (new 2nd gens) and it was quite frustrating but once I got the hang of it it was simple I really like these. There are a few points/steps during setup where it takes a few seconds and you need to be patient.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Claire & Nanami,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2019","These Wemo mini smart plugs are really easy to install. Install the Wemo app on your phone and you can start adding switches to it pretty easily. They make your regular electronic devices behave like smart home devices. You can use them for lamps, coffe pots, water boilers, etc. If you use them for your coffee pot, just make sure it is filled with water before you start it up.

I bought these for my lamps, and LED lights because I can use whatever lightbulb I want and still make my lamps smart. The switches don't use up much space when plugged on the wall, compared to the older ultra bulky version that would block any other electric plug. I upgraded to the mini switches because of that.

These switches integrate with Alexa, which is the main reason why I got them. You can give them names on your Alexa app and even group them by room. For example, I created a group in Alexa, called living room, which controls all the light switches in the living room. So turning the lights on is as easy as saying ""Alexa, living room lights on"". Another cool thing you can do is add them to an Alexa routine. For example, if you want to make sure all your lights are off before going to bed, you can create a routine where you say ""Alexa, good night"" and have Alexa turn off all groups of lights in your home.

If you don't have an amazon smart device or another compatible device for voice control. You can always use the Wemo app to control these switches.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Nomiworld,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2018","I have six of these operating in my house at the entrance porch, front entrance room, master bedroom, living room, tv and guest bedroom. I love the ability to turn lights on and off remotely. I have lights on the timers every evening so that I never return to a dark house. I use the commands to turn on and off with Amazon Alexa. The best switch is the one I use at the front porch light where you can have it automatically turn on at 30 minutes before sunset until sunrise. Even with a time change, I will never have to adjust since the device knows the local sunrise and sunset times. This product is simple to install. Literally takes a minute or less except for the switch which required me to get my electrician to do it. I know it’s not difficult to put wires together for a switch, but I wanted to make sure it was done correctly. I have not tried the dimmer switch model but would like to try. It’s terrific having a smart home that I can simply light all my rooms in a moment remotely before I enter my home or put everything on a timer to do same. I can turn on and off remotely for my dog who will never be in the dark waiting for my return. I have a couple on timers inside to always give the appearance that the house is occupied. It’s a great device for sure especially if you own a voice comand device like Alexa or Google.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2019","My expectations were low after reading all the negative reviews. This is my first smart home device, setup using an Android phone. I did what the flyer in the box said: Download app, plug in Wemo mini and wait for lights to do their thing, plugged a lamp in (leave the lamp on) and opened the Wemo app to complete setup. There was a important point during setup about disabling Google Location Wi-Fi Scanning on Android. After that I had control of the lamp from the app. Perhaps keeping my phone updated helped. Using att router. Getting Alexa to work was a bit more involved. There is a good tutorial on tomzguide how to connect a Wemo Switch smart plug to Alexa. I followed it and it also worked. Now I can turn the lamp on and off a la startrek. I setup under Automation an away rule. I did not realize it will not turn on when the rule time is reached, it will turn on after a random period of time when the rule begins. I got impatient, sitting in the dark so I asked Alexa to turn the lamp on. Evidently this disables the rule. I then manually disabled the rule until I need it and setup a schedule rule for convenience. I did not live through a power outage with this thing, so I can't speak of its recovery. I wonder for the folks that have several smart devices if it would complicate setup? Perhaps temporarily unplugging the other devices while setting up the new one would help?",5.0 out of 5 stars
Richismo,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2017","I just got this delivered an hour ago. I set it up in 1-2 minutes. We have 2 WeMo light switches already.

Now we can wake up and say, ""Alexa, turn on the heater."" Snooze a few minutes and walk into our preheated bathroom. During Christmas, I'll be putting this in my garage where I have our Christmas lights plugged. Typically, I have to plug them in at night, when I get home from work, and then it's the last thing that I unplug before bed. Last Christmas, every night ended with me walking to bed and seeing the lights still on outside. It's a first world problem, but I knew it would be great to ask Alexa to turn them off. I can see this as a great option for crockpot cooking too. One frustration for me is the recipes usually ask for 4-6 hours of cooking. I work 8 hours and I'm gone close to 10 hours a day. I will now be able to turn it on, from anywhere, 4 or 6 hours from when I'm home. Or even cook it for 4 hours, turn it off from anywhere, then turn it back on for 30mins-1hr before I return.

Jehjeh,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2019","I have several Wemo switches and all work really well. There is a feature for turning the device on and off at different times that can be set up through the ""Rules"" section of the app. There is also a feature that allows you to have the switch go on and/or off at sunrise or sunset with the option of a time interval before or after sunrise or sunset. This means that you don't have to change the timer as the days get longer or shorter.

Just thought I'd layout the instructions as it can be confusing for some people.

On the iPhone app there is a way to choose from 15 to 45 minutes before or after sunrise or sunset and also a custom time setting for each. It knows when sunrise or sunset is based on the internet feed that the device is getting through your IP and it will tell you what that time is during step 6 of the following instructions.

1. Start by going to “Rules” tap the plus symbol in the top right corner.
2. Tap schedule.

I have a Google Home Mini and a Chromecast, but my TV is so old that it's not only not ""smart,"" but it doesn't even CEC, so I can't use my Chromecast to turn it on and off. I plugged the TV into one of these smart plugs, and now I can turn it on and off with my voice through Home and from anywhere with the app. I used the other plug to make a lamp turn on at sunset at off at 11:30 pm. I turn all my lights off when I leave for work in the morning, so my pets end up hanging out in the dark for a while this time of year and I walk into a dark home when I get back from work. Not anymore! The plugs were easy to set up and the app is really easy to use. I linked it to my Nest, so I can use Nest's home/away functionality to control the plugs if I want. I have relatively new LED bulbs throughout my house, so I'm reluctant to replace them with smart bulbs. These plugs allow me to accomplish a lot of what I'd get from smart bulbs for my lamps, which is good enough for me. ALSO, the fact that this doesn't block the other plug in the outlet is pretty awesome.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JC,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2017","Well, so far, so good. I have been skeptical about trying this kind of product because there are just so many out there and so many brands that it was difficult to narrow down. I mainly bought this one because it only blocks one outlet and you don't need an additional hub or controller device to go with it. Just plug it in the wall, plug in your lamp/fan/whatever and go. The app is free and straightforward to use and so far we have no issues with it working.

My only disappointment, and it is not with the product exactly, is that it would be much more useful to have a wi-fi lightbulb or light switch (although the switch would not be plug and go) as it is hard to find a single lamp that I need to turn on when out of the room or not at home. I can see this being useful in an apartment maybe but in a house, it just doesn't do enough to make me excited. I wish there were high watt bulbs out there that could standalone (sans hub) and then you could put them in more meaningful places.

Overall, no complaints, product works reliably as advertised at a not too expensive cost. Works with Alexa and other such devices. Does not monitor energy usage. Unlike many other reviewers, we had no issue with setup, done in a few minutes and has been working fine for months.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I want more. I want them in each room for lights, I want one on my coffee maker so when I wake up - u guessed it ""alexa turn on the coffee""!! I bought a Dot for my mother and want one or two of these for her to speak her lights on. BUT the retail price is so high. I see the regular price.

Edit - I signed on and WEMO price is $5 off - so not a huge improvement but one that makes it a little less costly so at least they are listening.

Jesse Reviews Stuff,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2017","Pros:

-Their smaller size makes them much sleeker, I never notice them
-Incredibly easy to set up
-Work very well, never have connection issues
-I honestly don't notice them. I just say ""Hey Google, do this"" and it happens, I forget these are the reason why
-Work with Google Home via IFTTT

Cons:

-Can't think of any for me, but some people may not like having something sticking out from their wall socket at all times

There's not much more for me to say here. When I bought these I was just starting to experiment with home automation. They worked so well I started researching every other possible thing I could buy, and interestingly ultimately decided that for now these were enough and just what I needed. In the future I may invest more into lighting switches.

I would say if you can get over the fact that these will add an inch or so of depth to your wall socket, and have been considering them, please go ahead and buy them. You absolutely will not regret it!

Bonus: I had originally bought some TP-Link smart plugs as well. I did really like those (they worked great, and their minis were SUPER sleek), but at the time they did not have IFTTT support meaning I couldn't use them with Google Home. I believe they do work with Amazon products, so I'd check those out as another option if you use Amazon products.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Neil,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2017","I offer a conditional apology for my previous one star review. I attempted to install Wemo originally with the app on my Nexus 6 phone, which led to the initial one star review. Subsequently I've gotten an iPad. Installation of the Wemo app on my iPad solved all my problems. Works like a charm setting it up was a breeze, etc., etc., etc. The only remaining question is why it doesn't work with android. I have seen the same happen with other apps I have both on android and iPad. Night and day difference.

OLD REVIEW-
I bought this as a test hoping I could use it for a hard to reach place for my living room lights. So far I've used up several hours messing around with router passwords, resetting, plugging in and plugging out, online searches for ""wemo won't this"" and ""wemo won't that"", uninstalling app, reinstalling app, all with zero effect.

At this point I've spent $35.00 on something that has soft ware so poorly designed it's impossible to use. In a way I'm glad it didn't work initially. Many of the online comments indicate wemos stopped working or worked sporadically. This would be a disaster for the lighting system I plan on installing.

Beware the internet of things!

p.s. I will set the device aside for a while and try reinstalling at a later date to see if the firmware has been updated to ""workable"".",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kingsley Elbert,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2017","I have two homes. My second home is in an area with unreliable commercial power. Recent storms brought frequently interrupted power. My security lights on mechanical timers were about 12 hours off schedule. I had to make an unplanned drive of 3 hours round trip just to reset them. WeMo Mini Smart Plugs have solved that problem. However, another problem has surfaced. I set the routers at each of my homes to the same SSID and password, so that whenever I show up, my electronics hook right up. The problem is that when I am present at one home network, I can only view the WeMos on that network and not the WeMos at the other home. If I switch off the WIFI on the smartphone and use my cellular data, I see them all. If I go to a remote WIFI, such as Starbucks, I can see them all. I assume that If I changed the SSID's to unique names, this would not be a problem, but I have not tested it. Here is the good news, I am especially happy with Belkin's telephone technical help line. When I phoned to resolve this issue, the line was immediately answered by a live technician. I explained the problem and she provided the answers. If there is any down side, it is that there is not any PC access, only the smartphone app. I love them, wonderful devices.

Marie M.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2019","I have a number of smart home items and have bought, setup and used a number of brands. It seems the two most popular brands of wifi plugs are WeMo and Kasa by TP Links. While both are great, I have found one feature with the WeMo plugs that I use all the time. The ability to add an auto shut off timer. I use this feature for a number of things. My electric blanket is by far my favorite. Before going to bed at night I ask Alexa to turn on my blanket so it's warm and toasty when I crawl in, but then, it automatically shuts off after an hour. No more waking up in the middle of the night burning up. I also use this feature to automatically turn off my coffee maker after and hour and on my hair tools. I never have to wonder again if I remembered to turn them off, they'll turn themselves off.
Because of this feature I have continued to use WeMo over repurchasing other brands.
Note: I did find one other off brand that mentioned this feature in it's description but after purchasing and setting it up, the auto-off timer had to be activated from the app each time you turned the plug on. Not useful at all.

This past weekend I put lights across the whole front of the house, requiring me to plug them in at three different locations - including inside the garage. I quickly realized I had no desire to run around to plug-in/unplug these things every night (especially before bed) I decided to take the plunge into the smart home world. We already have an Echo so my goal was to be able to voice-control the Christmas lights... I'm happy to say that it couldn't have been easier. I ordered two via one-day delivery, and received them Saturday. No exaggeration - within 5 minutes each they were set up on the wifi.

I was initially concerned that I'd need a smart device hub, but these smart plugs truly worked with only wifi. I immediately had control of the devices via my smartphone. Next, I added the Wemo skill on the Alexa app, then followed the discovery process. This involves manually switching the plugs on or off while the skill searches. Each was recognized almost instantly, at which point I could create groups and refer to them by name to Alexa.

I prefer IP-based devices that just connect to my wifi. After reading a lot of the reviews on the Wemo smart plug, I decided to dive into the ""smart"" home world.

The Wemo was easy to install and configure, and the app is very user friendly. I purchased these for lamps in different rooms of our house.

Kyle Peschel,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2017","Love the redesign! Now I can plug two smart plugs into the same wall outlet. With this new version, setup was far easier than the old model.

Some Pro Tips I discovered when setting my home up...
1) If your cell phone is connected to wifi using AC band, you'll want to switch your phone wifi connection to an older wifi protocol (a/b/g/n) before attempting to connect to the Wemo. It reduces the setup time tremendously as the app tries to be helpful and copy over your stored wifi settings/password information to the Wemo smart plug. (since they device doesn't support AC, it will fail by default).
2) It is very easy to test if a device could become ""smart"" by using this plug. Simply unplug something like your Air Conditioner (while running) at the plug. When you plug it back in, if the Air Conditioner turns back on, then it will work great with this plug. I now turn my fans and Air Conditioner on and off using Alexa!
3) When you setup devices, you can ""cheat"" and make abbreviations/synonyms work on Alexa. I setup my Air Conditioner Plug to be called ""Air Conditioner"" so it works by voice command. I also put it, as the exclusive plug, in a group called ""AC"" so my wife can also refer to it that way. It works!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Frank in NJ,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2017","I wanted a quick and easy way to control more devices in our home. We already have our Amazon Echo hooked up to our thermostat and lights. These Wemo Mini smart plugs give us basic on/off control and scheduling of things like our entertainment centers and more lights.

I'm hoping future updates to the software will allow more flexible programming. For example- a critical use for US is keeping our kid from watching too much TV. Sometimes she wakes up very early and slips downstairs to start watching. That could mean she's been watching TV for a couple of hours before we come down! So I have the Wemo Mini set on a schedule to avoid that.

The switch allows you to set an amount of time something stay on when you turn it on. This is great again for TV: if you tell your child they've got 30 minutes watch a show- CLICK- it shuts down after 30. However, it seems that you can't add this function on top of an existing schedule. I wish the system can have a scheduled routine- but still allow me to set a timer to turn off after a specified time. I also wish I could use Wemo with my iPhone.

Shukero,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2017","I love this! I've owned 2 other WeMo Insight Switches which have helped me with automating my house lights, as well as curve energy costs for my gaming PC. However both of those had a glaring issue: They were BLEEEEEPING huge! This switch solves that issue. I'm going to get more of these as soon as I have need for them.

Thanks to the IFTTT integration, these switches work great with the Google Home. Although for some reason, I've had one or two experiences where the lights did not shut off after declaring they would through the Google Home; but that can be said about any new type of gadget. There will be bugs to fix.

Over all I'm happy with my purchase, but I will say that one somewhat ""Negative"" is the app that WeMo provides for your phone. The UI is horribly outdated (IE the app looks like it was designed for the original ""Samsung Galaxy 1"" phone) and it is somewhat difficult to setup, but the instructions that come with the WeMo Mini are basically for phones that are 3+ years old.

That One Guy,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2018","There are a lot of cheap smart plugs out there, but I went with this WeMo for two reasons: WeMo/Belkin has been around pretty much since the beginning of the smart home and isn't likely to go away, and they have a whole ecosystem of components that work together using the same app and support. I could save a few bucks, but I want to know everything is going to work together, and work for more than three months.

I really like the form factor of this plug; allowing two plugs in a standard outlet is hugely helpful. That said, it would be great if they could manage to make it somewhat narrower - it takes up a lot of space in a surge protector if it has to be placed length-wise. (I would happily trade a little thickness for less width.) The look is sleek and minimal, and the on/off button is very convenient.

One final reason I chose this one is because of the option of using a bridge to make it HomeKit (Apple/Siri) compatible. I'm currently using an Amazon Echo Dot, but the rest of my system is Apple-based and wanted the option to switch over to that platform if I choose to in the future.",5.0 out of 5 stars
GrantK,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2017","A few weeks ago, when I first got these plugs, I connected it to my Google Home. Like most people, I connected lights to it. Setup was easy through the App but I was immediately frustrated by the inability for Google Home to identify this device as a ""light"" and instead I had to call it a ""plug"". What really got me frustrated is that you can give the device a nickname (ex: ""light one"") but if the nicknamed was similar to a device it knew, it got confused, even if you didn't have any of the other devices in your home. It drove me nuts and I considered returning the product. However, instead of returning the product, I gave feedback to Google. The Google support person apologized and explained the challenges to me and said that he'd file a ticket...which I interpreted as a polite message to go away.

HOWEVER, about a week ago, Google pushed a fix that now lets me call my lights plugged into the Wemo plug ""lights"" and everything works! I can now say ""Okay Google, lights off"" and it'll control all the Wemo plugs in the house. The Wemo app is awesome as is (now) the integration with Google Home!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Hawker,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2017","This is a great little outlet. I have my echo dot hooked into my receiver for sound, but it occurred to me that leaving my RCV on 24/7 wasn't very green. So i set this outlet up and now i just ask alexa to turn it off/on in night/morning instead of having to open my entertainment center all the time. Alternatively, I have the 1x1 Wemo widget (from Wemo app) on my phone's homescreen that can toggle the power state as well. Ive used the widget from bed in the event that i forgot to power down but dont want to yell to alexa on the other side of the house.
The alexa app can also control the switch state if you prefer.

Setup was easy. A few minutes and it configures itself with your home network.

A big plus this has over other models is that it does not block the second outlet in a two gang box.

This does not track power usage, which would be a nice feature. Wemo has a power tracker variant, but the form factor doesn't look quite as nice.

I will likely but this again if i find another use for a smart outlet.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Michael Murphy,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2017","I own a WeMo smart light switch and love it, a Kasa Smart Plug, and now this little guy, the WeMo Mini Smart Plug. It works as described, the setup is a breeze, and it functions wonderfully with Alexa and through the WeMo app for iPhone, but the aspect that truly separates this product from my Kasa plug (which works just as well) is its smart design. It's not a clunky plug that will force you to sacrifice another outlet or rearrange your power source setup--it simply fits. Granted, for the more advanced electrical traidsman, a flush mounted, hardwired smart outlet is clearly the most visually appealing means of building the smart home, but for the average user or individuals wanting to move his or her smart divide around from time to time or for a quick travelers feel-at-home setup, this plug gets the job done.

I'll also note, having collected multiple WeMo devices now, I'm very pleased with the household management capabilities through the iPhone app. It's visually appealing, intuitive, and efficient. And again, this does work with Alexa. Just setup your plug, then give Alexa a shout to ""discover devices."" She finds your new WeMo the first time and learns whatever custom name you've given it. Great hands free control of your home.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Paul Pennell,"Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2017","I'm in the slow process of performing some minor home automation projects to integrate with the two Google Home devices in the house and was looking for a hub-free solution that was comparable in cost, but that avoided the additional cost of a hub.

I bought two of these to control two lamps on my bedside night stands and a standalone lamp in my living room.

It took just a few minutes to connect the devices through the wemo app and get them provisioned in the Google Home app. I've had them a few days at this point and I love it: it is so convenient to be able to turn lights on or off when getting home late just by yelling for the Google home to turn on the lights or, if I want to make sure I turned them off before leaving in the evening, to check the app and confirm they're off.

While the Google Home can't yet schedule lights to turn on and off natively, the Wemo app can and the Google Home can do it with help from IFTTT.

Overall, I'm very satisfied with these devices and I expect I will add more as I find new opportunities to leverage smart devices in my home.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jason,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2019","I currently own a total of 8 Wemo Mini Smart Plugs and I'm guessing that I'll purchase more as time goes on. I've been using them for close to two years now and I use them to control various accessories in my home office, audio electronics in my media room, and even to turn my Christmas trees on and off during the holidays. I have read many reviews before making my initial purchase and I read that some people experienced issues with reliability and that the plugs would frequently lose connection to wifi so they would not function properly when trying to turn them on or off. Honestly, I can say that I have not experienced any of those issues (or any issues at all) with these plugs over the last two years, hence the 5-star rating. They always turn on or off when I ask Alexa to control them and they now even update automatically when there's a firmware update available in the app. With the recent addition addition of HomeKit connectivity, in my honest opinion, these plugs are the best smart plugs available on the market!

NCBlueHog,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2017","Love it! Voice control when you enable the Alexa skill works very well, regardless of what you name each plug/device. I actually think Alexa/voice response may work better and more consistently than the Android app, but the app does have great features and is very useful to have. So far, I've integrated two of these - one for a free standing room fan and one for a living room light. I'll definitely be adding more!

One note, turning off the smart plug is the same as unplugging the device, so make sure that the device you want to use with the smart plug has a mechanical on/off switch. Devices with an electronic switch or standby power mode won't work properly or at all with the smart plug. For example unplugging your Keurig coffee maker always sets the electronic on/off switch state to Off, so when power is reapplied, it requires the power button be pressed to turn it On. Smart TVs are another example, using the remote to turn them ""off"" typically puts them in a low power, standby mode so they come on quicker. Smart plugs aren't usable in either case. That said, plan accordingly and these are great add-ons for your home automation.",5.0 out of 5 stars
James Rhoades,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2017","After purchasing an iHome SmartPlug and having ongoing hassles with on again, off again function issues I took a leap of faith and purchased this WeMo Mini. I installed it in no time and it has functioned flawlessly for a week now. I use it to control a small heater for our 4 season back porch and am pleased with the functionality of the plug. I set up the controls for ""on at 6:00am"" and ""off at 8:00 pm"" and can come out to a toasty warm porch to have my coffee and catch the news in the morning. Great so far......

Update; The first WeMo I purchased is still working flawlessly on my upstairs 4 season porch.....so, I purchased another one for our downstairs TV room which gets a little chilly in the winter. The installation was a breeze and it worked immediately. Now we can tell Alexa to turn on the heater we bought for that room before we go down to watch TV or read and the room is nice and comfy when we get there. PERFECT! These products are sooooo much better than the iHome Smart Plug that I originally bought.😀",5.0 out of 5 stars
Gino,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2018","Just wanted a few more smart outlets so I could automate some more IoT things for my smarthome (smartthings Hub). These worked great for the cost. Added them easy in the WeMo app, they got picked up immediately by the smartthing connect and WeMo connection, and was able to code them.

Only issue I had, was integration with Google Home. It wasn't a fault or issue but be mindful of what you name your devices as it carries through those systems for integration. Like I called a plus in WeMo ""Bedroom Heater"", but later moved it to another plug in the house. I only renamed it in the SmartThings app, but Google Home was seeing it with both its Smartthings Nickname/rename, but it still recognized its wemo name !! Took me 3-4 days to figure that it wasn't a caching issue and google wasn't keeping old values. Just a piece of advice - call this a generic acronym in WeMo, and then in ST or another hub, call it its nickname there so it doens't get compounded by a 3rd party system downhill like Google Home or Alexa.",5.0 out of 5 stars
L. / D. B.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2017","We love our Echo. It is amazing all of the useful things that she now does for us. These plugs are an added benefit to help Alexa do more. I had absolutely no problem getting everything in sync within the Alexa app. Have your tablet pick up the plug on your wifi. Open your settings and find it in your wifi selections. Press connect and it is now connected to your wifi. Discover it in your Wemo app and then do the same in Alexa. Give each one a name that is easy to remember. I love the minis small size. It doesn't block the second outlet. I have 4 and am now adding a 5th. I have so far named them ""Alexa"" turn on my light, couch light, TV and bedroom light. It couldn't be easier.

The only thing that was confusing at first was if the electricity goes out, you must physically turn the light on once for Alexa to take over again. Not sure if there would be any fix for this?

Steve in Monterey,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2017","I'm new to home automation, but not to electronic gadgets. I have to say that this is especially easy to set up. You have to be a little patient during the initial connection, but everything worked according to the simple instructions. I had the app installed, the plug set up in the app, and the device recognized by echo/Alexa in 5 or 10 minutes, and this was my first time. There's a floor, a wall, and a bunch of heating and plumbing hardware between the switch and our router, and this causes no problem.
It has only been a few days, so I can't comment on durability. Our application is a recirculating hot water system. If it runs 24/7 it's a waste of electricity and gas. If it isn't used a lot of water gets wasted when you run a tap and wait for hot water. Now I just say ""Alexa, turn on hot water"" before a shower or doing dishes, and it warms up quickly. I set a 15 minute timeout, so there's no need to remember to turn it off.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Floopsy,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2018","I Love this product. It is a little large and they do make more compact/smaller ones now from different companies but I already had another wemo product so decided to keep it the same. Works great, haven't had any connection problems yet having had it for over a month. I keep and extension cord with my flat iron and curling iron plugged into it, as well as another for a heated blanket, so that I can put it on a timer and have it automatically turn off whenever I leave the house in case I forgot to, thus reducing the fire risks in our home. Great for lights as well so you can control away from home. Highly recommend for anyone prone to forgetting to turn dangerous items off, or for anyone who wants to control of lights and other items with their phone from anywhere.

Michale,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2017","I have had the WeMo Mini for 4 days now. Initially upon ordering the product, I had some delivery issue, but Amazon handled the issue promptly and without repercussion on my part. I have paired the WeMo with my Echo Dot. Here are my thoughts thus far on this product:
1) Easy set-up
2) Pairing with Dot was easy
3) My father has a smart plug, but his is a bit bulkier. I like the slender design of the WeMo Mini.
4) So far, the Mini is very responsive to remote instructions (manually via phone)
5) The Echo Dot will misunderstand on occassion, but the Mini responds immediately with Dot understands my voice.

With that being said, I do have one negative review, but this does not reflect the Mini itself:
1) Although the set-up was easy, I also had the prior experience with setting up my father's smart plug. Belkin took a minimalist approach to their instructional packet and do not provide specifics. To an individual who has no prior experience to a plug like this, they may have trouble during set-up.

I will update after further use.",5.0 out of 5 stars
New review,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2017","This item is easy to setup. Follow the instructions. Some people have said they had issues connecting but this is because they most likely did not follow ALL the instructions.
First thing. Turn off smart wifi switch on your phone.
Plug in your wemo
Open your phone wifi settings again and connect to the wemo wifi network. Again make sure smart switch is off.
Open the wemo app
It should automatically detect since you just connected to wemo wifi.
Name device and test. You are set.
This is just a brief summary of what I did to set up.
I had no issues so far and will update review if I have any issues later.

I must stress that you turn of the smart network switch.
For those who do not know the smart network switch activates on your phone if the wifi you are connected to doesn't have any internet connection.
Since the wemo doesn't provide internet access you need to turn off the smart switch on your phone.
Otherwise when you try to connect to wemo wifi on your phone it will automatically disconnect since it sees no internet access.",5.0 out of 5 stars

These were my first smart home products with the exception of my Nest thermostat, so I honestly didn't have many expectations. I wanted the plugs for our living room, which is lit by 3 lamps on opposite sides of the room and have to be controlled with each switch. I hooked the Wemo plugs up and got them working with the lamps within 5 minutes. Very impressive and great UI. For the first few weeks I got used to controlling the lighting in my living room through my phone. Then a few weeks back, the Google Home integration rolled out and I have been able to control the lights with my Google Home device. Integration is incredible and this has automated something that used to slightly annoy me. The best thing about these mini plugs is that they don't overtake two outlets. You can have one of these plugged in and still have room for another device to be powered through the same outlet. 5 stars! Well done Wemo.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I've given it a static address, but It's only available about 50% of the time I try to use it. None of my other 25+ wifi devices have this connection problem. Maybe the second wemo is more reliable, but I've lost interest.

Update June 2018: Increased from 2 to 4+ stars. Wemo Customer Service reached out to me with specific recovery instructions and an offer to escalate support if needed. During the recovery process, I noticed the switch was swapping between my two wifi networks. Wemo was never authorized to use the second router. Bottom line: Both routers used the same shared key network password. I made the password unique on the secondary router and all's been 100% available for two weeks now. Seems to be a software/firmware error that could be fixed.

I was irritated with another smart home device ( light bulb that apparently must have a dedicated SSID) that would not work in the tri-band mode.

That plug is used in my far bedroom behind the bed and is at partially blocked/obscured from Wifi by the mattresses/box spring and parts of the headboard.

I’ve had my older gen smart plug for 3-4 years, and I just purchased a newer gen plug recently. I’ve never had any technical issues with my older gen in all of those years which is nice now that I think about it. The new gen mode has a slimmer design which means you can use the other socket in the outlet. For me that is a must, good job WeMo. Also very convenient that there is a switch button on the plug itself. It’s almost like adding another light switch to your home (if you are using it for lights).

My only issues so far are with the software. Not totally intuitive to set up and get going. It’s not rocket science to setup on your device, but I still think it could be easier/smarter. However, once you are setup it’s sooooo easy to use.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I am always skeptical to be an early adaptor to a brand new product but needed a programmable outlet and did not want one of the larger Wemo plugs that take up the entire outlet. This little plug only takes up half of a wall plug outlet. It is easy to program (much easier than the other Wemo switches that I have). Once the software was updated this plug device was connected to my router and working within less than 15 minutes after unpacking it. Programing was a quick and easy process and connecting it to IFTTT to get a notification if it is activated or deactivated. The only glitch, which is typical of Wemo products, is that updating the Wemo software causes problems with all the Wemo devices in use and they often have to be re-setup in order to get them to function.

Changing the Wemo times/settings is SO much easier with the free App for Android/Apple. Anytime we need to adjust the on/off times, just open the app and modify the settings, save....and you're done.
There are a couple of issues I have with the Wemo....1) the directions are simple/easy to follow, but are really (in some cases) too brief and leaves the end user wondering, and 2) have not found out what happens to the Wemo settings after a power outage.

For example, when we left a specific radius around the apartment, all of the lights would automatically shut off. There were no more instances of getting back from vacation to find that we left the lights on.

Self Employed American,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2017","Added the Mini to our Wemo infrastructure about a month ago. It was easy to setup and easy to reset when we changed the WiFi network name. The small form factor finally made it possible to automate items on that awkward outlet with not enough vertical clearance. While the Insight has been awesome for controlling electric heaters and monitoring the cost to run them, the Mini is great for lights and other appliances that stay in a power on state even when the power control switch is put in an 'on' state. It cannot automate our family room TV though for example, because when the power control goes to off, the TV goes to power off state. I wasn't expecting the Mini to do this, but thought other people might find that information useful. Also, though not specific to the Mini, the Wemo integration with Alexa has been an unexpectedly useful feature. Wemo's rule-based automation is what got us into Wemo, and adding Alexa in a way that doesn't require us to purchase new products is greatly appreciated.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Lourdes,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2018","I purchased this to replace an ancient timer I bought from Menards about 15 years ago.

We have had both wemos for over a year and they are still looking and working as well as the day we got them. There are occasional connection problems between the wemo and the echo but they usually resolve within a few hours with no intervention. When that happens, there’s a button to press on the wemo to turn it on or off manually.

I am looking to purchase more wemos in the near future for other rooms.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Brian W. Kittrell,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","I purchased the plug that was “Thread enabled” but it was nowhere to be found on my Thread network, either using the Nanoleaf or the Eve apps. I contacted Belkin/Wemo technical support and they couldn’t explain it to me. It is visible in HomeKit, and through there, it works flawlessly.

Federico Hatoum,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2017","The form factor is much improved over previous versions of their switches. I no longer have to strategically place the Mini Smart Plug so as to not block my outlets. It works with the excellent Wemo software which has very useful features such as ""turn on this switch 30 minutes after sunset"", ""sunset"" being a variable time which the switch tracks for you based on your location. I also appreciate that this switch costs less than its predecessors (of which I have a few).

It would be great if the Wemo Mini interfaced with the Wemo Motion Sensor, but I didn't lower my rating because of that. The great software Wemo software, the smaller size and reduced price make up for that shortcoming, in my opinion. I would also like HomeKit support in Wemo products, but I understand it would require a hardware change. For those of you with a spare server at home and a little linux/unix know-how can install homebridge to add HomeKit support to non-HomeKit devices, such as the Wemo Mini.",5.0 out of 5 stars
W. Lukeroth,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2020","I see a lot of unhappy reviews on these, but my experience has been positive overall. I have three at this time. The first one I bought I did have some difficulty setting up, the next two were easy (I think they improved the process since the time when I bought the first). They work reliably, only a couple times have I experienced them being unresponsive (unplugging them and plugging them back in was all it took to get it working again). App is fine. Google Assistant integration works fine. Possibly the reason for them working better for me is a mesh WiFi system? It would be nice if they were smaller (particularly the width, if it matched the width of a standard outlet) but it's not a deal breaker. I have not made use of any scheduling features so I can't comment on that.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Fletch Hasues,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2020","It might as well be magic noting I can use the magic of Wi-Fi and switch my devices on and off within my house. Noting how some use their phones, I impress my friends waving mine like a wand and making my speakers turn on and off in my house. I even figured out how to do this by sending direct communication to these devices through web requests, all the while screaming spells while doing it; one must keep up appearances. Also, it should be noted that these work over LAN where as using an Alexa only equivalent will be completely dead of one's Internet connection is not working: its like comparing a Nimbus 2000 to a Firebolt.

Bill E.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2017","Instead of running a four way switch to turn on/off my air compressor (its piped throughout the house), I put it on a Wemo Plug. Its rated for 15 amps as is my compressor, so perfect! Plus, I can turn it off from my bedside when I forget and it kicks on at 3AM.

I put a second Wemo Plug on the garage opener. The Wemo turns off the opener at night, so no one can break into my truck (parked outside) and open the door with the remote. Its better than the lockout switch on the opener because Wemo never forgets to do it and I can override it from the Wemo app. On vacation I tell Wemo to keep it off the whole time.

So I'm taking out the garbage at 2AM. Ugh; the garage door is Wemo'ed off and I don't have my phone. IFTTT to the rescue: my outside light Wemo switch is in the garage, so one long press tells my Wemo plug to turn on the opener.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Brian,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2017","I'ts a little wide but at least it grants access to the other outlet. I never understood why the first several smart plugs from TP-Link, We-Mo, and Belkin all felt it necessary to cover up two outlets--at that point, you may as well make it a 2-outlet plug or something.

Personally use it to control a fluorescent light in my bedroom that has no switch. I've since used the timer that you can set up free with their app to automatically turn off late at night (since I had a habit of falling asleep with the lights on) and turning on automatically in the morning to assist with waking me up for work. App gives you basic control of time-based schedule based on time of day, sunrise/sunset times (which adjust throughout the year), and days of the week.

Can also be controlled fairly easy with Alexa--it's so minor but it's more helpful to me than I would have imagined.",5.0 out of 5 stars
GDogg,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2017","I've got several of the older/larger style and this is the first Mini Smart Plug that I've bought. Here's what they are doing around my house:
-Replacing mechanical lamp timers. They've been very reliable and I set them up with the app to automatically adjust to the local sunrise/sunset. E.g. always come on at 1/2 hour before sunset, turn off at midnight, turn on at 6 AM, and turn off again at 1/2 hour after sunrise
-I'm an electronics hobbyist and run a server on a Raspberry Pi. On rare occasions it locks up so I plugged it into a Wemo Smart plug that's always on. If I'm not home and the server locks up, I use the Wemo to cycle power on it.
-My latest idea uses a Raspberry Pi to sense when my air conditioner turns on. It then triggers IFTTT to turn on the Wemo Smart plug which has a fan attached to it to help circulate the air while the A/C is running.",5.0 out of 5 stars
CTM,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2017","This is my first Smart Home product of this type. I wanted something that worked with Alexa to turn on lights that were a bit difficult to reach easily. Setup was relatively painless and both devices are performing exactly as I had hoped. No hubs necessary so installation was that much easier. It is convenient and great fun to ask Alexa to turn on the lights. The switch is low profile and attractive. It does not block the second socket in a two socket wall plate, something that makes my wife very happy. I haven't tried any advanced features like turning on or off away from home or scheduling on or off times but I am confident it will work well in those scenarios.

I have had very few issues with them at all. The only issue is making sure you have a good enough WiFi signal where you want to place the device. This was a problem for one of ours that got resolved with a Netgear Orbi. Now that we have full coverage of our home we have no issue with the WeMos. We have them on lamps so that we can turn lights on before we enter a room and turn them off after we leave. We can also turn them on from outside the house to make it look like we are home.

Update: We travel and I turn these on random on/off inside the house. After we returned from a 30 day trip I spoke with the local patrolman and he asked if someone was actually home because the lights didn't have a pattern of being on or off when he drove by on rounds. I told him that we had the Wemo plugs and he was surprised.

I'll continue to test this device and if I have any issues I'll be sure to update my review. The smart plug is made so it does not cover the other open plug on my electrical outlet.

Thinking that it was going to be a huge pain to get working, I held off on setting up my Wemo for about a week after it arrived. Quite surprisingly, it took about 3 minutes to get everything functioning properly (firmware updates and all), and It works like a charm.

I was comparing other smart plugs in the market, and I saw some reviews that the competing product did not have good app support. I figured Wemo/Belkin would have continuous support for it's app so I went for this one. The size is smaller than I expected and it can definitely fit two in a power outlet. So far the smart plug has been reliable, hopefully it continues to be reliable for a couple years.

Outside lights / porch lights are on but those don't light up the inside of the house. With the Demo plugs you can turn on any light in the house BEFORE you arrive and walk into a well-lit home. Typical scenario: You are away from home much longer than you anticipated and now it's dark. You can now turn on any light connected to a WEMO switch from wherever you are. Piece of mind restored!

MelK,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2017","We own both a WeMo mini smart plug and a wall switchs. Having previously installed the switch our app was ready and the setup took 2 minutes. Be patient with Alexa it takes her a couple of additional minutes to sync up with the plug at first. Be sure they are both on the same wireless network (we have several) or she has trouble. I also recommend changing the WEMO name of the light to something as short as possible. If the name is to long it gives you more room for error when talking to Alexa so more like ""Alexa turn on front light"" instead of the default WeMo sets ""Alexa turn on WeMo Light Switch Front light"".

The shape is good for not blocking both sockets in an outlet. The only thing the shape doesn't work well for is this. Above my kitchen counter, I have an 2-plug outlet with a light switch to the side in the same coverplate. The shape of the mini doesn't work with that switch. I don't imagine Belkin making different form factors unless this becomes incredibly popular, so I just put one of those short 2 to 3 prong adapter plugs and plug Wemo into it so it is spaced out from the wall enough to avoid the lightswitch.

Ocassionally they need to be reset after a long power outage or some other issue. (Once or twice a year) Not a big deal. They released firmware updates in the past year and I haven’t had any issues. My hunch is that most WiFi issues are for larger homes where the WiFi signal can be weaker or where there might be interference.

The Wemo is even better because I can set it to turn on and off at a specific number of minutes or hours before or after sunrise/sunset. Beyond that, the set up is so much easier than other plug in timers and I don't have to crawl under the table every time I want to manually override the timer as it can all be controlled by my phone.

SDWA,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2022","Wemo was good back in the day, but it’s integration with Belkin has ruined its functionality. Conflicts with Apple Home app keeping it from registering correctly, so you’re forced to use the Home app (that “install with Wi-Fi only” option is a dead end…) and that’s where the miserable setup begins the end of the process. Won’t let you install without Home App (forces you to add when iOS recognizes it as an automation device when you select the built-in Wi-Fi setup SSID from the wireless setting screen) and then if you try to use Home app, it insists on you scanning the setup QR while it’s plugged in and the status light is flashing. Guess where the QR code is?? It’s on the back of the plug where you can’t get to it while it’s plugged in. If you unplug it, that halts the install process. 🤦🏻‍♂️ Yep, I even tried while it was plugged into an extension cord so I could scan the back of it. App would act like it installed correctly, but return you to the main screen where there are no devices listed. Multiple app closures, re-installs and phone reboots with no luck.

At that point, you have wasted your money, and can throw it away. 4) Even though it claims to be Google Home and Apple HomeKit compatible, it will take forever to--and more likely, never--connect to their software.

pls,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2022","I got one of these to control an air condition that was located in a very inconvenient location. Getting to the Wemo required moving stuff around, getting a ladder and climbing up to it.

When I first got this smart plug, any short power failure would knock the Wemo off line and require a reset and redoing the setup procedure to recover it. I was climbing the ladder every few weeks. After several months of this, Wemo updated the firmware and greatly reduced this happening. I was now climbing the ladder 2-3 times a summer. Much better. That's where things stayed for a while.

This year I got a new Android phone and used the Android utility to transfer data to the new phone. It transferred the Wemo app, but when I ran the app, it showed the air conditioner Wemo as disabled.

I have a script on my Windows computer that can scan for active Wemo smart plugs and control thim. This found the Wemo and could control it.

The Wemo app has a function to scan for active Wemo devices and add them to the app. This function has never worked and didn't work this time. Wemo tech support told me to reset the smart plug and go through the setup process.

That was the end of my patience with the unreliable device. The next time I'm climbing the ladder it will be to replace the Wemo with something more reliable. I'm done with it.

In summary, this is a fine device if it is easy to reset and redo the setup as you will need to do so regularly. If doing this is difficult or you don't want to deal with the need to regularly recover the device, then this Wemo is definitely NOT RECOMMENDED. Get something else.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Beltway Jim,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2022","The v3 and an older v2 one we have finally refuse to work with Apple HomeKit. Worse, they don't even phone home to their native Wemo app anymore. So they are in a pile of electronics set aside for the electronics recycling day coming up in our city.

I used to be able to get them to work, but only after a LOT of trial-and-error. I learned early on to turn off the 5Ghz band on my router so it can only talk to 2.4GHz band to avoid confusion. But the native app now uses the HomeKit process of capturing the HomeKit QR code by camera. The problem is Wemo put that QR code on the BACK of the outlet, so you have to unplug it. And then it can't connect because it's not powered, of course. I have the code written down but the setup isn't accepting typed codes anymore.

These are SUPER finicky. If you have a power outage or even just move the smart plug to a different receptacle, you have to start the whole trial-and-error setup process all over again.

The Wemo app makes you create a user login these days. That's not helpful when you're having to delete the app from your smart phone and reinstall it in order to forget everything so you can start fresh. Now the app insists on helpfully remembering devices you are trying to neutralize.

In this day and age, stuff like this should simply be set-it-and-forget-it. A device demanding this much attention just does not qualify as ""smart"", in my opinion.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Mactavius,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2022","While this product was functional, it worked extremely well. But after 2-3 years, the plugs are no longer recognized by the wemo app. The plugs are still on the original timers/schedules, but I am unable to use the app to turn on off or revise the schedule. I now need to manually turn on/off which defeats the purposed of a smart plug.

These were purchased in 2018 and stopped working 2020/2021 timeframe. I do not know if the plugs are only expected to work for a couple years. I see these plugs are still for sale (this model I am reviewing was the model I purchased previously) and will not be purchasing again.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Melster,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2017","I have bought three of these so far and definitely plan on purchasing a couple more, all are working well and as expected. I purchased one a couple months ago, loved it, and so I bought two more just this past week. I have the three of them set up to turn on/off four lights twice a day (three hours in the morning and 5+ hours in the evening) and also have them hooked up to Alexa with two commands. They are fairly easy to setup initially via the app and also simple to pair with Alexa, just follow the instructions and you're golden.

I'm not going to lie though, I did encounter a couple minor, super small hiccups during the setup but nothing that I couldn't figure out or would cause me to rate this any lower than a 5 star (maybe a 4.5 but since half stars aren't allowed we will round up). First tiny hiccup: the first wemo I purchased took a few tries in getting the app to recognize it but with some persistence, a dash of patience, and a couple of restarts of the wemo, wemo app, and iPad and it was good to go in less than 15 minutes and it hasn't given me any trouble since (the two other wemos I purchased a week or so after and together they took less than 5 minutes to setup). Second and last little hiccup (solved in less than 10 mins but still something for users to be aware of): getting Alexa to turn my two newest wemos on at the same time by saying one command, I thought I could be clever and name both wemos with the same name and Alexa would know to turn both on/off when I said their name, however, it turns out that you have to instead create a ""group"" within Alexa's app containing the wemos you want to turn on/off together and the caveat is they cannot have the same name within the wemo app. If anyone figured out how to side step this (besides creating a group or asking Alexa more than one command) let me know, but naming two wemos the same name just did not work for me (or Alexa).

Use one wemo for two lights! - My third wemo works double and controls our two small lights on either side of our tv, just plug a multi-socket plugin into the wemo plug and wah-la, a one plug wemo became a two plug wemo. :)

Lastly, and most importantly, our cat Snickers is a HUGE FAN of these wemos and appreciates them very much because it makes her feel like we are home if we get home late or go away for the weekend. And yes, Snickers told me this herself, she also said that her and Alexa get along great and that they talk at least a few times a day. I have not witnessed any of their interaction because she says they only chat when we aren't home, and trust me I've tried asking Alexa if she talk with Snickers and she just outright denies knowing who Snickers is altogether. I have also tried looking into Alexa's app for the conversations but to no avail, I suspect either Snickers is going onto my iPad and deleting their convos or Alexa is not recording them. I contemplated getting a security camera but as much as I want proof of their friendship I would just never forgive myself if I ruined it.

In any case, these are great and I definitely recommend purchasing more than one, at least enough to control all the lamps you turn on daily or even periodically because the wemo app also lets you set which days you want it to turn on/off.",5.0 out of 5 stars
R. B.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2017","I was somewhat alarmed at the number of negative reviews of the Wemo mini smart plug switch. I decided to take it slowly, ordering one or two at a time. I now have six with a seventh coming.
Set up was effortless. The process of connecting to Wi-Fi, naming the switch, connecting to Alexa, setting up single lamps, joining a group, and testing it took five minutes for the first lamp and with practice now takes three minutes. I easily set up groups of lamps controlled by a single command.
I have not tried timed lamps but it looks simple. I have not tried IFTTT. I did not download the firmware update since everything was working.
However, I did try causing trouble. I unplugged a switch and plugged it back in. I changed the name of a switch. I turned off the Wi-Fi and then turned it back on. I set up switches on different floors of the house than the router or the Echo. At no time could I get any of the switches to fail.
The oldest one I have is less than two weeks old, so there is the possibility of failure in the long run. Otherwise I am truly baffled at why some people have had so much trouble.

Update: I ordered two more plugs, numbers 8 and 9. This time I had problems. They would not detect the Wi-Fi. I recycled the plugs and the Wi-Fi to no avail. I unplugged all of the previous 7 plugs, as recommended by another reviewer, but still could not get the new ones to connect. I tried several more times over a period of six hours. I saw why others gave up at this point but i was encouraged to persist because the first 7 worked. Suddenly the new ones connected. I'm truly not sure why. However, a month has gone by and all 9 are operating perfectly. Once again I recycled the Wi-Fi and unplugged the plugs but could not get anything to fail. Clearly these plugs have quirks, but now everything works: Alexa, the Wemo app and the rules. My only sure advice is to persist and you will be rewarded with eventual success.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Robert G. Coach,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2017","Update to my review 27 Nov 2018
The Wemo app finds NONE of my 24 remaining devices. Yet the Wemo server continues to automatically turn on and off two rooms. Go figure. Yesterday, 7 of the 24 remaining Wemos left and cant be found by anything. I have been using Alexa to control them while I go through the COSTLY process of replacing them all, but even SHE cant find these lost sheep. I am accelerating the replacement process. I cant wait to be Wemo free and look forward to the day when I can delete the Wemo app from my life. On a happier note, the Amazon smart plugs have worked flawlessly since installed and are currently on SALE!
Update to my review 7 November 2018.
After a LOT of effort I managed to get the 30 Wemo's connected and working. I just had my cable modem die and since replacing it the Wemo app no longer finds Any OF THE 30 active devices. ""Not Found"" Which is very odd because they are all connected to my wireless network and they are all WORKING via Alexa voice command. And they still turn on and off according to the preset schedule. But none are accessible or controllable by the Wemo app.

I ran a test with the Amazon wireless plug. It set up first try and has worked every time reliably. I am in the process of replacing all my Wemo devices with Amazon wireless plugs because they work and the Wemo has been nothing but trouble since I began installing it several years ago. If you are considering the purchase of a Wemo device I recommend you buy a goat and inspect its entrails prior to completing your purchase.

Update to my review. Yesterday, 3/5/2018 all my Wemo devices went off line. All of them. Not found. Not by Alexa nor by the Wemo app. I restarted all my devices. Nada. Not found. Restarted the wireless hub, no joy. NONE OF MY WEMO DEVICES ARE FOUND since the update.

I am now in full up manual mode. And looking for a different solution. I cannot say this LOUD enough. Belkin devices are CRAP and they just dont work. They have been nothing but painful since I installed them two years ago. At least once a month they just go away and now apparently they are not coming back. DONT buy this if you are truly into home automation. Find another solution. I am

I bought one last year and liked it. I went all in and now have most of the house on Wemo switches and outlets. They worked fine for many months until the latest firmware update. Now most of them are continually off line. I have reset, restarted and performed all the recommended updates including adding multiple wireless extenders throughout the house. They are performing so poorly that I am considering going back to pre Wemo days. Its just very frustrating. Had they left them alone I suspect that they would still be operating just fine. Now they are worthless and I can no longer recommend them.

November 2017 update. For the past two months the Wemo app will not find any of my devices. Fortunately I have been able to control them using Alexa else I would have backed the truck up and recycled them all.

This first happened when Belkin did a firmware update. The last three firmware updates have killed connectivity. The first time I reconnected all 22 devices. It took a full day. I contacted Belkin support and got a terse replay ""not our fault"" basically don't call us we will call you NEVER.

The second time I managed to get the devices to connect after two days of resetting them by cycling the power. What a huge pain in the butt. Again, Belkin support said ""Not our fault, move along we are not interested in your little problems""

Yesterday I was forced to do another firmware update cause I lost half the devices. You guessed it, they all went away again. I contacted Belkin support again. They told me to go away I was obviously not getting the message. They do not support their devices.

I used to buy Belkin wireless but went away from them several years ago because they are unreliable, inconsistent and not supported.

I tried to update the Wemo app. No update available. I tried controlling them through Alexa, but got the server not responding error message from Alexa. Interesting but for half the devices I could command them individually but not collectively via Alexa. Other room groups worked through Alexa normally but none worked through the Wemo app which did not find ANY of their own devices.

I tried to enable the Wemo skill in Alexa but of course Wemo did not find my wireless network. Nuts. Alexa was turning them on and off using the new Alexa built in hub, but Wemo did not find them while connected to the same freaking network. Belkin is junk in my opinion only matched by their lack of support. Can I go with half a star?.

I started going through the Wemo app trying different things. It was connected to my local wireless network but I deleted and reconnected it again. Like magic all of a sudden the devices showed up only three hours later!

I highly recommend that if you do decide to go with Belkin you place the switches in a location where you can easily access it manually because I can guarantee that you will need to do so.

Unless and until Belkin starts to support their devices and the reliability improves I recommend to my friends and family that they look at alternative solutions.

I would say that I have had a bad experience but it does not raise to that level. :-)",1.0 out of 5 stars
Gadget Guru,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2019","I have 4 Wemo minis that I use in tandem with 3 of the original plug switches, 1 Wemo insight plug and several light switches. I guess you could say I'm pretty well entrenched in the Wemo universe at this point.

All devices work great over my older wireless G router which is on the first floor in the kitchen of my home built in 1875. Not only do I have to contend with thick plaster and lathe walls (and perhaps some lead paint I'd rather pretend isn't there), thick hardwood framing and floors, 3 stories (including the finished attic, but I also have a metal tile ceiling in the kitchen. It's literally the worst case scenario, aside from maybe masonry.

Despite this, all my Wemo components across all three floors and even the detached garage manage to connect and show up in the app, both on the local and outside networks. I do see a lot of reviews that have an issue with this, but despite all the obstacles, I've had no issues. I do make the initial connection to the network on my first floor, but even after relocating the devices, they still show in the app with no issue.

I like using these switches for multiple reasons:

1) Automation: I can turn lights on and off based on sunset and sunrise times, exact time or any combination or sunset/sunrise and specific times. That means my porch light comes on at dusk and turns off at dawn and other lights turn on at dusk and turn off at the time I normally head to bed. This is especially great for holiday decorating.

2) Remote control: I can turn lights or other devices on or off from anywhere the internet exists.

3) Security camera control: I have several outdoor security cameras, but never wanted to have them inside since I didn't want to risk someone getting into the DVR and being able to view me indoors. With a Wemo switch, I can automate the cameras being on only when I'm not home or manually turn them on remotely at other times rather than activate or deactivate them through the security DVR. That means a hacker would need to have access to both the DVR and the Wemo switch to spy on me indoors. Granted, they would only see ""public"" areas on the first floor, but it's nice to have that extra security measure with two systems.

4) Access to lighting controls from anywhere in the house: It's nice to be able to turn on outside lighting from my bedroom using the app to investigate a noise I might hear outside. Whether it's a raccoon or a human prowler, it's nice to say ""get off my lawn"" from the safety of a lockable upstairs room using outdoor lighting.

Overall, installation, updates and use are pretty painless. I make it harder on my self by having MAC Address filtering turned on in my router, so I have to manually add each device address in before it will connect. Most people don't do this, so it's a problem I made for myself, not an issue for the device. Once I manually add in the MAC Address, things go pretty smoothly.

I have a password with special characters in it, so I can conform there is no issue with using them. The devices also see unfazed my using the newer WPA2 security.

Once you have one device connected, you can save those credentials to make adding more devices easier.

Overall, things are easy, but it's not entirely peaches and cream. Here are the reasons for only 4 stars:

1) The overall installation could be far easier if the app could simply read a QR code on the device and add it directly to the home network using the saved credentials that way. It's silly to have to connect to the device, send the credentials to it (or enter them manually if it's the first device), then connect back to the home WiFi network to use it with the other devices. Seriously: scan QR code through the app using the camera, input WiFi credentials (or select already saved WiFi network), plug in the device, then wait for it to connect and appear in the app. It should be that simple. It's not unworkable the way it is, but there's no reason for it not to be easier.

2) You can't change your WiFi password on all the devices using the app. That means if you update your router password periodically (as you should), you have to first deprogram ALL the Wemo devices, change the router password, then manually add them all back in. Seriously. What moron thought that was a good way to do it? The app lets you save the Wifi properties for adding additional properties. You should be able to go into the settings and change it and have all the devices update in one shot. That's, like, how everything else in the world works. Stupid, stupid, stupid....

3) Switches don't resume their previous on state if power is lost, then restored. They seem to reconnect to my network fine, but it's annoying my outside light remains off after power is restored instead of remembering the state it was on (or comparing the current state to the running program) and turning on if it should be on. If Belkin is worried something could trip a breaker or do something else bad if the switch somes back on unattended, simply make it a check box function for each individual switch. That way I can decide what should come back on following a power failure and what should remain off. Further, they can program in a delay to ensure the system is no longer at risk of brown-outs to avoid the effects of multiple power drops.

4) These things aren't cheap. In comparison to other similar devices on the market, the price of the Belkin devices is becoming more out of line with the market reality. Fortunately, occasional sales make that less of an issue, but Belkin really needs to price their products more competitively to ward off competition from the cheap Chinese knock-offs.

5) Belkin seems to take far too long to respond to new feature demands. It's only recently as last year they finally added a dimmable light switch, for example. Other manufacturers were already out with options for that long before Belkin came out with their product. Likewise, companies like Lutron not only have app controlled switches, but have options for adding additional switches to lights without the need for a direct connection with them. While the Belkin WiFi based system would likely at least need a power connection to an add on switch, they absolutely need to create ""add-on"" switches that can control a main switch, essentially creating a 3-way switch option to lighting. These add on switches would read the state of the main switch and show the the state in the app, and merely trigger the on/off press on that main switch they connect to. In short, they would only act as a remote control for the main switch. Belkin already has the ability to do this, as evidenced by the addition of the ""long press"" rule, but they need an option for a dedicated add-on switch to avoid the cumbersome ""long-press"" option that is really a complete pain to use.

6) Belkin needs more options for the rules. Right now, the rules only let you set one on/off event for days that you choose. If you want a second or third on/off event, you need another rule. That means you need separate rules for work days and weekends, morning and evening, home and away, home and vacation, holidays and literally every single thing else you can think off. My thermostat lets me set all those options that can be accessed in an unattended manner for most (work day/day off, morning/evening, etc.) , and two touches for others (vacations, holidays, time of year, etc.). I should be able to use on rule to turn a light on in the evening and off at bed time, turn on in the morning and turn off when I leave for work and have separate times for my days off. There should then be a check box to enable whatever vacation or holiday rules I might have set. If you're like me and have a lot of devices, having individual rules for each occasion for each device means a whole lot of rules.

Now, some of these negatives I can live with because there is at least a work around, even if it's more cumbersome. In some cases, I choose not to use a Wemo switch unless or until that option becomes available (such as my foyer light that has a three way switch). In the case of making it a pain when changing my WiFi password, I took off a star for making me jump through unnecessary hoops a couple of times a year. That star also includes the somewhat cumbersome method of adding switches.

The fact is, once added, the switches do work great (for me, anyway). Belkin just needs to get on the ball and bring their product a few steps further to make them stand out from the competition that is in danger of eating their lunch.",4.0 out of 5 stars
The Suburban Experimentalist,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2019","UPDATE: So I initially started using these in April, and it is now October 10th. I have had no problems with these, and at one point I was gone from the house for a month, turning the lights on and off, and have had no problem with this at all. Firmware has been updated at least twice since installing them, with no issues. It still works with Apple Home kit on my phone. I still rate them at this point great!

So i just recently starting using smart devices in my home. I do not want something that is always listening to me, so I do not want an Alexa, or Google Hub.

I set this smart plug up using the Wemo app in just a few minutes. This is contrast to another manufacturer I tried.

Can this work with Apple Homekit on your phone?
See the video, but the video, but the answer is yes! I was able to to use Apple Home kit to control this smart plug after I used the Wemo app to do a firmware update on the plug. At this time however, I was not able to do so on the Wemo light switch.

After doing the firmware update using the Wemo App, the Wemo smart plug simply showed up when I clicked on the Home app on my phone.

From that point, I could just push the home button and ask Siri to turn the light on our off.

Responsiveness of the Wemo app:
The app is instantaneous as far as I am concerned. That again is in contrast to another manufacturer that has a lot of lag(delay) in turning the decide on and off.

What can you do from the Wemo app:
You can schedule the device to turn on and off at certain times, you can program an auto off timer, You can use a motion detector to turn devices on and off, but you need to install a Wemo Sensor, or Netcam to do so. There is Away mode, for vacation, and you can get motion alerts (again if you have a sensor). You can do firmare updates to your devices, you can see who has access to your devices, and disconnect those you don't want on your system, and you can setup control to Alexa, Google assistant, nest, etc. You can also use the app to get in touch with the makers of Wemo.

Reliability:
My Wemo devices will occasionally become disconnected for a few minutes, but I am not sure what the issue is. It doesn't happen often, and it is not troublesome to me.

I really like the Wemo devices over the other smart devices I have used.

I hope this is helpful!

Lazyboy,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2018","I had asked the question as to whether or not this device will operate simultaneously with both Alexa and HomeKit. The answer I got was yes and it was true (I think) what I wasn’t told was that in order to work with Homekit it was necessary to update the firmware. Not really a big deal but if you’re installing eight of them it does take some time. With that said, I did get all the devices to show up in the Homekit app (although one stubborn unit took a total restart to do so) and I can operate through both the Homekit and Wemo apps. I have not yet had the chance to work our automation on HomeKit nor the chance to blend them into Alexa (I’m trying to make this really easy for someone else) but my first impressions are -
It’s a fairly simple setup once you get the first one
It does what it should.
Check back for an update on the grouping, voice automation (a single device at a time has worked as hoped) and finally voice control on two separate OS’s, HomeKit and Alexa. Probably a weekend adventure.

An add on update. I set up two scenes through HomeKit (very simple to do btw) and both worked with either the phone scene tab on the app and with Siri. With that said and as I have read elsewhere, three devices dropped from the network and had to be found again. For the mathematically inclined, that’s nearly a forty percent drop rate on the second day. I’ll attribute that for now to the new programming but am not encouraged that issues have showed up so quickly.

Final edition- have had the plugs three weeks now. Working flawlessly and will buy a few more (running eight now) based on my experience. Please note that I have only run them with HomeKit but I would expect the same results from Alexa.
Final final edition. I have added two more of these to my network to now total ten. My caveat remains that set up and integration into HomeKit can still be frustrating but....
I didn’t need a hub and the HomeKit scenes I have set up have performed without fail. Just remember you need to update the firmware to make it work. Once brought into the HomeKit network, it works with my tv remote, my phone, my Mac laptop.....you get the picture. My wife loves coming home this time of year and turning on lights all around the house with only asking for it. Nice feature to have. You cannot dim lamps (yet?) but on and off based on the scene you define is all we really wanted. I’ve upgraded my rating to a five in spite of the sometimes setup failure.",5.0 out of 5 stars
MO,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2017","UPDATE 3/20/2017: As you'll see below the nice folks at Wemo support reached out to ask me about the issue. Support had some good questions, and I felt like they knew what they were doing. I didn't get the usual basic questions about if the Wemo is plugged in. Ultimately I just had to hunker down, and do proper troubleshooting. After about 3 hours I finally narrowed down the basic issue.

Some context first. I connect all of my IoT gizmos to an isolated guest network. The idea is if somebody hacks one, they aren't easily getting to my laptops, and other sensitive devices. I have a Netgear R700 Nighthawk router that supports firewalled guest networks to fit this purpose.

I noticed in the router logs that the Wemo was actually connecting, and getting an IP address. However the amber light on the plug would keep flashing indicating it didn't think it was connected. What's weird is exactly every 60 seconds I'd see another DHCP request. Weirder yet the first time the Wemo DHCP's it seems to be stable.

Ultimately I found that if I went into my guest network settings and checked the box - ""Allow guests to see each other and access my local network"" the Wemo was happy and worked just fine. Something about the added L2 isolation is making the Wemo very upset. Of course leaving this box checked entirely defeats the purpose of the guest network. Ultimately I signed the Wemo onto my private network; let's hope they've done their security homework.

I'll give back a star because the plug works and stays connected now, and it seems to be a little more responsive as well. Holding a star off the potential 4 star rating as I have to compromise my network to do it.

==== Original Review 3/11/2017 ====
First, I'll lead with I'm VERY savvy when it comes to IoT products. My company designs and implements hardware and mobile apps for a variety of back office providers (Amazon, Ayla, Photon...). This is my first Wemo product, and overall I'm really disappointed. Wemo was one of the first to market, and a well known brand name. I expected a lot more from a company like Belkin, and a product that has been fielded since the beginning of the IoT rave started. Especially at this price point.

All I'm really looking for is a smart plug to automatically power cycle a piece of hardware once a day. And allow me to remotely power cycle it if necessary.

Note: my Wi-Fi signal is good. Less than 10 feet from my router. And I have 50Mbps Internet service. My other gizmos and gadgets have great response times so I'm not having trouble with my Internet.

The Good:
* The product looks professionally done, and feels like good quality construction.
* Wi-Fi pairing was really easy. I'm using the iOS app. Belkin could give me a button to launch iOS Wi-Fi settings, and use a captive network to automatically redirect me to the app once you connect to the Wemo's Wi-Fi access point to save me a little work. No big deal though.
* I didn't have to create a user account. The last thing I really want is another user account somewhere.
* In general, fairly simple and clean app design
* Active user community. Belkin's knowledge base is pretty useless, but the community forums are great!

The Bad:
* Exception to app design: The schedule options were confusing at first. Specifically the ""on until"" option. After a little trial and error I figured it out.
* The first time I created a schedule it took a minute to save it. Edits are faster maybe 10 seconds.
* Toggling power from my phone is really slow - 10-15 seconds. Not the end of the world, but I hate waiting.

The Ugly:
* I needed a firmware update right away. Which is fine. Kicked off the update. It sat and spun, and spun, and spun for about an hour. Noticed the LED was blinking amber. Pull up the manual and find out that means it's not able to connect to Wi-Fi. Power cycled the mini and still no connection. Reset via the on/off button. Repaired with the app and it was fine again.
* I setup my Wemo on a plug by my desk where it's easy to access and see that it is running the schedule correctly. It's final home will be somewhere that's not as easy to access. When I moved the Wemo to it's new home it came up with the flashing amber light again. No amount of power cycling or fidgeting would get it back onto my router again. I had to reset it and repair it again.
* Did some more testing and sure enough - once the power is lost it doesn't reconnect.
* I pulled power on my router just to see what would happen and when it came back up the Wemo didn't reconnect in that case either.
* Conclusion: If you lose your Wi-Fi connection due to router loss, warm reboot, or cold reboot you have to repair. This is a scenario any IoT product is going to face. Simply unacceptable Belkin would even think of shipping units with this issue.

I found a few posts on the community forum with many other people complaining about the same Wi-Fi problem. I'm not alone.

If I had frequent power outages the Wi-Fi problem would be a non-starter 1 star rating. I can live with it so I'll go 2 stars.

If Belkin can get a firmware fix out so Wi-Fi reconnect is reliable I'd go 4 stars. -1 star for the annoying schedule UI, and slowness.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Peter Franzke,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2019","Keep trying. I have around 7 of the Wemo start plugs. Some are previous generations but the set-up process is the same. Having said that even I have had trouble adding a new plug to the Wemo app. The first check is if there is a firmware update. Secondly I reset the plug Itself by holding down the power button (follow directions in user manual) and try again. I will admit that it's taking me up to five try sometimes to get the plug to connect to the app for the first time. However, once it does I have never had an issue even when I have removed a smart plug from one wall socket waited a few days, plugged it into a different wall socket opened the appand there was. One other confusing thing occurs when you connect to the WeMo Wi-Fi for the first time . After the app had successfully connected to the Wemo' s Wi-Fi it doesn't always take you back to the WeMo app to continue the setup process. Depending on the phone you have what you often have to do is close out of your wifi settings and tbe Wemo app and then restart the app. Once you do that it will connect to the WeMo smart plug and continue the process. There's a video I put where you can see where this happens. Also when you do connect to the WeMo Wi-Fi for the first time there may be a message that pops up warning you don't have internet connection. You can ignore this message. Hit dismiss or don't worry about it till it goes away. I think sometimes people stop at that point. However even doing all of those things correctly it is true that sometimes it takes a while for it to connect the first time. That's about the only negative thing as far as function I can say about it. Once you are connected adding your plug to Alexa is fast. It's actually faster than the WeMo setup process. Setting it up with all the other Smart Home hubs is just as straight forward. Setting up widgets is simple as well once you have it up and running. . Form-factors a different thing but that's a discussion for another day.

PROS - Easy step by step setup. Excellent third party support. I've used with Samung Smarthings, IFTT, Apple Home and the native app.

New form factor allows use of second plug. I've purchased multiples of this device. When it comes to Smart plugs this one is my favorite.

CONS - it could use a second plug.

If you're looking for a small plug that's also a smart plug that works with multiple third-party vendors you can't go wrong with the WeMo product. You can plug in smart devices from other brands into this plug and have no issues.

Homekit News and Reviews,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2018","As many reading this a probably aware by now, WeMo recently announced that their Mini Smart Plug was the first ostensibly non-HomeKit compatible device to gain HomeKit compatibility, via the new Software Authentication protocol. Intrigued by this, I decided a purchase was in order, despite the fact that I’ve already got quite a few smart plugs to spare.

If you’ve read my previous reviews, you’ll be aware that I put a lot of stock into presentation (the packaging basically), and on this count I would say that WeMo have delivered admirably. As with many of the current manufacturers of smart devices, the container that the smart plug came in was super sturdy, being made of a thick recycled (?) cardboard, enclosed in a green and white outer sleeve. Green seems to be the colour of choice these days, with iHome and Vocolinc both also opting for this colour scheme. Whether this is an effort to imbue their products with some form of ‘eco-friendliness’ I’m not sure, but it certainly works on an aesthetic level.

Once you’ve taken off the outer sleeve, you can really see that WeMo have gone the extra mile, with a lovely design on the inside of the carton – something you’d only see once you had already purchased the product, so this isn’t just to entice you, it’s to encourage and excite you into taking WeMo seriously, in that they think about the smaller details.

After you’ve open the box fully to reveal the smart plug itself, you can see that it’s housed nicely within the centre of the box, giving it little chance to move around and potentially get damaged. There’s an included manual to help with quick setup along with any problems you might have with the plug, in the form of a list of troubleshooting tips.

At the end of the day, of all the categories of smart devices, smart plugs offer the most choice, and while some can do small things that others can’t do (like monitor electricity usage for example), they all basically do the same job of turning a ‘dumb’ device on or off, giving said device some level of automation. This device is no different to any of those in that basic respect. It’s fairly slim, or wide, depending on how you look at it, but being this slim it does offer the advantage of not taking up more than one wall socket, which in turn means that it can be stacked with another WeMo smart plug quite comfortably.

The design of the plug itself is quite unassuming, which would lend itself to blending into a typical, mainly white kitchen. Simple branding aside, the only other thing on the front is a rather convenient on/off switch, with a small LED that lights up in white, when there’s power going to the plug. Going back briefly to its dimensions, while it’s not quite as slim as the iHome iSPX6, it comes close, although it is slightly taller. it does beat out the iDevices Switch in the ‘skinny’ department, but once again it is wider/taller, so it really is down to the individual as to what works for them.

Onto the setup: As this device isn’t a ‘straight-out-the-box’ HomeKit product, with no HomeKit code provided – or even needed – the procedure was a little bit more involved; not necessarily complicated, but a little long-winded nonetheless. First off, you need to download the WeMo app to get things started. Once the app is downloaded and running, you simply plug the device into an outlet and let the app guide you through the process of initially setting it up to work with the WeMo app. Interestingly, even though the setup process for getting it to integrate with HomeKit comes later, the first thing you’re asked on opening the WeMo app is access to your ‘Home Data’, meaning your current Apple Home data. Once you’ve okayed this, you choose which device you want to set up, you’re then presented with a few tips as to setup process itself. This involves connecting your iPhone or iPad to the wi-fi signal of the plug itself in order to exchange you home wi-fi network settings. Once all that’s ‘in the bag’, the app will attempt to connect to the device itself, which in my case took a little bit of time.

It eventually spots the plug and asks you to name the device (if you so wish – I stuck with ‘Wemo Mini’). You’ll then be prompted to provide an email address to complete the process before it proceeds to finally connect directly to your home network. After that is complete, you then get to choose whether you’d like it to send you notifications.

As I already mentioned, this was a lengthy, if straightforward process, but once you’re at this point, you’ll see the smart plug show up as a device that can now be programmed or controlled within the WeMo app. Chances are that there will be at least one, if not two firmware updates awaiting you. One of these will be for the plug itself, which is reassuring to know that kinks are spotted and ironed out by way of these updates. The other is to enable the plug to work with HomeKit, which is the whole reason this is being reviewed of course! Once you’ve updated the firmware, you’ll finally get to the section that allows for HomeKit connectivity. You’re given options for connecting the plug to IFTTT, Nest, Alexa and finally, the Apple Home App. Google isn’t on this list for some reason, but you can connect to Google assistant via the Google Home app.

We’re on the home straight now, so it’s just connecting the plug to the Home app, which in most respects appears in the same way it would if you were adding a standard HomeKit compatible device, minus the part where you have to scan a code.

From here on in, like with a standard install, it’s simply a case of choosing which room the plug resides in, whether it appears as a Light, Powerpoint or Fan, and whether you wish to add it to your favourites. It will then appear in your standard Home app, along with any 3rd party apps you may use.

I’ve only been using it for about 24 hours, and so far I’ve found it to be as responsive as all my other plugs, with no real sign of extra lag from touching the tile in the app, to the corresponding on or off. The device itself emits a small ‘click’ when it’s turned on or off (which may be good for some and terrible for others), and the LED above the physical switch turns white or turns off respectively.

As previously stated, it does work with other platforms, and while it isn’t compatible with Wink, unlike the aforementioned iHome smart plug, it does have IFTTT, which may actually be of more use.

After setting the device up, I unplugged it from mains power briefly, to see if it would reconnect without any issues, and it did reconnect after about a minute or so. However, I did a second test, where I left it disconnected overnight, and on this occasion it took a full uninstall and reinstallation to get it back to where I had it, which in fact took two attempts, with the first take managing to somehow render the physical button unresponsive. A second full reset solved the issue and once I’d gone through the lengthy installation process again, it was all good.

In my final assessment, it’s great to see how devices are going to work with the new Software Authentication process, and I’m hoping that when other manufacturers do get on board, the set up isn’t as long as this one was, even though I can see that most steps seemed to be necessary. However, there are a ton of choices for smart plugs out there, and while this device is a little cheaper than many of them, you do find some good deals occasionally, which essentially boils this down to just another smart plug.

Pros
slim, so easy to stack with another of these if needed
relatively cheap
good support from a reputable company

Cons
long-winded set up process
not great at remembering settings if left unplugged
Still, I’d recommend it for those on a budget who also don’t want to obscure two wall outlets with one plug.",4.0 out of 5 stars
AH,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2017","I really, really wanted to like this product & technology, but the failure modes and failure rates are astoundingly high.
Relevant background to my skill levels:
I bought a couple of the plugs so that I could experiment with how to automate my home. I am neither a software or hardware engineer, however I am a (very highly) qualified engineer and I have self taught myself a lot about network hardware & application of software packages. I have an advanced router with repeater, fully LAN & WAN connected house, with network switches, POE devices etc. that I installed & runs pretty cleanly.

First of all the app - I am still on 2nd level support waiting for a response to an issue where I am patient zero. I can create a rule, but it does not give me the choice of days. It is the same rule every day or no rule at all. I have tried installing the app on 2 i devices, same issue(the even have different itunes accounts to further firewall them from each other) So the app is highly buggy. App version 1.17.1.

2nd, the switch(es) I have RMA'ed one of my 2 as I still could, the first one I am stuck with. The 2nd one experienced worse functionality issues than the first one. It had to go as this is a defective unit.
The rules limited me, so I tried anyway.
Initial first time setup was quite smooth & I was initially impressed. (Hadn't realized the rules issues yet)
Paired it to Alexa, that was pretty smooth too (Still impressed)
Ran it for a few days, had fun having Alexa switch it on & off etc.
Then we had a power outage. Big system failure on the WEMO.

After restarting power, everything else came back up properly.
I tried restarting the first switch (the still semi functional one that is not RMA'ed) several times to see if it would boot up, it actually would not boot up until I had pushed the power button several times & actually physically unplugged & replugged it several times.
The WEMO devices were not recognized by the app on my phone, until I switched it to the same wifi network as they were running on. This i snot helpful when you are trying to make a remote access switch.
So after trying & rebooting I have given up.
I cannot set up a smart house with devices that require a full factory reboot and me to delete the app, reset all rules from scratch, every time the power fails or blips.

So sadly I have to say the devices are junk, the app is junk and they need to be fully redesigned before both parts of the system become stable & reliable.

Sorry Belkin, but you also have a lot of people on your own Community pages with many similar problems & your own support is not the one finding solutions, it is other users who have more time to do this than most of the rest of us have.
So, folks, if you read this far, don't waste your time & money, these devices are great in concept, but are far from Implementation Ready for mainstream use.

I have never been paid to write a review - good or bad and I have never been given anything for a review, except for one thing that was sent to me that I didn't want & I contacted the vendor & asked for an RMA (They said donate it - so I did). What you read is my genuine experience.
Sadly 1 star reviews get pushed out of sight on Amazon & they are hard to access (even your own ones).
Thanks for your time.

Updated 3/17 to add rules screenshot showing the app issue with no days selectable. App version 1.17.1 (420001) that I am trying to deal with on 2nd level support. I still struggle with the concept that I am the only person with this issue & that it is identical on 2 unrelated Apple devices that are on different accounts.
Just a side note - when Customers are on the phone with your reps, when discussing the product, it really makes a better impression of your company when they are aware of who your major competitor(s) are. 1st level support had never even heard of TP Link (check the recording it you don't believe me).

3/30/2017 update.
I found a workaround out of sheer frustration & anger &, well, it is still strange.

I had a blank screen for the days selection when creating rules. Nothing showed up at all, ever, I have deleted & reinstalled the app 3 times, done a full hardware reset on the switches 3+ times, had Belkin 2nd level support on the phone - you name it. (That was a whole different story - see the response comments!)

So I was giving it one last try to see if it would work, I reinstalled everything from scratch.
Set up a new rule - still nothing snowing in the days area of the screen.

So I was really very angry about how much time & energy I had spent on this whole exercise & I was absentmindedly tapping my phone screen repeatedly, when I suddenly noticed that it was highlighting days of the week.

So I played around some more.

I can get it to highlight, at most, 6 of 7 days, in any combination.

I have to guess where the day is to be selected on the screen, then I can find it.

I sometimes have to tap that spot several times to get the day to select (no it is not my touchscreen, both devices have the same response)

What I then found out was, if I select a day & I can now see it, that means that day is one in which the rule will NOT work. It Will work on the days that are not selected & still invisible on the screen.

I have attached a couple of random screen shots so you can see what is going on.

Is the issue fixed - no, not at all, it is still there & the software still has a huge flaw.
Does it work enough that I want to continue to try to experiment with it - yes
Will I want to see a software update to fix this issue - yes
Do I want to continue to use this switch for the short term - yes
So in short, I will not send it back, yet. There is something going on.

I tried this workaround on 2 different Apple products (Iphone 6 & Ipad Mini 3) and the workaround works on both.

Is it still fatally flawed - yes.

Please can you pass this on to your 2nd or even higher level Engineers as there is still a problem that must get fixed, but this is a partial workaround.

By the way, I also tried changing the screen color settings to see if it was screen contrast or color related - no it is not, the Apple devices are working exactly as they should, it is your software with the bug.

If you want me to try anything else, have your engineers get in touch & we can see what we can do.

I have still lost significant confidence in the product & am very unsure if I want to invest in any more of them to automate other parts of my home at this time.",1.0 out of 5 stars
MD,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2018","Original review was Four Stars, and follows this update, which is just a few days later....

So, as noted below, after some struggles, I did manage to get it connected. BUT, it won't power my heater! It is supposed to, but, today, it started overheating and turning itself (and my heater) off. I woke up freezing cold, and saw that it was off, and learned, via a message in the app, that this stupid plug just overheats and shuts itself off! What it the point?! Very fed up now with Wemo.

Switch was also making electrical crackling sounds, not good. Fire hazard, for sure!

I am returning it, and don't care to try another one. I have ordered one of the units from TP-Link, and I'll see how that does. I did not order one of their ""Mini"" ones, since maybe they are too fragile for a space heater, but, if that's the case, then these companies should be forthright and state, up front, that the small versions are only for a 4 watt lamp, or whatever the limit is.

I found many similar complaints about this useless plug, the overheating problem, and apparently it comes down to a defective unit, since some can power a heater, just fine, and others, like mine, overheat and shut down.

Lousy quality control, minimal customer help, fire hazard, all bad. I'm done with Wemo.

ORIGINAL REVIEW, a few days previous....

Back in 2016, I ordered a Wemo Smart Plug, just to be able to remotely turn on the space heater at home, so my apartment would be nicely warmed up for my arrival, in winter. It worked so well I bought a second one, to do the same at my office. They were the ""full size"" ones, not a Mini version.

As usual, this year, I did not use them over the summer, at all, and have only just now needed them again. This year, the one at the office still works great, but, to my great frustration, the one at home simply refused to work anymore, and I wasted hours following every procedure I could find, to no avail. Wemo does a horrid job, in my opinion, on simplifying use and troubleshooting of these products. You have to hunt through basically other customer experiences and what they did, and the app itself now doesn't even have built-in help, but instead kicks you over to your browser to try and find any solution and you can't even connect to the Internet while trying to set up this thing.

For me, my original less-than-clever plug would not connect to the app anymore, and would also not do anything else after reset, it just blinked orange and would do nothing more, and refused to even go into pairing mode. I finally took a hammer to it, and felt much better!

BUT, based on how well it worked, when it did work, and based on my office one still working great, two years on, I opted to try Wemo again, this time selecting this Mini version, because it doesn't block the other outlet of the wall plug.

At first, I was getting frustrated again, and nearly reached for the trusty hammer, but it WOULD at least go into pairing mode, although it would not complete the set-up. Turns out that smart phones now annoy the smart plug, so I had to change settings on my phone so that no other network would interfere during the set up process. I just turned off 4G, and deleted all networks but one, so that the fussy little plug could complete the set up process.

Then, the app promptly forgot or deleted the plug, and it was gone, and I had to start over. As my hand almost involuntarily started creeping toward the hammer handle, I paused, took a deep breath, and began from the beginning. This time, I knew what to do at least, deleted all my networks but one, turned off 4G, let it set itself up, then added one network back to my phone, so it could talk to the plug, and, voila! Plug showed up in the app and works perfectly to turn the heater on and off.

So, definitely a star lost for very poor assistance with these things. I never did figure out why the other one stopped working, and, with this one, I was entirely on my own to figure out why it would not initially set up, beyond the mention of some ""auto connection"" feature on my phone, which I turned off, but which made no difference.

Just using guesswork, I figured too many available networks was confusing the not-so-smart plug, and that turned out to be the case. But, VERY frustrating process, and there just is not readily available (or easily applicable) help from Wemo on their products, which seems ridiculous to me, and likely is behind some of the many negative reviews.

I know there are a lot of phones and a lot of networks out there, but it seems somebody could make a product that connects more easily, or at least offer some step by step guides for troubleshooting, or something. I'm no tech or computer guy, so I probably don't have a clue how difficult that is to accomplish, and it's likely a case where it's best to just be thankful for a product that can miraculously turn on my heat from anywhere on earth (if my Internet is working, at least) but I can see where folks would give up on products like this, that are just so frustrating sometimes and refuse to do what they are supposedly made to do.

This is certainly as deep as I'll ever dive into ""smart"" products, and, no thanks, don't need my fridge monitoring me or microphones and cameras surveilling my every move. I guess people raised in this nightmare era of social media don't think it's a big deal (despite all that goes wrong due to broadcasting one's life incessantly), but, yup, a semi-smart plug is about all I want to deal with in terms of the Internet of Things or whatever it is called.

So, a star off for frustrations, but, I will say, regarding these, that when they work, they are a big help. I can figure out for myself when to order milk, but smart tech that lets me operate my heater from anywhere is pretty awesome, so four stars given, and deserved, in that regard.

I do recommend, but hide your hammer, because frustrations may come along with this item and help is definitely not easy to find.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Customer Review,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2017","I purchased this item from Amazon on January 9th, as a pre-order from when they were released as a new item on January 10th, 2017. After receiving two defective units from Amazon, and before returning the second, I decided to play around with it more and do some more research online. I am posting this to help anyone else who purchased this and is having trouble getting it to connect to your local WiFi network. I did get the unit working fine, but I removed two stars from my review because of the hassle of getting it to work. I spent over an hour with WeMo tech support, who offered no solutions, and made me jump through a bunch of hoops in the process. Cycling a reboot of my router did nothing. Changing my WiFi password did nothing. Disconnecting my phone from cellular service did nothing. The issue with these early units lies in the fact that they seem to get ""confused"" if you have other WeMo devices in your home. When trying to set up this WeMo mini, the WeMo app on my iPhone would find the device after I connected to its WiFi. The screen would show the device, ask me to name it, and click ""Next"". After clicking next, it would get stuck trying to get the device to find my home WiFi network. I have 4 other ""older"" WeMo devices (none of which ever had any issue connecting). I have a WeMo light switch, and 3 regular WeMo smart plugs. Two of the other WeMo smart plugs were easily accessible, so I tried completely unplugging them (not just turning them off). I did a factory reset on the WeMo mini I purchased, went through the app process of connecting it again, and voila! It immediately found my WiFi network and connected. And then it immediately downloaded a firmware update. So it seems like WeMo is aware of an issue, yet their tech support wasn't informed. And so far, I seem to be the only one publicly acknowledging the issue with these early release devices and buggy firmware.

So long story short, if you have other WeMo devices in your household, and have trouble getting this WeMo mini to connect, try unplugging as many of the other devices as you can (they will automatically reconnect online after you plug them back in), factory reset the mini, and go through the setup process again. It should hopefully work.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Vispian,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2017","Update: 2017-04-05
The WeMo switch continues to work well for the most part. IFTTT and Google Assistant integration continue to work well also. I wanted to expand on my comment about the App based indication of On/Off being incorrect. This is using Android, I cannot say what the results on iOS are.

Wemo Android App: Always correct when it says the switch is on or off.
Wemo Android WIDGET: Sometimes correct when it says the switch is on or off.
Google Assistant: Always correct when it says the switch is on or off.

The issue seems to be only with the Widgets. Since the switch can be turned on or off so many ways; Wemo App, Wemo Widget, a dozen different ways via IFTTT, Google Assistant, Alexa...), it seems the Widgets do not get updated. Here's an example. My Wemo switch named ""Hallway Light"" is OFF. I ask Google Assistant to turn it on, ""OK Google, turn hallway light on"". Google Assistant says it will, and the light comes on. If I now look at the Android Widget, the widget continues to show the switch as being in the OFF state. If I open the WEMO App, it will connect with each of your WEMO devices and correctly display their current state. It will also update the Widgets so they, at least for the moment, also indicate the correct state. Not a major issue really, just an annoyance making the widgets untrustable, pity as they would be really useful otherwise.

There was a firmware update posted, this is good - shows Belkin is actively updating these. The update went without issue and the switch updated itself, very good. My Wemo Insight (different product, not reviewed here) has failed to update 4 times in a row though, it seems it just will not complete the update.

Original Review:
Works great, easy to setup and the IFTTT integration is excellent. Haven't used the iOS app, but the Android App and widgets work smoothly. There are lots of ways to control WeMo, I've used just a few; WeMo App, Google Assistant, IFTTT with various triggers such as Google Assistant, weather, email, NEST Protect. Here lies the only real issue I've found. The WeMo app and widgets display the status of the switch, on or off. This status is often not correct. For example, if I turn the switch ON with the Wemo app, the app shows the switch as being ON. So far so good. Now, if I turn the switch OFF using Google Assistant, ""Ok Google, turn off basement light"", Google turns off the switch, awesome. The Wemo app and widgets still show the Wemo switch as being ON, even though it is actually off. That means I cannot trust the app to show me the correct status. That's minor actually, not a big deal - and that's the only issue I've had so far. Except for that, Wemo looks like a great system.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Joey,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2020","I purchased my Wemo back in December of 2018. At that time I wanted to make my home more ""smart"" but did not have the budget to do so. I got this little guy as a way to hold myself over until I could invest into something more.

I was disappointed from the start. The thing with Wemo products is the fact you have to use their app to run the equipment. My disappointment was not from the product, but from the Wemo app support. Back in 2018, the app was constantly crashing, struggling to pair with the Wemo product, and made it difficult to use. It got thrown in a drawer, with little likelihood to be used for some time.

Fast forward to May 31, 2020. I move into a new place in May, and I decide to setup my ""smart"" home products again. I have a couple Philips Hue Light Bulbs. Those work no problem. I then try to set up this Wemo, thinking ""no way there are still problems with the app.... It's 2020"".

I download the app. I open the app and become excited. It looks like the app has been improved. Then I get to a screen that says ""Create New Account / Log In"". I look all around for the option to skip the account creation, since I had not done that before, and I only have one product so I don't really want to create an account. No option.

So I have to make an account. After spending 15 minutes (not exaggerating) creating 2 accounts with different emails and passwords, I am having the same issues and I'm frustrated. The passwords will not save when I create the accounts. I call their support team at 7:42pm. After a 9 minute phone call, we are able to follow specific steps to create the account. I say thanks for helping me set this up, I'm pretty tech savvy so I can probably add the device. Thanks for your help.

At 8:02, I call support again. Now that I have an account and I'm in the app, I realize that my Wemo device is not linking to my account. So I can setup the Wemo in their app, but I CAN'T USE IT because it won't pair to the account WEMO MADE ME CREATE. I have had it now. I do everything I can think of, from resetting the router to deleting the app, to switching to a different account, to resetting up the Wemo. All while I'm on hold with customer support for 26 minutes (never got through to someone). I hang up, frustrated and defeated.

I turn to Google and begin trying to find an answer. I come across post after post on Reddit and other forum sites, all with similar, yet different problems with Wemo than what I am facing. This seems to be a new issue no one has had. I try again to reset the app, re-setup the Wemo, etc. Nothing is working.

At 8:56 pm, I call customer support again. I'm on hold, but not for 26 minutes (thankfully), and I talk with someone. She has me do the same steps I have already done and what do you know, it doesn't solve the problem. This time our conversation is 23 minutes and I'm left with the answer ""We will have someone call you in 24-48 hours with an answer"".

The next day I walk by the Wemo, still plugged into the wall. I am frustrated and let out a sigh. I go to the Wemo app and click on Wemo Community. There's a post from Wemo called ""Issues After Wemo update"". I begin to scroll through the comments and there are so many problems being mentioned. Then I find this post. ""I had to download Yonomi to use my Wemo's because they can make a better app for Wemo's products than Wemo can!""

I download Yonomi and not joking, within 30 sections I am able to turn my Wemo On and Off, the simple functions I was hoping the Wemo app would be able to do.

If you made it this far, congrats. I hope what you got from this rant is that I don't want you to end up like me - spending 100 minutes (1 hour 40 minutes) trying to get my Wemo device to work, only to discover there is a 3rd party app made by another company that not only works better than the Wemo app that I am told to use, but took me 30 seconds to setup, as opposed to endless steps with the Wemo app.

Save your money. Don't buy this product. Invest in something that is quality from someone other than Wemo or Belkin.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Marie,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2017","For what it is and does, the Wemo Mini Smart Plug is a great device. I have no complaints and recommend it for smart home use or even something as simple as a timer or standalone appliance or light controller.

Overview:

The Wemo mini is easy to set up, use and integrates well with other smart home devices such as Alexa and Google Assistant for voice control and Nest for device sync. Unlike some other smart home devices, the mini does not require a hub. Using the mobile app you can easily control from anywhere, expand or modify your Wemo devices to control your lights and appliances.

I really like the form factor. Unlike many similar devices, the mini allows two devices to be plugged into the same outlet.

I really got tired of dealing with individual plugin timers that sometimes work or sometimes didn't or that had very limited capabilities. You can schedule the mini in whatever way you need, you can sync them, stagger them or make them work randomly. Much better than a better than a than a standalone timer. It even works with Nest. You can sync Nest with the mini for automatic home/away control. Try doing that with a standalone wall plug timer.

WiFi Connectivity:

This is a non issue based on my personal experiences. I did have a small problem on one occasion to connect with Wi-Fi, but this was due to the placement of the Wemo Mini behind a steel table leg which interfered with the wireless signal. After moving the table momentarily while initially connecting to the Wi-Fi router, things worked fine afterward.

IFTTT Integration:

You can even expand your uses by using readily available IFTTT apps or by writing your own which is easy and doesn't require any programming knowledge.

Star Rating:

The only reason, I didn't rate the Mini Smart plug a five is it's cost. However, you can sometimes find these discounted so if you plan to get several, I suggest that you look for one of these purchasing opportunities. I purchased each of mine by waiting for one of these discount events.

Owner Observations:

While you can control lights with the Mini Smart plug, I would recommend you determine what you want to use it for before before purchasing as there may be better alternatives especially if you're considering to use for primarily controlling lights. You may want to consider purchasing something like a Hue light kit depending on how many lights you plan. If you plan to limit your light control to a single light or multiple lamps connected to a strip, then go with the Mini. I highly recommend using the Mini for non-lighting functions and to control other devices.",4.0 out of 5 stars
WellDressedBookwormDad,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2023","I had these smart plugs for a few years and they worked fairly OK with my Amazon Echo device… once I could actually get them working, that is. The version I had required me to download the app which never seems to have been updated. Linking them into my home’s Wi-Fi always took forever, it did not seem to be quick or easy at all. If I had an hour or so to spare doing this, then eventually it would work and I could get the plugs paired up with my Echo device and then they would work just fine until the next power surge or loss of signal or whatever, in which case I would have to go through the whole process again. The last time this happened I just couldn’t get them to connect to my Wi-Fi, so they have been consigned to the trashcan and I am going to buy a different product now.

And as an aside, this is not an issue with my Wi-Fi or Internet. I always pay top dollar for the fastest Internet possible because I work from home. Everything else in my house connected to Wi-Fi works just fine.

I can’t give them one star because they do actually work. But I can’t give them more than three stars, because it takes them forever to work, and as I mentioned above, now they have stopped working.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Prime member,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2017","I started with Wemo Smart Plug(bigger version) in Dec 2016 and was fairly happy with its basic functionality but always thought if it could be smaller so it won't block the other socket. I then came across Wemo mini Smart Plug and bought one. The initial setup was a bit longer as it took 15 minutes and multiple iterations to detect and connect to my Wifi network even though I was in the same room where the Wifi router was. And I have a high-end router from ASUS (RT‑AC87R Wireless‑AC2400). So I was a bit disappointed about how long it took to connect
However once connected, it works like a charm both from Wemo App from my iPhone 6S as well as from Alexa. Once initial setup was done, it automatically prompted and downloaded the latest firmware updates. I'm very happy I did buy them that I added two more. I didn't go for TP-Link or similar smart switches only because it is easy to manage all 3 Smart Plugs in one Wemo App than having to maintain two or three different Apps.
Perhaps Belkin/Wemo should work on improving the setup time and hope to see a stable connection to my Wifi network. I recommend this to anyone looking for a smart-home.

Update 07/06/2017: I purchased one more Wemo product, the WiFi Dimmer switch. It took 10 minutes for wiring the Wemo WiFi Dimmer switch. However, the initial setup took more than 2 hours where the Wemo App was having a lot of difficulties finding and connecting to my WiFi network even though I was in the same room where the WiFi router was located. It was really frustrating when the App asked me to calibrate the Dimmer brightness setting for each iteration.
One or two times it did find and connect to my WiFi network but later got stuck when detecting the Wemo device. Then I figured out the reason Wemo App got confused was due to the existing Wemo smart devices already connected (4 mini plugs and 1 Light switch). I disconnected all existing Wemo devices from the outlet and had only the new Dimmer switch hooked up and thus time the Wemo App could connect to my WiFi network and detect the device quickly.
Once connected the Dimmer switch worked nicely. Belkin technical R&D team should really fix this frustrating setup issue. Hence I knocked down one star. I knew this setup problem so I didn’t give up and return the switch as faulty. I’m sure many would have already returned thinking the device is defective.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jason P,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2017","The Mini Smart Plug's are perfectly sized (height-wise) to be able to plug 2 into a typical 2 outlet receptacle - 1 above the other. That's really nice! They seem a little wider than they'd need to be. It would be nice it they were, at maximum, the width of the wall plate. It should serve the purposes of most users/use-cases. I wish I could control my WEMO devices via a web browser -- and not just an app on my phone. I think it would be easier to program schedules via a web browser. The app is functional but, even as a tech guy, I'm not able to program things super fast through the app. I also wish WEMO had some (OOTB) integration with Synology's NAS and Surveillance Station. (I have seen some backwards ways to integrating the two.)

Setup of the WEMO SWITCH devices is a breeze! Simply plug your WEMO DEVICE into a power outlet and plug your device into the WEMO. Then, hop onto your Smartphone, download the WEMO app, connect your phone to WEMO’s temporary Wi-Fi, follow the prompts, and BAM, your WEMO is setup. You should give the WEMO a descriptive name to identify it from any other WEMO devices you may have – or purchase later when you see how helpful they are!

I have 4 WEMO devices (2 Mini Smart Plugs and 2 Insight Switches - the latter I've had for over a year). I originally bought the Insight Switches for Christmas lights. I chose the Insight Switches, in particular, because I wanted to see how much electricity my Christmas Light displays were pulling and costing me throughout the season. This was successful.

A more recent use for the WeMo devices is to control several heating devices for our HEDGEHOG's cage. We have 2 WEMO INSIGHT SWITCHES – 1 for the heating pad and 1 for the heat lamp – that allow us to turn the heating pad and heat lamp on and off from anywhere in the world! We’re able to determine when to turn on or off the heat because we have a camera setup in Harvey’s cage that also captures the current temperature of the cage. We specifically use the INSIGHT SWITCHES because I'm very concerned for our hedgehog's well being and, while I'm sure WEMO Smart Plug's are working when the ""green light"" is on in the App, I'd rather see ENERGY USAGE in real time via the INSIGHT SWITCH to KNOW that the heating pad and heat lamp are actually FUNCTIONAL and heating Harvey.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Mr. Arthur Matthews,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2018","I had two of these switches that worked very well and then I purchased a third. In trying to install it on the Wemo app it would not install. In fact I deleted my app and started to see if that would fix it. A mistake as now all three wemo mini switches failed to work ! A call to support (who are very good and based in the Philipines) determined that the firmware was out of date on my old wemo switches. These were updated and still no joy. The new wemo was returned to Amazon as faulty and replaced (super service). The new wemo arrives and I contact support for another attempt at getting these wemo’s installed. After well over an hour of resetting the switches and deleting and reinstalling apps on both an iPad and iPhone still no joy. So I was upgraded to higher support who would call the next day. Next day and after creating a WiFi hotspot and upgrading the firmware ,the switches would install when connected to this WiFi hotspot that was created on my PC, however the wemo switches would still not install using my router WiFi ! It was suggested that I use another password on my router but I explained that I had numerous devices attached and didn’t really want to change my password, after all it had worked well with my old wemo switches! After some discussion and this was after over two hours approx on a support call I was asked about my password. When I explained it contained a symbol I was told the wemo switch WOULD NOT connect to a router password that contained a symbol !!! (my old switches prior to firmware update had worked to this password !!). The support agent (who was very patient and helpful) then arranged for a support call to me the following day at 9am and if not called that day, a call for the following day at 9am to see if there was a workaround for my password. No calls were ever received ! So frustrated was I after all these hours of support that culminated in finding the culprit was my password would need changing, I ended up changing it and reconfiguring my multiple devices. Having spent hours and determined to resolve this issue I feel Belkin/Wemo should give me a medal.

All good to this point. 2nd attempt try and succeed in installing WeMo app on my Nexus 10 my favorite go to toy for last several years. App installs no issues. Appears to work but does not allow me to install the WeMo mini plugs. Hangs up at the point of connecting to my router. Time for tech support. Round and round we go. Support is nice but does not go beyond my own attempts at installation. Finally decide all lost unless my wife's phone will work. LG phone and Nexus 10 are a bust. Netgear WNR2000V3 known to work with WeMo which is the router I am using. Round 2. Have wife's Motorola Razor HD and app installs along with devices in first try. Both new mini plugs setup and working. Then I checked Nexus 10 and both devices are setup correctly in it too out of the blue. Can control them with Alexa once it is setup for new WeMo devices. All working together. All working in harmony after 9 hours of my kind of playing around and pushing the boundaries. Tech's love to toy around new toys. Now I have control of 2 outlets in my basement without out stepping a foot on the stairs down to them. Motorola Razor HD, Nexus 10 , and Alexa app all controlling 2 WeMo mini plugins.

You can setup a schedule using the Nexus 10 but it will work some days and others it does not work at all. Not sure what is going on. Setup a schedule using Wife's Motorola phone and it appears to be working just fine. Will repost if things change..
Wife's phone scheduling is working great. One thing is that you should avoid using names like room one, light one, and fan one if using Alexa App. The one seem to cause issues with Alexa knowing which decided to turn on.

D. Pellegrini,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2017","So far, so good. Out of the box setup was a little buggy. You are supposed to plug it in to any plug (I suggest you plug it in somewhere easy to get to while you are doing setup) - and when the light flashes white and amber - go to your cellphone, connect to its private wifi network - then load and run the app on your phone - which connects and steps you through setup - which is very brief (name the switch and connect to wifi).

I set up two of these. The first one hung twice trying to get it to connect - after some unplugging and re-plugging - and starting/restarting the app I finally got it to connect - entered my wifi info and we were away. It then did a firmware update for a couple of minutes and now seems to work like a champ.

The second one seemed to realize that I already entered my wifi criteria and skipped that step - nice touch.

I bought one of these to set a more complex timer for a collection of old cellphones I have on chargers. I only want them to charge 3 days a week, on off peak hours. It was easy to setup that schedule, and it seems to be working well so far. I will update this review if anything changes over time.

NOTE: These seem to work fine when away from the house as well - you don't have to have your phone on the same wifi network to use them.

UPDATE [26 March 2017] - Just added a third and switch to the house - and what a royal hassle - but still worth it for me in the end. Must have had to close/reopen the app and plug/unplug this thing more than 5 times before the setup stuck. I think it was working itself through multiple Firmware updates - perhaps why it was more bumpy this time around. I ended up annoyed - and walked away to do other things for perhaps 30-60 minutes. It seems to have sorted itself out in that time.

Another oddity - with 3 switches on my home network now - sometimes one or two of them won't come up as available when my phone is on our local wifi - but then suddenly do become available if turn off wifi, run over cellular and refresh. YMMV

Despite the somewhat poor / unstable implementation, I am essentially using these as advanced timer/switches - and they seem to work flawlessly for this. In a pinch you can USUALLY connect to them from afar to manually turn things on and off - but if this feature is critical to you, be warned - these are a little flaky.

FINAL UPDATE [27 May 2017] - We just upgraded to a Mesh wifi router system - and now all of my switches show up on wifi and when away. Our older router + access point was apparently part of the problem.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Richard H,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2018","I purchased two of the WeMo Mini Smart Plugs and initially they connected and worked well with my 6+ year old router. A few weeks ago I updated my router for improved performance and security. I have about two dozen smart devices in my home and I was able to connect all of them to my new router with little fuss, that is, with the exception of the two WeMo Smart Plugs. I worked for hours doing research and doing troubleshooting with success. I called WeMo (Belkin) Tech Support who spent a 1-2 hours with me on the phone. When the plugs didn't work using my phone as a hot spot to eliminate the new router it was determined that both devices were defective. Given an RMA # I paid the postage to return the devices for new ones. When the replacements arrived I still wasn't able to get them to connect to my Wi-Fi router. I sent an email with my case number to support explaining that the problems I was experiencing. They called me back in a timely manner and we spent two hours on the phone doing troubleshooting. We were able to get the WeMos connected using my phone as a Mobile Hotspot and was even able to do a firmware update. Still no luck connecting with my Wi-Fi router. I understand this will be escalated but after spending so many hours without any results I am pretty soured on the devices. Tech Support was pretty good although a bit difficult to understand but the product is a disappointment. I have much cheaper smart plugs from another OEM that have always worked well and easily migrated to the new router using their app; just selected the new router, entered the password and was done. I do not recommend these smart plugs.

Update 2/15/2018: So WeMo Tech Support quickly responded to my follow-up email about the problems I was having with the replacement devices. The problem had been escalated and it was determined that the reason the WeMo Minis couldn't connect to my WiFI was because there was a special character in the SSID of the router!!! The SSID was valid and posed no problems for any of the two dozen or so devices that use WiFi. I selected WeMo (Belkin) because I perceived them to be a big player and have had good experiences previously. I am astounded that any device they would produce would have such a basic and simple flaw that would prevent it from working. Moreover, even with the flaw, it should not take me hours on the phone with tech support before finding the problem. Apparently they were aware of the problem and working on a firmware update to fix it. So add that to the tech support script and include a notice in the packaging for the Mini. The problem is that it is inconceivable that something as simple as special (and permissible) characters in an otherwise valid SSID would not work properly. It speaks volumes about the lack of quality control and testing of their firmware. I'll keep these WeMos but no more Wemo/Belkin wireless products for me.

Another Update 2/15/2018: OK so I changed my SSID and did all of the other things WeMo support said needed to be done and the two Minis worked for a few minutes. When I took them upstairs to use them they would not connect!!! I brought the one I was trying to use and went through the whole setup process again 4-5 times and couldn't get the device to reconnect. I plugged in the second WeMo that was only in my pocket to go up and it wouldn't connect. Basically all I did was walk upstairs with it in my pocket, bring it back down and restarted the WeMo app. I am about beside myself about these things. I reset 4 Echo Dots, 2 Ecobee thermostats and 3 other smart switches in about 10 minutes before I got to trying to use the WeMos for the last hour!! I need to go reconnect everything else with the new SSID but I am done with the WeMos. They are garbage!!!! I might hang on to them to see if there is ever a firmware version that will actually work since I spent about $60 on them but then maybe not - need to sleep on it.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Entaka,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2019","::Update:: Used these for Christmas again - had to do setup again - same issues. Now trying to set them up again to use them for under cabinet lighting control and I am running out of patience. The UI / confirmation / HomeKit integration APPEARS better but both apps constantly tell me conflicting information about connection status - I can consistently get WeMo app to control the units eventually - but all I can accomplish is the devices showing up in homekit after multiple factory resets and updates. Look elsewhere for a HomeKit outlet - perhaps the new smaller ones are better - But i wont be investing.

TLDR - I picked one up on discount circa 15$. It worked - after some fiddling and updating - so I bought another - that one required more fiddling of a different degree but eventually worked. Mine are integrated with Homekit and function with Siri without issue.

The product would be 5 stars if the easy set up stuff worked right. Out of the box it seemed both of the ones I received were not updated to a firmware that was compatible with Homekit - one of them even gave me a ""uncertified homekit device"" or something if that nature, within the Homekit app - once updated - it was fine.

Connecting to a devices WiFi is not irregular for set up - Ring does the same thing (only ring does it 100x better). The issue is partly due to the devices only using 2.4ghz networks - which can be a crowded frequency already. One of the devices hung at the setup and kept erroring - until I put my phone directly next to the unit - then set up went fine and I was able to update and add it to Homekit - eventually.

The second one I installed kept saying ""maybe try a factory restore"" - I did not do that as the lights were still indicating correctly for setup. They both just took different degrees of closing apps, opening them, reconnecting to wifi, and eventually updating prior to using the ""easy setup"" homekit QR.

Setup needs to be done with the WeMo app so you can get to the point of updating the devices so they can work with Homekit. I am an electronics repair technician and CompTia certified PC tech with above average troubleshooting skills - and technological patience - if thats a thing. There is little in the way of comforting prompts along the setup - expect to spend some time assuming it is getting set up correctly if you make it to that point.

The device would be 5 stars at the price point I paid if the setup was actually straight forward - both devices had completely different issues getting setup - but work great now that they are. Something to note is the relay within them is also quite louder than I expected it to be - think motion detector light relay in the grocery store refrigerated section loud. Not that big of deal if you click it on and it stays on - but something to note as my Philips and Lutron Caseta stuff does not have any hardware sounds. Currently using them for a garland and my christmas tree and being able to turn them off when out of the house adds some peace of mind.

I cant speak to how these work with any other smart home system - but judging from the issue being the initial setup within the proprietary app - I would assume
functionality is the same across the ecosystems.

A. Schuhmann,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2020","TLTR: Great plugs, just don't ever change the name of your Wifi network ...

First, I love my Wemo smart plugs. I have them all over the house, 12 by now. They work great and are initially easy to set up ... until you change your WiFi network.
I got a new fast 5GHz internet connection. The Wemo mini unfortunately only supports 2.4 GHz ...
So I set up a 2.4 GHz network for the plugs, no problem, right? But wait, the 2.4 GHz network needs a new name. And this is where the trouble began. I had to reset each one of them. Now, the latest generation of Wemo mini has HomeKit codes. And you must scan this code to get anywhere. But the code is on the plug side of the Wemo mini, so to scan this code you must take the Wemo off the outlet. You cannot scan the code with the Wemo mini plugged in. And whenever you unplug it to scan ... guess what happens. It naturally loses connection and the setup fails. You also cannot set up this Wemo by just connecting to the network it creates, like you can with the older generations without HomeKit. The iPhone will not let you connect without trying to use the HomeKit setup ... The HomeKit code is also on the packaging they come in, but this doesn't help you when you have to reconnect them.
I ended up unplugging them, writing down the manual code for each one, using the setup button in the Wemo App to add the plug and typing the code in manually instead of scanning. Suffice to say that you have to set up from scratch and make sure you give it the same name again ... otherwise all your rules are useless.
Overall the reconnection of the Wemo minis with all the trial and error I went through cost me probably 2h and 5 years of my life. But once they are reconnected they work great again :D",4.0 out of 5 stars
C. Perry,"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2017","Overall the product is decent and delivers functionality based on the design. In general I consider myself rather savvy with regards to general computer knowledge and network configuration. I have my own custom network configuration at home with distinct wireless networks on various bands including separated guest network, etc. My current job is in the IT industry providing end user support. I only mention all of that for background purposes and whatever it is worth for credibility sake. Overall I would say the physical plug is good quality and fairly straightforward in terms of basic functions. Where the issues lie are really within the internal firmware and the associated software application.

The initial setup is where I experienced issues, as other reviewers have noted. Establishing a connection from the plug to the wireless network seemed to be the most problematic. It would occasionally fail to recognize any network in my home, I tried multiple both hidden and visible. Typically the software would indicate incorrect credentials and refused to establish a connection. I even returned the plug in exchange for another unit. That behaved in the same manner. I eventually was able to establish a connection through the software application but only after trying for an extended period. Unfortunately I cannot definitively say what steps were successful since I tried so many different paths. One thing I would mention is you may have to try repeatedly in the app, despite how frustrating.

I would also allow the app time to connect, it seems even if it indicates failure to connect, there were times it actually established a connection from the plug to the wireless network but gave a false feedback. Indicating it had failed to connect. In my opinion the software app needs some improvement and is not as robust as is needed for this type of product. The plug itself has worked fine ever since the setup was successfully completed. I have been able to use the app to control the plug, as well as integrate with Amazon Alexa for voice control.",4.0 out of 5 stars

It was very easy to set up: download the app, plug it in, connect directly to the device via WiFi, then open the app and it walks you through step by step and even updates the firmware on the device automatically. Setting up the Alexa skill was just as intuitive.
Then it worked just as expected.
The only problem I have with this type of device is that I'm finding that I don't really have an application for it, as almost nothing I own will turn on simply by applying power to it. Almost everything in my home has digital controls: my coffee pot requires that you press a button to turn on after it's plugged and it's digital controls so there's no way to leave it in the on position. Same with 2 tower fans I own, my crockpot, etc...
In fact the only thing I can think of it controlling is a simple lamp, but in my home the only 2 lamps we use are controlled by a wall switch, so that didn't quite work out either.... Just something to think about if you're considering a Smart Plug.
I'm sure it won't be long before Amazon (and other manufactures) start making appliances (fans, coffee pots, etc...) with this technology built in, then it will really be useful.
That said, it does work as described, so if you have an simple device that will turn on as soon as power is applied this could be useful.",4.0 out of 5 stars
David L.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2020","I purchased 2 older Wemo mini smart plugs in 2018. They were easy to set up and worked well, and their wi-fi had great range. So when I needed another smrt plug, I ordered another Wemo mini. This is a newer model, and setting it up using an iPhone requires use of Apple Home. I found the setup very difficult.

First, setup requires scanning a HomeKit code on the plug. The code is hidden when the Wemo is plugged into a wall. So you have to unplug the Wemo, scan the code, plug it back in, and wait for the Wemo to boot up. After repeating this process several times, I connected the Wemo to an extension cord, so I could scan the code while it was plugged in.

I tried to avoid using HomeKit by selecting the option in the Wemo iPhone app that is used for older plugs that don't support HomeKit. The instructions say to connect the iPhone to a separate wi-fi network that is created by the Wemo. As soon as I did that, the Wemo was recognized by my iPhone as a HomeKit device, and launched the Apple Home app to complete configuration. I was unable to configure the Wemo without using HomeKit.

Initially the configuration via HomeKit failed with a message ""This device is not compatible with your wi-fi network"". The self-help in the Wemo app suggested resetting the Wemo and trying again. That didn't help. A search of the web revealed that this error occurs when your house has separate wifi networks for 2.4ghz and 5 ghz, and your phone is connected to the 5ghz network. The Wemo only supports 2.4ghz, and your phone must also be connected to the 2.4ghz network for HomeKit configuration to work. Once I did that I was able to complete configuration of the Wemo. Unfortunately, the Wemo app was unable to see my newly configured plug, even though it was visible in the Home app. I did one more reset of the Wemo, deleted it from Home, reconfigured again, and this time is showed up in the Wemo app. All of this took a couple of hours, and was much more frustrating than it should be.

Once configured, the Wemo smart plug works great, just like the old ones. So I would give it 1 star for setup, and 5 stars for how it works after finally completing setup.",3.0 out of 5 stars
JO is my Name-O,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2018","I'm just getting into the whole connected home thing and so it was time to integrate a smart plug so I can control lighting around my house either by voice or via Alexa. I selected this Wemo over the other smart plugs for a couple of reasons: 1) It only takes up one plug on the outlet (larger smart plugs take up the entire outlet yet only provide for one outlet) and 2) It doesn't require a separate hub to work with either my phone or Alexa.

I purchased two and went to work setting them up around the house. One design flaw of all of these smart plugs, including this one, is that they plug in the front instead of the side, top or bottom. This makes the plug long a bit clunky to hide behind furniture. One way around this is to pair the plug with a Flat Plug extension cord to make things a little thinner if you're installing behind a piece of furniture.

Setup is simple. After you download the app, connect to the ad-hoc wifi to then connect the smart plug to your network. Then, simply name the plug and then associate it with Alexa. There's no separate hub that is required to make the lights work and the app doesn't carry a fee to use it. My favorite feature is ""Away Mode"", which allows the lights to turn on and off on schedule like an old fashioned timer. Also, unlike a timer, the switch can be bypassed by pressing the button on the outlet if talking to Alexa isn't opportune or your phone isn't nearby.

While I wouldn't hook something high wattage up to anything I couldn't personally monitor, I do trust this plug to turn the lights on and off in the house as requested without issue. With that being said, I'm ordering more plugs to expand the capability.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Drew's Reviews,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2021","I have been using SmartHome devices for over 10 years and have watched this category grow and change in incredible ways over that time. Many of the changes have been consumer driven while some have been manufacturer driven.

Nearly all SmartHome items work solely using 2.4 GHz. This signal travels farther (covering a larger area) but is not as fast (internet speed) as 5.0 GHz. This makes it perfectly suited for SmartHome applications. Nearly every WiFi router broadcasts in at minimum both of these frequencies. If you have the networks split, named different names, you’ll need to make sure your phone is connected to the 2.4 GHz network during setup.

In terms of this product I’ve absolutely loved it. Over the last few months I have thoroughly tested it and found that it has worked flawlessly. I have used WeMo brand outlets for years and have always found them solid, dependable Smart outlets. The app is well designed and the outlet is easy to setup and integrates well with all other devices.

This is an all around excellent product that I have had zero issues with and would definitely recommend.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The Wemo mini smart plug is the new product in the WeMo smart plug product line. With Wemo Mini, you can set worry-free schedules for you lights and appliances. Using the free Wemo app, you can schedule a lamp to turn on at sunset, or keep your house comfortable by scheduling a fan to turn on at noon. When you use 'Away Mode,' Wemo Mini will turn plugged-in lights on and off randomly to to create the illusion that you’re home even when you’re not. Featuring a sleek new form-factor that allows you to stack two Mini Smart Plugs in the same outlet, the WeMo Mini gives you control of your lights and small appliances whenever you want, wherever you choose, with tons of options for scheduling and automation. Paired with Amazon Alexa, you can control your lamps and appliances with just the power of your voice. When WeMo works with Nest Thermostat, you can set your lights to turn off automatically when you leave the house, and on when you get home again. No central hub or subscription is required.

The Wemo Mini Wi-Fi Smart Plug uses your existing home Wi-Fi network to provide wireless control of your lights and appliances. No subscription or hub is required: simply plug Wemo Mini into an electrical outlet, connect a device to the Smart Plug, and wirelessly control your device using a tablet or phone. Using the free Wemo app, you can turn your devices on and off and set worry-free schedules from anywhere in the world.

Our answers to the frequently asked questions below:

Can the switch control a ceiling fan?

Absolutely if the ceiling fan can be routed to the mini smart plug.

Jean Farmer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2017","Previous to this I've been using iHome smart plugs but have had issues in the past with iHome losing connection and having to unplug and replug them in. I decided to switch over to Wemo Smart Plugs instead when I wanted to add a few more outlets. What I like about them is that they are stackable, you can have multiple in an outlet. I mostly use these on power strips and not directly in an outlet but they still work the same depending on the direction your outlets go on the power strip. The setup was a breeze. I had it plugged in and on the network and Alexa controlled in under 5 minutes. Super simple. Getting a firmware update was also easy, the Wemo app on my phone took care of it all. The integration with Alexa (I use the Echo Dots around the house) was superb. It never fails to work and I appreciate that a great deal. I was lucky to get them on sale so the price was also unbeatable. All around I am exceedingly pleased with these smart plugs.

If you are using Alexa it is great, because you can setup as many groupings as you like and include whatever assortment of plugs you want. I have a grouping for ""first floor"" and ""downstairs"" both of which are the same grouping of outlets from the first floor of the house. I make multiple groups to try and account for whatever I think someone in the family will say when they are trying to control the lights or fans. My groupings include a mix of Wemo and iHome outlets and Alexa is perfectly fine with that and controls them just the same with zero delay. I love that. I can say turn off a single light or turn off the living room or turn off the first floor and it responds in a second or two and does what I asked. I could not be more pleased with how easy these work.

The Wemo smart plug has been super solid for me so I ordered another one to expand my control. I would recommend them. I've only had this brand for a month but so far zero issues and super easy to use. Set it and forget about it really.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Erik Noren,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2019","The setup process was error prone and took a lot of Googling to figure out that the first problem was that the plugs didn’t like WiFi passwords with special characters. My WiFi router has two bands so they’re on the low and now far less secure band while all my other devices are on the high band. This seems to cause trouble with the WeMo app which most of the time reports the plugs as unresponsive until I switch my WiFi to the same network and then there’s a small chance the plugs will get picked up.

I was able to add them to my Echo fairly easily once they were set up but they would go unresponsive randomly and now for weeks they haven’t been accessible at all through it. Connecting to Apple Home failed on one of the three plugs I set up and left the it in a state where the WeMo app thought it was connected but Apple Home didn’t list it. More Googling before I finally tried a full reset on the plug and set it up again and then it worked. Now the only app that works consistently is Apple Home and that still has glitches where the devices will be unresponsive for a bit and I have to wait for them to come back online to turn them on or off.

The button on the plug to turn toggle power manually is a nice fallback but the purpose of the plugs was to make less-accessible light fixtures more easily controllable. All this did was move the switch from the light itself to the outlet which is harder to reach. At this point the only reason I’m still using them is because I paid money for them and they do give me more flexibility when they’re working right and I have hope of a firmware update coming out to fix these issues (if I can get the WeMo app to notice them again in order to update them that is). If they stopped working altogether I don’t think I’d miss them or even replace them; I’d just be mad I spent money on them in the first place.",3.0 out of 5 stars
PicklePower,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2017","The Mini Smart Plug is awesome, when it works. I have sent 3 emails to the Wemo customer service with no response. In order for this plug to work I have to constantly un-plug device, forget it on my phone, then plug it back in and start the initial install for my phone to find it. The first initial install went very smoothly with no problems and I was up and running with-in minutes.
The next day came into the office and used my phone to turn the device on (I have a desk lamp plugged into it) the light came on, everything was fine. After about 2 hours the light turned off, and I noticed that the Wemo light was blinking, no color just the ""white"" light to let you know the product is working. I went through the trouble shooting suggestions and nothing worked. So I unplugged the Wemo plug and the light from that and plugged the Wemo back in. I had my phone forget the device and reinstalled the Wemo device and everything was fine, or so I thought. I turned off the light.
The next day when I went to turn the light on again the light on the Wemo was blinking White and the device was not found on my phone. So I sent an email to the company explaining the issue that I was having. I went through the steps again of unplugging, having my phone forget the Wemo and reinstall it again. Again, Wemo worked as it should, until I shut it off, the only way I could the stupid thing to work was to keep un-installing the Wemo. This has been on going since I bought this thing, I have sent no less than 3 emails to the company asking for at least a return email to give me the illusion that they cared. Nothing!! and still to this day if I want the stupid thing to work, I have to forget the device, maybe that is the way the company hints to the buyer as to how technical issues will be resolved, just forget that you bought the device.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Shane W.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2018","The Good:
The great thing about this is that you don't need to buy all these expensive hubs and the like in order for this thing to work. Originally, I thought hey, it's worth checking it out and seeing what it's like. The plan was to use this for a lamp that we normally turn on when away, but seeing how great it is and all the options and timers and so on... I was like why not set the lamp that my grandma turns on and off everyday from sunset until bedtime. She has limited mobility and it's hard for her reach the switch, so this is great!!! What's even better based on your location it will calculate when sunset is and would turn on the light automatically.

The app is very easy to use. (And I believe no internet connection is needed if you want to access it locally). With WiFi (no hubs or any extra devices needed), you can access from anywhere.

Also works with Apple Home and quite a few others.

The cons:
It was a little troublesome setting up the outlet with Apple Home. You have limited accessibility. But, the good thing is we have a 4th gen Apple TV which you can use as a hub for all the smart devices (you can also use an iPad that is usually home as a hub as well). The trouble of course was on Apple's restrictions rather than this device itself.

Tips:
If you're connecting this with Apple Home, make sure the devices (i.e. iPad, Apple TV, or Apple speaker) have the same iCloud login for set up. (My dad was logged into the Apple TV, hence the connectivity problem).

Using an Apple TV or iPad is not required, but if you have one might as well set it up. If set up via Apple Home with the extra at home Apple device serving as a hub, you can set rules for which devices to turn on and off depending on time of day, your location, when someone from the family arrives home, or when the last person leaves, the lights can be configured to turn on or off.

I only received it yesterday, so hopefully it will continue to work! I think it was worth the ""investment risk.""",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amz Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2023","Wanna know what’s great about this? You don’t have to use their app. It just pairs directly through HomeKit and over thread so no WiFi issues and no connectivity nonsense and needing to be on 2.4 or 5Ghz or whatever. This works well because Wemo has absolutely nothing to do with its functionality. They made something with technology that their users don’t have to interact with their software which makes this priceless. Their previous smart plugs, despite working with HomeKit as well, were so unbelievably terrible I had a hard time understanding how Belkin (a pretty well known company) was letting such garbage leave their factory.

This solves all of those problems because it just doesn’t rely on anything they make software wise. Or even hardware to be honest. This having Thread solves all the issues.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Vlad R,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2017","You don't realize how useful these devices can be until after you've formed certain habits and have grown to rely on the automation and other home control features. Currently, I control most of my lights, one small space heater and an electric teapot using the voice commands with Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. I've been using smart plugs from other brands before, but I've recently switched to WeMo for three main reasons: 1) IFTTT integration, 2) Google's ""Home Control"" and Amazon's Alexa ""Smart Home"" and 3) these plugs do not block the second outlet above or below it. The ability to control each plug using the voice command or Wemo's native App is nice, but in my experience I get the most out of these devices through various integration and automation. Here are a few examples:

> When motion is detected by my Oco2 camera in the main entry way, the hallway lights are turned on automatically. (Requires: WeMo Smart Plug, IFTTT, Oco2 camera)

> Every morning turn on the space heater in the bathroom and turn it off after 30 minutes (Requires: WeMo Smart Plug, WeMo App for scheduling)

> When my car's ignition is turned on in the parking lot by my apartment, turn off all lights, arm the alarm, turn on cameras (Requires: WeMo Smart Plug, IFTTT, AutoMatic Pro, Oco2 camera, Scout Alarm system)

With the Google Home control as well as Alexa smart home feature, I've create a group of lights called ""Living Room"". Using one simple ""Hey Google, turn on lving room"" command, I can turn them all on (and off) at once. (Same thing can be done with the Echo's Alexa command). Using the similar ""Alexa, turn on the teapot"" command, I can get my teapot to boil water just using my voice.

As time goes by, I'm sure I'll create even more automation ""recipes"". On the other hand I recently realized that I may rely on those too much, as one day when I had an outage with my internet service, I had to actually *gasp* walk up to the outlet and physically push its button. Perhaps it's a good thing; I could alway use some exercise.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Tim,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2017","Definitely a step up from the previous Wemo smart plug. Not only is it smaller making it able to be used in either the top or bottom of the outlet, but it seems to react faster. I have a smart plug that I purchased about 2-1/2 years ago and it frequently has issues updating the firmware. This new ""mini"" hasn't had those issues. As usual with Wemo stuff, the setup is quite painless using my Android phone (takes all of 4-5 minutes total, if even that).

Personally, I prefer the WiFi controlled outlets to Zigbee and z-wave ones. Probably because most of my other smart home devices are one of the two protocols and it's nice to balance things out. Ok, price is a factor... These are frequently a more reasonable price than the zigbee or z-wave versions.

Wemo is nice if you don't have a zigbee or z-wave hub because LOTS of other devices support it directly (like Alexa and IFTTT). I have SmartThings, and that's what I control all my Wemo devices with. Within the last few versions of SmartThings, Wemo devices became ""natively"" supported rather than requiring a ""labs"" SmartApp. Stability has much improved over the updates to SmartThings (not sure how much of that has been Wemo updates too), and I have had no issues with them in a very long time.

I do not use the Wemo rules to control my devices. Every time I've tried, something doesn't work right, so I only use the Wemo app to apply updates and add new devices. This is the reason for the 1 missing star. I wish these could automatically update themselves during non-peak hours.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Lloyd,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2020","I have several of these and they work well. I just wanted to highlight an issue I ran into when setting one of them up. I have two wireless networks in my home and by my mistake the one to which I was connected on my phone when I set up the Wemo wasn't the one I wanted it on. I spent a couple of hours following the steps for resetting the device with no success. It kept reverting to the wrong network no matter what I did, even though Wemo's support site says you should be able to assign it to a different network. I then had a 45-minute call with Wemo tech support. They also couldn't make it connect to the other network, and had me return it for replacement. I don't know if the problem was just this one unit, but I strongly suggest you make sure what network your phone or tablet is connected to when you set up the Wemo to avoid such a problem.

Although my dual wi-fi may not be common, I believe the same problem would have occurred with any change in the wi-fi setup; for example, installing a new router, maybe even simply renaming the existing networks. The setup apps for all my other smart devices show available wi-fi networks, which makes it easy to select the one you want and easy to change it to another one in the future. The Wemo app needs to do this, not select the network on its own and not have a simple way to change it to something else later.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"DGC, MO","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2019","I'm not a happy camper....The unit will not recognize my home network. None of the other wireless devices in my home have any problem. I have followed all the directions and compensatory actions provided with the plug, as well as reading through the comment section here for other tricks to try. Well, I've tried them all. In addition to the physical product not working, the software application is cumbersome. I have had to enter my email address no less than two dozen times, since each time you attempt to 'find' your network, you have to enter your email address. It is VERY frustrating to keep going through the same steps over and over with an unsatisfactory result... I question why Amazon would bundle this obviously lacking product with their Echo. It does not reflect well upon them. Another buyer warning, ""Buyer beware!!""
Update: I was contacted by customer service via email with further recommended actions. These did not work, so I answered back via email and they responded with a phone call. Final solution: Using my wife's phone to set up a hot spot, I updated the firmware on the Wemo device with my phone. Once updated, it was able to identify my wireless network. From there it was easily set up to work with Alexa. I've adjusted the rating from one star to four. I'm probably being gracious due to the hassle, but the overall function is what I was desiring and the technician was helpful and patient, proving a workable solution.",4.0 out of 5 stars
LogiP,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2019","UPDATE as of Jul 2019
After upgrading wifi routers (tri-band mimo) and new firmware releases for smart plug, decided to try again since it's good price point for HomeKit plug. Now changing review to 4 stars. Plug no longer seems to have same issues mentioned below and setup worked on first try. Interesting. Ordered a few more plugs so we'll see if this is fluke or change in quality. Fingers crossed.

-----Original Review----
Bought this as test switch to start migrating from Z-wave to Homekit. Would only connect when in direct line of sight with main router. I have access points all over house but it did not care for any of them. WeMo App vs Homekit setup was also not clear per instructions. Trial and error and resets finally did the job (hope you're techie!) Finally able to connect to network and switch worked. Moved switch to other room and replaced Z-wave device with switch. Connection was working off and on (more off than on), but stupid switch would NOT stop broadcasting wifi. Would be at home and phone would connect to stupid switch! Missed many things on phone that week plus other parts of network began to have issues where things would connect to stupid switch automatically. No amount of trouble shooting online (firmware update, power cycling, hard resets with specific setup, special network ip assignments, etc.) would prevent broadcasting by this stupid switch and having things connect to it. Finally gave up and had to return. Sad since it's good design and was good price. Will stick with Z-wave a little while longer.",4.0 out of 5 stars
D and R,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2018","I'm still sticking to my WeMo setup.. just not sure I'll invest more money in to the ecosystem. It's a great concept and remote control/timers is super convenient... WHEN IT WORKS.

New users may want to second guess themselves before going ""all-in"" on an IOT device. I own 7 WeMo devices: 2 dimmers, 3 switch, 4 plugs. Belkin support website was not super helpful. Hope these tips below help you out.

ISSUE 1: KRACK vulnerability firmware update
-This wreaked COMPLETE havoc on my WeMo setup. This *almost* made me rip out all the plugs and devices. It made remote control unusable.
-Plugs updated firmware across 2 weeks. I had to 'hard-reset' ALL DEVICES after each time update a single device updated.
-When going through setup, repeatedly got the infamous ""Password invalid"" when connecting to WiFi. It is NOT you. You are typing in the password correctly. I tried both Android and iOS phones to setup my devices. The solution? Try again in a couple hours. Magic.

ISSUE 2: Migrating to a new router and 'multicast nightmare'
After the KRACK debacle I got my setup stable again. Then, I had to replace my router. I haven't figured out which was responsible, but I had to reboot my router almost daily:
*HomeKit/AirPrint/Bonjour was usable for only an hour after a reboot
*WeMo App would always show as 'Not Connected' when connected to same WiFi. Sometimes work if I use over LTE-only.

How I Fixed:
- Belkin says ""Don't use same WiFi name. It's true, WeMo doesn't like same WiFi name from 2 different routers""
- On Asus Router:
--- Enable Enable IGMP Snooping for 2.4G and 5G wireless
--- Optimized for XBox / BG Protection
--- Set 2.4G 'Control Channel' to '11'

ISSUE 3: One of Wemo Mini Smart Plugs have died after 4 months. I used it for a water kettle rated at 1000w. The Smart Plug is supposed to handle 1800w. Going to have to reach out to Belkin support.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Richard S,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2017","These plug switches have been very frustrating. They work for a few days then stop showing up in the app (both the Android one and the iOS one!). Sometimes they seem to work great and other times, they don't, I can't figure out a pattern. It's not my wifi network, I have 4 commercial grade APs around my house in a full mesh so there's nowhere that I don't have a strong signal. We don't lose pwer either, so I don't know why they seem to fall off the network. There have been multiple firmware updates for them but it doesn't seem to have fixed the stability problems. I would probably return these if I could but I've had them too long. I have one behind my lizard cage to run the day time light, so to recover the switch and get it back on the network I have to move the cage, which isn't small! It's a pain in the butt to deal with, however the switch does seem to follow it's programming and turn on/off at the right times even when it shows as unavailable in the app, so it does seem to be doing the right things.

One other thing to note. If you use iOS with an iPad, the only app in the App Store is the phone version. There is no tablet version of the app. You can run the phone version but it will be on a phone sized screen (or 2x if you hit the enlarge button), but it won't rotate with the orientation of the tablet. It's fine if you have an iPhone (don't know about the X or other new high-res screens though). I use an Android phone (Note 8 running 7.1.1) and it mostly works, except when it shows the devices are not detected. This can happen with the Wemo light switch too, so I don't know if this is an App problem or a device (ioT) problem. Whatever it is, it sucks and is very frustrating. Tech support isn't any help either, so don't bank on them solving your problem unless you have a basic problem.

2/18/19: update - these things are so frustrating, I would not recommend them to anyone! A power outage hits us 2-3 times a year, we just had one, lasting 8 hours (a lot longer than the usual). Neither of the 2 Wemo Mini Smart plugs came back onto the network... the stupid orange flashing light of death. I had to perform the ""hold button and plug in"" reset to recover them.... again. They then wanted to do an upgrade and I started that and they died again... flashing orange light, no network connection. In case you think it's my network, I run a multi-AP network, using 4 Ubiquiti AP-AC devices with a dedicated controller. I've done a signal strength mapping around the house and these are well inside a strong signal area. They are not reliable.

5/15/19: I'm done with these. Had another power outage over the weekend (lasted 20 mins) and the one remaining until didn't come back online until I did a factory reset and had it rejoin my wireless network. I just don't understand how a company can sell such a junky product. I've ordered replacement Amazon smart plugs to replace all the Wemo plugs. Support on these it terrible and the product is unreliable. I'm not going to waste any more time with these. I've been running the Amazon plug in parallel and it hasn't had any of the same problems",1.0 out of 5 stars
Jordan R.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2019","I read one review that talks about needing to scan the barcode on the back to the plug AFTER you plug it in... that's totally correct, I don't understand how they expect you to do that unless you attach it to an extension cord or something with a low enough profile just for setup... I don't get it.

That said, I have purchased and tried all three of the primary available plugs for Homekit, I also use Alexa around the house so consistent dual-assistant compatibility is important to me. I can say that out of the three options, WeMo has been the most consistent by far. I also happen to have power flashes 2-3 times a week, and unlike my iHome plugs that I'm currently replacing, the WeMo tend to go back to their function without issue. I do understand how some feel the WeMo APP is clunky and unintuitive, but both Homekit and Alexa seem to understand where the plug is and what I want it to do even if WeMo doesn't seem sure, so other than setup I don't really bother with the App.

I should also note that I've been using the WeMo plugs (and switch for my porch lights) since Homekit required a bridge, so I've never bothered to stop using it. Additionally I have an Echo Plus in my setup which may help with connectivity and reliability.

After finally getting them all working fine, we noticed there were constant firmware updates EVERY SINGLE DAY. Well one update COMPLETELY TRASHED all of our Wemos!!!!!!!! Because after our power went out briefly today, none of the Wemos will connect to WiFi now!!! They are blinking red, and not detected in the app. So now HOW do we get a firmware fix if there is one, since they can't connect to WiFi?!? They are USELESS now!!! I wish I had all the money back that I spent on all 7 of these. They were too expensive to begin with!

UPDATE (1/28/17): Rating changed from 1 star to 3 stars. For original review, please read below. Here is my updated review.
After returning the first unit and receiving the second one, I found it was still a beast to set up. However, when it finally did connect to the wi-fii, and the firmware was updated, it worked and stayed connected! It has not experienced the disconnect issue that the last one had since successful firmware update. I am glad to see they presumably fixed the issue. So I give it 3 stars now since it was still very difficult to initially set up, and the app (only on certain devices) would not show the ""Hidden Network"" option. I had to use a tablet which was the only device
I had that actually showed that option in the app. But this new one works as expected now.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I have successfully set up and use FOUR (4) of the original v1 WeMo smart plugs. So my review is based on my extensive experience with these, as well as knowledge of networking (as an IT professional). I tried setting up this new style v2 WeMo plug and had nothing but issues. It just would not connect to our wi-fi. The same wi-fi the other WeMo plugs are connected and work great with. I tried setting it up right next to the router, so distance was not an issue. I tried multiple times resetting it to factory defaults, and re-entering the router SSID & password. Still that amber light kept blinking. I actually got it to connect one time after trying for about 3 hours. Then I get a popup in the app about a firmware update. OK, so I tell it to update, and BOOM, the thing gets stuck in the middle of updating. I let it go overnight, and the next morning it's still stuck, and now won't connect again. I'm sorry, but this v2 WeMo has MAJOR problems, and from reading reviews it doesn't appear that it's just mine. I ended up sending this back. I might decide to give it a try again at some point in the future after they iron all the bugs out, because I do like the size of this device. It fits nicely into the outlet and allows for another plug in the outlet above/below it. So for the asthetics I give it one star. Other than that, it was just a major fail for me. If do I buy another one, though, I will definitely update this review with my experience with that one.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Tan68,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2020","I chose WEMO because I respected the parent company. I bought my first plug this past spring and had difficulty setting it up. During the setup process, ""location"" was presented as an option. I opted out of providing my location. After quite a time passed, I realized I would not be able to complete set-up with location disabled. Why present me with an option I can not feasibly exercise? (by location, they mean GPS and not selection of time zone or ZIP Code) A few months later, I bought a second WEMO and during the set-up process learned that I must now create an account. An account is a new security feature. WEMO did allow me to opt out of email ads and does not yet require a phone number.

The WEMO plugs are fairly easy to add and set up. There is a click when the switch is turned on or off. It is very audible but isn't an annoying type of click... It is possible to turn the plug on using the hardware switch on the WEMO itself and then have it turn off after any pre-set period of time. Once set up with timers, they seem happy enough operating without the WEMO app being opened for weeks. Set them up, let them go. 4.5 stars for the hardware. 3.5 stars for the increased requirement to provide personal information to WEMO.",4.0 out of 5 stars
umeweall,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2017","I have had this nifty little device now, in operation, for a little over three weeks. I had no issues with configuration for my Wemo. I have likewise had no problem with WiFi connection problems (I do have a very good, not cheapo, wireless router ). I have my Wemo linked into my Alexa device, and I use voice commands to control them. I also use the Alexa app to control lights, when I am away from home. I have had no issues, in any aspect.

One item I will mention is that if you use a Wemo to control a light switch in a room, there could be a partial inconvenience. If the light that you are controlling is tied into a wall on/off switch, you lose control of the light from that wall switch. The only way to turn the light on then is by manually pushing the button on the switch, or telling Alexa (if you have Alexa ) to turn the light on, or finally by using the Wemo app. If you are using Alexa, and Alexa is not in the room, Alexa is gone when you shut the door. You are then left with a manual turn on of the light, or using the Wemo application on your phone. In a kid's room, this is an issue. Even in an adult's room, having to manually turn the light on, or grab your phone to turn the light on will get tiring after a while. If the wall plug with the Wemo device is behind something, that just leaves the phone to turn the light on. If your phone has a dead battery, oh well.... You need to thing about where you want your lights controlled, and what happens when the door to the room is shut, with occupants inside, who need to turn the light on/off from inside of their room. How do they do it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
cg,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2017","So far, so good! I've had my Wemo Mini Smart Plug for a few days now. It was easy to set up, and so far, has done exactly what I've told it to do.

I bought only the one plug just to test it out and see if it is truly a piece of technology that would work for me. It is plugged into an entryway wall socket and I've plugged a lamp into it. I've schedule the lamp to turn on and off at certain times during the weekdays to coincide with my morning and evening schedule. Before I get up in the morning, the light comes on so that I don't have to stumble around in the dark. About the time I leave for work, it turns itself off. Now I have one less thing to try and remember as I scramble out the door to work. In the evenings, it is scheduled to turn on around the usual time I arrive home from work, so that I don't have to stumble around in the dark when I get home either. And since it is easily programmable, I can change this setting as the days get longer.

So far, there are no ""cons"" to the device. I can control this one outlet using my smart phone, which I think will be helpful. For instance, if I get in bed without shutting the light off manually, then I can pick up my phone and shut it off remotely. Another ""pro"" is that the device really does only take up one socket, allowing me to continue using the second socket for whatever I need it for.

Do I plan on purchasing more? Yes. There are a couple more electrical devices that I would like to have remote control over. I'm also intrigued by the other Wemo wi-fi controlled products, especially the ones that replace regular light switches.",5.0 out of 5 stars
FON,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2018","I want to give you a full report so you don't waste your time. I'm a very technical person, I have installed Schlage Sense Smart Deadbolt, Chamberlain Garage Door Opener, LIFX Lights, Sonos One, and of course Amazom Echo Show and Spot in our home to name a few. I use an Orbi 2 Satelite Mesh System to run WiFi throughout our home. Our WiFi Strength is so strong I get a signal at the furthest distance from the Orbi way in my backyard I have an older Belkin WeMo Insight Switch Smart Plug which although was a little quirky setting it up and establishing a connection, I was able to get it to work eventually. It took a couple of times and resets but since then it has worked without any problems. Even if power is lost it reconnects again when the power returns.

NOT this Wemo Mini. I bought 2 of them and after 1 1/2 hours of trying I could not get either one of them to be recognized and connect to my WiFi Network. Yes, I did all of the trouble shooting you can imagine. I Reset them to the Factory Defaults, Deleted the Wemo App (iPhone Version - I'm using the iPhone 7 Plus with the most current OS) and reinstalled the App. I restarted my iPhone. I turned off Cellular Data, I plugged them into different outlets in my home, in fact 3 feet away from my Router and Orbi.... NOTHING. At first the set up seemed to be going smoothly, I found the device under my WiFi Settings, selected it and then went through the next steps in the Wemo App. I entered a name for the device, entered my email address as required, selected my WiFi Network and then nothing. It just keeps saying it's connecting but it never does. Sometimes at this point the App just quits.

I know how usless Belkin Tech Support is so I wouldn't even bother to call them, I'm more tech savvy then they are. But I did go to their Support Forum and YES these Wemo Mini Smart Plugs are plagued with issues. Mostly just like I'm experiencing. For the lucky few who actually finally got them to connect, after hours of trying, it wasn't for long. If power was lost they would not reconnect and the process had to be started all over again. For others they would not keep a connection, they'd work for a while and then stop. Some folks the device wouldn't even appear in the App. The list of issues went on and on.

Thre trouble shooting page on Belkins web site has a long list of things to do if you can't get them to work.. REALLY Belkin you know of the many issues and you can't fix the problem. Oh they will gladly take your information and get you to a ""Level 2 Specialist"" who know less then you do! Oh an apparently it has been noted on their web site that different production runs of the Wemo Mini will have differnt results. OMG!

Anyway, I sent these back to Amazon for a full refund. I hope I save some people from having to waste their time and the aggravation with a product that just does not work as it should, especially for what they cost! I once really like them but I'm done with Belkin!",1.0 out of 5 stars
pls,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2022","I got one of these to control an air condition that was located in a very inconvenient location. Getting to the Wemo required moving stuff around, getting a ladder and climbing up to it.

When I first got this smart plug, any short power failure would knock the Wemo off line and require a reset and redoing the setup procedure to recover it. I was climbing the ladder every few weeks. After several months of this, Wemo updated the firmware and greatly reduced this happening. I was now climbing the ladder 2-3 times a summer. Much better. That's where things stayed for a while.

This year I got a new Android phone and used the Android utility to transfer data to the new phone. It transferred the Wemo app, but when I ran the app, it showed the air conditioner Wemo as disabled.

I have a script on my Windows computer that can scan for active Wemo smart plugs and control thim. This found the Wemo and could control it.

The Wemo app has a function to scan for active Wemo devices and add them to the app. This function has never worked and didn't work this time. Wemo tech support told me to reset the smart plug and go through the setup process.

That was the end of my patience with the unreliable device. The next time I'm climbing the ladder it will be to replace the Wemo with something more reliable. I'm done with it.

In summary, this is a fine device if it is easy to reset and redo the setup as you will need to do so regularly. If doing this is difficult or you don't want to deal with the need to regularly recover the device, then this Wemo is definitely NOT RECOMMENDED. Get something else.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Deborah/Martin,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2019","I bought two of these, and they worked great so I bought three more. And then they quit working. The app can no longer find the devices. I'm a pretty tech-savvy guy, but I've spent literally hours scouring the forums for answers to all these questions: Why won't the firmware update when it tells me I need to, but spins and spins and spins? Why can't I reset a device they way Wemo says I ought to? Why does it tell me there's no internet when all my other devices say there is? I've reset devices, and uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times. By the way, when you do this, it tells you to update the firmware (see debacle above), and provides no way to back out of the update's endless, pointless loop of doom. They also recommend ridiculous fixes like reconfiguring routers, etc. WTF? Are you guys serious? I should have to be a wifi wizard to use what's supposed to be a consumer product.

My recommendation? Switch to TP-Link with the KASA app. It works great! I've got 7 or 8 devices going now and have never had a single issue. I've been holding off buying more because I foolishly convinced myself I could make the Wemo work. Why can TP-Link figure out what Belkin can't? But I'm done now. $150 goes into the trash tonight.

UPDATE 4-20
I contacted Belkin after they responded to my review. They scheduled a tech call and walked me through resetting the app. The call took 25 minutes, and the tech was very courteous. The fix is one I hadn't encountered online after endless searching: for Android, go to Settings - Apps - Wemo - Storage - Clear Data and reboot. I'm upgrading my rating from one star to 3.

Pete D,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2017","We recently purchased a new house which does not have overhead lighting in every room yet. We were constantly leaving on of the floor lamps on in our office and decided it was bet to purchase a timer like I had on the lights in my house when I was a kid. Timers were around $10, and this Wemo showed up in the list for $30. We decided to give it a try.

Setup was super easy, pretty much the same process as setting up an Echo. You are asked to download an app, plugin the Wemo, connect your wifi to the Wemo, and run through the setup process. After you run the install, the Switch works by either pressing the button on the unit or the button on the app. I then adjusted the timer and schedule functions to turn the light on automatically at the times that we use the Office.

Even with just these features, the Wemo was already beyond worth the money. However, I went on to open the Alexa app and have Alexa search for the Outlet, again a simple setup. After this quick setup, I can now tell Alexa to turn on or off the Office light and she instantly makes the change.

With Alexa and the timer running the light, I am now determined to automate the rest of my house. I will be purchasing several of these as well as a few wall switches to control the other rooms. This is truly a Gateway product to Full home automation.

Bonus: You can also Use IFTTT.com to set up rules to trigger the light to turn on based on other events happening such as getting an email or posting on Facebook, etc. The trigger works the other way too where you can actually log every time that the light is turned on in a spreadsheet.",5.0 out of 5 stars
P. Holt,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2019","If you're an Apple Home / HomeKit user, do not purchase WiFi devices (such as this one). WiFi devices *will absolutely* work, but are another level of setup. Apple HomeKit is clearly designed to favor Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices - such as those from Elgato. If you are used to the simplicity of iOS, consider yourself warned. :)

However, BLE honestly makes sense as with BLE, you are making a direct connection to the device whereas with WiFi you are working through a proxy. Same with Android, I'm sure, but I do not own any Android devices. The executive summary is to search out BLE devices instead of WiFi devices. BLE has a range of 100M which should suffice for > 98% of homes - even with electronic and structural interference. In short, BLE is the future for closed-circuit home devices.

Other than that - and after jumping through some hurdles (circa Q1 2019) that most will not be confident with - this device is solid with HomeKit. It works both local and remote (assuming you have an iPad / AppleTV that can act as a hub when remotely operating).

Ease of setting up this WiFi device with iOS (and probably any mobile OS): 1 star

Functionality: 5 stars

Reliability: 5 stars

Low maintenance? Look for BLE devices, which will become much more common. Low short-term price? Buy this and, after some frustration, be happy. My money will go toward BLE from here forward.

UPDATE: I own two of these and they have been flawless with HomeKit over the last three months. 2,400 sq ft main level with three Apple TVs on the network. Programmable on/off always works. No complaints. Would buy again. Review upgraded from 3 to 5 stars. Two thumbs up. :)",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jon H. Greenlee,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2017","I bought four (4) of these WeMo mini smart plugs together with a couple of Echo Dots. The Dots set up easy, but I could not get the WeMo plugs set up, even after a few hours spent with Belkin support and my ISP support and hours scouring the Internet and support articles trying to overcome the issue, so I returned them. (I’m a longtime Prime member and have made very very few returns of anything I’ve purchased from Amazon, but I’ve appreciated the ease of that process). The problem wasn’t with the plugs themselves, but seemingly with the WeMo app as it just would not progress when I tried to link the plugs to my home WiFi. I wasn’t happy.

I then tried a competing product, but that didn’t work either. A friend convinced me to give WeMo another try, so I did.

Long story short, after a lot of trial and error I finally figured out that the VPN on my iPhone 6 was apparently preventing the WeMo app from progressing any further than it did. After temporarily disabling the VPN, everything worked like it was supposed to, the setup was easy and easily linked to Alexa.

I am now a happy smart home owner, and I would have given this 5 stars for these smart plugs but for all the trouble I had initially that I had to figure out for myself. I hope this helps anyone who may experience any similar setup issues.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jeff White,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2017","Nice compact unit, working well so far. It would certainly be easy to install two of these in one wall outlet, as is clearly the intent. I bought this to compliment several other WeMo wall switches in my house, and to work with my Amazon Echo & Dot. Using this one for a master bedroom Himalayan salt lamp (i.e., night light for grown-ups); except in this instance I need the soft amber lighting to not assault my eyes when I first stumble out of bed in the a.m. (a gentle wake-up light), and to put it on a schedule that doesn't wake me on weekends (thanks 'Rules' function!). Price is reasonable, I paid ~$30. I am happy with my purchase. I will update my review if it fails.

One handy trick, the Alexa app lets you assign WeMo switches to multiple groups (including groups containing only ONE device); that means if your spouse or significant other consistently calls your device the wrong name (i.e. 'family room lamp', instead of 'living room lamp', or whatever...), just create a group with that 'wrong' name and select only the switch with the right name in that group. Now Alexa will now turn on the switch using either name without complaint; argument avoided & relationship saved!! (More of an Alexa smart-home skill tip than this switch in particular, but a recent discovery on my part that I really like.) For instance, at my house the 'Porch Lights' belong to a group called 'Pizza Lights'; the kids think it is funny and it helps them remember to turn on the porch lights when they order a pizza.

After posting my original review, I was contacted by ""Belkin Cares"". They informed me that the WeMo SHOULD work fine with eero network (or any other dual band router than supports 2.4Mhz). They ultimately connected me with Belkin Engineering. The Engineering team worked with me and it appeared I had a hardware problem. They promptly shipped me a replacement unit. It arrived and I had the same problems getting it to work. I was scratching my head. I walked through all the points of Wifi and Network connection on my iPad and iPhone. I got to the point of my iOS VPN software (Cloak) and verified it was turned off. As a test, I tried uninstalling the VPN app. I re-booted my iPhone, and tried the WeMo install. Voila - it worked!! I then re-installed my VPN software, and everything still works fine.

For a $35 device, I am VERY impressed with the support from Belkin. On my initial attempt at troubleshooting I was able to easily get through to their 800 #. However, when they proactively reached out (after I posted my original review), I was really impressed. I cam away feeling that ""Belkin Cares"" is not just a tag line, but part of their culture.

I was unable to get the Wemo Mini working with a eero network.

I spoke with eero customer support and they said that they support earlier versions of Wemo and had no reports of issues with the Wemo Mini.

Thomasdoc,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2018","After spending several hours trying to set this up, reading the forums etc., I finally realized what the key requirement is to set this up: You must make sure that the only network that the Wemo can find during set up is your 2.4Ghz home network. You must turn on Airplane mode (so that Wemo cannot connect to your cellular network), forget for the time being your 5Ghz network, and then the setup should work.
Essentially during setup, you are connecting your phone or tablet directly to your Wemo via WiFi, and then the Wemo gets the information from the app how to connect to your 2.4Ghz WiFi network and it tries to find your respective home Wifi network. I hope I got the sequence right. Anyhow, IF your cellular connection or 5Ghz is an option, the app will try to connect to your cellular network first, or to the 5Ghz network, which in turn gives the Wemo device the wrong info. And then set up will fail. Also make sure to give the app the correct password for your network. Because if you don't, or have a spelling error, the app won't tell you and you never know. This is what fixed the connection issues for me.
I think it is ridiculous that the setup is so flawed and that would be a reason for me to not get those. Let's see how they work in practice and I will report back later.

Rebecca G,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2017","I used this for a night light type of lamp in my son's room knowing I could plug the lamp in and it could turn off in a set amount of time. That said, the app is missing a couple rules that could've made it better for me and how I'm using it. First off, it has a timer rule that allows you to set the amount of time you want it on, ok great. Then there's another rule you can set to specify exactly what times you want it on, also great. Not great, these cannot be used in conjunction with each other. In my case, I want to use the set times to turn on the lamp for the same time every night (7:15-8), however, when we're running late and it's after 8, I'd like to turn on the lamp and then use the timer rule for it to be on for 30 minutes. If I select this, it disables the set time rule and I have to remember to set it back. It's not the end of the world, but still. I also don't like the fact that I NEED my phone to turn the lamp on and off since the plug is hidden behind a dresser.

Original Review

Bad me for not reading deep enough in the description that these are not Z-wave, nor are they Zigbee. Therefore, they do not work with Wink. These require you to install (yet another) app on your phone to setup. I did not want yet another app to install on my phone, or another hub, or another skill... and its my fault I didn't read too closely that it's not Z-Wave or Zigbee.

Why use Z-Wave or Zigbee? Because they work with so many smart home hubs as well as Alexa and Google. WiFi devices require you to install yet another resource-hungry app on your phone or another skill to Alexa or Google. WiFi devices like WeMo also only carry as far as your WiFi signal carries - thats it. Zigbee and Z-Wave devices talk to each other - sort of a ""mesh"" that pass along commands from one to another. In my house I have Zigbee devices that far outreach any of my four WiFi networks.

So how does this unit compare? Eh... slow start up compared to my Zigbee outlet. It took this WeMo about a minute after plugging it in to an outlet before it would start working. Compare that to about 15 seconds on my Zigbee outlet. Also, I can place my Zigbee outlet in the fringe areas of my WiFi networks and know it will work because it talks to the other Zigbee devices that are nearer to it. This WeMo does not play well on the 5ghz networks, and thus has a hard time getting commands from floors away.

It seems to work great line-of-sight and on the same floor as my WiFi router.

I like that it doesn't consume more than one outlet space in real estate on the outlet. The button is right there on the front, no searching the sides to turn the device on.

In all, I'm sure these WiFi devices are fine for those who do not have a complex smart home setup, rather they just want something simple, maybe a few devices and not much more. If you own a Wink Hub and need something Z-wave or Zigbee, don't stop here, keep moving along. Again, my own fault for not reading the description closely enough, however I think I have justified above why it deserves the ""It's okay"" rating.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2018","I am replacing my old X10 plugs with wifi/web app managed smart plugs. I read a good review of the Wemo mini, but didn't do much on-line research before I decided to buy one -- just one, to test it myself. If the price is in an acceptable range, that is the best way after all. Besides, I've always been a little wary of Belkin products. They sometimes just haven't worked very well for me in the past.

The packaging was waaay too big for the item itself. A real waste of cardboard! Come-on marketing. You can do better.

The installation instructions were simple enough - 6 steps in all, maybe the part about changing your wifi router to ""Wemo.Mini"" is a little confusing to a total non-geek (I've been doing computer stuff since before the first PC). Anyway, the sheet also includes a troubleshooting section on the back. Good thing! The Wemo app would not connect the Wemo mini to my dirt standard stock comcast Xfi wifi router (there must be millions of these around the country.) Then, after about 8 tries, just when I'm about to send it back, it connected for no apparent reason.

Moving on, I have read since that the app itself has an old tired interface, but I have an iPhone 7, so I'm used to old tired interfaces. No matter, it's simple enough. I was able to set up rules and they actually worked. That's really all I wanted...except... I also want remote access. It simply won't connect. I have studied on-line resources, opened ports on my router (which is BTW very clunky with XFi) to no avail. I have no intention of spending hours and hours figuring out how to do this -- I'll simply try another product for another US$30 - $40 and see if it works better. You hear that, Belkin?",3.0 out of 5 stars
The Reviewer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2017","Overall it is a good product and I would recommend it.

I originally bought it hoping to eliminate the use of a power strip as this plug has a narrower profile than the TP-link plug it replaced and doesn't cover both outlets. Even though it didn't accomplish the goal (due to the other item plugged into the outlet, which is no fault of the device), it is an attractive well designed switch that has more capabilities that the switch it replaced.

The Pros are:
1. Narrow profile that doesn't cover the second plug in the outlet.
2. Easy setup (Wemo outlets have a kind of unique setup where you have to select the outlet first in the wifi settings section of your phone before you can complete your install. However, as long as you follow the directions it seems pretty easy.)
3. Easy integration with IFTTT, Samsung Smartthings and Alexa.

The Cons are:
1. Doesn't work with Apple Homekit.
2. It seems to loose its device settings if the power is turned off for an extended period of time, which means that you then have to resetup the outlet again.

Ordinarily I would give it a five star, but for the lack of Homekit connectivity and the fact that it drops off the network if it looses power for a while I felt that I had to knock off a star. However, that being said, its probably one of the best smartplugs on the market right now.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Michelle,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2017","We got an Amazon Echo for Christmas and started toying with smarthome options. We haven't delved too far into the smart bulbs because they are so expensive and you have to buy the silly bridge things. So we figured we'd try out the plug options to control our main corner lamp in our living room as a stepping stone. This mini option being the newest thing on the market was a risk but it was also compact and easily added to our existing map of electronics and cords in the corner. If it failed we weren't out too much money and could return it if need be. However! This mini was SUPER easy to install, just plug it in, let it blink white and orange, tap on its wifi network, name it in the app on your smartphone, and connect it to your existing home wifi network, BOOM! Connected. Took me all of 45 seconds. Instructions were clear. And I added it to our Alexa smart devices in 20 seconds so even my 4 year old can control the lamp. Definitely will be buying more of these mini plugs for other outlets around the house.
Info that helps: the plug is less than 8-10ft from our router and 2-3 ft from Alexa. I sat right next to all 3 on our couch when programming. AND I bought this out of pocket, not a freebie :)
Edit:
After a year we bought a 2nd switch and added another floor lamp because we moved to a new home with no overhead light. I easily renamed our lamps to LR1 & LR2 in the wemo app. I had Alexa rediscover our wemo switches and she recognized the name switch. I created a fast group name of ""the lights"" and ""BOOM"" once again both lights turn on at the same time. This little switch is a life saver especially when you walk into a dark house carrying armfuls of groceries and a toddler.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Brent,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2019","WeMo plug is very simple to use. Easy to set up. Changing WiFi is the only pain. If you change your Wi-Fi password you'll have to go through each one update the password. Pretty quick but still pain. You can set routines, you can have something turned on at sunset or a certain time turn off at sun up or turn off at a certain time. You can pick the days a week that you want. You can also control it through your phone with a widget on your screen or app. I have about eight or nine of these in my home. Along with a couple let wall switches. I've been using WeMo for probably about 5 years now. Have not had any problems. Don't think I wish, that it had auto update. I use echo ecosystem. And I used Google ecosystem. It works on both. some things Alexa does better than Google and there's a lot more things that Google does better. But mainly use Google ecosystem over Alexa any day.

Overall I think it's an outstanding product and works absolutely flawless. I would definitely recommend getting one and picking it up I just always stick with the same brand instead of mix matching other brands into my system. I know other friends that have used other brands and mixed in with a bunch of different brands. What happens is you have all these different frequencies running it messes up your Wi-Fi speeds. So try to keep your products the same whatever you go with. Whether it's Philips hue WeMo stick to the same brands.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Glowplugv,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2017","I started to build a smart home around the Amazon Echo and needed smart plugs to control various lamps. I was only interested in devices that connect directly to Alexa not indirectly through a hub. I originally looked at the TP-link version of a mini smart plug, but after reading the 1 star views (highly recommended) and seeing several reports of electrical issues I switched to the Wemo version. Installation of the first plug took a few tries but it installed within 10 minutes of fussing with it. That plug went into a firmware upgrade that took awhile but required nothing from me. The remaining that I added were easily done as the app remembered the network password and then they asked permission to do the firmware upgrade too. Connecting to Alexa was simple as asking Alexa to scan for smart devices. She found the three installed plugs and their names and that was that. The Wemo app is very simple and for me the lights turn on/off almost simultaneously when I press the button in the app for a lamp. Of course I use Alexa most of the time but I wanted to state that because some reviews have complained about the slow performance of the app. I have them set up on an on/off schedule. I could have set them also to be on sunset to sunrise (you put in your location information). I also found I could turn them on and off during the scheduled window with no effect to the overall schedule programmed. I am very satisfied with them so far and expect to add more of them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amz631,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2021","A couple of years ago, I ordered several of these based on a favorable (non-Amazon) review. I have used them since then, but they don't work very well.

Pros: They do work and it is possible to integrate them with Alexa.

Cons: About every week, at least one of them ""forgets"" how to work. Most of the time I have to unplug the device, wait a bit (sometimes overnight) and plug it back in. Most of the time that works. About 10% of the time, I have to factory reset the plug and re-introduce it to the network. If I power down my router for any period of time, one or more will require the same reset process. Many months ago, a firmware update that should have been one on the app, required me to find an undocumented process on-line and then fiddle with every plug, multiple times, to get them all working again.

By comparison: I have two Amazon-branded plugs which I have also used for a long time. I plugged them in and forgot about them. They just worked. No setup. No weekly maintenance for lights that suddenly stopped working.

In my opinion, wemos are twitchy and hobbyist grade at best. However, every network is different, and it is possible these problems are to my network. I suppose it is also possible that these problems were corrected with more recently manufactured wemos, and it may not be fair to judge current production on older models. I can only speak for my experience.)",3.0 out of 5 stars
Ampazon,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2019","I purchased These to use with HomeKit. I bought 3 new ones (2nd gen) and 2 refurbished ones (1st gen). I will say that the HomeKit set up on the new ones was a little bit tricky but now that I have them all set up properly they work fantastic. They DO NOT completely reset when they lose power like numerous people have stated in old reviews. While that may have been an issue in the past, it is no longer an issue with the latest firmware updates. My recommendation for setting them up would be to install the Wemo app and set them up through the Wemo app 1st, then immediately update the firmware. Then factory reset it by unplugging it, holding down the power button on the front and plugging it back in until it shows a blinking white light. Then set it up for HomeKit. Also I would recommend only having one of these plugged in in your home at a time while setting them up so as you get one set up and working I would unplug Until you add the rest. I am using Google Wi-Fi mesh router system, so I cannot turn off the 5 GHz frequency Wi-Fi but it was not at issue at all for me which was another thing people have mentioned being a problem in the past that was likely fixed with the latest firmware. I will say I spent an hour trying to set up the first 2 initially (new 2nd gens) and it was quite frustrating but once I got the hang of it it was simple I really like these. There are a few points/steps during setup where it takes a few seconds and you need to be patient.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Claire & Nanami,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2019","These Wemo mini smart plugs are really easy to install. Install the Wemo app on your phone and you can start adding switches to it pretty easily. They make your regular electronic devices behave like smart home devices. You can use them for lamps, coffe pots, water boilers, etc. If you use them for your coffee pot, just make sure it is filled with water before you start it up.

I bought these for my lamps, and LED lights because I can use whatever lightbulb I want and still make my lamps smart. The switches don't use up much space when plugged on the wall, compared to the older ultra bulky version that would block any other electric plug. I upgraded to the mini switches because of that.

These switches integrate with Alexa, which is the main reason why I got them. You can give them names on your Alexa app and even group them by room. For example, I created a group in Alexa, called living room, which controls all the light switches in the living room. So turning the lights on is as easy as saying ""Alexa, living room lights on"". Another cool thing you can do is add them to an Alexa routine. For example, if you want to make sure all your lights are off before going to bed, you can create a routine where you say ""Alexa, good night"" and have Alexa turn off all groups of lights in your home.

If you don't have an amazon smart device or another compatible device for voice control. You can always use the Wemo app to control these switches.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Michael Head,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2018","So this is my 4th WEMO product and until yesterday a very happy customer. I have 2 older style wall outlets and one light switch. Easy setups and all work with Alexa. So yesterday I get my WEMO mini in the mail, plug in, go to the app to add, all goes well except the device never showed in the list of devices, did a restart, loaded again, same result. Off to customer service and downhill from there. After checking I have the latest app version, that the mini did not show up in the hardware list and then a 5 minute hold of elevator music - what were my options - delete and reinstall the app, the catch, some of my devices might not show up. True to fashion, I cleared the cache and data from the app (did not delete), and guess what - the WEMO mini showed up, but my 3 previous devices were gone. Get the 2 wall switches reloaded and then put back in my routines with Alexa. Regarding the wall switch, no luck in getting it added back, WiFi for the WEMO showed up, but for some reason my phone reverted back to my home WiFi. Here's the catcher, although the wall switch does not show as a device, Alexa still works with the wall switch - so until it stops I guess I don't care that its not listed. Based on this experience I have no plans to add any further WEMO devices to my house and have to start from scratch. Maybe you have a better experience than I did, but this was too much of a pain to add a wall switch",3.0 out of 5 stars
Nomiworld,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2018","I have six of these operating in my house at the entrance porch, front entrance room, master bedroom, living room, tv and guest bedroom. I love the ability to turn lights on and off remotely. I have lights on the timers every evening so that I never return to a dark house. I use the commands to turn on and off with Amazon Alexa. The best switch is the one I use at the front porch light where you can have it automatically turn on at 30 minutes before sunset until sunrise. Even with a time change, I will never have to adjust since the device knows the local sunrise and sunset times. This product is simple to install. Literally takes a minute or less except for the switch which required me to get my electrician to do it. I know it’s not difficult to put wires together for a switch, but I wanted to make sure it was done correctly. I have not tried the dimmer switch model but would like to try. It’s terrific having a smart home that I can simply light all my rooms in a moment remotely before I enter my home or put everything on a timer to do same. I can turn on and off remotely for my dog who will never be in the dark waiting for my return. I have a couple on timers inside to always give the appearance that the house is occupied. It’s a great device for sure especially if you own a voice comand device like Alexa or Google.

Hitome,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2017","I use this to restart my super fancy litter box, that sometimes likes to get stuck on its side while sifting. The cats really hate it when I'm gone all day, and the litter box is stuck! So I keep tabs on it with the security camera, and can operate the outlet from anywhere I can get a phone signal. My cats are thankful for that!

Downside! Sometimes the plug shuts itself off on its own! If it needs an update, or maybe it's just Thursday, it could randomly turn off sometimes. (Another reason why I have a camera watching it...) I haven't played with the scheduled settings though, so I could possibly remedy that by having scheduled on/off times. I am afraid to have it reset while a cat is in there though... LOL!
It will also not turn back on if there has been a power outtage, even after power has been restored. You'll have to push the button, or turn it back on in the app. (When you suddenly realize ""Oh no, the cat box is still off!"") Again, having a schedule programmed will probably remedy this issue.

I'm thinking of ordering another one, to have my modem/router on a schedule. Not only would it be useful for ""No internet after 10pm!"" but nobody can hack an offline router either. Though it means I'll be using my cameras less...",4.0 out of 5 stars
Reiggin Hilderbrand,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2018","I purchased two of these plugs because they were on sale with the Echos I bought at the same time. The price was great but the support isn't. I learned quickly that the plugs lose connection easily and often. After googling around for a bit, I discovered others that have the same issue. Turns out, it's a problem with the Alexa skill. And thankfully, I was able to disable the skill and use the native Alexa support to operate the plugs. But this shouldn't be the case and you would think that Wemo would address this issue. However, they do not and finding the support was nearly impossible.

And that lack of support by Wemo is more frustrating than the device issues themselves. I opened a support ticket with Wemo and it was immediately closed. I got an email basically saying, ""Thanks, we've closed your ticket."" No one reached out to me and nothing was done to address my concerns/questions.

So for those that have similar issues, just know that you need to disable/remove the Wemo skill from the Alexa app. From there, ask Alexa to discover your devices and she'll find the plug(s) without the skill being installed. Since doing this, I haven't had any issues.

Beyond the flaky (e.g. completely absent) support by Wemo, the installation of the plugs felt more complicated than other smart devices I've installed. I bought an outdoor plug by Meross around the same time and it was simple (and reliable) to set up with Alexa. The Wemo app is far less intuitive and nothing is really explained for you. The small instructions with the plug are okay but it just feels like it could have been simpler.

I also installed the device with my HomeKit (Apple) services to be able to use with Siri. That's where most of the complications with the app and directions came from. It just wasn't explained well and it took some trial and error to figure out. Once I got it set up, it works fine with HomeKit and Siri, though.

At full price, these certainly aren't worth it. I would have returned them and went with the AmazonBasics plugs instead if it wasn't for the great deal I got on them. That's the reason for the two stars instead of a one star -- the price was right. But my final advice is to shop around and, if you do choose to go with the Wemo devices, be ready to do some troubleshooting -- on your own and with no support from Wemo.",2.0 out of 5 stars
MKES,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2019","I've had a number of these running in an Apple HomeKit environment. Initial setup is simple. I added via HomeKit directly and then used the Wemo APP for firmware updates. All scheduling/naming was executed in HomeKit, not the Wemo APP. These have worked flawlessly for many months now. Would recommend this smart plug for HomeKit users.

There are the occasional wifi drops (""not responding"" in HomeKit) common amongst these types of accessories, but these plugs have consistently come back online without any effort. And this issues is happening less and less as time goes on and updates are applied.

Couple of things that could be better. There's an audible ""click"" sound when these turn on/off. If you're used to other bulbs and/or in-wall dimmers operating in complete silence, this will be a noticeable difference and a step down in overall experience. Also, it would be better if there was an outlet on the side instead of the front. Wall outlets are often behind furniture or curtains. The thickness of the outlet added to the lamp plug itself requires a decent amount of space in front of the outlet. Ideally this device would have a front AND side plug so the user could choose the best option for their situation.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Charles C.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2017","This 'Smart Plug' is great if you know HOW to use it and WHAT to use it for...the problem with this Smart Plug is it only works they way you probably want/envision if you pair with DUMB APPLIANCES. Example: If you pair it with a TV - yes you can turn off the TV from your phone (which by the way why wouldn't you just use the remote?!) or by voice such as Amazon Alexa. However, if you ask Alexa to turn the TV back on it will simply return the power the TV but as far as switching the TV display ON that is something different entirely. With that said this type of device works best with SIMPLE on/off appliances i.e. a fan, a lamp, Christmas lights you still have up in the summer, a cotton candy machine that you bought for yourself and live with the guilt of every single day save for the 5 minutes you treat yourself to some freshly spun cotton candy...The phone app is relatively simple to navigate and the pairing with Alexa is just as simple as well.

I do not know for how long, but tonight, I can turn my stereo on and off with the power of my voice. We'll see how it goes, but for now, Wemo wouldn't be my first choice in mini smart plugs.

Update 7/19 AM: I would hesitate to purchase again. It would no longer respond to the Echo commands this morning. I reset the device, but it still wouldn't show up as an available network. I walked away for a while, and came back to find it finally showed up. Took a few times to connect to the device, but when I did, it told me I might not be connected to the internet (I was) and it wouldn't connect to my home network router. I'll try it again later, when I'm less frustrated, but this is not something I'd buy again. I'll follow up . . .

Original review:
Actually ordered by mistake. It looked like the TP-LINK that I already have, so I jumped in to get another. I tried to cancel the order when I realized my mistake. But, it came today, so I figured I'd give it a try.

Setup was easy, both connecting to the network and to Echo took 5 minutes, tops. I have this one controlling the stereo. On/off works just as it should.

So, I have another smart device app on my phone, but Wemo didn't make me create an account.

It's really nice to be able to hit a button, as I walk to the bedroom at night, to turn it off rather than strain my reach to turn the little knob thing.

Setup was pretty easy, just follow the instructions. The only thing that scared me was when I setup my wife's phone. I had assumed I would be making an account to log into. But when I went to setup my wife's account, all I had to do was open the WeMo app and our device showed up ready for her to manipulate, no login necessary. The reason this worries me, is because it basically means that anyone who knows we have WeMo products, and knows that they can just access the app on our wifi, can get access to our home devices.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2019","My expectations were low after reading all the negative reviews. This is my first smart home device, setup using an Android phone. I did what the flyer in the box said: Download app, plug in Wemo mini and wait for lights to do their thing, plugged a lamp in (leave the lamp on) and opened the Wemo app to complete setup. There was a important point during setup about disabling Google Location Wi-Fi Scanning on Android. After that I had control of the lamp from the app. Perhaps keeping my phone updated helped. Using att router. Getting Alexa to work was a bit more involved. There is a good tutorial on tomzguide how to connect a Wemo Switch smart plug to Alexa. I followed it and it also worked. Now I can turn the lamp on and off a la startrek. I setup under Automation an away rule. I did not realize it will not turn on when the rule time is reached, it will turn on after a random period of time when the rule begins. I got impatient, sitting in the dark so I asked Alexa to turn the lamp on. Evidently this disables the rule. I then manually disabled the rule until I need it and setup a schedule rule for convenience. I did not live through a power outage with this thing, so I can't speak of its recovery. I wonder for the folks that have several smart devices if it would complicate setup? Perhaps temporarily unplugging the other devices while setting up the new one would help?",5.0 out of 5 stars
M S T,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2017","I wanted a device where I didn't have to spend 10 seconds crawling under my desk hunting for the cord every day when I get home.

What I get is a device where I spend 10 seconds watching an enormous amount of initialization activity take place on the Wemo app on my phone. (Every time the app opens in fact, it takes 7-10 seconds on my phone to load.) Arguably a downgrade. I was under the impression that sending the signal over the network, not opening the app would have been the bottleneck. Overall, considering how much time in this day and age we spend waiting for our phones to load things, I think that this solution needs to be more well thought out.

I have tried this UI both on an LG g4 and Google Pixel 2 - it has the same glitches, so it is not a phone hardware issue.

Additionally: WeMo should add support for Google Assistant (and Siri and Alexa?) to control this device not from devices, but from phones. This would also get rid of the lost 10 seconds I spend waiting for my phone's UI.

Edit: I have updated this review after 2 months and deducted 2 stars.

First off, on Android you can set widgets on your home screen, but they are laughably terrible in terms of whether they work. They theoretically show you at a glance whether the light is on or off, but it is stupidly inaccurate and shows a false state. I have a higher rate of success just opening the app. So that was a headache.

But even in the app, devices just straight up don't work. They don't load and clicking on them leads not to any type of troubleshooting help, but an insulting option to ""hide the disabled device until it shows up again"". Why the hell would I want to do that when I need it to be working? So I can, you know, toggle it? What a dissappointment.

It's a dream come true about 20% of the time. Down from my expectations of 100%. I have a package of 2 of these plugs to give my dad for his birthday next week (which comes on Thanksgiving) -- I am seriously considering shipping these back and finding something else.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Typically, I have to plug them in at night, when I get home from work, and then it's the last thing that I unplug before bed. Last Christmas, every night ended with me walking to bed and seeing the lights still on outside. It's a first world problem, but I knew it would be great to ask Alexa to turn them off. I can see this as a great option for crockpot cooking too. One frustration for me is the recipes usually ask for 4-6 hours of cooking. I work 8 hours and I'm gone close to 10 hours a day. I will now be able to turn it on, from anywhere, 4 or 6 hours from when I'm home. Or even cook it for 4 hours, turn it off from anywhere, then turn it back on for 30mins-1hr before I return.

If the other cord has even a small transformer (looks like slightly oversized plug), it will not fit in the same outlet as this smart plug. However, if it is a simple small two or three prong plug, it will fit. Two of the WEMO smart plugs will fit in same outlet. They were fairly easy to set up on Android cell phone (Samsung). I had hoped they could be controlled by voice, but it does not look like they are voice activated. I did successfully set up on phone so I just click the app, then click the device I want to turn on or off. I also set up a schedule to randomly turn lights on and off. I park my car in garage, so potential intruders will not know if I am home or not. With lights going on and off at odd times, I feel like my house is less of a target.

Steve H,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2017","Overall I'm really not happy with this product. I'll say the few good parts about it were how easy it was to install, upgrade the firmware, and I like the design and the fact that I can use two on a single outlet. I think it's fair to give it 2 stars for that.

The whole reason I purchased these was so that I could use them with voice-activated smart device like Alexa. In order for that to work, I need them to stay connected to the WiFi network. Every few hours they would just randomly disconnect and they wouldn't reconnect until I unplugged them and plugged them back in. I went to their support forums and found that some people had some workarounds, like setting my WiFi channel statically and turning off my 5GHz network, but neither of them solved the problem. Oh and I rebooted all involved devices several times. Even if all that did solve the problem, I don't want to buy a product that tells me how I need to set up my network. If you claim to have WiFi enabled device, then you should make sure it easily works with WiFi.

A note about my WiFi setup: it's super simple. I have a single wireless access point and the two WeMo minis are less than 20ft away on the same floor and in the same room, both plugged into the same outlet. I have not done anything fancy with my access point. I have a Nest Thermostat, Nest Protect, a Nest indoor camera, an Echo Dot as well as a couple phones and an iPad all connected to the WiFi. I don't feel like that should be enough devices to cause significant interference.

The other reason why I find this silly is because after connecting the Dot and the Nest products they just worked. I've never had a problem with network connectivity. So that means someone solved this problem years ago and I don't see why this should be one for the Minis.

I fully admit I never called their support, but I'm pretty sure they're working as intended since I have two that are behaving identically and terribly.

Overall I would not recommend this product unless you're very network savvy and like playing around with that stuff.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Erin,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2020","FINAL REVIEW: It's December 2021, and after having more and more problems with my WEMO app and Google Home's integration, I decided I was done with WEMO. My husband bought six TP-Link Kasa plugs instead, and we love those because they work, the app works with more features, and we were able to get these installed and working in about five minutes each. At this point, I wouldn't recommend WEMO to anyone.

ORIGINAL REVIEW (READ FURTHER FOR FIRST UPDATE): I've ordered three of these so far, one in 2017, two during the same week in 2020. The one in 2017 has been good in some ways but a hassle in others. The installation was a pain, and on my iPhone 7, I still have to refresh the app home page multiple times to find out how many minutes are left on the timers (my husband's iPhone 6 doesn't have this problem). But overall, I've found this plug helpful for turning lamps on and off during vacations and scheduling lights to turn on and off at Christmas. In fact, I've had just two larger issues with the 2017 WEMO; the first was easily resolved by a helpful employee at WEMO, and the other was resolved (as were other problems with devices that connect to wifi) when we moved to our new house and switched Internet providers.

That said, I bought two more WEMO plugs this past week. They are now installed and working well so far. But the two plugs I received this week were in different packaging (neither frustration-free, I assure you), and the one that appears to be newer was a 3-minute install compared to the one that appears to be older, which required a lot more jumping through hoops. I would recommend these regardless because after you get them set up, they are worth the money.

One more thing: I connected these switches to Alexa for the first time this afternoon. I had to Google how to do it, but in about 7 minutes, I had all three switches successfully connected.

ETA (10/23/2020): I woke up this morning to all non-working WEMO switches. In about an hour, I was able to fix all but one by myself. I waited on hold about 10 minutes before reaching someone who spent another hour helping me reset, unlink, and reassociate the last switch, but then we reintegrated with Google Home and had to reset, unlink, and reassociate all of them all over again. I still like these, but if I were buying such a product again, I'd research for a better option and, if I found one, I would likely buy that instead. The process is just a little too tedious, especially when you have a lot of other tasks on your plate.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Jim Clack,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2018","Actually a decent e-switch but suffers from one simple problem: The instructions leave out one very important step. The quick-start sheet says nothing about it. The online instructions say nothing about it. The FAQs/help say nothing about it. They would need half as many support people and would get much better feedback if they would fix their instructions. The missing step? ""Make sure that Mobile Data is turned off on all nearby mobile devices before configuring.""
When I installed my first Wemo I had to wait on hold over an hour to get through to somebody that told me this. The next Wemo installed fine because I remembered this. When I bought my third one, I remembered that there was a missing step but I couldn't recall what it was. I spent another hour on the phone with them, this time trying a lot of different things, before I realized that my wife's phone was nearby and had mobile data turned on. Ugh. Their support guy told me that this is a really common issue and most of their support calls that last more than a minute or two are due to this. Why can't they fix their instructions? Just add it to the troubleshooting steps online.
There's another setup caveat as well... Once it connects to your Wifi you have less than a minute to complete the next step or it will disconnect. In many cases that is not enough time so you might have to try it a few times to get it done quickly enough.

Jehjeh,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2019","I have several Wemo switches and all work really well. There is a feature for turning the device on and off at different times that can be set up through the ""Rules"" section of the app. There is also a feature that allows you to have the switch go on and/or off at sunrise or sunset with the option of a time interval before or after sunrise or sunset. This means that you don't have to change the timer as the days get longer or shorter.

Just thought I'd layout the instructions as it can be confusing for some people.

On the iPhone app there is a way to choose from 15 to 45 minutes before or after sunrise or sunset and also a custom time setting for each. It knows when sunrise or sunset is based on the internet feed that the device is getting through your IP and it will tell you what that time is during step 6 of the following instructions.

1. Start by going to “Rules” tap the plus symbol in the top right corner.
2. Tap schedule.
3. Tap desired switch. (i.e. “Living Room”)
4. Under “When” tap “On”.
5. Tap the sun symbol in the top right corner.
6. Tap sunrise.
7. Tap desired time. (i.e. exactly, 15m before, 15m after)
8. Tap sunset.
9. Tap desired time. (i.e. exactly, 15m before, 15m after)
10. Tap days desired. (tap each day you want this to occur)
11. Tap “Done”
12. Tap “Save”",5.0 out of 5 stars
T. Miller,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2017","These dropped to $20 on Black Friday, so I figured I'd give them a try and bought two. I'm so glad I did and actually wish I had bought more! I have a Google Home Mini and a Chromecast, but my TV is so old that it's not only not ""smart,"" but it doesn't even CEC, so I can't use my Chromecast to turn it on and off. I plugged the TV into one of these smart plugs, and now I can turn it on and off with my voice through Home and from anywhere with the app. I used the other plug to make a lamp turn on at sunset at off at 11:30 pm. I turn all my lights off when I leave for work in the morning, so my pets end up hanging out in the dark for a while this time of year and I walk into a dark home when I get back from work. Not anymore! The plugs were easy to set up and the app is really easy to use. I linked it to my Nest, so I can use Nest's home/away functionality to control the plugs if I want. I have relatively new LED bulbs throughout my house, so I'm reluctant to replace them with smart bulbs. These plugs allow me to accomplish a lot of what I'd get from smart bulbs for my lamps, which is good enough for me. ALSO, the fact that this doesn't block the other plug in the outlet is pretty awesome.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Don Draper,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2017","This smart switch is a neat way to control your electric devices via your phone, tablet, or through voice with Alexa. There is a decorative salt lamp in my living room that has the switch on the cord. Before Wemo Mini I had to get down on my knees and reach under a table to turn it on. Now all I have to do is say ""Alexa, Salt Lamp On"" and she turns it on for me!

The compact size leaves the other outlet accessible which is an improvement from the original Wemo plug design. Another feature that is nice about the Wemo switches is that you can control your lights from anywhere even when you are not at home. The app has an ""Away Mode"" which automatically runs a lights on/lights off program to give your house that lived-in look when you are away. There is also a scheduler function to turn lights on and off at preset times. If you have a Nest thermostat you can link it, but I don't have one of those so I can't comment.

The setup was kind of tricky. I had to fiddle with my WiFi settings to get it to connect to the network, but I eventually found the right combination of settings to make it work. I would advise going to the Belkin Wemo website and reading their troubleshooting documents if you have difficulty getting it setup. So far so good. I may get one or two more to control other devices around the house.

UPDATE 12/09/18

I feel like it is my duty as an informed consumer to warn buyers before they purchase these switches. They are great when they work, but they don't always work. App and firmware updates sometimes mess up the connections and the troubleshooting process is time consuming. I've been living with them for 9 months. I'm invested in this brand with a total of 6 switches so I'm kind of stuck. If I had it to do over again, I would go with a different brand.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Onur Baykal,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2018","This is a great plug, great quality. The app however, especially on Android, has been an extremely unpleasant experience to say the least. The app tends to ""forget"" that the plug exists on my home network. Other times, remote access will just disable itself, and refuse to re-enable, causing issues with the Google Assistant. Let's also not forget to mention that the app is the slowest of the the three smart home apps that I've had to deal with, I mean seriously, the Android App will have you asking questions all over, as to why it was designed/implemented the way it was. Lastly, be aware that the wemo app has no login (username/password) system in place, in contrast to some other systems and their apps. Yes it may be a bit more convenient to not have to deal with another user account, but I've noticed that having a user account in place tends to result in greater reliability for smart plugs, especially when it comes to remote access control for the plugs/switches. Also, I'm here only referring to the wemo Android App, I've read some other accounts by others, of having greater success and reliability through the ios app, so I'd best suggest buying it and trying out to see how it works out for you.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Bob Loblaw,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2017","When Wemo plugs work, they're fine. And they're also probably the most widely supported plug on the market today, which is nice. What's especially nice about *this* plug, compared to their original model, is its size. While not as small as those offered by competitors (e.g., iHome), it's certainly much nicer than the original Wemo.

Why 2 stars? Because, in my experience, Wemo makes some of the most hit-and-miss smart products out there. I just spent 3 hours trying to get this brand new plug working, following each and every bit of advice offered by their techs, by fellow consumers on message boards, etc. This is on top of me literally spending days upon days trying to get my two original Wemo plugs to consistently work

In fact, that's why I bought this one. I hoped that perhaps a brand new plug would ""simply work"", and I could throw the others in a closet or something, never to have to curse at them again. Well, my hopes were dashed...

The two originals actually did seem to work fine, until a recent firmware update. From that point out, no amount of resetting, reinstalling of apps, changing wifi channels or rebooting the router, assigning fixed IP addresses, disabling cellular signals, moving plugs right next to routers, unplugging every single Wemo device save the one I'm trying to install, trying IOS then Android, etc. would reliably work. Most fixes did nothing. When they did work, the fix was fleeting. Wemos appear and disappear, whether using the Wemo app or my Amazon Echos.

The fix that worked for me? Switching my phones/tablets to my wifi's Guest network, and installing Wemo there. Fwiw, my router: Asus RT-AC88U. It played nicely w/ my two original switches until the firmware update. (Coincidence? No idea. I just know that that's when my troubles began.) I can't use my Echos to control my Wemos anymore, since they're on different networks (Guest vs. Main network). But at least they're not totally useless anymore.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Kevin,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2017","Received 2 WeMo minis yesterday. First one setup with no problems. Second one was a real pain. It kept saying connection failed no matter where I put the plug. Close to the router, away from it, near my phone, away from it, didn't matter. After about 10 times of cycling between the Wemo Wi-Fi and my home Wi-Fi I unplugged the first Wemo and tried again, this time it connected and setup with no problem. Plugged the first one back in and there they both were. Then it said there was a firmware upgrade required. The second Wemo took an hour to upgrade, the first ran all night and still showed upgrading. Out of frustration I turned off the app and unplugged the Wemo, plugged it into the outlet where the other was plugged in and started the app. Then it showed upgrade complete. Go figure! Then there are the rules. These are the applets the app uses to turn off and on at specified times. When I click on the rules icon it takes about 5 minutes of ""looking for rules"" before it comes up. So after the second Wemo had upgraded I set a rule for it to come on at 5:45 am. When I got up this morning it wasn't on and when I looked in the rule it wasn't there . On the plus side Alexa had no problem detecting both plugs. The Wemo is a great concept and I like that the Mini is small enough that you can still use the other outlet, but they still have some work to do to make it really user friendly and frustration free.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Stevie,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2017","Update November 2020. I have had constant disconnects with these for months, or even though I've paired with both Google Assistant and Alexa, they disassociate and neither assistant can control the devices. I don't have this issue with any other devices integrated with my digital assistants. Wemo pushes software updates, but the performance doesn't get any better. It started off good but has become a really unreliable and frustrating product. I had three of these and am down to only using one, and will likely get rid of that one, too. I had issues with both Eero and Nest as my routers and no other client issues, so it's not a router issue.

Really handy devices. I have three of them, and use them to remotely turn lamps on and off while I'm gone. They have generally worked very well with few issues, though they can take a long time to connect to WIFI after setup or rebooting. I did have issues with one of them not staying connected but since I unplugged and rebooted it, it's been fine. Setup is pretty easy. These do not block the second outlet for normal-sized plugs. You can toggle devices on and off through the app, both on your LAN and remotely, or physically press the button on the device. They have stayed connected to my wifi now for a couple weeks ago with no unintended disconnects.

You can also set it up to work with voice commands via Google Home units or Amazon Echo & Alexa, and I have found that works very well. The Google app seems more reliable; I have had a few occasions where Alexa could not communicate with the device where Google could. Overall, very happy with the performance. You can also set up timers and schedules, so it's pretty versatile.

The app also has an option to associate it with your Nest account so you can make thermostat changes within the WEMO app, or sync your switches to shut off when the thermostat is in ""away"" mode. I haven't tried that yet, though.",2.0 out of 5 stars
JC,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2017","Well, so far, so good. I have been skeptical about trying this kind of product because there are just so many out there and so many brands that it was difficult to narrow down. I mainly bought this one because it only blocks one outlet and you don't need an additional hub or controller device to go with it. Just plug it in the wall, plug in your lamp/fan/whatever and go. The app is free and straightforward to use and so far we have no issues with it working.

My only disappointment, and it is not with the product exactly, is that it would be much more useful to have a wi-fi lightbulb or light switch (although the switch would not be plug and go) as it is hard to find a single lamp that I need to turn on when out of the room or not at home. I can see this being useful in an apartment maybe but in a house, it just doesn't do enough to make me excited. I wish there were high watt bulbs out there that could standalone (sans hub) and then you could put them in more meaningful places.

Overall, no complaints, product works reliably as advertised at a not too expensive cost. Works with Alexa and other such devices. Does not monitor energy usage. Unlike many other reviewers, we had no issue with setup, done in a few minutes and has been working fine for months.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Evan Upshall,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2018","The Wemo Mini Smart Plugs are a fantastic evolution from their predecessors. Unlike the older versions and similar models, these neatly fit in just one socket and leave the bottom or top open for use without obstructing the space. It is easy enough to install, too - especially if you already have experience with other WiFi enabled devices and Echo/Alexa. The app is fairly intuitive; setting up schedules is a breeze.

My only complaint (or suggestion, really) is that the app should allow you to ""batch"" multiple plugs together with the Echo/Alexa - similar to how you can batch them in the app's scheduling feature. I purchased a bunch of these, and two of them are specifically controlling lamps at either end of a couch. However, each lamp is plugged into a different Wemo Smart Plug, so I have to name them separately and call out two commands to Alexa, instead of just one. It would be far more fluid to just say ""Alexa, turn on the living room lamps"" than ""Alexa, turn on the living room lamp"" and ""Alexa, turn on living room lamp 2"". It's possible this feature is accessible and I've just missed it, but I don't think that's the case. Happy to be wrong on that, though.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Andrea,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2017","I just bought and installed. I received it from a prime day purchase and I'm totally sold already! My installation was very simple and straight forward. I added an Alexa dot and this product in one quick sitting. No issue whatsoever. Here is the problem and the reason for 4 rather than 5 stars. I want more. I want them in each room for lights, I want one on my coffee maker so when I wake up - u guessed it ""alexa turn on the coffee""!! I bought a Dot for my mother and want one or two of these for her to speak her lights on. BUT the retail price is so high. I see the regular price. There are NO multi packs and how can the average person buy 4 or 5?? Other sellers are half price or sell two for about this price. So sorry WEMO I won't be outfitting my house and moms with more.

Edit - I signed on and WEMO price is $5 off - so not a huge improvement but one that makes it a little less costly so at least they are listening. A multipack of 2, 3, or 4 at a discounted rate would be a good option too. How do you make your house smart without multiples.

Jesse Reviews Stuff,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2017","Pros:

-Their smaller size makes them much sleeker, I never notice them
-Incredibly easy to set up
-Work very well, never have connection issues
-I honestly don't notice them. I just say ""Hey Google, do this"" and it happens, I forget these are the reason why
-Work with Google Home via IFTTT

Cons:

-Can't think of any for me, but some people may not like having something sticking out from their wall socket at all times

There's not much more for me to say here. When I bought these I was just starting to experiment with home automation. They worked so well I started researching every other possible thing I could buy, and interestingly ultimately decided that for now these were enough and just what I needed. In the future I may invest more into lighting switches.

I would say if you can get over the fact that these will add an inch or so of depth to your wall socket, and have been considering them, please go ahead and buy them. You absolutely will not regret it!

Bonus: I had originally bought some TP-Link smart plugs as well. I did really like those (they worked great, and their minis were SUPER sleek), but at the time they did not have IFTTT support meaning I couldn't use them with Google Home. I believe they do work with Amazon products, so I'd check those out as another option if you use Amazon products.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Neil,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2017","I offer a conditional apology for my previous one star review. I attempted to install Wemo originally with the app on my Nexus 6 phone, which led to the initial one star review. Subsequently I've gotten an iPad. Installation of the Wemo app on my iPad solved all my problems. Works like a charm setting it up was a breeze, etc., etc., etc. The only remaining question is why it doesn't work with android. I have seen the same happen with other apps I have both on android and iPad. Night and day difference.

OLD REVIEW-
I bought this as a test hoping I could use it for a hard to reach place for my living room lights. So far I've used up several hours messing around with router passwords, resetting, plugging in and plugging out, online searches for ""wemo won't this"" and ""wemo won't that"", uninstalling app, reinstalling app, all with zero effect.

At this point I've spent $35.00 on something that has soft ware so poorly designed it's impossible to use. In a way I'm glad it didn't work initially. Many of the online comments indicate wemos stopped working or worked sporadically. This would be a disaster for the lighting system I plan on installing.

Beware the internet of things!

p.s. I will set the device aside for a while and try reinstalling at a later date to see if the firmware has been updated to ""workable"".",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kingsley Elbert,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2017","I have two homes. My second home is in an area with unreliable commercial power. Recent storms brought frequently interrupted power. My security lights on mechanical timers were about 12 hours off schedule. I had to make an unplanned drive of 3 hours round trip just to reset them. WeMo Mini Smart Plugs have solved that problem. However, another problem has surfaced. I set the routers at each of my homes to the same SSID and password, so that whenever I show up, my electronics hook right up. The problem is that when I am present at one home network, I can only view the WeMos on that network and not the WeMos at the other home. If I switch off the WIFI on the smartphone and use my cellular data, I see them all. If I go to a remote WIFI, such as Starbucks, I can see them all. I assume that If I changed the SSID's to unique names, this would not be a problem, but I have not tested it. Here is the good news, I am especially happy with Belkin's telephone technical help line. When I phoned to resolve this issue, the line was immediately answered by a live technician. I explained the problem and she provided the answers. If there is any down side, it is that there is not any PC access, only the smartphone app. I love them, wonderful devices.

Paul D Harjung,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2017","Not bad but leaves room for improvement. The plug on the back should be able to rotate so I can place this in a vertical or horizontal position. The plug should also be at one end of the switch, rather than the middle. The switch is so wide and takes up so much real estate that I was very limited on where I could place it.

It was very easy to set up initially. The app on the iPhone is intuitive and good. However, the ""away"" mode is completely random and can not be managed; it is either on or off. I would prefer the ability to set my own schedule. I really don't need my lights to come on at noon if I am away; but I would like to know that they came on at 5pm, 8pm and 10 pm (or similar). Unfortunately, when creating a manual rule you are limited to a single on/off time.

This is my first automation tool to work with Amazon echo. That functionality works well. I started with WeMo because it was less expensive and could be easily expanded.

Kit10,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2017","This is my third Wemo device. I have two light switches, and this Smart Plug. I've used the light switches for the past couple of years now, with great success. I mostly use the Android app to turn on and off the lights. Initially, when I first purchased the switches years ago, it would take a few seconds to toggle the lights from the app, however, that has been vastly improved to fractions of a second. That was my only real complain at the time; now that it's worked out for the last two to four years, I decided I wanted to add to the control.

I purchased three of these at once; my confidence being high in the product. I bought new lamps (with awkward switches on the power cable, that end up behind the bedside tables), and hooked them up to this with a spliter (two lights). This is my one critique, two side-by-side plugs would have been nice; makes sense to me.

I had gone through the same routine a few months ago with another of the Belkin Wemo switches, but I didn't call Belkin that time. I ended up returning that unit because I couldn't find the app on iTunes, and I had absolutely no luck setting it up with the Android app. Even with Belkin's help, we couldn't get the Android app to work on setup, although it works fine now after setup. I have no iphone but two iPad minis. Turns out you have to specify iPhone when searching for the app on iTunes, and the iPhone app works fine on my wireless iPads.
