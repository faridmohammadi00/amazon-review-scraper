Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2019","The Echo Studio is a quantum leap from any other speaker that Amazon has produced to date. Everything else sounds like a transistor radio in comparison. The sound separation is fantastic and you can actually feel the bass at higher volume levels.
There a couple of issues, however. The vaunted 3D sound is a waste on anything other than the songs that are specifically set up for it. DO NOT use it as a default setting. The music that is not 3D will sound muddy and the vocals will be lost in the mix. However, if you turn it off, the music will immediately brighten and the vocals will be clear and crisp. There are a lot of online reviews where they claim that the clarity of the vocals is lacking. That is because they were early reviews and took place before you could turn off the Spatial enhancement option. Second, if you combine the speaker in a group or as stereo pair, playing the amazon music app causes songs to stop playing at random and skip to the next song. I have read online where it stops playing altogether for some people. It does not happen when just playing though a single speaker. I have not experienced the problem, as yet, when playing through the alexa app. However the Alexa app navigation leaves something to be desired. Also the Alexa app doesn’t show the quality of the track that’s playing.
Ok, issues out of the way, I have 2 of the Echo Studio paired for stereo and the sound is a revelation. Listening to the White Album in Ultra HD reveals melodies and instrumentation that I’ve never heard before. The clarity of the voices is amazing. It’s like listening to it for the first time. The 3D tracks sound great as well. There is a massive sound stage. The music really does envelop you. It’s not the same as surround sound. So those looking to relive the days of 5.1 SACD and DVD-HD will be disappointed. It’s impossible to get the same effect from one or two speakers. You won’t hear discrete sounds from behind you, but instead you get a full range from in front of you. It’s difference between sitting the front row for a concert (Echo Studio) and sitting on stage in the middle of the orchestra (5.1 surround). I haven’t tried out the pair for fireTV as yet. The current options for Dolby Atmos are limited and I’ve already watched the new season of Jack Ryan, but I may try this at some point in the future.
The amazon credit for turning in an old Echo, sealed the deal on getting the second Studio. The wait for a second one was too long from Amazon, so I got it at Best Buy. They also participate in the Echo buy back program. So, I turned in an old echo dot and got 25% off the new studio (the discount is the same regardless of which echo you turn in), along with a $5 credit. So instead of $219 (with tax), I got the second studio for $155 (with tax). Great deal and with the discount it’s about the same price as an Echo Plus.
The size may be an issue to some, but it wasn’t with me. In order to accommodate 5 speakers, there is no way for it fit into the same space as the Plus. The space is really need to fit the subwoofer and it certainly makes a difference.
So my final thoughts: It’s a fantastic speaker. Much better than anything else you can get from Amazon. The price is right, especially if you turn in old echo dot (any echo really, but the dot is the cheapest of the bunch and you get the same discount). Don’t use the Stereo Spatial Enhancement. The songs in 3D will play that way regardless of the setting and it makes everything else sound worse (in my opinion). There may be point when Amazon releases an update to fix this, but at this point it’s worthless. I have never had a Bose or a Sonos, so I can’t compare, but I doubt anything in this price range can compete with what the Studio has to offer. If sound quality is important to you and you subscribe the Amazon HD music service (the studio is the only device Amazon offers that can play the Ultra HD music in full 24/196 quality), I would say run don’t walk to get one (or two) of these. You won’t regret it.

UPDATE: I did try out the Dolby Atmos feature last night. I watched some of Jack Ryan and Carnival Row. The effect was just as outstanding as the music. Wide sound stage and clear, crisp dialogue. I do think that for watching movies the subwoofer might be a good addition. The bass was definitely present, but I think that the subwoofer would add some welcome bottom to the sound field (Perhaps that will be a Black Friday/Christmas purchase). The setup was fairly simple after restarting the 4K firestick. Initially the firestick was greyed out in the Alexa app, but after a restart it showed up. Set up involved just following the instructions after that.
As stated before, there are very few options to watch Dolby atmos enabled content on Amazon. It does not allow it from Netflix, and as of yet, does not have the option for the Disney+. Hopefully that will change at some point in the near future (although I’m not holding my breath). However, since my main reason for buying the Studio in the first place was for music playback, I see the Atmos option as an added bonus.

Update 2: they have fixed spatial enhancement mode! It sounds fantastic. If you toggle between the two modes, you can actually hear the sound field shrink. It's now very worthwhile. Also I added a sub to the mix and it does wonders for the sound. If you are using the studio in the kitchen or a home office, one will work spectacularly. If you are using it in a living room or large space then 2 with a sub is the way to go. The sub adds so much depth when you are listening in a larger space. Currently playing through the app is a problem but voice commands still work fine.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bryon L.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2024","I purchased two of the Echo Studios with the Echo Sub, so I write this review with all 3 devices. Also, keep in mind this setup is best completed with the Amazon Fire TV 4k streaming stick or I am sure the Fire TV Cube would work just as well. I was a little frustrated when I first setup the Echo Studios and Echo sub because I was trying to make it all work without the Fire TV 4k Streaming stick. I already had the streaming stick, but just didn't think to configure this setup through the fire stick. Once I setup the two studios and sub in theatre mode through the Fire TV Stick settings, it immediately made the audio work amazing from the TV. Also, once I setup the Fire TV stick to run the audio, it also made it so my other HDMI cables plugged into my TV also ran through the studios and echo sub. We were watching a movie the other night and my son asked me to turn it down because the audio was so loud. So this setup will give you great sound once you have it setup correctly and it reduces the amount of space needed for your audio system. So if you want a great sounding system that takes up a lot less foot print in your room, then this is the way to go.

All you do is plug the studios in first and make sure they are both online. Once online turn on your Echo sub and wait until it is online as well. Once they are all online, you will want to go to the Alexa App and go to devices and click the + in the top right corner and create a group. You will want to select the Theatre option and add the two studios and sub to the group and save your setup. Here is some instructions that I followed to make sure everything was setup correctly and in the right order. Hope this review helps!

Steve Pugliese,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2019","There will be plenty of reviews for the Studio in stand alone, single speaker use. It does sound excellent that way. But if you pair two Studios and throw in the Echo Sub, that is an extraordinary composition! That is the way to do the Echo Studio! That is how I'll review it here.

I decided I must pair two Studios since I had two Echo Plus's stereo paired with an Echo Sub and it sounded pretty darn good. So I had to try the Studio paired in stereo, and since I had the Sub, I threw that in too. What else am I going to do with it? The Sub added a lot to the two Plus's. I wondered would you even notice it with the two Studios? I'm here to say that you definitely notice it. You notice it's not there, I can tell you.

The sound of this whole system (two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub) is quite exceptional. I would have to say it's thrilling! Yes, it costs $530 but that is bound to come down and did I tell you that it sounds incredible? It commands a respect, it really does. There is such a depth to this. The bass is deliberate and authoritative. Very punchy. It has exceptional dynamic range (at high volumes this can be startling) and the stereo image is just stunning. An enormous stage. Those 6 midrange speakers sound sweet indeed. Be sure to turn everything up in the equalizer in Audio Settings of the device in the Alexa App. This thing likes loud! It can easily handle max volume for extensive listening.

You crank this up to ten and it literally takes over the room. If you can listen at that volume for awhile with this system (you must live without neighbors) you will be found with a huge smile on your face.

All of Amazon's music library is now available in lossless CD quality streaming or better, which shines on this. The new celebrated 3D formats also sound excellent, though I thought there'd be more to them (Abbey Road sounded great but I didn't think it was transformed). But anything you play on this will sound exceptional. I really can't believe Amazon has taken it this far from the original Echo. Bravo! I notice that the Apple Homepod is now down to $200 at Best Buy. Would two of them paired sound better than this setup? I truly doubt it. They'd need a subwoofer and none, as far as I know, are available for it.

A few things. The circling Alexa lights are now on top of the speaker. You can no longer really see them from the side, which is unfortunate. I love those lights! And two, the Studio comes with this ""spatial"" setting set. I recommend turning it off. In the Alexa app, go to the device and then Audio Settings and below the equalizer is that on off button for the spatial effect. I don't find it adds anything even though it really changes the acoustics. But if you want to hear music as it was recorded, leave this off.

Oh, and I have to say that Amazon still does not make it super easy to set this all up. You have to start with a new or deregistered speaker. Set up each separately and then pair them. But it's anything but obvious or close to foolproof. Come on, Amazon!

And I feel I must tell you that you can't connect to the Studio by Bluetooth when stereo paired. It will only play through one Studio, the first one you set up. To use the Studios in stereo pair with the Echo Sub, you can only stream. And you can only stream if you pay.

Finally, then, these things are big. Really quite large. And seemingly only available now in black, though there's a gray one in Amazon's web site ads. This is not a speaker that sits demurely upon a table. It's almost as big as the Echo Sub, if that helps visualize it. But you will definitely be challenged as to its home, because that is where this will stay, like forever. Especially if you go for the whole magilla. But I urge you to at least try it (the whole magilla!). But be prepared, I guarantee you won't send them back!

UPDATE: After a software update, the Spatial effect is now the preferred way, so leave it on. Turning it off now makes the music too flat. I think it may even turn off one of the mid range speakers. But something's missing!

ADDENDUM:

After two years, these still shine as brightly as ever. But the thing that must be emphasized is that this system of two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub is designed to take full advantage of Amazon Music’s HD streaming service, since these can work together only with streamed audio. Using that enables you to get at least CD quality audio recorded in lossless FLAC files (what Amazon calls HD, 16-bit/44.1kHz) for everything in the catalog, and Ultra HD (up to 24-bit/192kHz) available on an ever-growing list of recordings. In addition, it is also capable of playing Amazon’s (admittedly still in limited quantity) so called 3D Audio recordings (Amazon Music supports Dolby Atmos and Sony 360 Reality Audio spatial audio formats). If you don’t get the Amazon Music HD package ($12.99 monthly with Prime / $14.99 without), then you will be missing out on what these speakers are designed to deliver. Amazon’s Ultra HD music must be heard on a system that supports it to be appreciated. It truly is something else in audio quality, significantly better sounding than any CD or LP. And Amazon Music’s catalog is growing by leaps and bounds every month. It is currently quite vast, even its Classical Music selection which has exploded in the two years since the Echo Studio was introduced.

Using the Amazon Echo Link ($140), you could get this same quality streaming audio (or even better depending on your amp and speakers) for an existing Hi-Fi setup (at least I think you can- there seems to be some confusion about whether it supports the full 24-bit/192kHz Ultra HD), although you could not get 3D Audio with the Link. You could also use the Echo Link to attach any other sub-woofer to your Echo Studio pair but that would also require an additional amplifier thrown in. However, if you don’t have that Hi-Fi system already, these (2 paired Echo Studios and the Echo Sub) are the way to go to take full advantage of Amazon Music HD at a very favorable price. Just compare their cost to that of a good Hi-Fi system consisting of amplifier, pre-amp, two speakers and a sub-woofer as well as the Echo Link you’d need. The Echo speakers here are a definite bargain for getting excellent audio with minimal wires or fuss!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Erik,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2019","These speakers are a great value for the money, easy to set up, sound great and overall just an awesome way to transform your home into a theatre like experience. In regards to the reviews from the audiophiles trashing the quality; they're just completely off for what these studios are meant for. Actual studio speakers are meant to sound flat for production purposes. A home entertainment system, unless you're going to pay crazy money, is meant to be loud, clear and not distort. These are great for music and streaming in a living room to give you that theatrical feel. If you want to install an actual theater in your house, then yes, go spend way more money on better speakers.

The sounds is really impressive for the price point. I have studio monitors in my music studio that cost hundreds more per speaker, and what can I say? I'm just impressed with what they're delivering for the price.

My current set up is a Fire TV Cube with 2 Echo Studio speakers. One placed on each side of the television for a true stereo experience.

When listening at really low volumes, I double checked a few times to make sure the sound was coming from speakers because the stereo imaging really is that good. Dialogue centers right to the TV and the ambiance is great, not to mention the panning of sound effects from left to right (you'll feel it when you see that plane fly across screen, bullets fly from one side of the room not to mention movie scores sound great). The room analyzer really is fantastic and uses your walls to reflect sounds for a great experience.

The speakers are balanced and my only recommendation for the EQ is to open up the Alexa App, throw your ""Highs"" all the way to the top (to the far right of the slider), your mids to the middle and give yourself just a little boost for the bass. Now we're talking! If you push your bass or mids too far it's going to sound muddy. Again, these aren't studio speakers and I think the EQ provided is more than sufficient.

I've tried watching with just one speaker to see how it sounds. The speaker auto adjusts to the room and does give a convincing stereo feel to your experience, however, if you double the speaker, you double the power—this means you're gonna get way more punch and I can't recommend it enough. If you're on a budget or on the fence, just try one.

Overall the sound is good, set up is easy and EQing them on the app is a breeze. So big checks for all of these things. Within 30 minutes (read about the delay below) I was re-watching favorite action and sci movies just to hear them in my living room and I was really impressed with the quality of the highs, mids and even the bass. I don't understand why one would invest in the Echo Sub — just get 2 Studio speakers and the combined power of them is going to give them all the ""UMMF"" you need. The woofer in these guys is plenty at higher volumes.

In comparison to the apple home pods: As someone who almost exclusively uses apple products, I couldn't be happier with these. Apple is just charging way too much for their speakers for slightly better quality and they will sound not much better to the untrained ear. It's simply not worth the extra money.

So why aren't these getting 5 stars? Well to be honest, I wasn't aware that they would only connect as a studio pair with Fire TV over wi-fi. Read that carefully. Yes, they still have a quarter inch in (like for your headphones on your phone) and they are blue tooth enabled, but in order to take advantage of using them in stereo they need to be connected over wifi and so does the sound source. Therefor, you aren't having a party and letting people just connect to the pair to play their music (unless it's one speaker at a time). Not a big deal if it's mainly for entertainment, but I do wish I would have known.

In addition to that, one of my primary frustrations was purchasing the Fire TV Cube so we could easily stream 4k media without longer buffering or drop outs. Well, the way you do that is by connecting your Cube to your ethernet. Unfortunately, the stereo pair has to be connected to the Fire TV over Wifi, so that means the Cube has to be connected to wifi as well. They will NOT work for your cube/firestick if you're connected over ethernet. This was a bit frustrating and caused some minor hiccups in my setting up... so instead of 10 minutes it took me about 30 to delete and reinstall the pairs.

So this leads me to my one BUYER BE WARE: if you are trying to stream 4k, make sure you have a good internet speed and if not you better have your modem nearby or you'll want to buy a wifi router to plug in to increase the signal near your TV, firestick or cube. In the end, I had a router next to where my TV was to extend our wifi throughout the house, but there's NO WAY everyone has this set up and I would have been really upset if I had major issues watching 4k. Luckily, I have not and I don't have super fast internet (about 55mbps) so I'm hoping most buyers are not put in that position.

With that said, I do believe some of this could be fixed with a firmware or software update, so I'm hopeful. If they do, I'd change my review to 5 stars.

Overall navigating and using Alexa is what it is and there's plenty of reviews about that elsewhere. One thing to note: if you have the cube and 2 speakers, they do not overlap well when listening for voices. I highly recommend you mute 2 of them (I muted one speaker and the cube with the microphone mute button on top of the unit) so we're only giving voice commands to one speaker.

In summary, if you're looking to add theatre like quality sound and punch to your living room, you cannot go wrong with these guys.

Make sure you have descent internet for streaming 4k (55mbps or higher) and don't be afraid to play around in the Alexa app to tweak your set up to your liking.

Even as someone who lives and breathes audio, I was impressed. Not because they are the best sounding speakers but for what they deliver, how easy they do it and for what price they are doing it at.",4.0 out of 5 stars
jarreeddd,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2020","Amazon really came through with this product. A few things to take into consideration:

Sound Quality:

While the sound quality is extremely good, especially given the price range, it’s definitely not on the top of the audiophile list. That being said, for the average person, this is a great speaker. It lacks luster in the mids so lyrics themselves aren’t as crisp as other high fidelity speakers on the market. However, the bass is awesome. No distortion. Also, this thing gets LOUD. Great for a house party or if you feel like rocking out.

Alexa:
While this may not be the BEST speaker out there, the Alexa integration and capability is great. The mics will pick up your voice from across the room even with music blasting. If you’re a heavy Alexa user then the great sound quality and seamless Alexa integration makes this the speaker for you. I personally run all my smart home devices through Alexa so having one more assistant in the room is great.

Size:

This speaker is chubby. Kind of looks like a chopped off robot head. It will definitely not just blend in the background. I have it on the corner of my desk 60x30 and still have plenty of room multiple screens and peripherals.

Room adaptation:

This speaker will definitely fool the room with sound. As far as the “3D Sound goes”, it’s really going to depend on the placement and structure of the room. If you place this in the corner of a room and try to listen to it from the opposite corner, you do loose some of that full sound effect. Also, the size and material of your room are going to effect the acoustics and how the sound bounces off the walls. It seems you really only get that full 3D sound effect if it’s directly in front of you and you have 4 solid walls for the sound to bounce off of. I have mine on the corner of the desk with the front speaker facing me. When I’m sitting at my desk I really get the full 3D effect. To manually reset/calibrate to a room hold down the command button for about 15 seconds.

3D MUSIC:

This speaker performs optimally when playing 3D Music from Amazon. Something to keep in mind though is that there are only about 1,000+ 3D song a offered. Who knows what the future has in store but that shouldn’t be the selling point if you’re looking at this speaker. Either way, you’re still getting great sound from any music app.

Built in Zigbee:

I don’t use any zigbee devices so I can’t comment on this. I also couldn’t figure out how it really works.

Competition:

For the same prize you could purchase a smaller Sonos One. Which one has better sound quality is up for debate but what’s lacking in the Sonos is Bluetooth connectivity. Also, the built in Alexa is limited.

Using it as a sound bar:

I personally only use this for listening to music while I’m at my desk. I can’t really see this being better than a a bar and subwoofer around the same price range or even slightly more expensive. I think it would work great with two Studio’s but then again ... there might be better options at that price range. User preference.

Summary:

I truly am impressed with this speaker and really enjoy using it. If you’re a casual music listener Like me and currently or plan to utilize Alexa, this is a great speaker. If you really want to fill the room then I would consider buying two and strategically placing them somewhere in the desired room.",5.0 out of 5 stars
REM52,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2019","(Note: This was written by me and posted elsewhere, so ignore the personal references – I have simply pasted it here so that I didn’t have to write it again!) Two regular Echo speakers paired in stereo mode don't even come close to the ear-pleasing sound that comes from two Echo Studios in stereo mode. As you said, Ty, you listened to only one Studio speaker, and some of that listening was in a surround mode. The Echo Studio does not ""shine"" with just one Studio (when playing regular stereo music files, which are the most common). Two of them paired in stereo mode sound exponentially better. I humbly ask you to reconsider your 7 rating for sound quality and change it to 9 or 10, for the benefit of potential buyers interested in purchasing high quality equipment. If using two Echo Studios in stereo mode, turn off the ""Upmixing"" toggle switch in the Alexa app. Upmixing tries to adapt 2-channel stereo music to the 3D potential of the Studio. If you don't turn off upmixing, the sound will not be that clear and direct, and you will get the wrong impression about how good these speakers really are. That is why some reviewers gave the Echo Studio a low rating when it first came out because you could not turn off the “upmixing” (Stereo Spatial Enhancement) feature, but now you can. With that feature turned on, the speaker will try to add some processing to the sound and that doesn't sound very good in stereo mode with two Studios. That processing may sound ok with one Studio, but even then it's hit-and-miss, depending on which song is playing. Up-mixing is not perfect and not best for all songs.

Comparison of the Echo Studio to the Regular Echo:
The regular $99 Echo has drivers (internal speaker units) whose sound gets somewhat trapped inside the enclosure case, as the separate woofer and tweeter drivers face each other with a small space between them (they point down and up, not out -- one pointing at the other!) instead of facing outwardly like the Echo Studio’s drivers. But the 3 midrange drivers and one tweeter inside each Echo Studio are facing outward and project the sound outside of the enclosure. That makes a big difference -- there's much more clarity and presence in the midrange and treble. It does not get muffled or trapped inside the enclosure at all; it is allowed to come out clearly and completely. I am hearing detail in songs I’ve been playing for decades -- details I’ve never heard before. Those details are clear as can be without being harsh or grating to the ears. The outward facing circular arrangement of the midrange and tweeter array act like sort of a wide-dispersion tweeter – no matter where you are standing you hear each speaker channel’s sound very clearly (ideal for when you are moving around, working in the kitchen, etc. And I am talking about stereo mode here, not a surround mode). The bass is clear and mostly tight – just right without overdoing it. And if you listen to talk radio on these, the sound (EQ) automatically adjusts itself so that the talker's voice doesn’t sound boomy (those built-in monitoring microphones work well).

Finally, it is recommended to adjust the EQ settings using the Alexa app, and set the EQ to: Bass middle (5 on the scale), Midrange boosted to about 6 or 7 out of 10, and Treble to about 8 out of 10 (this sounds best in the very small alcove that I have these speakers set up in). Use a good-sounding music file for test listening – an audio file that has never been compressed more than once, and has been encoded well, and been recorded in high quality (not necessarily a hi-res file). An excellent sounding sample to buy and use for testing purposes is Rudolf from Burl Ives’ album “Have a Holly Jolly Christmas”. Sure, it’s an old-fashioned song but it is extremely well-recorded and encoded (at least on the specific album I mentioned). You can purchase it for 99 cents on Amazon’s online digital music store if you want to have it stored in the cloud and playable on demand -- on these speakers.

Note about Setup: if you have a weak Wi-Fi signal, the slow signal from your Wi-Fi router may cause some confusing delays during setup, so if you encounter this, begin by finding a way to get an adequate signal strength to these excellent speakers. Move your router closer or maybe buy a Wi-Fi extender if your Wi-Fi signal is weak in the spot where the two Studios are located. After a minute or so of getting established, they will find their way to sync with each other and play in perfect, flawless stereo without you having to do anything after the setup.

Sucram,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2019","UPDATE
I’ve had the 2.1 setup connected to a 4K Stick for 5 months, which has been used as a sound bar/stereo in our master bedroom. From a music perspective, it sounds it’s pretty good! The sound stage is full and produces decent bass. I wish it got a little louder. I find the bass response better for music than movies (I LOVE heavy bass in action scenes). If you like heavy bass for action movies, you may be a little disappointed. .

I have, but no longer experience the connectivity issues others have written about. Mine were limited to music playback, however the issue subsided a few months ago.

I’ll address three improvement areas:
1) When connected with the sub, all the lows go through the sub and the woofers on the studios are rendered useless, unless the volume is high. The trade-off is clearer sound than when the studios are paired alone. Personally, I look at it as a design flaw. All three units should produce lows (or at least have the settings in the EQ to do so) for a better, more immersive bass experience. What good is a 5.25’ Studio driver if it won’t be used when paired?? 🤔

2) As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a lip syncing issue when used as a home theater. Depending on the source the fire stick is decoding, there can be a noticeable sound lag. I have not discovered a way to address this issue.

3) The Studios have the ability to play lossless tracks (24bit). However, paired with a Fire device (Cube, 4K stick... doesn’t matter) the output drops to 16bit, because the sound is decoded in the Fire device and played through the Studio. This simply means that fidelity/musical clarity is lost . The limitation lies within the Fire device, not the Studio. However, it’s worth mentioning because when connected to a Fire device, the Studios will be limited to the capability of the decoding device. If they’re used as a stand-alone stereo for music only, you can use the Studios to their full ability.

BOTTOM LINE
I like the setup. I already owned the Eco Sub so its cost had no bearing on my buying decision. The Studios were an add-on for me. In fairness, I came out off of pocket $240 for both Studios combined. With that said, FOR ME I find great value and functionality.

The question is, if I was to start over and pay full retail ($400 for two Studios + $130 for the sub) for a wireless stereo/sound bar system, what would I think? Could I find a better wireless Atmos Sound bar + woofer with no lip syncing issues for the money? YEP! Could I find a better wireless Smart stereo for the money? I’m not so sure! Could I find one that does both pretty well? I doubt it! Could I split the money between two decent systems, one for music and one for theater? Not why would I go do that??? I’d get one that could do multiple things.

FOR THE MONEY it’s good buy. It’s not a Sonos Playbar + Sub (which is 2x the cost) nor a B&W sound bar & Sub (which is 4x the cost). It’s good for the money.

If you can look past the intermittent lip sync issue, go for it. If that's a deal breaker, spend more and get a sound bar that also produces good music.

————————————————————

The speakers sounds great! No complaints; simple setup, quick calibration and I was off to the races.

From a price point, it's comparable to the Sonos One. From a sound quality, it far exceeds. Sonos One is probably slightly clearer, but that's where the comparisons stop. Echo Studio has a wider/fuller sound stage, more bass, gets louder. The closest comparison is probably the HomePod or Play 3. IMO, this sounds better than both.

I already own an Echo Sub and ordered an additional Studio for pairing. I have yet to connect to FireTV 4k to test the home theater setting.

In summary, this produces very good sound, the price is reasonable and it's the best smart speaker on the market... in my humble opinion...",5.0 out of 5 stars

Multi-room Music issues

I found a solution to not being able to get more than one speaker to work at a time, paired, or set up a “Multi-Room Music” in the Alexa app. This solution also fixed my inability to get Apple enabled devices connected into HomeKit, or even Google Nest Hubs to set up, period.

Quick answer: 
Deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation” when activating your 2.4 Wi-Fi broadcast on your router.

I also took all speakers off guest wifi. But I’ll try to put them back to see if that is necessary now.

Back story: 
Months of issues with HomeKit, (only weeks with Echo Multi-Room Music), I gave up trying and decided to try Alexa and Google to replace my Apple smart home efforts. I spent way too much time. After the fix, I’ll live a blended tech life. I’ll give a quick answer, followed by my backstory: 

Last week I was at my wits end in utter frustration over three major roadblocks. I acquiesced and decided to try Alexa because I couldn’t get almost any of my Apple HomeKit enabled devices into HomeKit, except for new Apple products. 

I knew it had to be something small I was missing. 

Alexa was sooooo easy and quick to connect to everything, before I figured out the fix. (I dislike the echo show advertising, their echo speakers are better.) While they seemed a breeze to connect everything, for some reason I couldn’t get more than one echo speaker to work at a time. I was continually blocked from setting up Multi-Room Music or even connect a pair to play together.  

Hundreds of tries. I deleted, reset, rebooted, spent over 4 hours with Comcast yesterday (thankfully a Boston native who did not put me on hold every minute like certain countries) getting my internet working again. I had rebooted my modem and router so many times, my computer got molasses slow and I feared I went too far

In interest I also decided to try a few Google nest hub speakers. Black Friday had great sales on all this stuff. Trying to set up googles hub 7 was impossible. It wouldn’t stay connected to the internet for more than a split second before “Something went wrong” message. Probably over 70 tries. (Google is better than Echo Show. Apple HomePod mini sounds crisper and better than Amazon echo 4 and mini 5’s. But Alexa is way friendlier to interact with verbally, and price point, well...)

Frustration. Thursday, I broke down and bought my first Apple Homepod Mini to see if I can get that working and see if it works better than the Apple TV 4k Ethernet connection. The HomePod mini gave me a hint how to solve all these l connection and internet blocks. 

The HomePod mini kept telling me that I don’t have “peer-to-peer connection” allowed on my network.

Now, I’m a little techy, but it took three days (ehem, months) to finally take a chance on a for granted setting I always enable on my netgear router. It’s the blasted first Wireless page when enabling a wifi broadcast.

I had to deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation.”

That was it. It solved every issue I have come across with smart home tech for the last 4 months, ..year.

For the months that I could not solve these problems, Amazons Multi-Player Music issue made me dig deeper. I did not find anyone suggesting this particular router setting, so I thought I’d share with ppl. 

Tonight, I finally am able to simultaneously play music on all of my Echo speakers, connect my HomeKit enabled and Google nest hubs.

I’m not sure what this will do for my/your internet security. But I’m going with it for now. And I’ll try to put all devices back onto guest Wi-Fi. I’ll never really leave Apple, but after interacting with other smart speakers, it’s probably not going to be my main go to for speaker or answers to questions. Or I’ll just get too creeped out by Google and Amazon invasiveness and acquiesce with Apple instead. 

Echo Dot 5 (this is such a sprite, great speaker!)
Echo 4
are my favorite for Amazon Echo

Echo Studio
seems the least smart, most deaf, quiet, combative, difficult to interact with, of the three speakers. Hopefully the Multi-Room music fix will improve my experience with it

Echo Show 8
Meh. Far too much and annoying advertising of non-solicited or wanted advertisements. Least user friendly screen to work with. It sits unplugged for the most part. I mostly got this for a friend who visits who wants a YouTube fireplace playing on the tv.

SIDE NOTE on other Smart Home Amazon (online, or physical store) products, related to this topic:
I have been pleased with Smartbot plugs, switches and app, the Levoit 600s air purifiers and app (app goes by VeSync), and Lutron Caséta Light Switches and Dimmers, and hub. Lutron has the most stable and reliable app out there. I was fine running their apps separately. They are very nice, better than the big 3 apps. Well, back to listening to music throughout my house instead of one or two rooms. Joy!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Andy San Diego,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2024","I've had the ""Echo 3rd gen Smart Speaker"" for 4 years, and am surprised to see it cost $99, close to the $150 I just (July 2024) paid for the subject Echo Studio (refurbished). What a big upgrade! But not to be compared with a big hi fi speaker set-up I used to have, Harman Kardon. In Ravel's Bolero, the big crash at the peak of the crescendo would actually stop my heart. I'm trying that now on the Echo Studio, but I'm sure it won't even break any glass.
Adding this edit a few days later. The companion Echo Subwoofer will arrive today. I can't wait to see what it will add. I am optimistic. I note that the Studio delivers that special sound of Italian tenors, one I can stand for only a few minutes at a time. The point I was trying to make in my original review is that the Studio does not give out that brilliant lifelike large cymbal-like deafening crash you get with a true hi fi LP player/tuner/cabinet speakers. But, coupled with Amazon Music, the Studio, hopefully augmented by the Subwoofer, is highly pleasurable. I'll update this after I try the Sub. The performance of Bolero that Alexa came up with is not the performance I had on LP with the big speakers, so that is also a factor.
Edit August 5, 2024: First, regarding the Sub, I was not able to get it going even with about an hour on the phone with Amazon Customer Service. I couldn't pair the Sub with the Studio, and had to return it. However, I picked up the tip from another review that Alexa will increase or decrease the Studio's treble and bass. I said twice, ""Alexa, turn up the bass."" And today I asked her to play J.S. Bach. Many of his compositions include solos by viola or cello, and I find the Studio's bass satisfactory. For comparison, I reset the Studio to its original settings (hold the mic button and the volume down button for 20 seconds) and I couldn't hear any difference in the bass. Both settings sound fine.
August 8, 2024 To reinforce my favorable opinion. I just listened to the entire Sibelius violin concerto with Hilary Hahn and my morning coffee, no distractions, and enjoyed it so much. My favorite piece so far.
Today will try pairing my ""Echo 3rd gen Smart Speaker"" in another part of this room, both about 20 feet from where I sit.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Dean,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2019","This journey got started when Amazon recently announced their newly upgraded music service, Amazon Music HD.
For an audiophile, musician and music lover such as myself, this announcement was the holy grail of music. Amazon claimed you can now access millions of tracks in lossless hi resolution audio quality. But let m clear on what this really means to avoid confusion. Typical streaming services such as Spotify stream with audio quality that is sub-par to audio CD's. Amazon's new service boasts both HD audio and Ultra HD audio. When you pull up a track on the service, it designates whether it is an HD audio track, or an Ultra HD audio track. An HD audio track is CD quality, with a bit rate of 16 bits and a sampling rate from 44.1khz to 48kkhz. While many marketers tout this as lossless, it's not really lossless, but it is a big improvement over standard streaming. On the other hand, true lossless is what Ultra HD audio is all about. True lossless Ultra Audio tracks must have a bit rate of 24 bits, and a sample rate that can go as high as 192k. These are true hi-resolution audio tracks that are much better sounding than HD tracks. I was an early adopter of the now defunct DVD-Audio/SACD formats, which were true 24 bit hi-res audio, so I immediately upgraded to the new Amazon Music HD service, excited to have such a vast library of hi-res audio tracks now at my disposal.

I had recently downsized my home, so didn't have the room anymore for a true 5.1 discreet surround system anymore. I'v been using a soundbar and wasn't happy. So when Amazon introduced the Echo Studio, I took notice. After researching, I learned that the Echo Studio supports 24 bit audio, meaning it has the ability to play Ultra HD tracks. So it was time to update my audio system. I went to Best Buy the first day the Studios went on sale there, and invested in 2 Echo Studios and an Echo Sub.

In the Alexa app, you can configure these components for a home theater environment and that was my plan. I had also already owned a Fire TV Cube, which was great for streaming my content and controlling my home theater devices using voice commands. I upgraded my Fire TV Cube to gen 2 in anticipation of integrating it with my Echo Studios and Sub.

If you want Dolby Atmos soundtracks when watching movies, you need to have the Fire TV/Fire TV Cube in the mix, as the Fire TV performs the audio decoding for these surround modes. Through the Alexa app, it was relatively easy to configure the Fire TV Cube, configure each Echo Studio for left and right channel, and the sub. That is my Home Theater Group.

Now this is where things begin to derail. I said to Alexa ""Play Jack Ryan"", and I was immediately impressed with the sound emanating from the 2 Studios and the Sub. It did a great job decoding the Dolby Atmos soundtrack, and short of a true discreet surround setup, I was quite impressed. Center dialog came through nicely, soundtrack effects were presented on a nice wide soundstage, giving a nice surround illusion without actual rear speakers.

Next up, the moment I've been waiting for. Time to listen to some 24 bit hi res audio. Through the Amazon Music HD app in the Fire TV Cube, I searched for some Ultra HD tracks. Again the tracks are designated as HD or Ultra HD. I decided to play The Sound of Silence by Disturbed, which was marked as Ultra HD. ""Alexa, play the Sound of Silence by Disturbed"". Oddly, the song started playing, but it took about 5 seconds for the audio to actually kick in, cutting of the beginning of the song. The other thing I noticed was when I used the voice command, it pulled up the standard HD version of the track. I knew there was an Ultra HD version, as I had just looked for it. So I did a manual search, found the Ultra HD version and started playing it. Oddly, it sounded no different from the other version to me. The label on the screen said Ultra HD now, so this was odd. I clicked on the track information, and was surprised to learn that even though the screen label for the track is Ultra HD, the song was actually streaming at 16 bit, 44.1k audio. This is not hi-res Ultra HD at all. Any laymen would look at the screen and think they're streaming in Ultra HD because it says it's an Ultra HD track, but the track information was telling a different story.

This is where the call to tech support happened. Tech support sent some logs to the development team and them got back to me. What he tried to tell me at first, was that I was indeed listening to 24 bit audio through the Studios. How can that be possible when I'm actively streaming and it clearly says 16 bit, 44.1k. It didn't make any sense to me. Once you have the Cube integrated with the Studios, the voice interaction is between you and the Cube, not you and the Studios. Further, if you need the Cube to decode the Dolby Atmos soundtrack, then it stands to reason that the audio decoding is taking place in the Cube, not the Studios. That was my argument to the tech support guy, and he agreed that made sense. So...I've come to find out that the Cube is only capable of 16 bit audio output, not 24 bit. So the Cube is sending the audio to the Studios in lower resolution, not taking advantage of either the Ultra HD tracks in Amazon Music, or the capabilities of the Studio's hi-res audio capabilities.

So I cannot natively, in my home theater setup, issue a voice command and have Alexa play back an Ultra HD music file through the Echo Studio speakers. This was a huge let down, especially after making all this investment. But I still had one more test. If I bypass the Cube, and use the Amazon Music app in my iPhone to cast directly to the Studios, then this should give me Ultra HD audio in all its glory. I'm doing this for testing purposes only. I should have to, nor would I want to, whip out my phone in my home theater to play Ultra HD tracks. I should simply be able to issue a voice command to my home theater components, and the Amazon Music app in my home theater system should be doing it for me.

The cool thing about the mobile app version though, is when you click on the HD or Ultra HD icon, it displays the full resolution of the track, the bit and sample rates of the equipment it's connected to, and the actual resolution being played. SO now I can validate the bit rate and sampling rate going from my iPhone Amazon Music app directly to the Echo Studios. Only I can't. When I press the Ultra HD icon I get a message that says ""Information not available when casting""! What?? So I can see this info on all my other playback devices such as my car entertainment system, my headphones, but not the Studios? So I still have no idea what the actual nit and sampling rates are bypassing the Cube.

Amazon: You are touting the benefits of Ultra HD hi-res audio. You have created an audiophile speaker with the Echo Studio (supposedly) capable of playing 24 bit Ultra HD tracks. But there is no way for me to stream these Ultra HD tracks natively in my home theater, and no way for me to even validate the audio resolution from my phone direct to the Studios. So here I am with all this new equipment and still can't natively enjoy hi res audio through a simple voice command to either my Echo Studios or the Cube. Seems to me the fix would be a software update to make the Cube 24 bit. Please don't make me buy a third 24 bit Cube!",3.0 out of 5 stars
Cam,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2021","TL;DR for the Echo Studio is that the speaker, whether paired with the Echo Sub or not, running hi-fi music (I’m on Amazon HD) sounds fantastic, but there are so many glitches with it that I’m hard pressed to give it a full recommendation.

I love music, but don’t consider myself an audiophile. I’m a family man and don’t have the luxury of a dedicated “listening room,” and I’m certainly not going to spend thousands on a home sound system. I like listening to music while having my morning tea, relaxing in my bedroom, and when in my car. I have so far been using a pair of Sony XB-43 bluetooth speakers at home and they have been adequate.

I decided to look at upgrade options when I went over to Amazon HD for my streaming service (I also tried Tidal, but that’s for another review). I wanted something convenient, plug & play, and as a parent, relatively childproof. Bluetooth was not an option, as one loses most of the hi-fi benefits over bluetooth. Enter the Echo Studio. I already have a few Echo Dots, Fire TV, and as mentioned, Amazon HD Music, so it seemed like a natural fit. It should be noted however, that although Alexa Cast only works with Amazon Music, you can stream music with the other major services, Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, and others.

So I bought an Echo Studio for the breakfast area where I have my tea, and where I had previously been moving a bluetooth speaker every morning. Setup was quick and painless and I was immediately impressed with the sound. It’s not a high-end home stereo system, but it’s the best single-unit speaker system I have ever had and heard. And it’s $200.

I used the Alexa app to set the EQ, but you can simply tell Alexa to “increase bass” or “reduce treble” or make any other adjustments on the fly, mid-song or whenever you like. I see some reviewers complaining about the sound profile and wonder if they made EQ adjustments for their personal preferences or to suit the type of music being played.

Impressed, I ordered a second Studio and an Echo Sub for my bedroom. Setup and pairing the Sub was equally simple. At first I thought the Sub was defective, or not set up correctly, because I could barely hear anything coming from it. Turns out that for me anyway, it needs to be at a certain volume and playing certain music for it to really be felt. But feel it you will, as the Sub makes the music fill the room in a way that the Studio by itself doesn’t. Make sure you put the Sub on the floor.

The glitches started here, with the bedroom Studio. The music would randomly stop playing, whether during a playlist or simply when I had asked it to play music from a certain artist or genre. When I say that, I mean every single time I used it. Two or three songs and then nothing. Extremely frustrating. My wifi setup is solid, so I looked at suggestions online, and several people recommended putting your Studio on your 5GHz and cordoning it off there (everything else in the house on your 2.4GHz). I tried this, but it did not solve the problem (I ended up leaving the Studios on 2.4GHz and it has been the best option). I unplugged and went through setup on the Studio again and the problem, for the most part, seemed resolved. I took the opportunity to bump my internet tier up to improve my overall household speeds. The music on both my Studios will still stop playing occasionally though, for no apparent reason, with a strong internet connection. And they will go into “red ring” mode too, which is extremely frustrating.

Fast forward to now. Sound quality is noticeably better than my bluetooth speakers, and I mean noticeably. I am hearing guitar strings and cymbal crashes on music that I don’t remember ever hearing before. I used my bluetooth speaker last night for a bit and it was painful. There is no way I can ever go back to standard definition music streaming and bluetooth speakers. Think SD television versus HD television.

Now for the drawbacks. These things are glitchy. Music will stop playing for no reason. Voice recognition of the music or the playlist you asked for is hit and miss. The Studio itself will go into “Sorry, I’m having trouble right now” mode (red ring mode) and won’t play any music for you. At all. For five minutes or for an hour. I have to remind myself that it is a somewhat data-intensive streaming service and think back to the earlier days of Netflix and the like.

Also, while it is convenient to just tell Alexa what you want to listen to, at times I miss having the control of just playing music from my phone, and the Alexa casting is frustrating. Bring up the Amazon Music app, start playing your music (which you have to do before you get the casting button), wait for it to connect, then finally get the music going. Yes, it's probably only seven seconds, but trust me, it feels cumbersome. Again, even Netflix needs to load up.

If you happen to use a voice command directly to the Studio while casting (because when casting, you lose the Alexa voice control function from your Amazon Music app) it reverts back to Alexa app control and you’re out of casting mode (and phone control). Even if you don’t, the casting drops after a bit and you have to go through the connection process again. I’m not going to pair the Studio over bluetooth to get phone control, if I wanted bluetooth quality sound I wouldn’t have bought the Studio. (I did pair it once to check it out, and the music was at a super low volume).

It would be nice to be able to browse the music app and tap a song or playlist at any time and just have it play on the Studio as with a bluetooth connection. As it is, I have to tell Alexa to play it while I’m looking at music choices on the app and hope she gets it right. While on the Alexa app and controlling from there, sometimes it will show me the playlist I’m listening to, sometimes it doesn’t.

I also have Apple Music, as other family members are on Apple Music, and other than one time at the outset, it will play the Apple Music when requested without any problems (Amazon Music is my default setting).

As I sit writing this review, my Studio has played my music flawlessly the entire time and sounds fantastic, and this is what keeps me in the Echo Studio game and considering a third Studio to stereo pair in the bedroom with the Echo Sub (Prime Days?). If it performed this way consistently and the Alexa and Amazon Music apps integrated more smoothly, I would give the Echo Studio a 100% recommendation. I am holding out hope that future software updates will smooth out the rough edges. Until then, know what you’re getting. A sweet-sounding, self-contained hi-fi smart speaker system that will both delight and frustrate you.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Patricia West,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024","This was great until a few months ago when I noticed that they would drop out and I would only hear the bass (separate unit) It would do this erratically, but it’s getting worse. You cannot reasonably expect these units to last forever. After a time, you will need to buy more and send these to the landfill. I guess that’s what Amazon wants.

Update 8/31/24: Argh, I take it back. I got new Echo Studios and the same thing happened. Finally, through trial and error, I realized that the real problem was some kind of newly developed incompatibility between the echo subwoofer and the speakers. The subwoofer would play, but the speakers would not. Now I disconnected the subwoofer and have it in my Goodwill donation box. No further Problems with the old echo studios. Sending the new ones back.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Songdog,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2024","I was told by amazon rep that the echo studio was compatible with remote. There is even a option in the alexa app to do so. After many days of frustration another amazon rep tells me that there is no compatible remote for studio. The problem with this (and all echos is that the speaker and microphone are in the same enclosure which means that if you turn the volume up past 6 then the echo becomes deaf and cannot hear you.

I have a pair of these along with a sub, and they sound really beautiful, but it sure would be nice if I could turn the volume up and still have them respond. I seriously think they need to make a compatible remote for echos. They used to make one, but no longer support it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Kevin S,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2024","I really love the sound this speaker produces while using Amazon Music. The speaker itself deserves a 5 but Amazon really needs to overhaul their music app. It’s sloppy, clunky and malfunctions and crashes frequently. An improved user interface and full app overhaul and this would be an amazing pair. The speaker however is excellent. I am pairing it with the Tidal Music App and the sound is just amazing. The speaker really does redefine how music is heard. Simply amazing.

One dislike about the speaker is that when you play a song for the first time on any given day Alexa feels the need to announce ""now playing on """" which actually interrupts and cuts off the beginning of the song you are trying to play. Not good. The developers need to update and eliminate that. I bought the speaker to hear music, not Alexa.

Also, out of the blue, Alexa feels the need to announce when the Studio is connected and what it is connected to. This happens randomly at any given hour, even the middle of the night. The developers need to fix this.

Really though, those are minor.

Pair this speaker with something like Tidal and its awesome!!",4.0 out of 5 stars

NEURO,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2024","I bought this mostly to get better sound from my Omni FireTV, as well as the benefits of Alexa. The sound quality is terrific, but there's a lot of issues & bugs that need to be resolved and smoothed out from the integration of Alexa/Echo Studio and other devices.

For example:
1) Although I have navigation sounds turned on for my Omni FireTV, Echo either ignores that setting or turns it off. Doesn't matter how many times I turn it back on, it turns it off every time. Before I bought Echo, this issue didn't exist.

2) The volume control on my FireTV is stepped from 1 to 100, yet on Echo it's stepped from 1-10. Why this inconsistency in volume control settings among Amazon products? So when I ask Alexa/Echo to change the volume, I only have a range of 1-10, instead of the finer resolution of the TV's 1-100.

3) Echo has issues remaining connected to the wireless home network. My wireless router is only 20' feet away, yet it's a regular occurrence for Echo to lose the connection, then create its own ad-hoc network to reconnect. Then it's a PITA process that takes several tries to get Echo to reconnect to your preferred home network. My FireTV has no issues remaining connected to my wireless network and never disconnects or drops it. Why does Echo have this issue remaining connected, even when manually chosen in the Alex app?

4) All the different color rings on Echo that mean different things makes you ignore them, because it's ridiculous trying to remember what all the different colors & pulses are supposed to mean when they light up. I ended up saving a PDF doc to my PC & phone that I open when I'm wondering what Echo is doing and flashing certain colors & behaviors. A simple solution would be a concise answer from Alexa if you ask her, 'Alexa...what are you doing?' If we're going to go full-boat on voice control AI, then do it properly & completely.

5) Why does Alexa/Echo sometimes alert you to some notifications, but not others? Why do the alerts contain no info or only vague info? Why doesn't Alexa notify me when an Amazon package is delivered, although I have that setting? All these inconsistent/incomplete behaviors are annoying and useless.

6) We need an Alexa app for the PC, instead of just the phone app, to control settings for the Echo and other Alexa devices. Please make one for the many who use PC's most of the time for home & work.

There's other issues & bugs, but I can't remember them all now.

Would I buy an Echo Studio again? Yes, because the sound is great and Alexa is handy to have for some things...but there's also numerous issues to resolve & improvements that need to be made to the Echo Studio & Alexa.",4.0 out of 5 stars

From the first song, the sound was rich and full, with clear acoustics and detailed percussion that filled my living room beautifully. The Echo Studio not only plays music; it enhances every note.

Setting it up was straightforward. With the Alexa app, I easily adjusted the bass, midrange, and treble to my liking. Whether quickly calibrating or fine-tuning the settings, the Echo Studio made it simple to enjoy enhanced sound that complements my space perfectly.

Happy One,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2024","I've now had time to listen to pop, classical, and jazz on my new Alexa ""Studio"" device. I bought it WITH the Alexa studio sub-woofer because I knew I want as 'full' as experience as possible.
The old Echo Plus was displaced in my living room by the ""Studio"" and, although the whole set-up was more expensive than I would have liked, it's probably worth it! The sound is REALLY good and makes the Echo Plus (even though the Echo Plus was 'good') sound like a tin can with a string stretched to another tin can. Well, that may be extreme. But still, the Studio version just sounds GREAT! With classical music, the bass added by the sub-woofer is marvelous! To MY ears, there's so much bass in pop music anyway that the added bass seems barely worth it to me. But classical and jazz? Definitely worth it!
The set up was really simple. (Getting the Echo Plus to work in another room - which had an Echo Dot in it previously - has so far been fruitless. Nothing I've done in the app or otherwise has succeeded and I hesitate calling Amazon support because (1) I have a phone phobia and (2) that phobia was caused by agonizing attempts at phone support elsewhere.
If it's in your budget, the Alexa Studio and subwoofer are sort of 'game changers' in Alexa's world.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Riggs Royena,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2020","First and foremost if you are looking for standalone Bluetooth speaker, then the Echo Studio is a must buy. You'll be extremely happy and at 200 dollars its a home run on value and performance. Highly recommended for that aspect.

Now if you are using it as a home theater system, that is a whole another story. Let me first say I was intrigued by the Echo Studio because of the Dolby Atmos, 3D immersive sound, and just the whole complimentary features I would get being a Fire TV Cube 2nd gen user. First impressions, lets be honest, the Studio is big and ugly. But guys we can get over that, my wife hated the look of it as soon as I brought it into the house. It has an unforgiving presence, hate it or love it, kinda feel. Not a deal breaker for me but for some people its a viable reason to pass on the Studio.

Lets proceed, I am going to be honest, I tried my best to set the speaker up as a home theater system on my own going through the Alexa app. The first of many frustrations to come, I ended up having to factory reset it (deregister it) and call Amazon Alexa tech support to help me set it up. In my defense, I came from Homekit/ Siri/ Apple TV world where things are arguably a little more user friendly. The customer service/ tech support for Amazon Alexa services is outstanding. If I ever have to call them again for any issues, I feel confident that I will get my issue resolved over the phone. Alright so with the assistance of an Alexa technician guiding me through the process we were able to connect my Echo Studio to my Fire TV Cube. Thats what I wanted! It was a longer process than I wanted but I was finally there, probably took a couple hours to fiddle with it including the hold time and assistance over the phone. It is what it is, just a meh moment for me. But now I'm all set up and all is working.

Then through out the night we proceed.
Flood gates of frustration opens...

Before I take a dump on the Echo Studio, let me reiterate when sound comes out of the speaker it sounds really good. Standalone Bluetooth speaker its number one. Its without a doubt should be on anyone's radar looking for one. With the flexibility of all the music streaming services, solid mids and highs and house rattling bass, it is definitely a contender in this space. Price and value alone to me its hands down the winner.

Now lets talk about my deal breaking issues with the speaker.

Amazon advertises the Echo Studio as a theater system that supports Dolby Atmos using their latest Fire TV Cube, I told you that earlier and thats what lead me down this path. But there are issues on the software side that needs to be addressed before this even gets close to a theater system replacement.

Audio and video sync issues. Yes I know you are able to go into settings and tweak this, and so I did... various times throughout the night. It seemed like after awhile the audio and video sync would sway off and I would have to go back into the settings and tweak it again. A high frustration, but forgivable for the price. I could live with it and hope for updates to come with better syncing support. As long as nothing else was an issue I could deal with it, But I am now needing a flawless experience from here on out.

Unfortunately, flawless is not in the Studio's vocabulary.

Switching between Bluetooth music from my phone and theater system is an absolute nightmare and some how Amazon Music playing from the Fire Cube TV was thrown into the mix as well. Its like Freddy vs Jason, two nightmares into one. The studio can not handle and decide the proper channel to play the media without a little effort on the user end. Its hard to explain but juggling media playback for a theater system shouldn't have multiple sources; Bluetooth and Fire Cube TV that should be it. It seems like both devices are competing for attention, while the speaker should just be a speaker when connected to a fire cube.

Side note, ""Alexa, Connect to my phone."" never worked. Studio also has a hard time handling more than one Bluetooth connected device. Had to manually connect my wife's and mine's device each and every time to play music. Also a couple times I had to restart the whole set up because music wasn't playing. Restarted the Fire Cube, Studio, and phone to get music playing. My frustration is building at this point.

The final straw though was later that night while watching a show the audio without warning abruptly goes out. Video still playing but the Studio was silent. I was fed up. I wasn't going to bring something in my home that I had to babysit every night. I didn't even try to troubleshoot the issue. I did the final and last factory reset on the Studio and packaged the speaker back up to be returned.

I know I am an edge case and I am being extremely critical on some functionality , but at the end of the day, I dont want to deal with any issues. I want to set it and forget it. Give me the same sound and ugly design with a $100 higher price tag but a flawless seamless integration, I would gladly pay. I dont want to have to think when I come home, I want to flop on the couch and just watch tv. Bottom line I wanted to love the Studio, but in the end with all its perks comes unnecessary issues that I dont really need.

I DONT recommend it as a Fire TV Cube theater system set up.
I DO recommend it as a standalone bluetooth speaker.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I'm an audiophile (I love good sound), and this sounds good enough for my kitchen. It gets loud enough for me, but I wouldn't count on it for blasting some ""Snoop Doggy Dog"" at a party (that's an old person joke). I had some trouble learning the command to get it to play music or podcasts when coupled with my other Echo Dot in the living room. It's very specific... ""Alexa play the song Eat It by the band Weird Al on Spotify on the Everywhere group."" It's a mouthful. With little information online I was very frustrated in figuring that out at first, and I had to resort to the Alexa app that you download on your phone for setup to sort-of get the answer. There is a chat bot there which is helpful. Otherwise, not so straight forward, so I'm providing it (the group command) here for anyone else with the same problem. But now that it's working I'm happier with this product. My mother wouldn't be able to set it up alone.
You do have to raise your voice over the music to turn it down with a verbal command.
One thing I don't like is that when you ask it to play a podcast Alexa reads not only the podcast title of the show she is about to play, but also the description of the show that is usually listed below the title. It can be quite a lengthy description, so she may go on for some time before getting to the play button. Also, unless you pay for Prime Music Unlimited membership some musical functions are limited. Like a few times it wouldn't let me skip forward. That's very frustrating when The Eagles come on. Alexa will prompt you to buy the Unlimited feature with a full pitch that takes a good 20 seconds to ge through before the pesky Eagles resume. Eventually I learned how to shut off this ad, but then I got it again today when I asked it to play Led Zeppelin. Not sure why. Eventually I hope to figure out how to shut off all ads.
I also thought this device would speak Chinese, a language I am learning, but strangely it is not included in the list of 20 or so available tongues. Which is a little strange to me since Mandarin is the second most spoken language in the world. Apparently there is a language learning app you can set up, but I haven't figured that out yet. If I do I will update this review.
Beyond those issues I'm very happy with this product. If Amazon were to make a home stereo system that was wireless for your entire house, they'd do well.",4.0 out of 5 stars
cowboy,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023","If they made it easier to connect too it would be great. Im considering sending mine back to get a sonos, only because our fire tv wont connect to it, and its such a hassle using a firetv stick on a fire tv just to get audio. If they would push the home theater option to all fire tv's and sticks and what not, it would be an ok setup. But your regular tv wont connect to it, your fire tv wont connect to it.

its a real expensive speaker to add to the living room, when its so hard to integrate with the tv.
Yes i could buy a echo link. That would solve my problem. But that brings cost of the single speaker audio setup to over $350 after tax and all. You really need two studios and a link for any kind of decent theater audio. That brings total cost too $583 in washington. Tooo much for what it is.

You can hear all of the audio coming from the single point of the echo. No technical foolery they are using changes that. Its sound coming from a single point. So get two they say. The echo balls are not a great option because of lack of living room theater mounting options not to mention an audio quality mismatch with the studio. And another studio is darned expensive to fix what they sell as a one speaker theater setup. A sound bar is soooooo much better. Im going to go back to my old boston sound bar in the mean time. Sounds so much better. And i get no single point of sound problem with it.

9/3/23 Update: The connection issues have not improved for me yet. Now when i talk to them, at least twice a day, they tell me that cant help me with that because they have dropped internet connection. its not my network. i have no issues with any other devices on my wifi. I believe that the theater wifi connection and the connection to my router is too much for the studios to handle. Probably its a software issue there.
However!:
I somehow missed that it has an optical input. I have hooked them up via a fiber cable to the tv and now, every single issue ive had with connection to just the tv is solved. Now the only glaring problems is if i want to use more than one device and the constant disconnecting from wifi. I have not been able to get the Theater setup to accept that optical input. If they would allow a theater group to be set up sans TV, and then allow the audio for the group to come from a single optical input on one of the devices, it would be a much more simple and foolproof way to get the audio into the theater system. Connection issues would become far less of a problem. There may be an almost insignificant audio timing issue with that sort of setup, but thats a tiny issue thats not difficult to fix.
Anyhow if your looking for a great sound and dont mind the optical cable hooking to the back of your tv, everything including xboxs, playstations, and streaming devices like rokus will send their audio through hdmi to your tv and out via optical to your speaker.

My one last thought on the optical cable to solve problems. If you split your optical cable into two, and use two studios like i am on either side of the tv it sounds pretty great, though its not even stereo. The one thing that would make it better is if in the alexa app i could select which channel i wanted to play on each echo unit. The optical is delivering atmos, because im using passthrough on my tv. Each of the Studios could, in their onboard software, selectively play a single channel from that 8.1 channel optical signal. But the whole reason this Studio/Theater software is taking so long to fix glaring issues is because of the cuts in personnel in the alexa/echo branches of amazon. So my hope is very small.
9/19/23 update.
Im now just pissed i spent the money on them. Ive had them to long for return. They just dont work. The optical connectio has two huge issues. The DAC or something freezes and you get no audio. Have to power cycle the device to get audio back. Which is a real pain since you cant reset it through the app. The ither issue is that there is some insane crackle that goes on with audio being to loud. At those volume its fine if your connected via bluetooth.
The atmos is pure fiction with this thing. Songs i know real well are completely missing frequencies and there isnt an eq accessible in the app for the speaker. It needs so much improvement it hurts. Worth maybe $70, only because they can get pretty loud. Complete ripoff otherwise. Trash is what they are as far as i can tell.",2.0 out of 5 stars

inger lise,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","Update 3/30/24. I'm disabled and use a wheelchair. This AI Alexa thing has started doing its own routines and hunches and is now turning off my wheelchair charger at night when it's supposed to be charging-because it hears me go to sleep. It also turns lights off at night that I need left on so I can find my wheelchair. It also decides to turn on every light in the house, whether I want them on or not just because I did once.
I thought I had the Alexa hunch issue fixed by deleting all routines and schedules in the app regarding everything! However that isn't a solution either because it turned off the plug for my wheelchair charger again again last night for the fourth time! I woke to a dead wheelchair again this morning! Had to spend the day in bed letting it charge. It's plug had been turned off again during the night! For the app it does this as ""hunches"" and evidently there doesn't seem any way to turn the ""hunches"" off!
Additionally, this afternoon I discovered the Studio Sub was offline because it's plug had been turned off too by Amazon Alexa without my permission! It also turns light bulbs off at night when I need them left on so I can see to find my wheelchair!
So I called Amazon tech support just now to get help. He wasn't much more helpful than Alexa herself. He suggested I remove the routines from Alexa app. When I told him I'd done had I had already done that days ago but it only helped for a bit,, He had no solutions- no answers beyond apologizing. He did ask though if I was using Apple? So maybe this thing is not Android friendly in spite of them saying it is?
My advice is do not get anything relying on Alexa, if you are handicapped or elderly- it extremely dangerous! Amazon AI is not smart enough for disabled or elderly people yet. Alexa also has major issues hearing elderly people who have dentures, or any sort of an accent or speech impediment or stuttering
Amazon should buy this stuff back-way too primitive and dangerous.

+++ February 2024 update!
I've had this speaker for about a month. Also have it's sub. At this moment I'm sitting here spending Friday night typing instead of watching my movie, because the Studio as usual
just disconnected the speakers from the TV with a half hour yet to go on a movie! No sound at all and I can't get it reconnected! The fire stick remote won't work and Alexa Studio just keeps saying something to the effect of ""it's having issues and can't think"".....
So I decided to take a break, calm down, and write this review update! Sadly this happens on a daily basis- the connectivity issue with this thing is real, frequent and terrible! The TV, Studio Speaker and Sub are all within 10 feet of our router! No reason for all the issues! When it's good it sounds amazing- but unfortunately having it cut out in the middle of the movie is nothing but frustration. The Studio also has trouble understanding things. It has trouble understanding the simplest of commands and stops movies or YouTube shows, for no reason, or starts talking about topics or showing topics on YouTube that I didn't even ask for- eavesdrops a lot. If I actually need anything Alexa related I usually go back to the bedroom and ask the Echo Dot instead!
I had Amazon tech support contact me because of my one star original review and unhappiness with this. They were able to resolve the buzzing issue the speakers had. Turns out moving them further away from our older metal filled TV helps. So they're now 5 ft away from the TV and in the middle of the room and the buzzing issue is resolved.
However they're in the middle of the room.....
I find the connectivity issue appalling in view of the fact that everything else made nowadays comes Plug and Play!
Because of this ongoing issue that Amazon seems to not be able to resolve, I still do not recommend this Studio speaker at all!

Original review -
This has been a problem since setup- it's definitely not Plug and Play. You would think that something from the same company would hook up easily together, but sluggish updates and incompatible connectivity issues made it take an entire weekend to set up. And if you move it? You have to start all over again. This speaker is buzzy already and I've only had it a few weeks. Have to keep it at low volume which defeats the whole purpose of having it.
Additionally it's about half as smart as the Dot I have in the bedroom. 'Studio"" doesn't listen or understand me most of the time. For example, I asked it to play Teskey Brothers. And it starts talking about super bowl instead! And it stops the music on the rare occasions it does play what I want- so it can play commercials for things that it wants to sell from Amazon!
I so regret that the return window has passed.
Save your money for something else. This thing's 10% enjoyment and 90% aggravation.

Hope this helps some of you out.

Dolby atmos does not work on PC and it sounds like a mid to low end stereo over bluetooth. This was confirmed through the Dolby Access app for the PC. I hope to find out that I am wrong about this. I did read that I can supposedly get up to 5.1 surround but it requires another adapter that I just placed an order for and will update to see if it actually works. Aux cable does not register to my PC or smartphone at all and customer service technician could not figure out how to get it to work and stated they will send me an email with instructions within 30 minutes. It has been several hours as of this review with no updates.

I always find that most people who say the sound quality of a certain speaker is excellent/audiophile quality usually have no idea what they're talking about. I would bet most are running this over bluetooth and not realizing it does not allow the full features of what this speaker supposedly can put out. It has a punchy bass and that causes the illusion that the speakers sound better. As far as I know, this product requires a cable to utilize its dolby atmos, and the Amazon service tech could not confirm or deny this. However, read the description that says it works with the latest Firesticks and other devices but not with older gen. Perhaps this means for TVs, you can still wireless connect over bluetooth and utilize dolby atmos.

I have not tried it on a TV for dolby atmos but as stated above, the description implies you may need to get an optical cable to connect with your TV for the dolby atmos. However, one of my biggest problems with this is that you cannot adjust sound settings. I don't want the bass on at night because I don't want to disrupt my neighbors, and there is literally no way to adjust that or any other highs/mid/lows. I'm hoping the optical cable will allow me to adjust settings with the sound card driver on my PC.

On a similar note, it is worth mentioning that not being able to adjust the bass affects the sound quality of movies, as it often adds too much bass to the voices of the actors and sounds odd. Additionally, it adds almost a reverb to the voice, which I tried adjusting through windows sound settings by turning off spatial sound and digital surround. Nothing seems to fix the issue. I have loudness equalization turned on and while it helps movies and music, the Alexa notifications come out at a significantly louder volume to the point where I have to turn it down only to have to turn the volume back up when I resume a movie or playlist.

This device doesn't allow you to use the built in mic for the majority of apps outside of Amazon but it will set the default mic on your PC to the Echo Studio. This is annoying because you will have to manually go into every single app that the Echo mic does not work and change it back to your original mic.

In any case, until I can hear how it sounds with dolby atmos or even 5.1 surround, I would say do not believe the hype that these are audiophile quality as they sound worse than my $70 bluetooth speakers. These don't sound bad, just don't expect to be blown away over bluetooth.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Sami,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024","I actually ended up here to write this review because I thought they didn't make these anymore. I remember hearing about the Amazon hardware group suffering cuts last year, so when I saw this thing hasn't been axed yet, I wanted to offer my support since I have loved it for 4 years now.

I'm not an audiophile, but I care more about sound quality than your average person. Also, I'm not one of those people that has the luxury of buying 10 different products and comparing them, so my assessment is somewhat limited in that regard. But all that really matters, I think, is that this thing blew me away day one, and it's going strong 4 years later.

We have it in our main living room/kitchen/dinette which has 10 foot ceilings and is an open concept with total footprint of about 30'x20' and this thing does a very solid job of filling the room. Of course, bigger, dedicated speakers would sound better, but then you have to screw around with an AV receiver, multiple pieces, running wires (or at least power for each speaker), and trying to make it all look good. This thing looks sleek at one end of the 20'x30' room, has a single necessary cord (power), and provides impressive sound given the tight package everything is crammed in.

I understand there are other speakers out there that would sound just as good, if not better (Bose, Sonos, etc.), but I want to emphasize that this is phenomenal for the $200 price point.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Townie,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2024","First unit arrived used and damaged, so Amazon sent me a second that was brand new. We are using both for music (mostly). I use Amazon Prime Music HD and my wife uses Spotify. Spotify works very well and seems to be stable. Amazon Prime Music is very buggy. Firstly, if it continues playing similar music, it always replays the last song already played first. Secondly, it cannot distinguish between different artists with the same name and so you get some random musical styles. Thirdly, the Amazon Music phone app and the device lose sync regularly. The Alexa phone app and the device also lose sync regularly, so there is no way to reliably see what is currently playing. Sometimes fast forwarding a song will cause the message ""an error has occurred"" and sometimes a song will not play even though it is available and has played previously. Sometimes songs that are unavailable will play, which is a bonus...

Sound quality wise I find the unit sometimes sounds excellent and balanced and sometimes sounds trebly and sibilant, there is no rhyme or reason to how it will sound. Sometimes the bass speaker will stop working and you have to reboot the unit (I had to reset it and re-set it up from scratch).

The front firing tweeter does not produce any sound with spatial audio disabled (and hardly produces any sound with spatial audio turned on). So most of what you hear is the two side firing speakers and the bass speaker (when it chooses to work). The upward firing speaker seems to also only work with spatial audio enabled. This is an issue because spatial audio does not sound good on all material. Material specifically developed with it in mind sounds great, but everything else sounds echo-ey.

Note also that there is no volume leveling feature for any of the music services, so you will play one song and then the next will be 5 times louder, so you are constantly asking Alexa to change volume. This is, of course, unless you use it with Bluetooth, but the sound quality won't be as good.

As a smart speaker, when the unit works properly it sounds really good - in fact it almost seems to break the laws of physics, it sounds so large. Hopefully there will be a fix for the non-spatial material (getting all the speakers to actually work) and the instability.

As for the smart part, it is useful for news and weather, but trying to get suggestions on where to buy something for example comes up with completely inappropriate results. For example, asking where you can buy ""home décor items"" will get suggestions for coffee shops or bakeries mixed in with chain stores. Also, be careful if you banter with the unit because there is a chance you could accidently subscribe to an entertainment subscription service.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Dopest Nerd on the Block,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2020","Received the echo studio yesterday, I've only got about an hour of listening in. Wrote the following while listening and setting it up.
1. Could not get studio connected to my 5g network, only 2.4g. I haven't looked into it yet.
2. Setup and integration into my existing Alexa set-up was easy.
3. Looks great
4. It's no audiophile speaker but definite improvement over the echo and echo plus.
5. Immediately the vocals are center stage. The three 2"" mid driver's project the sound around the room while not letting the vocals get lost.
6. The 1""tweeter delivers bright crisp highs
7. And having a 5¼"" speaker to handle the lower frequencies in the music really makes this speaker sound and feel like a bookshelf style speaker. I may just have to purchase another for pairing into a stereo set.

I'm going to pair the studio with my echo sub just to hear.

I've been playing the echo studio for a bit now. Playing songs from different genres, 80's, 90's, 2K, Amazon music 3D, HD, and ultra HD.
First impression... Compared to echo and echo plus. Eq flat and spatial enhancement on.
1. Noticably louder
2. Highs more present and crisper
3. Vocals not as muffled

I temporarly have the echo studio in a bedroom I converted to a small home theater. Room is 12ftx12ft with 10ft ceiling. Speaker was placed in center of room on foot rest/table. (Amazon suggest having it 6"" from a wall. I'll play with that later when I figure out where it works best in it's possible final destination, the family room.) The echo studio filled the room. I was sitting on the couch in front of the echo studio. With my eyes closed I could follow the sound around the room like a globe. When I would turn off the spatial enhancement you could hear and feel the ""sound globe"" get smaller and closer to the speaker.

The first 3d song on the playlist Alexa tells you to ask to play was a bad example. ""The steps"" by Haim. There are weird distortions in the music. I thought too myself (what a wonderful world. You know that's where your brain wanted to go) this is horrible sounding. Turned off the spatial enhancement (SE) and still not good. Went to the next song and was relieved that it was the song and not the speaker.

As I said earlier I played a handful of songs from Amazon music. Turning on/off the SE, adjusted the EQ a little. It's tough with Amazon music, the sound quality from song to song (unless they're all on one album) is super inconsistent. You don't notice this on the dot and if your listening you can almost kind of hear it on the echo and echo plus. But it's pretty tough to hear unless you know what to listen for. As the quality of your speaker or system gets better, the distortion, compression become more noticeable. Before subscribing to the HD music I couldn't even listen to Amazon music in my car without cringing from the distortion, inconsistent compression, and/or hollow sounding songs (Lincoln Parks ""hybrid theory"" is a good example of distorted highs. And it sounds like it was recorded in a tin can) HD subscription helps the sound quality a lot but doesn't eliminate the issues.

Overall I like what I heard. Definitely need to play with it some more. Let the speakers get broke in. After about 30-50 hours overall sound should warm up and be a bit smoother.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jason,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2023","My reviews are long to provide my reason for purchase, how I like it, etc...if you don't care for all that...here's the short version: Sound is amazing coming from a 3rd Gen dot, not quite the highs or lows a proper speaker setup provides, but it's space saving compared to that and produces very balanced room filling sound.

Full Review:
I purchased this as an early family present to replace a Gen 3 dot and Gen 1 dot, the sound blows of those away. Even at first plugin, it started up with a tone that more or less spanned the range of what the Studio can handle...everyone's head turned at me in awe, including myself. My family loves music..lots of music...from K-Pop to Metal, and everything in between. The size of the Studio is definitely larger than the dots, comparable to a medium sized pot. While the sound quality is better b
than the Gen 3 dot in both fidelity and clarity, it is still behind proper 2 or 2.1ch+ speaker setups, in case there are some hoping to replace that (again we love music and enjoy it as close to how t was intended). That said, if it's
an upgrade to one of the smaller Echo models and/or tired of connecting to a larger speaker system (this is my case) for sound, the Studio is the way to go. The sound the Studio puts out is well balanced: highs, mids and lows are not muddied together nor tinny. The fidelity and clarity is wonderful coming from a single small device and with the multiple speakers built in, the Studio fills a room with sound with ease; whether it be for background music or for listening to the latest album. I still prefer the sound that my tower speakers and sub produces...but it satisfies my families ears without the need to tell Alexa to first connect to speaker...really it's so good that I'm looking into getting a second to further enhance the Soundstage, better separation of left and right, of an already phenomenal Echo speaker.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Tall woman,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2021","Once I start this review I would like to mention that I did a lot of research before I purchased the Echo Studio product. My 7 year old Sony sound bar for my TV suddenly died and was not fixable or in order to fix it was too pricey. Let me first say this product is for a second home and the room functions as a bedroom and entertainment room. This room is not a home theater so what I am trying to describe is I didn’t need a robust sound system based on the room size and function. Also, I did want a system (speaker) where I could listen to music and have good sound from the TV. Finally, I should mention I have Play1 Sonos speakers (1st Generation so no smart functions) at my primary home. Okay, understanding all those areas let me provide my review…

I have had the Echo Studio for about 2 ½ months and the sound is very good with the music and playing through the TV in the size of the room as I described above. The smart functions are nice to have but I will be honest I don’t really need to have them. Based on the research I did and reviews on Amazon and outside of Amazon said the sound from speaker was almost as good as the Sonos play1 speakers and I have to disagree. My personal opinion is the sound from Sonos is much better and the functions with Sonos app are 95% better for music lovers. What do I mean by that statement is I feel there are limits with the Echo Studio based on functions and performance for music lovers or as a primary speaker for music and tv in a smaller size room. The following list below includes the limitation of the echo studio.
• Always defaults to Amazon Music ( I recently changed the function within the app to my favorite music platform but Alexa still goes to Amazon music but not as much). If I want it to go to a favorite station of mine I need to be specific in my statement by naming the station exactly. And I am finding this very annoying b/c on my Sonos I have them saved and just go to the app and play them. So I have to look them up everytime if I want the echo studio to play them. This is a big fail for me.
• Unable to save favorite stations
• Doesn’t have the capability to store recent playlist or station. For example, if I like what Alexa did pick I say save that station and she communicates that function does not exist.
• Also, I don’t find the Alex app helpful when it comes to the music element as the Sonos App is. Sonos app is seamless to me. Also, I love the Sonos app in terms of saving the history of what the user has listen to and I can store favorites.
• The search function in the Sonos app is great because I can see all the options to play from all my linked music platforms.
I want to communicate to those individuals who are music lovers and are using many online platforms for their music. And understanding the difference between the two products. If you are reading this review and your in the market in purchasing a speaker for music and to play through the TV. I would highly recommend Sonos speaker b/c it is seamless more flexibility and more functions within the Sonos app that is not offered through the Alex app. This is why I am doing this review b/c that was not mention in my research and if I had known I would have spent more money for those functions and flexibility. I realized that I did get a better price but for me at what cost. I will say I am good with my echo studio and it does sound good. But if I had known what I know now, I would have gone with a Sonos speaker. I wanted to provide this information for anyone who is on the fence like I was….",3.0 out of 5 stars
Amanda Benson,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2023","Pros:
If you are using Amazon Music Unlimited and have a large library of Dolby Atmos songs, you will love the depth of sound from the Echo Studio.

Cons
Non Atmos/360 songs sound like a cheap AM radio. Mono/Echo sounding. You can disable the ""Spacial Enhancement"" option in the Alexa app which helps a little, but the speaker should be smart enough to play lower quality formats.

I'm including comments on the Amazon Music app here because the speaker can't be used without ""some"" app, and the Amazon App is what I use.

So many things wrong with the app.

View library by Album and it sorts by recent activity instead of Album name. Same if you view by artist.

If you don't have Music unlimited your playlists are useless. Amazon ""says"" users asked for access to a bigger song library so their solution is to mix random songs into your playlist. BS.

They changed the definition of library. My library used to contain songs I purchased and playlists. Now it contains everything.

Can't see the quality of the song you are playing. Plenty of room to show it on the now playing screen but they don't. Why? They don't want you to see how many songs are not high quality I guess. Maybe they just have bad designers, developers.

No volume control in the app. They have one in the Alexa app. So you have keep both apps running, which you really need to anyway to enable/disable the spacial enhancement option.

Optical line-in port is almost useless. Go read the forums. Too much to include here.

Seems like every ""enhancement"" they've made to the app lately is a step backwards.",4.0 out of 5 stars
GreatNorth,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2022","To start with: the Amazon Music App and Alexa app don't play nice together, but its getting better; Alexa app likes priority power! Also flipping from app to Fire 4K Max has interface issues. It's getting old unpairing speakers and clearing caches... When music or movies stop for 10 minutes, it should default to next command pinging it and not mate for life!!....

The software issues aired... I bought two of these with the sub to justify my monthly unlimited music fee along with the Prime membership; both of which keep going north.... I am old enough to remember when the Dire Straights Brothers in Arms CD DDD cost $26 bucks, but if you had a CD player, this was a life changing listening experience! So I'm conditioned within reason, but am a frugal value buyer.

I am a self proclaimed audiophile, but that is arbitrary based on your music, room, ears and budget, but I have always paid up for ""Hearing"" sound value. A $10k amp/pre sounds only as good as your speakers. No the Studios aren't that, but for a smart Alexa speaker you can't engineer or make a speaker set for your $200 investment. Amazon is even or losing on selling these to get you enrolled in the unlimited music; HD, ultra HD, Atomos, 3D etc... and it works. Very smart.

Will they make a TV sound experience better, obviously, compared to factory tv pairings. Will they play your music subscriptions epic on your go to listening personal high end system, blow your hair back, chair? That is your call. Prime: return if not. My easy answer is that Amazon doesn't currently make a better speaker with the versatility the studio has, and I own everything they sell related to sound... truly.

Amazon isn't intentionally trying to price themselves out of the music streaming services and the value here is that they are committed to getting it right. Many of the settings adjustments have been firmware updated to work as it should of been from origin, but tip of the hat for addressing weaknesses. Most high end audiophile speaker companies aren't going to swap out the cross-overs or update the digital footprint because you spent $35k on a set of speakers you think should clear the air better. Get a calculator out. $200x amazon customers, x customers who subscribe to music and movies..... it's millions
$$$! Amazon will stay proactive and reactive when necessary to keep us happy! Buy the speaker/s, it's a brilliant 150-200 dollar investment considering a tank of gas is $100. Money well spent, stress well relieved and a chance to re-listen to music, that doesn't sound the same as it did over the years.

*After submitting my review an Amazon Outreach Representative called me to see if they could help and troubleshoot the problem. Basically a reset and maybe move to a different location. So I did and I have to admit, not a whole lot of difference. I did move the speaker closer to where I sit so yes, sound is definitely better but that's just because it's closer.

Rob in Boston,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2023","""Spatial Audio"" is NOT A SETTING on Echo or Alexa. It's a playlist that you must request verbally while operating Alexa once you have Amazon Music Unlimited (which you must purchase additionally as with other music platforms.) If you are already an Amazon Prime member, the added five bucks is worth it. With Amazon Music Unlimited, Alexa becomes your slave). Understand, with basic Amazon Music, the sound is suppressed (It sucks.) It's better to fork out a few more bucks for the Unlimited (and you're the boss). 2) Once you pay for Amazon Music Unlimited, the sound improves significantly. 3) ""Spatial Sound"" IS NOT A SETTING for your device. It's merely a marketing ploy. It's simply a playlist that only works if you subscribe to Amazon Music Unlimited. THERE IS NO SETTING ON ALEXA FOR ""SPATIAL SOUND."" Once you have Amazon Music Unlimited, you say to Alexa (on your Echo device), ""Alexa, play the best of spatial audio playlist."" What you get is random pop music, most of which is redundant and not rewarding. Keep your settings basic. Do get Amazon Unlimited because you are in command. You can skip without suppression at any time. If you ask Alexa a general question, it's usually okay, but sometimes it's ridiculous how badly a question can be misinterpreted. I like my Echo Studio. It doesn't allow much finessing of the volume. I'm searching for a compatible 16 band equalizer (which probably doesn't exist) but it tells you I'm encouraged by the sound of this device. Don't be confused about ""Spatial Audio."" Also, keep the basic sound settings once you have the Echo Studio speaker. You can adjust simply by commanding: ""Alexa bass up,"" or ""Alexa, mid rage down,"" Or, ""Alexa Treble up 1,""etc. The same with volume. That's all I got.

Judith F Wagner,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2023","I own numerous echo devices, from the Shows to the Dots and Towers and Fire tablets, so I'm all in the Amazon ecosystem. I bought a Fire TV and then this Studio to use as a speaker last year. I have not gotten the Studio to work well with the TV yet. First, I tried Bluetooth, but the sound and lips would not sync, no matter how much I played with it. Then I tried Amazon Home Theater. This eliminated the sync issues, but the TV and the Studio would unpair every couple of DAYS. I did a factory reset on the Studio and then had trouble connecting it to a strong internet signal, so I set it next to the router to connect to the internet. I also tried using an optical cable to hard-wire the two but all I got were crackling noises. So I went back to Amazon Home Theater -- and I always have to reconnect the Studio and TV, after unplugging them both -- a real pain. I was going to get a second Studio and the Echo subwoofer, but not now because of my experience with this Studio and Fire TV (both Amazon products); just not staying connected. If anyone knows how to fix it, please post. Thanks

Aug 22, 2023. I'm updating my review as Amazon Home Theater seems much more stable, so I'm increasing the stars on the Studio to 4. My main problem was never the sound, but the connection between the studio and my Fire TV. I am only losing the connection between the Fire TV with the Studio maybe once every two weeks now vs. once every two days. I'm pretty sure it's on the Studio side as when I go to reconnect, the Fire TV doesn't recognize the Studio that is sitting next to it. I try the next day and it works. So I'm going to be brave and get the second Studio and see if I can really get a home theatre system going. The home theater still baffles me as I have FIOS's top internet package so it should support everything. To give Amazon kudos, someone called me on this, but I couldn't recreate the problem with regularity, so it was impossible to work with them.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Greg W.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2021","While it is true that, to date, the Echo Studio paired with another and the Echo Sub is one of the best ways to listen to Amazon Music Unlimited, there are some drawbacks.

The first is probably the price. You really don't need to pair two together if you can't afford it and the Echo Sub does not automatically add as much bass by default as you would like.

I don't want to split hairs, but the Echo Remote works with the Echo Studio much better in one-speaker format.

In paired mode, you can sync the remote, you can change the volume, and bypass the wake word with the press of a button, but you can't skip forward or go back with two of them working as a 2.1 system just with a press.

I hope Amazon addresses this with a software update or that I am the only one for whom this happens. I sincerely doubt Amazon addresses this as they do not sell the remotes on their website anymore. It's a shame. I really prefer using the remotes.

When you set these devices up on your smartphone or tablet, I learned the hard way that you need to re-enter your same address multiple times and label your rooms correctly for the sake of organization and using the drop-in feature.

As for the sound quality of the streamed music, it's very good, but not excellent.

It's very difficult for streamed music to sound great. I've listened to vinyl records and CD's and DVD Audio and music that was advertised as lossless, but streaming music for the time being is compressed by algorithms. Most people know that. And you know you're being robbed of sounds or data that make the file small enough to stream.

If you are an audiophile, buying one of these Echo Studio devices was never on your to-do list.

But the Echo Studio makes for a decent smart speaker. I like that I can control the thermostat and dim lights without spending much effort.

I've owned previous generation Echo devices that had built-in thermometers. The Studio dropped that feature.

I should tell you that I have also used Google Home and it seems to be more capable of answering my more complex questions.

Yes, your smartphone is smarter. Your computer is obviously smarter.

Basically, what I am saying is the Echo Studio is better than previous models from Amazon.

I got what I paid for because I had realistic expectations. And it sounds very good on its own.

I like that it adjusts to the acoustics of the room automatically when moved to new locations.

TheFirstMongoose,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2020","Pretty good speaker. Bad exchange policy and customer service. I purchased two of these on Prime Day, since they were $50 off MSRP for a total of $100 savings. Tested both of them out and paired them together with the Echo Sub. Played music fine. Somewhat drowned out the bass from the subwoofer, but music was nice and clear. There really is no way to independently turn up the bass just on the Echo Sub since they are all connected now(two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub). Amazon needs to invest in these tweaks that would make a big difference.

I discovered a day later that one of the Studios had a low static noise whenever I asked Alexa a question. It wasn’t on the other one/speaker. So I tried to troubleshoot and went through everything. Changing the WiFi band from 2.4 to 5.0 and back. Changing to different outlet. Unplugging for a few minutes. Nothing worked. Very noticeable if your within 3 feet and asking Alexa a question. When playing music however, the static seemed to disappear or so I thought. When the music is turned down, the static was still there. So I decided to call Amazon technical services. A tech/representative went through all the troubleshooting methods I had already tried and we determined that the speaker was faulty. I agreed to just have it replaced. When he was telling me on how to ship the faulty speaker back, he mentioned to not include any cords or pamphlets. That raised a red flag and I asked if I was receiving a new or refurbished unit for a replacement. He said he doesn’t know or would not know until it ships. So I end the call with him and go to my Amazon account to look at the replacement being shipped. It’s a REFURBISHED! Nothing wrong with refurbished, but I bought new not refurbished. So Amazon should be replacing with a new one. Right out of the box there was a static. It’s not like I used it for a month. So I called back and tried to explain to a different representative. Come to find out, Amazon’s policy to correct such issues is either to refund your money or replace with new OR refurbished unit(their call), when it comes to Amazon devices. My argument is that this is a brand new device that was defective, sending a refurbished one should have NEVER been an option. What complicates thing now even more is that they are out of stock on new Studios. None expected in until a month and a half later. The second representative ended up canceling the refurbished replacement and said I can wait until they get new Studios in to do the exchange since she can’t even order a replacement due to the lack of stock. Either case, I’m not very happy on how this was all handled. Decent sounding speaker, but if you get a lemon, be prepared to get a refurbished one as an exchange. Or be vigilant like me and question it. I did notice other reviewers stating receiving replacements coming in generic boxes....those are refurbished. And there’s nothing wrong with refurbished if you originally bought refurbished or if you have owned that device for a number of days, weeks, months. That wasn’t my case.

Clinton W. Salvato,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2020","I had been looking at, and watching reviews of the Echo Studio since it was announced last year, and had decided, it was a product, that I initially wanted to get my hands on, and at least test.

Since I have been happy with my Echo Plus 2nd Gen, and Echo Dot 3rd Gen, I put the studio on the back burner.
Earlier this month, I just happened to be at my local Best Buy, and they had a couple in stock, so I decided to grab one.

First Impressions:
The studio looks and feels to be well built
It seems to be able to fit into a good amount of places, although I've only had it in one so far, but (judging by that location) leads me to believe, even though the largest echo speaker, that it can fit anywhere (within reason).
The sound is extremely well balanced, at least for the majority of music I listen to, and even a good stereo mix is immersive on this speaker, the left and right channels come out clear, and it's NOT just stereo, it does immerse you, however, I have noticed that it depends on the style and recording quality of the music as to how well that works. As others have mentioned in reviews, by default the Echo Studio has a Spacial feature enabled to enhance stereo. I'll leave this up to YOU to turn it off, or leave it on. I will leave this suggestion, if you don't have a technical background in audio, and want to keep things simple turn this off in the Alexa app under settings:device settings: your echo studio:audio settings. I say this because it's essentially what Dolby Pro Logic, and other similar technologies do to simulate surround sound from stereo. Some music it actually helps and gives a nice affect to, and others it distorts, and actually makes sound worse. Putting that aside though Audio sounds really good through this device, and the bottom line is, to get the best performance, you can't always use the defaults, or someone else's settings, because there are too many variables. that can change.

Other things I've found to share, Initially I had WiFi issues with the 5ghz channel, because the Echo doesn't get full signal where it's at here, but switching to the 2.4ghz channel has made things more stable, not just for the echo studio, but features like multi room music, and overall performance. My advice here is:

Yes, 2.4ghz is going to be a slower channel then the 5Ghz one in many cases. However, for an audio only device such as an echo without a screen, it's not going t make a difference in performance. So if issues with Wifi, and it's on the 5ghz channel, try setting it to 2.4. Amazon even recommends this, in their help article on updating and troubleshooting Wifi settings with echo products. Let me rephrase that, they suggest 5ghz for faster performance but suggest 2.4 for better stability and signal range.

Bottom Line:
The echo studio is a great smart speaker with a unique design and purpose. As always, while the sound is great from this device, it's not a replacement for a dedicated surround system. If you're ok with this fact, and still want to try this product, I recommend it 100%.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Big plus since I bought it to replace a glitchy stereo pair of 3rd Gen Echoes in bedroom used for music & ocean wave sounds to help drift off to sleep. The stereo pairing suffered frustrating dropouts, with one or sometimes both speakers quitting in the middle of songs & very rarely played the ocean sounds through morning. But so far the Studio has worked perfectly.

However, in spite of the Dolby Atmos credentials, the Studio doesn’t sound nearly as spacious as the paired Echoes (which I had in opposite corners of the room on the headboard wall, mounted about 5 feet high on candle sconces.) Paired also with an Echo Sub, this filled the room with sound rather nicely... well, whenever it all worked simultaneously. But the glitches simply became untenable, so I grabbed a Studio during Prime Day...

At first I put the Studio near a corner of the room on a dresser, pointing the front toward the bed. Sounded tinny. Made sure I had upgraded to Amazon HD & played Best of 3D... Still barely any immersion of sound whatsoever. Very disappointing. Moved speaker to center of wall, still on dresser... Better but still not very impressive. (And yes I did keep the Echo Sub, now paired to the Studio.) I let it play all day while at work to break in the speaker & allow the room tuning to recalibrate... No avail.

Finally I moved the Studio to a speaker stand, centered on the far wall facing the bed. The sound was significantly improved. Still not what I’d expect from a product claiming Dolby Atmos, but certainly better sound immersion. I think the side-firing speakers work far better in space, rather than bouncing sound off a near surface. Clearly the Studio is intended to point at the listener’s face & it must to achieve any reasonable degree of sound immersion. Regardless I did prefer the sound of paired Echoes with Sub over the Studio + Sub... but not enough to go back to all the frustrating glitches.

No doubt paired Studios would sound better than the paired Echos, but I don’t want to return to the annoying dropouts. Besides for $300-400, a stereo pair of Sonos Ones would be better sounding with rock solid reliability.

Bottom line is I will stick with the Studio because it has been so reliable & good enough sounding for a bedroom. The Echo pair absolutely demanded a Sub for quality music. However the Studio doesn’t depend on it since it has a woofer, unlike all other Echoes. So at $150 (on sale) I would recommend a Studio for a bedroom or kitchen where music will be played, but stereophile audio quality isn’t required. But for a living room or den where you may prefer excellent sound quality, I would highly recommend a Dot & a stereo pair of Sonos One SLs, or better yet the Sonos Five.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Pablo Freddy Man,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2020","I LOVE LOVE LOVE these speakers. I bought two of them and have them paired up. So far it has been amazing. Here's what I love about them:
- In paired mode, the speakers sound incredible. I have tried both ""spatial"" and ""non-spatial"" settings and both sound pretty good.
- I recently upgraded my fire TV to a fire stick 4K and the dolby sound that comes when watching a movie/show is outstanding
- Speaker is so good that I sold off my regular speakers which were really nice, but I truly don't need them anymore
- microphone pickup is outstanding. even if music is playing I can say Alexa and usually it hears me
- When compared to the google mini I had, I notice that the home automation stuff I have is faster. Like ""Alexa turn on kitchen light"" it responds instantly

Cons:
- I have spotify and frankly spotify integration sort of sucks. I can't say ""shuffle music"", i doesn't work. if i say ""play more songs like this"" it doesn't work. playing of music will just stop mid-stride for no reason. even ""play that song that goes shake it like a polaroid picture"" doesn't work. i'm really disappointed with spotify on echo studios. so i tried out amazon music with a free offer, and guess what? of course everything works perfectly. i'm a little bit bothered that i may have to migrate from spotify or change to a different type of speaker. with my google mini, spotify worked perfectly.
- i have my speakers paired, and because of this, using the communication feature of the echo studio when paired doesn't work. i found out it will only work if i unpair the speakers. i submitted a bug but there's been no fix for weeks. irritating!
- the speakers can be buggy. sometimes the speakers will unpair for no reason. i had initially setup my speakers on a different wi-fi network name. so i changed it to the one I want. i went to amazon and told it to not remember any old wi-fi names. but for some reason, they would randomly re-connect to the old connection. I finally did a factory reset and did it all again and now it seems to work without switching back.

Pretty much what I have come to believe/realize is that these speakers are all about the amazon echo-system. I don't see a priority for it to work with spotify because they want you to switch to amazon music. The hardware itself is great, so I may actually follow what they planned and switch to amazon music. But I'm irritated about it. The alexa app is okay, but kind of buggy.

So I would've given it 5 stars, but give it 4. I'm still extremely happy because I love the sound from teh paired speakers. and watching movies with atmos is amazing, like for the first time i feel like you can hear sounds coming from the side or further away or atmospheric sounds. my old home theater system never sounded this good.

If you're a huge spotify user, I'd stay away and maybe go for the Sonos. But if you're ambivalent about your music service, this works perfect with amazon music. And so far with my fire stick 4k the sound with the paired speakers is amazing.",4.0 out of 5 stars

n0nuf2,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2020","Good day Amazon!

So, I've had a pair of Gen2 Echo+ and Echo Sub for some time. I like overwhelming bass in all music; I don't want to have the volume on +10 to feel the bass. The Echo 6"" sub is decent for what it is. I have the two Echo+ and Sub stereo grouped with FireTV Cube for 2.1 sound while watching TV (only from FireTV). Sounds very good for what it is. Now I've purchased 2 Echo Studio speakers as well in hopes the larger drivers will 'fill' the bottom end. Honestly, if you like your head ripped off by too much midrange (1K, 1.2K, 5K, etc), then these are for you; The Studios have no 'heart'. I used to run sound for our band and I know when there's too much of something in the mix; FWIW. I turn the Studio mids all the way down -6 and drop the treble to -2 and set bass to +6 then the Studios sound just 'ok'. So, I paired my Echo Sub with the Studios to see if that balances it out. Nope... No matter what I set the EQ to or turn spatial on or off, makes no difference with any kind of music (3D or not). The Studios actually attenuate the sound coming out of the Echo Sub. Far less bass paired up with Studio than Echo+. I'm seriously considering returning the Studios and getting 2 more Echo+ and another sub. (all of this stuff would benefit from more user EQ and crossover adjustment). In a final attempt to get 'MY' preferred sound out of all of this I created an Echo+ stereo pair with the Echo Sub, then just stereo paired the Studios together, set all EQ accordingly, then created an ""Everywhere"" group out of all of that. In that configuration the Studios aren't attenuating the sound from the sub. One would think that the size of the drivers on the Studio would trump the Echo+ as far as low end, but nope. W/e these things are doing is wrong IMO. It is true that Studio is clearer than Echo+, but to what end? Not a good one IMO... When I turn the EQ to +6 Bass, I expect the thing to thump (within reason for a 4""+ woofer). If I had a wish it would be that Amazon Echo releases an 8"" 800+ watt Echo Sub (with a decent user adjustable EQ) so those of us who LIKE the low end more than screaming mid range can manually shape the sound and get the sound they want. All in all, after trying high-end Apple, Sonos, Google, Bose and a few other expensive options side by side (yes, bought them all at the same time and tried at same time, then returned the others), the Amazon speakers sound the best, and are the clearest. (By the way, don't believe what you hear in the store or the sound demos... The acoustics are NOT the same as the environment YOU will be using them, and their ""demos"" are adjusted to make 'their' device sound better than it is with real music). I wish I knew where to post this comment that Amazon team would read it; probably wouldn't matter. LOL. All aforementioned devices have been tested on a 400GB connection with Amazon Music, Google Music, Pandora, Spotify, several other streaming services, as well as Bluetooth music from multiple devices. Agree/Disagree, there's my experienced 10 cents worth opinion for anyone considering these devices.

I own a LOT of Echo devices and can't wait for new better Echos to be released. I just hope the Studio is NOT where they are going in the future... Don't get me wrong, it's a nice speaker, but not everyone wants screaming mid range. Example, most everyone I've EVER met uses a "" V "" or "" W "" configuration in their EQ. That represents CUTTING most of the screaming mid range. FWIW.",3.0 out of 5 stars
The Queen Bacon,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2020","This is my review for the 2 studios and sub connected the the cube.
Please be aware that I think that the 2 studios and subwoofer are amazing together. The sound is outstanding, my only setback is that I can't connect a bluetooth record player to the group to listen. I can only listen on one of the studios, and no sub. I am hoping that this is something that amazon fixes in the future...

So I had a regular Fire tv that worked fine, we recently purchased 2 amazon alexa studios (amazing sound! kudos amazon!) and a subwoofer. well amazon got us on the hook for an additional $90.00 because we couldn't connect the group to the fire tv, we needed to upgrade to the 2nd gen cube. FINE, we move the tv into our bedroom lol.
Fast forward, well we watch a lot of shows on amazon video, hulu, and sling. MOSTLY recorded things, sound and function 5+ stars! We love that you can control the hdmi ports and everything with the cube remote/alexa by telling her. I Think its awesome, you want to play video games alexa switch to hdmi 3, ok.
So in the mornings getting the family ready for the day, and when I am working from home I love to have the news on in the background. I notice news12 app doesn't work (local live news app) , do everything, delete cookies, cache, delete redownload the app. So im like EFF IT, put on sling, I Guess im effen stuck with fox/abc, well those won't work with live tv either! wait look amazon has a live news app, download that, oh look that doesn't work either. I factory reset the cube, reset everything back up still doesn't work, even tried hard wiring the cube to the internet to make sure it wasn't our wifi (even though we have 2 fire sticks, and a tv that are working fine with all the apps and live tv). Still doesn't work.
Speak to amazon they work me through everything, still nothing works, they send me a new cube. Set it up, didn't connect it to the speakers, live tv works fine, HOOOOOOOORAY LOOK AT THIS LIVE TV WORKS FINE! Now I can catch up on this whole coronavirus news lmao. Time to set up the speaker group (I mean I just spent $600.00 on amazon speakers to use with the tv/music I mine as well use them) . Live news worked for literally 5 seconds, then freezes. We reset the router, hardwire it, update it, delete cookies and did a little dance and said some prayers around it, still nothing worked for live tv. My husband swears its some kind of cube bug maybe that live tv just doesn't work with it, I said ehh maybe its the speaker group (2 amazon echo studios and subwoofer which happen to be the reason I even bought this god damn cube). I forget the group, live tv starts right up.
In my opinion this should be a glitch worked out before making people buy this device to work with all of these expensive amazon speakers. Some might even be like why do you need stereo surround sound to watch to watch the news? I don't.. but what about sports events, or if I decide to watch a show when it airs instead of pre recording? none of that works. So in a weeks time I spend about $650.00 on an amazon entertainment system that doesn't work. I was already upset that I couldn't hook up a bluetooth device to my entertainment group (I would like to play records on the 2 studios and subwoofer) and can't do that, but now this? Amazon please come up with a resolution asap. Once you do, let me know and you will get 1000 stars.",3.0 out of 5 stars

AC,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2019","I have a myriad of Echoes around my open-floor plan house including five Echo Subs for whole-home audio but some of my Echos are 1st generation. When this game-changer, Echo Studio came out, I was hoping to up the ante by replacing my old Echoes with a few Studios so I started out with one.

First, its greatest feature: the room-measuring, self-adjusting, high-tech “spatial” processing must be disabled in order to hear the highs, at least to my ears. That’s okay since I don’t really care about spacial whatever, I just want to crank it up!

One important feature for me is the ability to pair the Echo Studio with my Echo Sub and enjoy the bass from both devices at the same time. After all, for twice the price, I want twice the bass, right? That’s where I ran into problems.

I initially setup the Studio and played some tunes which sounded spectacular. Then, I eagerly set up my sub and paired it to the Studio, imagining what twice the bass was going to sound like. The pairing went fine with no hiccups. Then I added the new pair to my “Everywhere” group which also went fine. I played some music on my Everywhere group where the Studio performed well again BUT there was nothing coming out of the Echo Sub it was paired with.

I paired, unpaired, paired again, deleted and reinstalled both but the result is the same: the Studio vibrates for all its might while the Echo Sub it was paired with sat completely silent. I was heartbroken, wondering why the Studio would play all the bass and deprive a dedicated Echo Sub from playing any of it!

Amazon tech support actually called me to try to sort out the issue and assured me the Studio should, in fact, play nice with the Echo Sub as they have an identical setup in their own testing room. The tech verified on her screen that the Studio and Sub were active and linked together in a sub pair I labeled “TV room sub pair” in the Alexa app.

However, I only over tested the setup by playing music on my Everywhere group. The tech asked me to first play music specifically on my “TV room sub pair” and suddenly my Studio and Sub came alive together! Then, I tested music on my Everywhere group again and lo and behold, the Studio and Sub played together, giving me the bass I wanted.

I don’t know how or why but I learned: 1. Pair the Studio with the Sub and give the pair a name in the Alexa app, “TV room sub pair” in my case. 2. Ask Alexa to play music, specifically using that pair’s name. It is not enough to just walk up to the Studio and ask Alexa it to play a tune because only the Studio will play and the Sub will sit silent. 3. After playing a tune to ensure the Studio and Sub work together, THEN add the pair to my Everywhere group.

Thanks Amazon tech girl!

MSR Workshop,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2019","So I have an interesting review to write. I Purchased my first echo studio from Best Buy and immediately got it home and playing music. I was immediately underwhelmed by the music that was coming out of the speaker and was confused. I had heard so many good reviews and how much people love this speaker. Was I just too much of an audio snob to appreciate it or was I doing something wrong. I repaired the speaker just in case I had messed something up in the set up process and it still didn’t sound that great the base was poor and the sound that came out was very thin at low-volume. Well the speaker did have good sound at high-volume the low-volume sound was very lacking. I decided that there must be something wrong internally so I immediately returned it and bought a second one. The second one I purchased was just as easy to set up. This one immediately did sound better with the immersive sound function turned on. But I am still on the fence overall.

So what’s the hidden problem you might ask? Many reviewer’s have said to turn the “immersive sound” off, And it will sound much better. No reviewer has mentioned yet that when you turn the “immersive sound” off, it turns two of the speakers off. With the immersive sound on, sound comes from all five speakers. With the immersive sound button turn off, no sound will come from the top firing or the front firing speaker. So essentially you are left with a left and a right and a sub to produce music and sound content. WHY, has amazon chosen to do this, I’m not sure? Maybe someone can chime in and comment on this. I would have thought that all speakers on the system would be active all the time instead of just sometimes.

I have a very high-end home theater system and understand how surroundsound works. Only delivering audio to a specific channel if there is content decoded for it. An example would be a 7.1 surround. The 2 rear channels on this type of system may not produce sound all the time, they are there for when, say a plane flies by or a an object goes behind the listener. Another example is the center channel is designed for speech and the left and right are for other sound affects. But..... this all has to do with the processor. In most processors you can choose to have a multi channel stereo sound where sound is sent equally to all speakers. This is not the case with the echo Studio. Essentially the “immersive sound” button turns your speaker into a 4.1 surround , sending specific sounds to each speaker for the surround affect. Turning the “immersive sound” off, you get a 2.1 stereo sound, killing sound from the top and the front firing speaker. Not sure I’m cool with this. I would much prefer a 4.1 stereo sound when the “immersive sound” is toggled off than a 2 channel stereo.

Amazon..... care to chime in?

inger lise,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","Update 3/30/24. I'm disabled and use a wheelchair. This AI Alexa thing has started doing its own routines and hunches and is now turning off my wheelchair charger at night when it's supposed to be charging-because it hears me go to sleep. It also turns lights off at night that I need left on so I can find my wheelchair. It also decides to turn on every light in the house, whether I want them on or not just because I did once.
I thought I had the Alexa hunch issue fixed by deleting all routines and schedules in the app regarding everything! However that isn't a solution either because it turned off the plug for my wheelchair charger again again last night for the fourth time! I woke to a dead wheelchair again this morning! Had to spend the day in bed letting it charge. It's plug had been turned off again during the night! For the app it does this as ""hunches"" and evidently there doesn't seem any way to turn the ""hunches"" off!
Additionally, this afternoon I discovered the Studio Sub was offline because it's plug had been turned off too by Amazon Alexa without my permission! It also turns light bulbs off at night when I need them left on so I can see to find my wheelchair!
So I called Amazon tech support just now to get help. He wasn't much more helpful than Alexa herself. He suggested I remove the routines from Alexa app. When I told him I'd done had I had already done that days ago but it only helped for a bit,, He had no solutions- no answers beyond apologizing. He did ask though if I was using Apple? So maybe this thing is not Android friendly in spite of them saying it is?
My advice is do not get anything relying on Alexa, if you are handicapped or elderly- it extremely dangerous! Amazon AI is not smart enough for disabled or elderly people yet. Alexa also has major issues hearing elderly people who have dentures, or any sort of an accent or speech impediment or stuttering
Amazon should buy this stuff back-way too primitive and dangerous.

+++ February 2024 update!
I've had this speaker for about a month. Also have it's sub. At this moment I'm sitting here spending Friday night typing instead of watching my movie, because the Studio as usual
just disconnected the speakers from the TV with a half hour yet to go on a movie! No sound at all and I can't get it reconnected! The fire stick remote won't work and Alexa Studio just keeps saying something to the effect of ""it's having issues and can't think"".....
So I decided to take a break, calm down, and write this review update! Sadly this happens on a daily basis- the connectivity issue with this thing is real, frequent and terrible! The TV, Studio Speaker and Sub are all within 10 feet of our router! No reason for all the issues! When it's good it sounds amazing- but unfortunately having it cut out in the middle of the movie is nothing but frustration. The Studio also has trouble understanding things. It has trouble understanding the simplest of commands and stops movies or YouTube shows, for no reason, or starts talking about topics or showing topics on YouTube that I didn't even ask for- eavesdrops a lot. If I actually need anything Alexa related I usually go back to the bedroom and ask the Echo Dot instead!
I had Amazon tech support contact me because of my one star original review and unhappiness with this. They were able to resolve the buzzing issue the speakers had. Turns out moving them further away from our older metal filled TV helps. So they're now 5 ft away from the TV and in the middle of the room and the buzzing issue is resolved.
However they're in the middle of the room.....
I find the connectivity issue appalling in view of the fact that everything else made nowadays comes Plug and Play!
Because of this ongoing issue that Amazon seems to not be able to resolve, I still do not recommend this Studio speaker at all!

Original review -
This has been a problem since setup- it's definitely not Plug and Play. You would think that something from the same company would hook up easily together, but sluggish updates and incompatible connectivity issues made it take an entire weekend to set up. And if you move it? You have to start all over again. This speaker is buzzy already and I've only had it a few weeks. Have to keep it at low volume which defeats the whole purpose of having it.
Additionally it's about half as smart as the Dot I have in the bedroom. 'Studio"" doesn't listen or understand me most of the time. For example, I asked it to play Teskey Brothers. And it starts talking about super bowl instead! And it stops the music on the rare occasions it does play what I want- so it can play commercials for things that it wants to sell from Amazon!
I so regret that the return window has passed.

robv14000,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2022","The Echo Studio sounded great for about 10 minutes, until it rebooted itself. Then, after another 10 or so minutes of listening to music, it rebooted itself again. I gave up using the Echo Studio before I could even complete my sound tests. I don't know what caused this problem, so I returned it for a refund as ""defective."" I probably should've asked for a replacement, since all sorts of bad things happen because I chose refund. The first is that I am dealing with AMAZON, and their holier-than-thou automated approach to everything does not (historically) match all the possibilities of reality. I traded in an old Echo Dot for a $5 gift card and 25% off. It is up to me to return the Echo Dot (but AMAZON pays for shipping): I need to cart the trade-in to the UPS Store. Aside from the fact the shipping label is three times larger than the Echo Dot packaging (which I saved), the Echo Studio itself was to be picked up by UPS today. I had that package outside all day, and it was not picked up by after dark, so I brought it back in the house. (I have had UPS pickups that never materialized, so I thought this was the same thing. Historically AMAZON has no way to deal with this ""no pickup"" scenario in their system. It's not like they sense it or anything and make a new request.) It turns out that (later, after dark) UPS did try to pick up the package. I was home, and would've heard if the driver tried to make contact. No contact was made. The driver appears to have left a shipping label. So I have to cart the Echo Studio to the UPS Store if I am ever going to get my AMAZON refund. But what about the $5 (which was automatically used as a credit on the order)? Well, the ""estimated"" refund is $5 more than my credit-card payment, so it looks like I'll get the $5. That means I must definitely trade in the Echo Dot: I am ethically bound. But what of the 25% off? I seem to have lost that. I have no known hope of recovering it because AMAZON makes it so difficult to TALK TO SOMEONE. In fact, I haven't even tried, because I don't want to put myself through the aggravation of trying to battle finding a way to call, waiting, etc. Finally, I had actually ordered two Echo Studio's, but the first one was in a bundle with a light bulb. I tried to cancel this ""first"" Echo Studio, but the automated system will not let me cancel part of a bundle that has already shipped. So an Echo Studio will arrive here, and the light bulb before or after that. But I would now like to -- may as well -- use the 25% discount on this Echo Studio. I see no way to do that. The only hope I have is calling AMAZON. And I don't want to suffer through their automated system. I'd be willing to keep the second Echo Studio (assuming it works), but not, however, if I lose the unused 25% discount. I realize in the old days that if I called in and explained the scenario, AMAZON would probably have seen things my way, and extended the 25% discount to this ""first"" Echo Studio. But those days have been automated away, at least based on my last attempts to call in. So I imagine I will have to wait for the stupid thing to get delivered, and then return it. That leaves open the question of what happens to the bundle. I think AMAZON prorated the costs, so I will have to pay for my ""free"" light bulb. When things work, AMAZON is great. But when they don't work out, it's a nightmare. All I can do now is wait for things to get delivered and then return them. In the end, I get $5 for a traded-in, perfectly serviceable Echo Dot, and I probably lose my 25% discount. This is what happens when automation takes the place of people that have minds. You would think I'd know by now: STAY AWAY FROM BUNDLES. P.S. I wonder where the $5 will show up -- as a gift card or as a refund on my credit card. If it does actually show up, I bet the former.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Robert Danger Byrd,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2023","I have fully automated, high tech and super luxurious AirBNB that I call the Cliffwood Experience in Houston Texas and it is a resort style vibe and we have hosted many famous and demanding clients. I wanted the best multi room speaker system I could get to complete the experience for my demanding clients. I had owned a few Alexas dating back to the original and they always worked great, but not so much for this application...

THE SETUP:
I purchased a mixture of Alexa Echos (4th Gen), Studio Alexas distributed over 10 rooms in this 3400 Sq Ft home. All rooms are setup in a stereo pair, and 3 of the rooms also have Alexa Subs and 5 rooms have Amazon Fire TV 65"" Omni Series and those rooms are setup in Home Theater mode.

My internet is Xfinity is rock solid and fast at 1,000 Mbps down and 120 Mbps up.

The wireless access points were Eero which the Amazon site says ""Works W Alexa"" but it doesn't allow you to force all devices onto the same speed, which support says is required for muilti room sound to work properly. So I ripped out the Eero, and installed the $1,500 NETGEAR Orbi Quad-Band WiFi 6E Mesh System (RBKE963), Router with 2 Satellite Extender which I purchased on Amazon.com. This system is on of the most highly rated by noted reviewers like PC Magazine and Toms Hardware Guide.

I am using a paid Spotify account as well as the Amazon Music Family Plan. The default is the Amazon Music Family Plan account.

THE GOOD:
The Home Theater pairs work flawlessly, and its a simple and affordable way to have an easy to use home theater and the voice control is a huge plus. These are especially nice when you add a sub.

The Alexa Echo (4th Gen) speakers are very impressive for the size and the Studio Alexas sound downright amazing, especially when paired w a subwoofer which all 3 rooms w Studio Alexas are.

Its cool being able to play different streams in different rooms, which became possible when I changed to the Amazon Family play. The standard plan only allowed one stream at a time and it often would refuse to play at all stating that music was already active in another stream even though it wasn't.

This is a very simple and economical way to add theaters, stereo pairs and multi room to your house.

The Alexas work great for controlling lighting, HVAC, and other devices.

THE BAD:
The multiroom music is a disaster, my ""Everywhere"" group that includes all rooms, wont work at all. It starts playing the chokes out a few notes before giving up.

My ""Central Speakers"" group which includes 5 of the Rooms works intermittently. Sometimes it will play for seconds, sometimes minutes, but it always stops. More often than not it crashes after a few minutes.

I am also required to say ""play music on central speakers"" because the feature that allows you to always make a speaker or speaker group play in a room or group of rooms crashes each time I attempt to change it.

I have replaced the Orbi wireless system which was the best I could find, and this allowed me to force the same speed for all of the Alexas and TVs and Subs. Tried forcing all devices to 2.4, which made it worse, but forcing them all onto 5Ghz was a definite improvement. With 3 wireless access points I have very strong coverage throughout the house so the shorter range of 5Ghz is a non issue.

I have spent countless hours on the phone w Amazon support and they always do the same things. Update the firmware, delete and rebuild the speaker pairs, delete and rebuild the groups. Unplug all the alexas, TVs & subs for 30 seconds. I finally put all the network gear, Xfinity router and wireless access points on a battery backup so I could just kill power to everything by shutting off the main breaker to the home and not waste time running all over the house unplugging 30 devices.

SUMMARY
In short, if you want a simple home theater, stereo pair or even a single Alexa to listen to music, or control lighting and other smart devices in a single room these are great.

But if you have a large home and need a multiroom solution, you should look elsewhere. Amazon Alexa solution simply doesn't work for this application.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Edub,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2024","I spent 6 hours on chat with 4 different agents trying to get this thing staying connected. The initial setup was easy. 1,2,3. I did it in my living room. Paired it but it wouldn't play music when I gave a command. It acknowledged me but no music. When I unplugged it to put it in the room I wanted it in, it would not power on. After a few minutes it worked. But I gave the command to test it, ""Alexa play music""...It would acknowledge me and say it's gonna play something but didn't. I tried this numerous times. After about an hour I contacted Amazon chat customer service and told them the deal. The agent said try plugging it in a different outlet. So I did, and it worked, WTF? So I plugged it back into the outlet in the room I wanted it in. Nothing. Had to pair it again. After 5 minute then it worked. The sound was great. I was like ok. But still I may want to move this speaker to a different room, say the living room if i am entertaining or just want to hear some music while sitting on my couch flipping through a magazine. Plugged it in a outlet in my living room. Nothing...WTF??? again. So as time went on and I went through 4 agents I looked at the clock and it was 6PM. I started the chat help at 12:30PM. One agent did a diagnosis and said it was my WIFI. Get outta here with that. I also bought a SONOS Era 100 so I could compare the Echo Studio and the SONOS together.,to decide on which one to keep and which one to return. The SONOS had no problems, unplugging a plugging in again in different locations. Right now the Echo Studio is in the room I wanted it in and it's working just fine. Sounds fantastic. Much more powerful than the SONOS, (IMO) but the SONOS is bad ass in it's on right. Anyway I got a return label and this is going back...I think. I think there is a conflict somewhere in the set up. I have 2 Echo Shows and they work just fine. The 1 star is because of the headache I went through and the waste of my afternoon. the 6 hours I wont get back. But if you get this thing working and stay working the sound is all that!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Minnesotian,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2019","Let me start out my review by saying I have purchased five different kindle tablets and at least four amazon type speakers from the dots to this studio. I am not an Amazon fanboy - but I do enjoy their products and appreciate their pricing. I also gave this speaker its teething period before I decided to write this as I was a preorder 1st day delivery customer.

Let me start by saying if this speaker is going to be used to play music from your 24bit capable phone - its great. The sound is bass heavy and you will very likely be turning it down a notch to appreciate all it has to offer at the higher volumes. That said - where this thing does not shine, is in every other feature.

As others have stated the light bar is at such an angle that you are often peaking at the top to tell if it heard you so often time you just have to assume it does and wait to hear the feedback. Not a deal breaker.

The speaker is large but nothing you wouldn't see in a sub woofer but for a speaker id use like a right or left, its very large as a satellite type speaker without the height of a standard tower that would let you forgive it. - again not a deal breaker.

Now where the deal breaking starts is whether or not this is connected via an optical audio this device SUFFERS with the ebs and flows of your internet connection. It is so sensitive to your internet setting that it cannot even calibrate or produce its calibration audio with less than perfect internet. This is such a true statement, that I actually returned my first studio as defective because AMAZON's technical support and developers thought there was a serious bug in it and had me ship it to a persons name at one of their centers for analysis. I was even asked for video recordings of the bugs mine was producing.

If you have less than stellar internet and mine is 200mbs down cable type internet - my Alexa when asked questions would have her audio clip. After about 10 resets of my modem - calling ISP - and updating software on my Alexa I reduced this from a permanent aspect of my Studio to a 10% occurrence.

So did it get better = Yes. did it go away....no.

You said 24bit audio sounds great? Yes it does. But lets caveat that. If you have a 4k Fire stick. The one they link to in this product description as compatible > its not. Not truly. You can pay for Amazon HD music and get up to 24bit type audio and play it through the studio on your phone. But Amazon HD on your firestick is only capable of 16bit. I have a yet to be responded to ticket for that. Which is why Im finally nail in coffining this device and sending my 2nd one back.

What about use paired to firestick. How does that work? Its a pain. Not undoable, but not intuitive. If you want the studio to have volume UP/DOWN with remote you have to group it into a room AND set a home theatre system up. Not bad but not naturally intuitive. Setting up the speaker to pair with the smart TV or firestick you think would be enough or you could go in the firestick and change the Equipment management = nope. You spend so much time in the app making/breaking connections > its truly maddening.

Stability? Lets talk about that 10% failure rate on this. What this equates to is when everything else is sailing on your internet for no reason the studio will have audio pop while being your firestick audio. Then because you hit pause, to go to the restroom, when you resume the lips no longer sync. OK maybe you just need to go to firestick and set the lip sync once in the setting > false assumption. You will set it and it may work for that resumed playback. But you pause again > back to out of sync. Again maddening. This if where I get into the fishing type comments is no matter how sure you've got something pegged some other variable makes your setup not work and lose all confidence you were even doing the right thing to begin with.

I love amazon products when they work and I wanted to believe in the 3d audioscape of this device but this one is not ready as many have described. If this thing does 3d audio, I cant truly tell, and honestly I don't have the patience to wait any longer to find out because I spend more time on forums and in that Alexa app messing with settings/pairings to make something that should be near plug and play for how long they've been in this smart home hub/speaker business.

All this speaker has done now is make me want to reconsider buying a new nighthawk router and modem > which every other day up to this point I didn't think i needed. And honestly the only reason this thing makes me want to waste more money is to compensate this things very probable lack of readiness for the market. Its just too much of a gamble in this first run.",1.0 out of 5 stars
D.W.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2022","We got two of the Studios to pair in our kitchen to listen to HD music, based on their being listed as the only Echo device capable of playing HD.

Initial setup was glitchy, but finally got them paired. Started playing music, waiting to hear what everyone raves about; and we got meh. Pretty flat standard music. Then one of the Studios started cutting in and out. Called support, they had me factory reset, worked fine for a day or so, then started doing the same thing.

Call support again, all sorts of questions about my router and bandwidth (RAXE500 with gigabit internet). Finally they agree to replace the glitchy one. Well, not exactly replace. I can return and buy another one. But the price I got it for is less than its currently priced at. Oh, no problem, we will give you a credit for the unit, and when we receive it back, give you a credit for the difference (never came).

As to why it doesn't play in HD, no real answer or solution. Wife calls, is told that our current plan, Unlimited Music, was created before the switch to the basic tier having unlimited music. We need to wait for our current plan to expire and re-subscribe. Sounds fishy, but whatever at this point.

Coincidentally, our current subscription expired on Christmas Day. I re-subscribe, still no HD. Yet another call to support. I patiently explain that I have the HD/Atmos/360 buttons to toggle between modes in the Amazon Music app on both my iPhone and iPad. That works just fine, switches modes just fine. As soon as I cast to the the Studios, the button goes away and i have the same flat non HD sound.

I explain all this and support again goes down the rabbit hole of lets do a speedtest on your uplink. From my iPad, right next to a Studio, I get 650Mbps down. Support tut-tuts this result, asking how many other devices I have on my LAN. I explain, again, that HD/Atmos/etc., works fine on the exact same iPad I just did the speed test on, but fails to carry over when i cast to the Studios. I'm then told that each Studio needs (as does every phone on my LAN) a dedicated 200Mbps per device.

So, I'm to believe that in order for the pair of Studio's to play HD, they need 400Mbps dedicated? Umm, no. Sorry. So more troubleshooting. Uninstall the app, reinstall the app. Same thing. Factory reset, rename, regroup, no change. Will...not...play...HD.

Support says ask Alexa to play HD music, she replies playing HD playlist XXX, which sounds just the same as anything else. Support says tell Alexa to stop. I do, she doesn't. Tell Alexa to pause. I do, she doesn't. Unplug them. Hey, they stopped playing music. Support then latches on to this, its a known issue right now, and we have to wait for that to be fixed. Wait a second, how does that have anything to do with playing HD music. Oh, it does, its mixed in. Okay, what about the last 3 weeks with no HD music? Oh, sorry sir, nothing more I can do to help you until this issue is resolved, thank you.

Will someone call me be when this is resolved? Support: we will send you an email. Okay, you say this will be fixed in 48 hours. If its not, you have until New Years, and if they still wont play HD, they are a waste of my money and will be returned. Ok Sir, it will be fixed by then.

Not holding out a lot of hope at this point. Support has been 100% ineffective, the devices don't do what their biggest selling point is: play HD music. Come Jan. 1, I fully assume I'll be returning them.

Don't waste your time. If you've read that Amazon is gutting the Alexa division, it would appear so. From product quality, to support, its not good. Go for the new Echo dot with clock for $40, sounds much better than $150-200 x 2, or even for 1. Oh well.",1.0 out of 5 stars
T. Bingham,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2023","Converted my home entirely to “Amazon” echo and Alexa driven devices, including a eero pro network and echo studio speakers with sub woofer. All devices are engineered, designed, and sold by Amazon, promising full compatibility… but that does not promise never ending wireless issues and related issues on what is promised to be seamless compatibility.

I write this after 2 years of repeated issues and frustration that offer no cure or fix. The same boiler plate response on Amazon forums given by Amazon is NOT a fix. It is a repeated instruction to completely shut down, unplug, and reboot your entire network and all devices; router, wireless network, and all devices. If my home had any non-Amazon (eero/echo) devices I would assume responsibility for some non-compatibility or hardware conflict issues, but this is not the case. I’ve invested 100% into Amazon devices, and regret the investment now as years go by.

The issue; speakers and sub must be paired collectively in the Amazon Alexa app. When the app allows you to pair, without errors, the paired system will work. The issue is two fold. Many times the app will give an error that the speakers or subwoofer are not on the same network and therefore will not pair. Yet, you can look at the erro network and clearly see all devices are connected to the same network and extender. The Alexa app also confirms this. When you try to click any speaker or subwoofer to pair, the remaining devices (speaker or sub) will become grayed-put and if you attempt to choose to pair, it will not allow you and gives the error that devices must be on the same network, when both erro and Alexa apps clearly show that they are. If you are able to set-up and get working, one or more the the devices eventually stops working, and you must un-pair and re-pair the system once again, giving the exact same error message, and no way to pair the devices, leaving you with a single working speaker or subwoofer that may as well be a Echo Dot device at that point, offering no stereo sound or subwoofer… so what’s the point of investing in the studio system?

What’s frustrating is after 2 plus years there is NO real fix from Amazon, putting burden and hours of unnecessary troubleshooting on you, the consumer for a system that does not support of function as advertised, and where I am left with it on this very day, only wanting to listen to music while I work, but left wasting time troubleshooting once again with no resolve and more time wasted letting everyone know my experience. In 2 years, with repeated consumer complaints on the same issue, which you can also see by searching on any search engine, Amazon still cannot seem to offer and a simple update to resolve.

And to make things doubly worse; my Alexa app asked me to re-enter my user name and password only to log into my Alexa app and see nearly all of my devices are no longer listed. Meaning, after taking hours to set-up my smart home as devices were added, I must now do once again from scratch. The lesson I find; these devices and app are not all they promises to be and become a burden to the consumer who bares the time and responsibility to maintain beyond normal expectations where issues reside on the side of the manufacturer and distributor of a brand. It simpler terms; it’s 2023, this stuff should be plug and play by now simply leaving the consumer to enjoy the investment, but that is a fairy tale like the promised that you are purchasing a working devices.

If I had one wish; Amazon… fix it!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Colin,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2024","This might be the worst technological purchase I’ve ever made. Amazon tried their hardest to create a product, and it delivered in the sense that it works. Mostly.

Audio quality? Pretty decent. Can be a little flat by itself, which is why I also purchased the Amazon echo sub. That’s about all the good things I can say about it.

Performance: abysmal. I have pretty internet, up to 400 mb/s. The frequency at which the speaker would lose connection, or if your internet flickers for a second, you’re waiting another 5-10 minutes for it to reconnect to the firestick TV.

On that note: the most baffling thing about this device is how poorly it works with anything Amazon. Want to stream Amazon music through the speaker? If it’s connected to your firestick, it has to use the Amazon music app on the firestick. And inevitably, it will freeze up mid-song, requiring you to close and restart the app. “Just use Bluetooth!” you might say. Good luck. You have to connect to the speaker via Bluetooth using the Alexa app. Remember how I mentioned the Amazon-amazon relationship is trash? Well surprise surprise, using it as a Bluetooth speaker is also an exercise in patience (if and when it decides to work).

The real kicker is this: trying to watch any show on Amazon prime video. This is a firestick tv, plugged into an Amazon-branded firetv, connected to an Amazon speaker system, utilizing an Amazon app. And I couldn’t get more than 5 minutes into the show before the audio would de-sync by 5-10 seconds. Every troubleshooting method, trolling Reddit and the Amazon forums, led me to one solution; replace the piece of ****

Don’t buy this. Buy the Vizio m-class 5.1 system. I’ve had it for a few days, and the surround sound is very solid (actual extra speakers rather than a simulated experience), and a subwoofer that doesn’t boom like I’m trying to wake up the neighborhood (which the echo sub does on the lowest possible setting, which you can only change in the Alexa app).

I hope this was helpful, and if you read the entirety of this novel, and still want it, let me know. I’ll sell you mine on the cheap.",1.0 out of 5 stars
joe/angie,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2021","bought these to replace my aging home theater system. wanted something more compact than a big receiver with less wires running to satellite speakers. Figured this would be the perfect option. Not only is it cheaper to buy 2 and sync them for a stereo pair, but the Dolby atmos sound eliminates the need for satellite surround speakers. I have 2 in a stereo pair connected with my amazon firestick 4k for the home theater set-up. sound is....ok. I previously had an echo plus in my living room that I used for music. I moved it to the kitchen. when I listen to whole-home music, I can hear the bass from echo plus in the kitchen over the 2 studios in the living room. the bass is NOT what they claim it is even with the bass turned all the way up in the equalizer. will be purchasing the echo sub if it ever comes back in stock. They also are VERY glitchy. if I go from listening to music, to watching tv on the firestick, I lose sound altogether. Its like it gets confused when switching listening modes. I have to continuously switch the volume control from the fire stick between TV and home theater system until finally I get sound back. they also get really screwed up if you ever lose power. they wont respond at all without resetting them. then you better make sure they are both working when you think you have them set up again. I lost power one day, and every time I tried to talk to one of the echo's, the light ring would light up in response, but no sound came out. Then I tried playing music and put my ear to it and realized there was no sound at all coming from it. for no reason at all. everything was set up correctly and online. I had to reset it, delete the stereo pair and home theater, then re-connect it as a stereo pair and home theater so it would start working again. Don't even know how long It was like this. there needs to be some serious updated to these. At $200 a piece, I would expect better.

***update*** downgraded to 1 star. haven't had them for a year and sending them back for repair. Ended up being useless as a home theater set-up. had to continually go into the firestick sound settings and turn the home theater off and on repeatedly until they finally worked. Just gave up on this and used the speakers primarily for streaming music. have since added the echo sub which increased the bass, but was only really noticeable with the bass turned all the way up in the equalizer. Now they randomly stop playing. it will start with one speaker cutting out, then the next one cuts out. then 30 seconds later, the sound comes back. it does this every couple minutes rendering the speaker useless. it is not an internet connection issue. they are right next to my router with a strong and stable signal. i have other echo speakers all throughout my 3000 square foot house, and even the one furthest away on the upper level of my house has no issues. i tried switching them to the 5ghz band, and it didn't help. I unpaired them from the stereo pair, and it didn't help. to sum it up, speakers are extremely glitchy with multiple problems, and i cant even use them for what i bought them for as a home theater set-up. going to send them for repair once, and if they come back with the same issue, i will be requesting them to be replaced with the newest generation echo. not worth the money and the headache

***another update*** sent my 2 studios back to amazon for warranty repair for music cutting out. my account page says they have received them, but the status update never changed. it's been almost 10 days. they said i would receive my repaired items or new ones within 10 days. Contacted customer service, and they could not locate my devices. they wanted to send me new ones right away, but i said i wanted a refund instead. I'm not dealing with the headache again. will get 2 of the echo gen 4 instead. avoid these speakers. dont be sucked in by the sugar coated claims of sound quality. too many issues to list. these should be pulled and taken back to the drawing board to work out all the issues before releasing them to customers",1.0 out of 5 stars
Josh,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2019","UPDATE 11/21/19 - I received a replacement unit on 11/13. I set it up and everything seems to be working. I would note that for whatever reason the packaging of the replacement was more generic than what I originally got (the box didn't have the picture of the device on it, just was plain black) and it didn't come with the power cord which I had sent back with the defective unit. I don't care about the box at all but why not supply the power cord??? (luckily for me I had a spare I could use from another device - it's just a generic figure 8 power cord). I did also pair the new device with an echo sub I used to have connected to a stereo pair of Gen 2 Echos. I like the sound from the studio and I definitely can hear the difference in 3D music vs. non-3D music. Interestingly now that it is paired with the sub I don't really notice the Studio being that much better than the stereo pair of Gen 2 echos (with sub) that I used before when playing non-3D music. Granted I'm no audiophile but I'm wondering if it was worth the upgrade when I already had the sub to help the Gen 2 Echos in the bass dept. I debated changing the rating since the replacement works as advertised and I think Amazon customer service was great (although after leaving the negative review below they called me within an hour or two - otherwise I had been waiting for a few days for follow-up), however the whole review/experience may get missed by others if I up the score so I'll leave as-is.

ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW 11/11/19:

I preordered this speaker the day after it was announced. With 8 existing Echos around the house I was more than excited to experience the sound quality from this HomePod killer. It arrived on launch day (11/7) and I immediately went to work setting it up. With baited breath I told Alexa to ""play the best of 3D music"" in order to get the full 3D experience and Alexa repeated my command as a confirmation. Then...... nothing. No music. No sound. Was the volume too low? No, it was set around 5/10. About 30-45 seconds after the initial command Alexa told me ""Sorry, I'm having trouble playing the music"".

Long story short I tried everything - playing different stations, playlists, individual songs, etc. All with the same result. Alexa would repeat my command as confirmation (just like the other Echos prior to playing what I asked) but then there was silence for anywhere from 15-45 seconds before she would tell me ""I'm having trouble playing the music"". I called tech support after running through all the online suggestions (reboot cable modem, reboot router, reset Echo, remove and reinstall Alexa app, etc.). Even though the Studio was in the same spot in my house where an existing Echo pair with Sub was located I put the Echo Studio 6 inches from the router and went through some more troubleshooting with the tech on the phone. I asked the Studio to update software and was told on several attempts ""Sorry, I experienced a problem, please try again later"".

To be clear the Echo does everything else it is supposed to - control lights, answer questions, play the news, etc. It just won't play music (and I'm an unlimited subscriber).

After an hour on the phone with the Amazon tech he was clueless. He pulled some logs to send to engineering team and I've yet to hear back. I REALLY wanted to love this new Echo and the sound quality but right now it's not even up to par with an Echo Dot - at least the Dot can play music.

I'm sure this will get sorted out somehow, either with some update or with the replacement of the device itself. It's just frustrating to wait so long for the preorder, get the device, and have it not work. And Amazon's Echo Studio page is saying it's out of stock until 12/10 so it may be another month before I can have the chance to hear music on a replacement. I hope others that got theirs on launch day didn't have the same experience!",1.0 out of 5 stars
A Reviewer,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2023","Everyone seems to love these speakers, so I guess you probably will too. I loved these speakers at first. But after 8 months, I’ve decided to buy replacement speakers. There are frustrations that are deal breakers for me. (Shuffling music, especially.)

These are fine sounding speakers. One speaker wasn’t loud enough or covered enough space for me, so I got two.

But the pairing only works if you play music from Amazon Music (or use a buggy Alexa skill to play from a supported streaming service).

The only other music inputs are Bluetooth and an aux cord. (No airplay.)

And those other inputs only work with one speaker, not a pair. If you have the speakers paired, then that speaker is only going to play either the left or right channel. And the volume is going to be half as loud. You have to go into the app to unpair and then pair the speakers again if you want to switch between Amazon Music and another input.

And so the limitations of Amazon Music and Alexa skills affect these speakers.

What I want most is to be able to shuffle my music collection. Sounds reasonable, right? Well almost no music system shuffles acceptably well. Amazon Alexa and Music are no exception.

Amazon (and others) only shuffles the first 100 or so songs from the start of the playlist. On my playlist that means only two bands are shuffled. Shuffling works fine in some situations, but if you’re playing music from an Alexa speaker, or from an Amazon app connected to one, shuffle won’t work. Sometimes the app even freezes or crashes.

This shuffling problem also affects when you’re using Alexa and a skill to play music from another streaming service.

Alexa can’t even find or play any of my playlists on the Tidal service. I assume this is the fault of the Tidal developers who made the Tidal skill, not Amazon.

I don’t know why this is so freaking hard. It seems like they load the first 100 songs from the playlist into the queue and then shuffle them in the queue. I would think it should be quick and easy (and not resource intensive) to pick 100 random songs from the playlist (when the user clicks the shuffle button) and no need to shuffle the queue. Maybe there’s something I don’t know, but it seems doable to me.

So to recap — Alexa shuffle doesn’t work. I could fix this via Bluetooth or an aux cord, except THAT doesn’t work. I could fix this with Airplay, but THAT doesn’t work. I could fix this with streaming from the Tidal skill, but THAT doesn’t work! Very frustrating to be blocked at every turn.

This is all unfortunate for these speakers billed as being their top of the line speakers for music lovers at $400 a pair.

EDIT: Less than an hour after I posted this, Amazon phoned me! They asked me questions and said they’d forward my feedback to the development team for consideration. They also let me know there was another product (Echo Link) that might solve my problems. And they let me know the Tidal web site said support for Tidal Playlists via Alexa is coming.

I thought that was really awesome support from Amazon. Kudos to them.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Lutfi,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2023","The sound quality is great! Almost supreme!

However it keeps disconnecting and the only way to fix it is to restart my FireTV stick. If this doesn't get fixed, I am sending it back.

Additional info in the hope Amazon technical team read this and can make some adjustments:
I bought off Ebay for about $50 less an Echo Studio, so now I have 2 Echo Studios and 1 Sub
The pairing with Amazon FireTV 4K Max is a nightmare and here is why:
1) The FireTV is stable when is hooked up to a net hub in my home network. I have the FireTV stick hooked up to a 5 GHz wifi extender
2) The 2 Echo Studio and Echo Sub is like a nightmare in the making to get them to hook up to the extender and stay on the extender... Totally frustrating experience and here is why:
a) I setup the 1st Echo Studio on the same extender
b) I setup the 2nd Echo Studio on the same extender
c) and I setup the Echo Sub on the same extender
3) One would think, they would stick to where you assigned to
4) Once you try to combine the speakers and the sub, I can see one or the two of the units randomly chose either to go with another extender or the main router
5) Go back and reset the one or two back to the extender I wanted
6) If not changed on me, I mate the Echo Studios and Sub with My Fire TV 4K Max
7) I go through the setup on the FireTV Max and It would not complete
8) You guessed it, one of the unit either failed to connect or switched to another network device

So I read on the web and they said to go into my preferences on Amazon and disable password retention. Which I did. Then I had to go all over again and do the resetting and reassignment to the extender.

Now I am experiencing where I hear sounds (awesome surround sounds) but then somewhere watching a movie or listening to music, the EchoStudio disconnects and the only way to regain the connection is to restart the FireTV 4K Max

I suggest the following fixes
1) To lock the WiFi connection in EchoStudio and Sub to stay locked to a device you assigned them to it
2) When a disconnect happens, provide a soft audio connection reset without having to reset the FireTV and reboot
3) To lock the pairing of EchoStudio and Sub, and FireTV into an internal Mesh Network so they have dedicated bandwidth

You expect this to just work, like any of the other Echo devices, of which we have at least 10, Echo, Echo Show, Echo Flex, Echo Dot's, etc. Nope, this thing when paired with the subwoofer will randomly do the following when trying to play music, listed in the order of frequency:

1. You ask it to play your liked songs, it will say ""Playing your X from X service"" then nothing plays.
2. It will start playing music FROM THE SUBWOOFER but not the echo studio.
3. It will take over Spotify! Yes this happened, it finally started playing my liked songs from Spotify, however when I left the house and tried to listen to Spotify in the car, it kept flipping back to playing on the Echo Studio! I would tell Spotify to play on this device (my iPhone) but after a few minutes the Echo Studio took control and started playing Spotify there!
4. It will stop playing audio and just play static! Yes it will play static, like FM radio static, then it goes silent and won't play anything.
5. Try to play music to it via Amazon Music, the app on the phone will allow you to select the Echo Studio, but then after a few seconds it just says ""your device disconnected'. Over and over and over again, to the point I give up and play to a Riva speaker instead.

dadofeaios,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2024","Sound is usually good. Many times just doesn't play at all. Often starts playing and then stops mid song for 20 seconds and then picks back up. Often I only here the Sub's bass and no music. If I weren't so invested in Amazon's music platform, I would get rid of it all. Really disappointed. Amazon must have their C team on their music and its equipment. I would never recommend this to anyone. Terrible.

Update 7/23/24 - I didn't think it could get worse but it has. This is a trash music service and system. It doesn't do any of the things it should. Doesn't play speaker groups properly. Doesn't play the songs the whole way through. Amazon's customer service doesn't give a hoot about it either.

MJS,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2023","UPDATE: Worked well for a while and now all of a sudden the device will not play music from Amazon for longer than 30 minutes, sometimes less, two weeks ago it played perfectly, and now all of a sudden playback is just terrible. As usual, Amazon will attempt to blame my Wi-Fi, but I know it's not because the Echo Dots are the only things that do not play with my Wi-Fi. I think it's time that Amazon owns up to the inferior product.

While I didn't purchase from Amazon, but from Best Buy this speaker has caused me more aggravation than anything. For some reason it doesn't like to play longer than 45 minutes, when giving directions it many times will not connect to its group and songs will play intermittently. The overall sound quality is what I might call ok, nothing special, nothing better than the echo generation 4. Most of my frustration is really with Amazon Tech support, they seem to come up with any excuse other than admitting that the device is only mediocre at best for connections. They have tried to tell me that it could be my router, when in fact I have a Mesh system and generally only 3 devices at any one time, the router has two additional extenders both extenders each in a room where my echo speakers are in, and on top of that I never have any trouble running a 4K TV with no interruptions, so this is not $200 wisely spent, but a poor excuse for a device that is at best mediocre.

I have decided to amend my review to degrade the review, if I could give it a zero I would. I have never had a problem with anything I own dropping my Wi-Fi signal. These Amazon products constantly drop the signal and I have to do a complete reset, at least once a month. Sometimes it actually does a complete reset and sometimes it doesn't. Once I get the reset and I am directed to the Alexa App to finish it, the app will not accept my address.

My experience with Amazon Tech support is ongoing, with them telling me there is a fix coming, or it is the fault of my Wi-Fi, I just don't understand why these are the only items that ever drop the Wi-Fi signal, My 3 smart TV's that never drop the signal, my computer never drops the signal, my cell phone never drops the signal. I usually run maybe two or three devices at the same time using Wi-Fi, and yet the Amazon products are the only ones that continually drop or lose the signal, I would like to say what I really think of these products, but I would probably get censored.",1.0 out of 5 stars
D in California,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2024","I just deregistered my Echo Studio to switch to an Apple HomePod. Why? Because the HomePod will let me listen to my own music. Amazon played a bait-and-switch on Echo users who started with the first devices. The appeal then was that we could upload our music libraries and play them through the Echo speakers in our homes. Then, after Amazon had lots of information on what people listened to, it took away the option to upload our libraries and listen to our own music. Then it took away the option of listening to just the artists we wanted to unless we subscribed to Amazon Music, replacing a request to listen to an artist with listening to ""similar artists."" The MyMedia for Alexa app was supposedly a workaround, but it hasn't been updated in years and the results with it lately have been too frustrating to bother with. So, it is time to say goodbye to Echo as a source of music. It's still useful as an intercom, a timer, and, in a pinch, and Echo Show can be used to watch a movie, but the reason for buying it in the first place has been destroyed by the seller. If you're interested in paying for something that will only play popular music and you don't mind paying a subscription every month — and WON'T play music you already own — this might be the device for you, but it is no longer the device for me.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Tyler H,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2024","I purchased the studio/studio sub & have had problem after problem. If you manage to get them to work, the sound quality is good - but good luck with that. 9 times out of 10 Spotify doesn't recognize that this speaker is on my wifi. If this happens I have to jump through dozens of hoops and pray that it works. Most times nothing does.

It's also important to know, that the sub ONLY works while wifi streaming. If you connect via Bluetooth it does not work - it will only play through the speaker. In addition to this, if the speaker isn't connected to WiFi (whether it be an outage or whatever) it will not connect to your phone via Bluetooth. Making it completely useless.

All in all, the sound quality is great. But it's such a pain in the ass to get everything to work that this speaker & the sub that I purchased separately were a complete waste of money.

Ryszard Kilarski,"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2020","Update on 12/15/2020
It's gotten worse. First, the reboots started happening more frequently: Now they're up to 2 to 3 times a day, including sometimes within 2 minutes of the previous reboot. And just yesterday something new started happening: My volume starts to either go up or go down on its own. I hear the ""beep beep"" as if I'm pressing on the volume up or down buttons, but no one's pressing anything.

I've now unplugged it and am waiting for a replacement. It's on back order, so Amazon a month ago told me I'll have to wait until the end of the year for a new one.

Original Review:

I am... disappointed. First, the good: The sound is great, it fills the room very well and, as you expect, setup and folding it into the Alexa ecosystem is a breeze.

But I certainly have a lot of criticisms. I'm using this as a speaker for my TV, and HERE is where it just falls down hard.

So here are all my problems and complaints:

1. When I use it as an Alexa home theater group for my 4K Fire Stick, it constantly disconnects when I pause my video. Even when it works, I lose maybe 10 seconds of sound before it reconnects. But when I pause video for ""too long"", it doesn't reconnect for... well, I've sometimes waited 30 seconds to a minute before giving up and having to re-do my home theater group. Once I redo my home theater group (basically, just editing the existing home theater group, unselecting and reselecting the Studio, and clicking save) then it seems to work. Until my next pause. This is hella frustrating.

This happens A LOT. The long pause to reconnect happens almost each time, and having to redo my home theater group is maybe every other day. I can't help but compare to my Sonos speakers (in a different home) where I can't even tell it's on Wifi, it ""just works"".

2. So, instead, I tried connecting to the TV directly with an audio cable because my thinking went: if it's directly connected, then maybe it won't do that pause and certainly maybe it won't drop completely. Nope, same thing. It's as if it's ignoring the direct connection and still using wifi for sound.

3. Alright, so I switched to using an Apple TV instead of the Fire Stick. MUCH better: The reconnect time goes down to maybe a few seconds and it hasn't dropped at all. BUT now that I'm using Apple TV, I can't control the volume with my Fire Stick remote. So either I have to do it via voice or the physical buttons (what is this, the 80's?).

4. Now it's definitely better (but it's frustrating that it works better when NOT using the Fire Stick!). But lastly, the wake functionality seems to be significantly over-sensitive. We're watching something, and maybe we make a sound or just move on the couch (not even words) and the Studio mutes the video sound and listening to a command from us. It's just tooo sensitive and interrupts our viewing a lot. I'd like to try to turn off the microphone while watching TV, but then I can't use voice to change the volume! Ugh!

5. Finally, ever since I plugged it into the TV via a hardwire, it seems to reboot a lot. Like, two or 3 times a week. This is not good either.

Yes, I've reset it, I've re-paired it, I've examined my network (I'm a tech person) and it all points to the Studio.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Liz,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2023","I got totally sucked in to building a whole Amazon Echo ecosystem with latest generation dots and a new echo studio and spent 3 days getting every thing set up and communicating with all the other echo devices we've bought over the years, bought the firth device - all in! And every single device has been an absolute nightmare. The change networks on their own, constantly. They reset to default audio settings, constantly. Sit down at the end of a long hard day, and am lucky to have sound through a single speaker. I got completely up to speed on combining speakers into groups and rooms and assigning multi room and home theater grouping and getting everything on the same network. Then it just all falls apart. This is the saddest, worst system I have ever owned. It's really truly quite terrible, and I don't normally get frustrated with tech toys. But this system is the worst. Do NOT ride on Jeff's rocket ship: his engineers can't even get a left and right speaker to work with a tv.

But don't just take my word for it - read the reviews of people who tried to do anything more then stick a dot in the corner of the kitchen. EVERYONE has been having the SAME issues with these devices for YEARS - look for yourself.

So sad: I really wanted to love this tech. And I did, for honestly maybe 2 1/2 hours, and have hated it ever since. Returning what I can, the rest - who knows? not even good enough for music in the garage (the sounds is great, but who wants to take 20 mins to try and troubleshoot every single component to just get a single channel to produce.

How can this be? It's a mystery. Maybe it's part of some evil plan to identify the fool-hardy Amazon loyalists. But why? What is their plan for us, other than to deny us of a simple, mediocre sound experience.

Based on my experience (and I'm really sorry to say this because I really want dto love it), look to something else. This system and its components are way too much work for what they deliver.",1.0 out of 5 stars
GB123,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2024","Update: 5 hours on the phone with Amazon support and still won't work. Even the replacement unit has the same problem. Told me their tech department would get back to me in 48 hours, A joke no call back and it has been 4 days., For music it could be fine, for Fire Stick, no it will freeze all the time and then you get to talk with Amazon support for hours of NO help!

Well the sounds is great, but I'm using it with a Fire Stick 4K and it is the worst experience. Setup was easy, then things went south. First the video on the TV will freeze. (I have 400MB service) and the sound will still pay. You try to go and resume and the sound can be way off. I'm not talking lip sync. I'm talking up to 30 seconds off!!. You can't watch anything. I have reset set the Fire Stick and Echo Studio several times and the same thing happens over and over. You may watch for 10 minutes and the picture freezes. You reset and 5 minutes later it does it again. I had it do 5 times in a 30 minutes program. Today it happened and I unplugged the Fire Stick, guess what the audio continued playing on the Echo Studio. It kept playing until I unplugged the power. So the Echo Show must be getting the audio not from the Fire Stick, but just off the WiFi. So I think this is the problem and you can't correct it. I never had this problem without the Echo Studio. So this is a waste of time and money trying to use it for watch TV on the Fire Stick",1.0 out of 5 stars
Ben Van Vooren,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2022","How about that title?!

I bought 2 echo studios and an echo subwoofer with hopes of using as a home theater setup as well as music source. I should have heeded advice in the reviews I previously read. They stated that home theater integration was frustrating and functionality was hit or miss.

The good - Congrats, Amazon. Sound quality is as advertised.....usually.

Setup and pairing of devices to make this a home theater system was frustrating and annoying, but would have been livable if the functionality that followed was quality. Unfortunately, functionality is mediocre to subpar.

I would say that 80 or 90 percent of the time when I use it to stream my Amazon Music Unlimited, it works well. Voice commands mostly work. Syncing of the speakers is mostly okay. Every now and then, voice commands are problematic for Alexa and we have arguments. Again, semi regularly, the music will just stop playing for no reason or the syncing will be off and the 2 speakers and subwoofer are not in time. If Alexa wants to force feed Michael Buble Christmas music into my ears, despite all my protests, it'd be cool if the left speaker wasn't 2 seconds ahead of the right speaker. I plan on dying from diabetes or heart disease like a real American - not brain tumors.

Onto the bigger, more annoying problems. I'll start by saying I gave tech support a shot to fix this. No dice. Factory resets, firmware updates, spelunking my own way, speaking in Japanese. None of it resolved the issues. When I first turn my TV on and play content, I get a message that states something like ""home theater needs to restore settings after device was powered down"". Doesn't matter if I'm using Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube, or cable TV. This system needs to think about life for a few minutes before it's going to emit sounds. Most of the time, after walking away it will work. A majority of those times, it will even play sounds out of all the devices that are paired.

The last neat little feature - don't even think about trying to use this as a music source and then switch to using as a home theater. For whatever reason, this system just can't/won't play music and then transition to home theater. At least not until I've shut everything off and asked Alexa to stop playing music.

Buy yourself an actual home theater system that is independent from these products. You'll be glad you did. My only regret is that I didn't return these to Amazon.

Note: I think it's only fair to mention that I did not inquire about returning these products. My hope is that Amazon gets the firmware lined out and working better.",1.0 out of 5 stars
GemmaStone,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2024","I wasted approximately $600 on 2 echo studios and a sub. All hoping to have an amazing sound experience. I wad aware in advance I'd also need an alexa device to connect the studios to. Awesome. I already had a fire cube. Everything worked flawlessly on ny 10 year old LG. But after purchasing a very high end Samsung TV was where I ran into problems.
Everything set up and connected just fine. But then at night when I turned the TV off and used my echo studios as sound devices for sleep they kept turning off. Worse than that they'd also randomly begin playing audio through them for no apparent reason.
I didn't know the cause. This went on for 3 sleepless nights till I finally reached out to Amazon.
Get this... their solution...upgrade to the new model studios.
Are. You. Kidding. Me?! Instead of admitting their products are failures with broken hardwares they want me to drop another $609 on the same set up that I purchased a year ago ?!
Amazon is aware there is an issue and won't do a firmware update. I will never buy another alexa product again after this.
Total let down and total dissapointmetn. And worse on a year warranty. If you buy more than 1 of these units...which most do to create a surround system....you will also be flushing away $600 in a year. Sad. Pathetic and they dint stand by their products.

Paul_Mackoon,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2022","Disclaimer: A pair of these were bought solely for the purpose of a home theater set-up for a guest room and that’s how they’ll be reviewed.

PROS: (This part’s quite short)
These speakers sound fantastic for the size. They definitely punch above their weight. Even without the sub, the bass delivered from a stereo pair is adequate and punchy although not as low-frequency as one would hope. Mids and treble are distinct generally until around 90% volume after which distortion occurs. Will that’s it for the pros.

CONS: As a “home theatre” alternative this is HORRIBLE. Maintaining connection is a major issue. Again these are in stereo pair and a home theater created with my fire stick 4K. Multiple times during the week one speaker in the pair will stop playing. I’d have to tap the physical volume button or unplug the speakers to get them working. In the 2.5 months playing these I’ve also had to delete and re-add my Amazon home theatre set up over two dozen times to get them playing again. The hardware of these speakers is impressive but honestly the software is a tremendous deal breaker.
The software also occasionally affects the audio quality. On multiple occasions there’s been a quite noticeable and horrible reverb from the speakers making it sound as though there was an echo in the room.
Now let’s talk Dolby Atmos. You may be tempted to buy these as an Atmos system based on the price. I’d definitely avoid that option (note, Atmos is only available wirelessly through your fire TV and not through optical). I’ve played Atmos content from multiple streaming services and there IS NO DISCERNIBLE BETWEEN ATMOS AND STEREO CONTENT! Quite frankly the fact that these speakers are listed as Atmos, is laughable at best.

OPTICAL? Yes indeed. These are connected to the TV (LG NANO Cell) via a toslink to mini toslink adapter. That reverb I mentioned earlier, we’ll that always happens when I use the optical connection, no matter what audio options I use on the TV. This happened to a buddy of mine too so I know it’s not just my speakers.
The only place where this sort of shined is as an optical output for my Xbox series X. The audio quality and consistency far exceeded that of Amazon’s bogus “wireless home theatre”. It wasn’t without issues however as there was a bit of a lag between the Xbox’s video and the audio.

VERDICT: If you’re looking for a smart speaker that packs a bit of a punch (DEFINITELY WAY MORE THAN A HOME POD) then this may be for you. But as a home theatre, this is a definite flop!",1.0 out of 5 stars
PaulTD,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2024","I was pretty happy with the echo studio, until two days after my return window closed. One day it just began blasting a very loud ad while I was in the middle of a conversation, I couldn't figure out what on earth was happening, but I went and unplugged it. Later I plugged it in to use as the home theater for a firestick. But I didn't unplug it when we finished a show. In the middle of the night...BOOM, very loud ad playing at 3 in the morning!

If it wasn't for this one HUGE glaring flaw, I'd be quite happy with the speaker. Instead, I have to attach it to a smart plug, so I can turn it on and off by voice as needed. But of course, I won't be able to turn it on using the echo studio, I'll have to use another echo or my phone to do that.

Zax.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2023","I genuinely hate the fact that this sounds as good as it dose, because the interface and using it is so beyond frustrating it’ll make your last few hairs fall out in anger. Between Alexa cutting you off while talking and playing some super random song you’ve never heard of, to having to ask 5 times to finally get the song you’re looking for. I’m not entirely sure what has happened with this device as I have had Alexa devices since gen1 echo. I have HomePods Sonos google smart devices. This studio speaker has been the single most frustrating device to interact with its unreasonable.

The sound: it’s actually good, I would say it’s on par with 1:1 sonos SL.
Loudness is fair, I live in a 2 bedroom flat, and set in the middle bedroom (My office) it can be hear throughout the flat at about 50+ volume.
Bass is decent, no where near audiophile level, again reminding yourself this is 1 single speaker unit, it’s decent,
Mids, there aren’t any.
Highs, are auditable over the bass, lyrics are understood, not overly bright and in your face.

If there was a logical way to use Apple Music with this device I’d keep it, I actually would buy a second one and the woofer to go with it, I really liked the design the style the materials, the audio response. It wants to be a good unit in hardware. The software and desire to be proprietary cripples it. And makes it unusable in my opinion. You can link Apple Music with the device through the app, however you MUST use Alexa voice commands to draw music from the app. And the voice commands on this specific unit are crazy making.

Bottom line, till the day comes when Amazon realizes people want to use a music app they’re familiar with and not try to use hardware to sell you on their proprietary app. This and it’s alike devices are useless.

I called Amazon and they are sending a replacement. I am sure it's a refurbished service unit which sucks because mine was brand new and only 32 days old.

UPDATE: The replacement unit was broken right out of the box. While the crackling was not there, the replacement unit which was refurbished, constantly gave the “I’m having trouble understanding you right now, please try again later” error.

I fully reset the unit, rebooted my router and did all the required trouble shooting steps. Same issue. This error is supposed to mean that the echo can’t communicate with the server.

Here’s the kicker, I has an Echo Dot right next to it and it worked fine so there was nothing wrong with my internet.

I called and they said that YOU CAN ONLY GET ONE REPLACEMENT under warranty. Everything is setup to be a REPAIR!

This is the WORST experience I have ever had with an Amazon product and I will never recommend the Echo Studio.

Oh and get this, after the original review, I got an email from Customer Support asking if they could help me and I said since this was TWO DAYS out of the return period, it would be good to get a new unit and not a refurbished unit since they could have issues (foretelling).

FGSouza,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2024","This speaker offers commendable standalone performance with decent sound quality. However, integrating it into a home theater setup with a pair of speakers and an Echo Sub connected to an Amazon Prime TV presents reliability issues. Sound failures, synchronization glitches, and distortion occur frequently, leading to frustration. While the system is impressive when it functions correctly, the unpredictable nature of these issues raises concerns. Consider thorough research before committing to this setup for a Prime home theater experience. Also be prepared for a very limited and frustrating Amazon support.

REVISED: I'm downgrading my rating to 1 star after extensively testing the integrated home theater solution comprising 2 Echo Studios and a Subwoofer for a month. Despite upgrading from a previous setup with 2 Echo speakers and an Echo sub, the reliability remains disappointing. While the newer setup is marginally more reliable, it still experiences frequent sound failures during TV viewing or music playback. Additionally, Amazon support's insistence on troubleshooting the issue as isolated overlooks the systemic nature of the problem, as evidenced by similar complaints in other reviews and on YouTube. Amazon, please address this issue promptly!

UPDATE: After 5 months, my initial review and score remain unchanged. Despite trying everything, including getting a top notch new router, the results are the same. The home theater set up with 2 Echo Studios works fantastically for a while, but then stops, requiring a frustrating re-setup.

In summary, the speakers and sound quality are great when they work. However, using them in a home theater setup (2 Echo Studios + Echo Sub) is frustrating due to low reliability.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Lizardo,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2021","Alexa used to work great. I would tell her reminders for my medicines, plans, games.

She would read my Chirp Audio books for hours while I accomplished many tasks.

She would play music I requested ... with just a few mix-ups.

Those were the good old days.

For the last few weeks, Alexa has decided to control what to do. I ask her to set a timer ... she plays random music I have never heard before. I ask for one song to be played and she plays a different song.

I asked for a Chirp audio book and got a lengthy NPR report. Often now, when I ask for my current Chirp book to be played, she will play a different book.

One time I heard a man's voice coming from my great room. I crept closer and found my Alexa Studio had decided to read a Chirp book in there, even though I had not been in that room that day, nor had I listened to any Chirp books that day. By determining the place in the book the narrator had gotten to, I was able to determine that the book reading had started about ten minutes before I came downstairs for the day.

Today I asked Alexa for the time. Instead of the unit next to me responding, the one downstairs responded... and I was too far away to hear the answer.

A timer went off. I told her to stop. It took several minutes repeating the command to get her to turn off the alarm. Sometimes loud works, sometimes a whisper is best.

Now when I asked her to add time to my timer, she listens as well as a doorknob....not at all, despite many repeated requests.

I told her she put me into a negative mood. She gave me a very very long monologue on what to do with negative influences. She would not stop until she was finished, no matter how many times I told her to stop. (Which had always worked until last month.) I then told her I have feedback. Instead of putting me into feedback mode, she played an extremely loud and abrasive song on Spotify. She would not turn off. I told her two dozen times to stop, at increasing loudnesses. I finally got her to stop by turning her off... and that is the way she will stay.

After all, Alexa told me to get rid of the negative influences in my life.

My throat now hurts from yelling at Alexa to stop.

All my units cooperate less now, but the studio is by far the worst. And the studio is only two feet from me.

Time to get an ice cream bar to hopefully sooth my throat.

It would just cut off..... skip songs... only play half of a song and then just stop. I ran an internet speed test and my speed was great. I called Amazon and did all the trouble shooting with the tech and they sent me out a new one.

Now since I had a working unit for 8 months I knew how Alexa was supposed to act. Well this one was doing half white circles while I was asking it something. It was spinning blue and blinking red. It was just acting weird, slow, lagy, and different. I was having issues with my Playlist only on my ECHO studio.... the Playlist worked fine on my phone and cpu via wifi. After I called to complain about unit #2, I asked if this was a refurbished unit and was told yes. The 2nd rep made me run more trouble shooting and ultimately blamed my internet.

I own NINE other Echo smart speakers from the Flex all the way thru the regular Echo but I've always been very curious about the Studio. We were pretty much snowed in this morning and on impulse (how we buy many of our Amazon purchases) we decided to order this speaker early this morning and have it delivered today. It came basically when it said it would but wouldn't connect to our WiFi. After at least half an hour trying the hacks we found online we called customer service and spent at least another 45 minutes trying the same exact things under their supervision. That didn't work either and ultimately they told us we would need to send it back but not to worry as they would send us another one on Friday. Today is Monday. Additionally, we would need to take it out of our way to a UPS outlet. I've been a Prime member for over 15 years and the service (mostly delayed shipping among other issues) has continually gotten worse, especially over the past year or so. I no longer see ANY true benefit to Prime membership and will be canceling that as well as my Prime Music subscription. Too bad. Amazon had a good concept/idea that they've allowed to deteriorate until it was no different from any other online retailer. So long, Amazon.

Update: The replacement speaker (remember the defective original was delivered to me in 6 hours on Monday) is in Illinois (originated in South Dakota) right now according to tracking info despite being scheduled for delivery tomorrow. Also, a small optical cable that I ordered to connect it to my Sony television that is ALSO scheduled for delivery tomorrow left Salt Lake City (where it originated) and is now in San Bernardino, California. Amazon is insane and I doubt I will get my replacements anywhere near when they promised (five days afterward). Amazon Prime is a ripoff and a bait and switch.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Jeremy J,"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2023","If you are looking for an expensive paper weight, this is your device. It can do nothing else. I have more detailed info below but here is the executive summary: it sounds like crap and if you can get it to sync, it won’t stay synced for long. Amazon “support” will not help. Once you get past the chat bot, the live support is even worse, and a BBB gives up quickly.. I assume because Amazon has too much money.

My studio keeps failing to play from the digital input. I have to unplug and plug back in weekly. I have contacted support 2 times now and it is awful. They keep asking very obvious follow up questions and are suggesting the reason it doesn't work is because I have it paird with the Amazon subwoofer. I can no longer return either some I'm stuck with these paperweights. DO NOT BUY.

Update: this product still sucks. The bass response is horrible, adds no value to the already poor quality output of the echo studio.
It’s so greedy for Amazon to try to operate in this genre, they have some good products, but they constantly fail with electronics and don’t seem to care that they sucks.. they will provide poor customer service until your are out of the return period or just exhausted.

Update: Amazon as continued to waste my time and refuses to give a refund. They are also giving inconsistent information based on who you talk to. One support person said the issue is that I paired this with their sub-woofer.. which is the purpose of buying the sub. The other “support” person said I can pair, of course, but offered no reason or solution of why my Echo stops working.

It simply stopped working. I’ve called customer service several times and they never suggested sending me a new speaker. I was even told that it was my Internet service providers problem and I needed to call them. My Internet service provider tested everything and nothing was wrong. I left the speaker unplugged in hopes that reconnecting in a free weeks would work. I reconnected it and still cannot get the speaker to reconnect. In fact it won’t respond to any button pushing or voice commands. Conveniently, now that the warranty has passed, the representative tells me I need to purchase a new one and there’s nothing they can do about it. Even though the issue was reported before the warranty expiration, I’m still required to spend more money. They are very capable of sending a new speaker, since Amazon is worth $1.88 TRILLION, but simply because “time is up” on an invisible “line in the sand” called a warranty… They refuse to replace it.

John,"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2021","Ironically, will not function properly with my Amazon Music HD paid subscription. I successfully paired two Echo Studio speakers and an Echo Subwoofer to my 400mbps/second cable wifi network. When playing music, the songs would stop playing up to once every thirty seconds then begin playing again after about ten seconds (like the echos were buffering my music).
Additionally, every other to every fourth song would play the entire cut at a very low, almost inaudible volume then play the next few cuts normally then repeat playing another full song at low volumes.
I troubleshoot the problem using every suggestion my extensive research found (unplugged and replugged the hardware, reset all three devices to factory default, insured all three devices had the exact same setting on the Alexa App, disconnected all three devices from my account then reconnected, insured all three devices were using the same 5 or 2.4 bandwidth by disabling one or the other from my wifi modem, did a speed test at the location of my devices, grouped the paired devices on the Alexa App and un-grouped them, etc…).
Amazon’s help service was exceptionally unhelpful. The chat service was a joke. The telephone service after two days and four calls eventually opened a repair ticket and admitted that their engineers were working on a solution to a known problem like the one I was experiencing (Case ID: P51661713). Once I had a repair ticket open, a tech insured me she would contact me when an update was available which ‘should resolve my issues’. As an Amazon Prime member, I had a month to return my echo devices and in that time frame Amazon engineers were unable to get my devices working even after a new update had been installed on all three devices. I have yet to hear back from Amazon customer service. I was so dissatisfied and frustrated of listening to my paid Amazon HD Music service under substandard conditions that I returned the Studio and Sub for a refund and am likely to cancel my Amazon HD subscription.
Oh, and as a paired set, your studios will not be able to connect to blue tooth.
My attempt to find a voice control solution to a reasonable sounding three speaker system has been a flop. I looked at the Sonos speakers as an alternative but not only are the set of three speakers outrageously expensive but my research reflected that customers complained that they loose technical support and updates after about five years… no thanks Sonos:

Donald Eddins,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2022","We purchased the Echo Studio and sub together.

First issue, if you play through the Studio speaker by itself it sounds good. Expected much more considering we used to a 2nd gen Echo. The bigger issue is when you connect the sub it seems the sound out of the studio speaker has a crossover function kick in. When this happens you lose the fullness out of the studio speaker, all of the lower end sounds come out of just the sub. If the studio continued to play the full sound with the sub added it the two speaker combined would sound really really good. When contacting Amazon about this, they say to use the sound control functions in the app. This is a function you cannot control. I’ve been a critic of quality sound for many years, my opinion buying the sub was a complete waste. The only reason for giving 2 stars for sound quality is the single studio unit sounds decent by itself, key word - decent(far from great, and that’s comparing it to the 2nd gen echo, slight step up)

Next, a whole list of issues;
- The unit often gets stuck playing the same song over and over.
- Normal voice commands don’t work, our original Echo works fine with all voice commands or questions. This unit seems to not understand even the simple commands or interaction. It’s so bad we feel like this is one of the first devices ever developed with voice commands.
- The voice interaction is usually logged. With my old unit I can look in the app and see everything. This unit rarely logs the interaction. Back to the last issue, when I look through the history of commands to try and find the issue, none of them can be found.
- when contacting Amazon about the problems, they directed me to do a software update, we did, did not correct any of the problems.

Overall, complete and total waste of money. The amount of money spent on the two units should have delivered better quality sound and followed basic commands without the problems we have. My wife is one of the most patient people I know, today she finally lost it with the unit. We have now unplugged the unit and placed it in a box for the next yard-sell. Now looking for other options.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Harry Sachz,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2019","After installing the update (that took an hour) it still won't consistently play music. I don't know if this device is ready for primetime as this seems like a common issue.

I was very excited for this one as I use my original echo daily to listen to the radio or music. Little difference between this device and the original when it comes to listening to talk radio like NPR or news streaming. The music that it did play sounded better than the original echo (much of the difference was an increase of bass). It sounded good when it played music.

I have returned it because of the inconsistency and lack of functionality. I opted to not get a replacement though because I have my echo spot hooked up to a Boston Acoustics speaker that sounds as good and it's cheaper than the $200 For this speaker.

Having used this ""studio"" version, I would recommend hooking up your old Alexa to a quality speaker instead of spending the money on this one. I find this to be a much more versatile option. Plus this thing is huge and didn't fit in the place where my original echo sits.

My experience with Amazon customer service this time was horrible!

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2023","2 weeks ago, we needed to replace our TV. Decided to go all in on the whole Amazon setup. 55” OLED Fire TV (so we could ditch our 1st gen Cube), 2 Echo Studios and 1 Echo Sun. With all the promo about creating a surround sound system wirelessly with all the above, we hoped to be amazed with the sound and integration. Unfortunately, we’re very disappointed. Getting everything up & running was a bit glitchy, but finally got it all working. Upon startup, the Studios & Sub put out some amazing theater-like sound, then after calibration, everything just sounds like a better quality tv speaker (our 4th gen Echo w/premium sound has more bass alone). Our cheap LG Soundbar w/ wireless sub from Walmart 5 years ago under $200 had better sound (already given away to a friend😒). We have changed as many setting combinations as we can to try to trick the system into putting out the sound it’s capable of but nothing improves. The equalizer in each of the speaker settings does nothing to help. We paid $450 from the 2 Studios & 1 Sub (the Studios were on sale that day). When I decided yesterday to return them to Amazon, they will only give $139 back (first time ever trying to return something to Amazon that they didn’t give a full refund). So I’m stuck with them and will probably just sell them on NextDoor for a little less than I paid. I’m sure 1 Echo Studio (alone) would sound great in your bedroom for just listing to music, but DO NOT purchase as a replacement for a soundbar or other home theater sound system. If you have $500, apply it to anything else. We love all the other Echo devices throughout our house (10?), but the 2 Echo Studio + 1 Echo Sub is a very regrettable decision.",1.0 out of 5 stars
rogisem,"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2023","I want to love these speakers, but attempting to use them for their home theater purpose has been a nightmare. For one, make sure you have an HD TV with an ARC enabled HDMI output, which you've toggled on. Next, you need a premium 4K Firestick to get it to feed audio to your speakers on anything outside of the Alexa TV app interface, such as video games. After that, you need to sync all of them properly to the same wifi network, in the same speaker group, with the right acceptable speakers, and then switch your TV sound output. If you're lucky, it'll work. And for me, that often lasts about 10 minutes to an hour until connection drops, for some mysterious and various reason, and its a pain to get it back. One of the only solutions I've found is to unplug all of my electronics (modem, TV, speakers and sub woofer), and then turn them all back on. This is a pain. This is without a doubt the most frustrating, and expensive, non-working surround sound I've ever used.

Update: still the same issues- very poor at sensing input changes from TV- you have to learn very funny techniques to trick the input into fixing itself, such as restreaming audio through your TV and then switching audio back to HDMI-Arc again to reinitiate. Other small features are frustrating- if you begin to stream audio through the Prime music app, it will suddenly switch to the Alexa app, and you have to toggle to that app to navigate music. You cannot fast forward or rewind streaming music through the speakers without opting for a higher grade music subscription. And the list continues. If you're looking for a surround system, I would look elsewhere.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Public Name,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2023","I was really excited to get this device. In fact, when the first one Amazon sent got stolen from my doorstep within an hour of delivery, my heart broke. Thankfully Amazon sent me a replacement the same day.

Sadly, I've had it for about four days, and by day 2, there were already a few glitches in the sound every now and then. Today is day 4, and I literally cannot listen to anything on it because the glitches are incessant. The sound cuts off every other second.

Additionally, when it worked better, it was unresponsive to most voice commands. I mainly wanted it for music, so I had to control it from my phone, which defeats the purpose of having the Alexa feature.

I reset it to factory settings, but that did not help at all.

Now I'm trying to get another replacement, but when I spoke with Amazon customer service, they said I couldn't replace it, I have to return it, and that ""I am free to get another one if I want to.""

Then when I asked if I could drop it off at the nearby Amazon Hub to return it as I've done with other returns, I was told that I couldn't. That HAVE TO drop it off at UPS, which is more difficult for me to get to because I don't drive.

Safe to say, I will not be getting a new one just purely based on the frustrating customer service experience I had. The trouble this device has caused me is not worthwhile. I'd much rather keep my $200.

UPDATE: i bought another one and it didn’t even connect to the wifi so it’s just a really heavy paperweight i will be returning. This one is also a replacement of a third one that never made it to my house because it got lost in transit…

Update 3/24/24: Keeping it one star. I fixed this trash, Looking over it after disassembly, Just wow Low quality solder, dollar store even. The vibration's from the speaker alone will detach most of the points. The power supply while it didn't fail (surprised by this giving its quality) I can see why many would have this as a point of failure. Amazon refuses to acknowledge this despite it being a wide spread issue. Almost like they knew they were selling a 50 dollar speaker for 200 bucks. Governments where amazon sell should look into this. Mismanagement at best and scamazon at worst. Scamazon Subprime would be the perfect moniker.

Update 3/23/24: She's dead jim, seriously a ""premium"" speaker should not die after a year. As with other reviewers I have seen that's about all you will get out of this piece of S###.

Thomas,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2021","This smart speaker is the best speaker’s idea but in the meantime it is the worst speaker I’ve ever owned.
The best because this was my dream coming true. Decent design, not large but also large enough to produce a good sound with basses. Good for music and good for tv/movies as a sound bar.
Just what I was dreaming for. Something clean that I can put on my entertainment stand in order to have a very minimalistic design.
In order to use it plenty you have to pair it with your Fire Tv stick or cube,... And for the music Amazon Music is the way to go, since you can cast/stream the music. Very convenient.
Unfortunately, do not expect to cast your music from another app unless you’re ok to go through the Fire tv app but that means it turns on the Tv.
Besides this little inconvenience, the idea is great!
But I would stop here and just rate it 5 stars if only this would work well.
In about 10 months I’ve bought this speaker. I haven't spent 3 days in a row with no issue with this. This is literally the most time consuming device and nerve racking I ever experienced. And the reason for that is because I wanted to love so much.
Here are the issues I’ve encountered since :
Dropping sounds randomly when watching TV. Sometimes just a few sec sometimes more and very often this issue can be resolved only with a complete restart of the Fire tv.
Volume unresponsive
Lately, the casting music through the Amazon Music app is choppy and has become impossible to listen to.

As of today, pretty much nothing works fine. I have a speaker that can’t play music through Amazon Music and that can’t pair flawlessly with a Amazon fire tv.

Besides the time I’ve spent trying to fix that. I can’t count how many time I unplugged, restarted, unpaired/repaired, cleared the wifi, changed the wifi settings, factory reset,...
I also spent hours over the phone with Amazon support. Nice people. They do their best but for every intervention I ‘ve had I never had any update from them.

Still no resolution and no additional information from technical support. They may be done with me. I no longer am using the Studio with my Fire TV Cube.

The issue that I have is there becomes a video/voice synch issue after watching certain shows for a while. My set up is a Fire TV Cube and also an Amazon Recast DVR with the Echo Studio. To temporarily get rid of the synch issue, I have to restart the Fire TV Cube, but then there is no sound from the Echo Studio. So I have to unplug the Echo Studio and plug it back in. Then sound works again. Some days I have to do this more than once a day. As far as the sound system, when it works, the Echo Studio is great for movies and music, with a couple reservations. For music, the sound can be great. However, only some Amazon Music apps give you full quality. You don't get full quality from the Fire TV app, but I do from my phone app, or directly from the Echo Studio. For movies, the Echo Studio has good sound and a pair of them is much more immersive. However, two Echo Studios do not work as a pair when you are playing a movie through a disc player (I have a Samsung 4k bluray player). Only one Echo Studio works (The one with the cable into the player). The quality of picture and sound is better when playing a 4k disc versus streaming, but unfortunately sound only plays through one Echo Studio.

So disappointing as Amazon typically has rock solid devices. This one is flawed, do not purchase! Previous-I really wanted this to work and the sound isn't too bad for the price. However it was frustrating to setup and get connected. I have had or purchased over 12 Echos and am currently running five Echo Dots of various generations. All connected flawlessly when first purchased and they always stay connected, some for over a year.
The Echo Studio has been a frustratingly negative experience since I removed if from the box. Very difficult to get connected and does not integrate well with the Alexa app. The instruction video is worthless and just promotes whatever song they want to promote at that moment. I have never had some many connection issues with a wireless device as I have had with the Echo Studio. At the most, it works for a few days and then the high frequencies will disappear and it will hiss or only play low frequency through the connected Echo Sub. I either have to power cycle my router, the Echo Studio or both just to get it to work again.

Well it doesn't work!

Basically its worthless for home theater use with Amazon's own Fire TV edition tv's

Can't connect wirelessly to FireTV edition as a home theatre in the app, as alexa app won't permit it, says not compatible.

So as work around, Bought a toslink to mini toslink cable and connected to Toshiba FireTV edition tv that way and it still stinks, you can't control the volume with the tv remote anymore, So i would need to buy another remote and give up the single remote which ruins the whole FireTV built into the tv all just works experience.

Didn't even get to the point of attempting to mate a second studio to the first to try and at least get 5.1 out of it (Amazon website, while totally unclear, seems to say the toslink input can NOT be shared anyway). Gotta go cancel my second order.

Even if pairing two does work, the second remote experience is probably a deal breaker. But the web is clear 3d and Dolby atmos wont pass over the toslink optical anyway. Just all around disappointing mess.

Epic fail that the most expensive top of the line echo speaker doesn't work with most expensive top of the line fire TV devices.

My issue is I bought this under prime it’s an Amazon product. I returned it and now have to wait up to two weeks for them to process my return. I don’t get it. You can charge my card in the second, but you don’t give me my money back for something that was defective and broken, and clearly not worth the money paid for it.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2022","Update, one year after purchase. After resolving connectivity and pairing issues with Echo sub (still not consistent, but better), I have now discovered these devices will not pair with my Bluetooth turntable. The Studio itself will pair but I’ve read that my turntable will not connect with both the Studio and the sub, therefore I do not get the rich sound I was hoping for. I could spend another $200 for the Echo Link (which also gets spotty reviews) to make the entire system work together. Wish I would have returned it a year ago. Go for the Sonos speakers and steer clear of these devices that over promise and under deliver.

My husband gave me the echo studio and sub for our anniversary. My best advice - go read reviews OUTSIDE of Amazon because feedback on the interweb is similar to my experience. The studio won’t play music half the time. It says it’s going to play what I’ve requested but instead I get silence from the echo studio but can hear bass from the sub (so something is working). The other half of the time the device only plays about 30 seconds of a song before it just stops. My wifi is fine and my suband Studio are not close together. I have 2 other echo dot devices on the same floor that have zero issues. Amazon’s idea of troubleshooting is telling me to unplug/restart or reset my WiF. Save your $$ or better yet, spend your $$ on a Sonos One. It won’t be as loud but the sound is much richer and it will work better than the Amazon device.",1.0 out of 5 stars
medpeds,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2021","I bought a BRAND NEW Echo Studio on November 22, 2020, and waited nearly a month before my purchase finally shipped on December 19, 2020. It set up very easily and was connected to my account without problem. Within less than a week, every time I asked ""Alexa"" to perform a task (eg. play music, play NPR), she would start the task briefly and then freeze with a loud annoying buzz and would fail to respond again, until 1) she seemed to reset herself, or 2) I unplugged her and plugged her back in. I phoned and spoke with tech support for Alexa devices (outsourced to the Philippines) with whom I spent about an hour on the phone, while he coached me through various attempts to fix, including resetting the device. None of this worked. I asked for an exchange, and when I *specifically asked* to make sure I'd be getting a brand new device, he said yes of course I would get a new device. Well, he LIED. Amazon tech support LIED. What I ended up getting in return was ""Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa - R"". The ""- R"" means REFURBISHED! I bought a BRAND NEW device, had it for less than 1 week, was lied to about the replacement being new, and ended up with a REFURBISHED device. There is terrible customer support! Why not just return the defective device for a refund and re-buy a brand new one? Because when I bought it on November 22, it was a special deal for a cheaper price, bundled with two ""free"" Phillips Hue bulbs. It's back up to full price now. That said, see for yourself in my video (taken just today before I return the defective unit to Amazon).

Dan L,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2023","I purchased the Echo Studio in January to replace an Echo Plus that I had for several years. After nine months I must report that it has been a disappointment.

When it arrived it worked great, but after a few months’ things started to fail. I use the wake-up word Alexa, which seems to work about a third of the time. You must face the machine directly and can’t be too far from it, otherwise it doesn't respond.

It will only play Amazon Music or any other internet service for only a few minutes before it goes silent. If you tell it to continue to play, it will continue to play on the same station, but for only a minute or two. In another part of the house, I have an Echo Plus and don’t have this problem.

I have paired the Echo Studio to my phone, and I am able to play Amazon Music or other internet services through my phone, using the Echo Studio as a speaker.

While the Echo Studio is still able to turn lights on or off and add or delete items on my shopping lists, you do have to repeat your commands often.

If you want an Echo, I suggest you purchase another device and not the Echo Studio.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Jadon,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024","For a product that costs $200 from 2022, you would think that having a rock solid bluetooth connection would be a number one priority. And yet, when I connect this to my phone or PC, there is an UNACCEPTABLE amount of stuttering. Multiple times each song, the audio will cut out for about 0.5-2 seconds. These stutters make it genuinely impossible to enjoy what you're listening to.

What's sad is that despite the large difference in sound quality, my $60 soundcore boost from 2017 is a preferrable listening experience over this because at least it can play a full song without stuttering. I really wanted to like this but I will be returning and going with some sort of regular bluetooth speaker.

Also, even if you are not phased so far, be WARNED that compared to regular bluetooth speakers this an insanely frustrating pairing experience. I see it say ""connected"" on my iPhone, but when I ask Alexa to pair or click pair in the app, she says nothing was found several times in a row. And again, even when you get it to pair, the listening experience isn't good because of the stutters.",1.0 out of 5 stars

You can no longer tell Alexa to play anything from your Apple Music library. I just bought two of these last year and now they don't function correctly. I can't get a refund or any support regarding this problem. Support contacted me because of this review and sent me an email with a bunch of stuff to try that I had already spent hours trying (none of it worked).

A brief history of my technology history is listed below should anyone want to see what I mean when I say that I am no novice. I've also spent hours with tech support chatting.

I had a home computer, an apple II+, in grade 11. I've done well in college courses in english, Windows and Mac (101's) while attending community Colleges back in the 90's. I've had all the game console stages sometimes more than one brand at a time. I loved the Wii and the the Xbox 360 in combination with a 7.1 surround sound system back in the 2000's. I did not hop on the cellphone train until I bought a brand new iPhone 3 I rode that train for around 6 years and now have switched to android but have not kept up with the latest models since and now have a Samsung A73.

I have 2 studio speakers and a sub running through a fire TV. There is no volume control for the sub, which is disappointing. I get crakling from the speakers while streaming from the TV, this includes the connected Xbox. I have to unpair the speakers and then create a new home theater, next I have to restart my TV in the device menu.
The other issue is no sound at all. I can turn the volume up and down but there is no sound. At this point I have to unpair the home theater, unplug the studio speakers, and let them reset. Then plug them back in wait for them to connect to the wifi. Then I have to create a new home theater. Sometime I have to do this multiple times.

Incognito,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2020","I have had echo devices since the original. I purchased this speaker from Best Buy last holiday and have been using it for approaching 11 months. I have a mixture of Shows and Echos and Dots and the one Studio throughout my house. I have held off on a review in hopes that the problems with the speaker would have been fixed, but they never have been.

The sound quality is great when it works.

Initially the setup literally broke all of the connected devices voice functionality in my house. The integrated bridge wanted to rediscover every individual device instead of using the existing bridge everything was connected to. Maybe I did something wrong but I set everything back up and it sucked but it was fine.

Initially it seemed to work well and the sound quality was great. This was followed by 11 month of absolute unreliability.

At least twice a week I will come in and the speaker is unresponsive and lighting up like it’s looking all around and never working. The microphone array, which at first was by far the best out of all the echoes I have at picking up through loud music and talking quietly, almost never works.

I can be in my living room and say Alexa and be 3 feet from the studio and it will light up but never respond to anything unless I unplug it and plug it back in and then it will work for a little while before it has the same problems again. I talk a little louder and the old Dot I have in my bedroom down a hall and through a wall will come on and respond while this guy just puts on a random light show. It is not connectivity issues, it’s about 10 feet away from a new high end router which has been upgraded since I had the thing with the same problems.

Sadly, the mic and voice recognition is terrible on this thing. Our echo in the living room answers at least one question for us a day even when we are facing the studio one in the den, 6 ft away! The living room Echo is 20-30 feet BEHIND us and hears the question and answers it! Everyone know it is a waste to try customer service so just wanted to get it out there.

Jeff,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2022","Where do I even begin with the Echo Studio? This product is an absolute disappointment in every sense of the word. I had high hopes for this so-called ""high-fidelity"" smart speaker, but it fell far short of my expectations.

Let's start with the sound quality, which is touted as one of the main selling points of the Echo Studio. Well, I can confidently say that the sound is far from impressive. The bass is weak and lacks depth, the mid-range sounds muddy, and the highs are often distorted. It's as if the audio is coming out of a cheap, low-quality speaker instead of a high-end device. I've heard better sound from budget Bluetooth speakers.

The price point of the Echo Studio is completely unjustified. Given the subpar sound quality, performance issues, and design flaws, it's shocking that Amazon has the audacity to charge such a premium price. I could have purchased a much better speaker at a fraction of the cost. In fact, I did. I own the Amazon Echo (4th generation) which has stronger bass and a more balanced sound at half the price of this mistake.

In conclusion, I regret purchasing the Echo Studio. It fails to deliver on its promises of superior sound quality and seamless performance. Save your money and look elsewhere for a high-quality smart speaker because this one simply doesn't cut it.",1.0 out of 5 stars

The product description doesn't help. It says is has 3.5mm TOSlink. Okay, technically they are correct, there isn't a comma between 3.5m and TOSlink, meaning it is a mini-TOSlink, but they could have just said mini-TOSlink and left out 3.5mm to avoid confusion.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Jeff lane,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2020","The sound is FLAT.... With the equalizer adjusted all the way(which is a joke because there’s only three settings bass, mid range and treble) the sound is like a $25 blue tooth speaker you buy at Walmart.
I purchased 2 of these and now they are basically echo device.
If you’re seriously considering getting this because you think it will be a 360 surroundsound experience or something of that nature you will be heavily disappointed.
My problem is I bought these didn’t use them right away and once I started I only had a week to play with them. And now it’s too late to return them. I would rate the current value of each one of these devices at no more than $50 and the price is only that high because you can use them as a hub. Huge disappointment again. This was their second attempt at some cool surround sound with a Alexa hub I don’t know if anybody remembers the echo bass speaker, but that actually sounds better.

Amazon makes a lot of good products, This one though they got completely wrong again. Please Amazon if you decide to make another version of this have some of your quality control guys listen to the device before they sell it on the market. And if those guys don’t come out of that room after listening to the music with a smile on their face then you know you did not get the speaker right again.

Daniel S,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2023","I bought two Echo Studios, an Echo Sub, and a Fire TV thinking that it would go well with my Alexa-powered smart home. Trusting Amazon to keep decent firmware on its products is the biggest technical mistake I have ever made with any purchase. I have never spent so much time reaching out to support, pleading with them for any kind of assistance. The devices require a connection to the same network for synchronization to work, but little did I know that the devices would constantly create virtual networks that would cause them to go out of sync and cause the sound to regularly cut out as though I was going temporarily deaf or constantly watching the opening scene to Saving Private Ryan. The sound on these things is great when they work, but the lack of reliability makes them very expensive pieces of garbage sitting on my entertainment center. Customer support can only suggest factory reset as a solution but the issue is obviously in their atrocious firmware if so many other people in the Amazon forums complain of the same issue with no concrete solutions.

Once it updated, it paired with ease. However, this one also drops audio every few minutes. It only needs to pair with ONE TV, an Amazon Fire that's about 3 feet apart. It is only 10 feet from my wifi 6 router running at 980mbs to 1 gig. I gave Amazon a chance with this second one. I am thoroughly done with any more Alexa based products. None of them have worked as designed.

The sound quality is quite impressive and at first it was very simple to connect. However, the sound when I played anything via my Amazon Fire TV (of which the two are paired) dropped out every 2-3 minutes, lasting just as long.

Brett J Cooper,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2022","I bought these with a fireTV with the hopes of a good sound ecosystem. When it works, it’s great… but I find myself resetting the whole setup weekly because it stops working correctly. I wish I had spent the extra money on a Sonos setup. The price savings on the echo studio setup is not worth the frustration.

I was hoping with the amount of data Amazon is collecting from Alexa’s that they would be able to find these bugs and iterate faster to resolve them.

Likes:
- good audio (I added the echo sub)
- price compared to alternatives
- fire tv integration

Dislikes:
- randomly stops playing music
- disconnects from the fire tv and requires restarting tv and echo studios to get it to work (a multi minute process)
- randomly requires two prompts to get it to play music

Do not buy… spend the extra $$ on Sonos

cowboy,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023","If they made it easier to connect too it would be great. Im considering sending mine back to get a sonos, only because our fire tv wont connect to it, and its such a hassle using a firetv stick on a fire tv just to get audio. If they would push the home theater option to all fire tv's and sticks and what not, it would be an ok setup. But your regular tv wont connect to it, your fire tv wont connect to it.

its a real expensive speaker to add to the living room, when its so hard to integrate with the tv.
Yes i could buy a echo link. That would solve my problem. But that brings cost of the single speaker audio setup to over $350 after tax and all. You really need two studios and a link for any kind of decent theater audio. That brings total cost too $583 in washington. Tooo much for what it is.

You can hear all of the audio coming from the single point of the echo. No technical foolery they are using changes that. Its sound coming from a single point. So get two they say. The echo balls are not a great option because of lack of living room theater mounting options not to mention an audio quality mismatch with the studio. And another studio is darned expensive to fix what they sell as a one speaker theater setup. A sound bar is soooooo much better. Im going to go back to my old boston sound bar in the mean time. Sounds so much better. And i get no single point of sound problem with it.

9/3/23 Update: The connection issues have not improved for me yet. Now when i talk to them, at least twice a day, they tell me that cant help me with that because they have dropped internet connection. its not my network. i have no issues with any other devices on my wifi. I believe that the theater wifi connection and the connection to my router is too much for the studios to handle. Probably its a software issue there.
However!:
I somehow missed that it has an optical input. I have hooked them up via a fiber cable to the tv and now, every single issue ive had with connection to just the tv is solved. Now the only glaring problems is if i want to use more than one device and the constant disconnecting from wifi. I have not been able to get the Theater setup to accept that optical input. If they would allow a theater group to be set up sans TV, and then allow the audio for the group to come from a single optical input on one of the devices, it would be a much more simple and foolproof way to get the audio into the theater system. Connection issues would become far less of a problem. There may be an almost insignificant audio timing issue with that sort of setup, but thats a tiny issue thats not difficult to fix.
Anyhow if your looking for a great sound and dont mind the optical cable hooking to the back of your tv, everything including xboxs, playstations, and streaming devices like rokus will send their audio through hdmi to your tv and out via optical to your speaker.

My one last thought on the optical cable to solve problems. If you split your optical cable into two, and use two studios like i am on either side of the tv it sounds pretty great, though its not even stereo. The one thing that would make it better is if in the alexa app i could select which channel i wanted to play on each echo unit. The optical is delivering atmos, because im using passthrough on my tv. Each of the Studios could, in their onboard software, selectively play a single channel from that 8.1 channel optical signal. But the whole reason this Studio/Theater software is taking so long to fix glaring issues is because of the cuts in personnel in the alexa/echo branches of amazon. So my hope is very small.
9/19/23 update.
Im now just pissed i spent the money on them. Ive had them to long for return. They just dont work. The optical connectio has two huge issues. The DAC or something freezes and you get no audio. Have to power cycle the device to get audio back. Which is a real pain since you cant reset it through the app. The ither issue is that there is some insane crackle that goes on with audio being to loud. At those volume its fine if your connected via bluetooth.
The atmos is pure fiction with this thing. Songs i know real well are completely missing frequencies and there isnt an eq accessible in the app for the speaker. It needs so much improvement it hurts. Worth maybe $70, only because they can get pretty loud. Complete ripoff otherwise. Trash is what they are as far as i can tell.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Robert,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2021","Ordering the Studio Echo along with a Smart Plug has been the most negative experience I have had as an Amazon customer. Usually, Amazon's is first rate, even impressive, in its efficiency and customer service. This order, however, seemed to have slipped through the cracks.
To begin with, I ordered the Studio Echo in late November and was surprised to receive an email two days later estimating the order to be delivered in six weeks, which would be early January. My payment card was not debited, which seems to be a standard practice when ordering through the internet. I expected the charge to be processed once the item was shipped. In mid December--out of the blue and without notification--I received a heads up from my card company that an ""unauthorized"" charge had been made on my account. At this point I did not make a connection between my 3 week past Amazon order and the charge that suddenly appeared on my account--I had not received a ""heads up"" from Amazon of the charge being processed or notification of the order being shipped (which it had not). As a result, I immediately contacted the card company and disputed the charge thinking my account had been compromised. My card was cancelled and a new one issued. It wasn't until the charge was tracked to Amazon that I made the connection with my order of the Studio Echo. I had to back pedal my charge dispute, but the card had been needlessly cancelled. It turns out that even though it had not been shipped, Amazon was running a ""charge check"" to make sure that my payment was sound. Really? I have been a steady Amazon customer for YEARS and have never had a hiccup of any kind, and now they have to verify I'm good for a charge less than $200? This was just the beginning.

True to the information I received, the Echo Studio arrived in early January. The Studio itself was in its original box inside of a brown shipping box. The Smart Plug was in the same box. There was no packing material around either box and the Echo Studio box had a crunched corner and the taped seal was broken--apparently from ""rough"" handling?

Now for the Echo Studio review itself-- Setup was relatively easy, involving the downloading of the Alexa app on my iPhone. I had purchased it, hoping to use it to supplement the audio from our Smart TV. Reviews have stated that it can be linked two ways to television, through bluetooth or through pairing with a FireStick. It has been noted that people have found that with bluetooth there is an audio lag. I found that to be true of trying to access the video through our FireStick as well. It worked, but it was like watching an old sci-fi movie from the sixties. Audio was completely out of sync. I also found that as a speaker itself, the music seemed to be of poor quality, even after adjusting the bass and treble levels. It sounded ""boxy."" So I initiated a return.
I received return authorization from Amazon and was given the choice of printing up a return label myself and sending it back or taking it to a UPS Store where they would box it and send it back. The email also informed me that my refund would be processed 2 to 4 hours after Amazon received it.I dropped it at UPS on January 4th and received confirmation that it arrived at Amazon's return facility on January 6. Two days later, I contacted Amazon about the refund and was told that I should give it a business week and to contact them if I did not receive it by Monday, January 11. I called Amazon customer service and spoke with an agent who then told me that it was their policy to wait two weeks before issuing a refund for electronic items--despite the fact that their email to me said it would be a matter of 2 to 4 hours. It wasn't until I spoke with a supervisor that she authorized my refund. What a fiasco!

This has not been an experience that I expected with Amazon, but it has made me wary and hesitant before making a similar purchase from them in the future.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Mike S.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","I love music and I love GREAT sounding music! Last year, we decided to replace our regular Amazon Echo located in our living room with the Studio because that's typically the Echo device that we use when we're listening to music. Because of the hype about the quality of the Studio and the raving reviews, I decided to take the plunge and pay for it. The unit itself is very stout, quite large, heavy, and very clean/modern looking. Setup was as simple as any other Echo device - You plug it in and follow the voice prompts.

Upon completion of setup, I was extremely excited to try out the music quality of this thing, so I immediately requested Alexa to play on of my wife's playlists, which consists mostly of country, but with some 90's hits, hip-hop, and a little classic rock peppered throughout. Immediately, I was underwhelmed and I thought maybe the equalizer or some sound setting needed adjustment. The vocals sounded as if we were in an echo chamber. I tried playing the Spatial Audio Playlist recommended by Amazon to ""unleash the full experience"" of the Studio and it sounded pretty good, but who actually listens to that music? So I played around with some of the sound settings and I was able to get it fairly dialed-in for ""our music"", but it's certainly not as impressive as it should be for the price tag. The bass is pretty impressive, although I feel like it's better heard/felt from a room or two away.

We've also started having some issues with it (just about 9 months in) where it will randomly quit responding to its action word or will not understand some verbal commands, such as what playlist we're telling it to play. For example, we'll say, ""Alexa, play the Morning playlist"" (a personal playlist we have literally called ""morning"") and she'll say something like, ""Okay, here's a playlist called 'Easy Listening Mornings' from Amazon Music."" I'm not sure if this is a connectivity issue or if somehow it's not seeing our personal playlists or what...

I'm at a loss - I wish we could just return it and get the latest standard Echo back. It sounds like others have had great experiences with this device, or maybe they didn't have as high of expectations as I did, but I personally can't recommend it to anyone.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Eliza Doolittle,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2023","Well, what can I say? I spent around $500 on two Echo Studios and one Echo Sub and I'm disappointed say the least.

There seems to be absolutely ZERO audio control of any of these devices through the app. I can go into the Alexa app, change the bass and treble levels, and see the lights on the devices light up while changing the levels, close out the app ... and nothing changes sound-wise.

I go back into the app, back to where I was changing the audio settings... And... Everything has reverted back to default.

Why??

For five hundred dollars or so, I should be able to change more than just the volume levels, for crying out loud!!

I called Amazon customer service more times this weekend about this and other issues, like trying to get these things to work together as a home theater (do stuff with the device itself, do stuff on the app, although that doesn't always pop up to tell you that you need to be doing stuff on the app, then do stuff on the TV via the Fire TV Cube settings, although it doesn't pop up on the TV that you're supposed to be doing stuff on the TV, either).

Then the Studios can't decide if they're supposed to be connected to my home network (which they were for most of the weekend) or some weird Amazon network which they decided to join after the last time I updated my right channel speaker.

And that's another thing ... Amazon always seems to set my left Studio as the right channel speaker,and my right Studio as my left channel speaker. Why?? Is it not supposed to be the left and right speaker as I LOOK at the TV?? Or, am I a complete prat, and it's actually as I look away from the TV?

Come on Amazon, for the price you charge for this stuff, why is it so frustrating to set up, and why do I have so little control over my audio settings??

If this isn't sorted soon, you can expect to receive them back. I had more control over the $100 Vizio sound bar I sent back to you people.

And why is it whenever I try to turn the volume down I have to actually turn it up, because pressing volume down even jusy once, on the remote, actually mutes the speakera or turns the volume down extremely low?

Seriously. If anyone askes message about these I would NOT recommend. I really want to sell these on and try to recoup some of the money I spent, but I'm too nice to inflict them on anyone else.

I bought them. Spent a whole lot of money I don't have on them, and want to use them because of that, but... I really DON'T want to use them either. I want to replace them, but how can I justify MORE financial outlay after they amount I spent on these??",2.0 out of 5 stars
James Withee,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2021","I have a lot of Alexa speakers throughout my home and business. I love the ecosystem and really dig Amazon's echo product line in general. For the price on the regular echo, especially when it's on sale, it's an insane value for what you get in terms of size and sound. I thought the Studio would have similar value. It does not.

I have a Sonos one that I use as my main Alexa speaker in my living room. I have a newly built smart home and my house came with the regular echo, an echo dot, an echo show (2nd gen), and the Sonos One. The Sonos sounds the best out of all of them so I put it in the room where I listen to music the most. Recently I decided to move the Sonos to my business and replace it with the Studio, thinking that the studio would be a better speaker, since people are raving about it on the internet. I mean, it is a bigger speaker and a newer design. And, since the regular echo is such a good value, I figure it's likely that $200 spent on a Studio would equal a better sound experience than $200 spent on the Sonos One. I was wrong.

I got the Studio today and it looks impressive right out of the box. I plugged it in and tested out a few tracks, and it sounded pretty good. I couldn't yet tell if I liked it better than the Sonos. I mean, it was obviously louder and had more bass, but it was hard to judge since I hadn't listened to the Sonos all day.

I put on a hip hop station and started listening casually. A couple of songs in, it became obvious to me that the bass, although louder, was kind of clumsy and didn't seem to hit perfectly with the other sounds. I thought meh, maybe it's just this song. Then it happened with another song. So I moved it to another area of the room, and listened to it at different distances. I went into the Alexa app and messed with the EQ and toggled the sound enhancing feature that everyone on here talks about.

The feature makes a difference but honestly makes the music sound kind of tinny when it's off and muffled when it's on. So that was another layer of suspiciousness. Then, when a particular song came on, called ""wasted"" by JUICEWRLD (don't you judge me now), I noticed that during one of the parts that he sings in a higher pitched tone, there was a VERY noticeable crackling. Wtf?? I know I didn't just hear that. Then the chorus came again, and it did it again.

I combed through forums, factory reset, and tried everything I could to make it sound the way I wanted. Then I was like you know what, I'm just gonna plug in the Sonos and see how it compares. WOW. As soon as the Sonos played the same song not only was the crackling non-existent, but everything else sounded way better, too. Even the bass. The Studio has louder bass, but the Sonos is so clean and precise with the way it hits and maintains sustained low notes. I'm not a self identifying audiophile (nerds) but that's the best way I can describe it. The Sonos is definitively better all across the board at the exact same price. Plus, it's less than HALF the size.

I wanted to love the Studio and was sure that I would. But I'm returning it. I won't even keep it to put in another room because it straight up sounds like crap to me. I'd honestly rather have another regular echo. Amazon missed on this one. I don't know how it got so many good reviews. Get the Sonos instead. People say that it has problems with the microphone but I've never experienced any of that. Only problem with it is that it doesn't pair with other echo devices for ""everywhere"" playing, so be aware of that and decide based on your needs.",2.0 out of 5 stars

the Tarantula Collective,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2024","This seemed liked a very cool device as I use echos to listen to music all the time at home and work. I set thus up at my business and paired it with the sub woofer. The sound is very good and I was definitely impressed with the quality and volume. The issue is it only works half the time. I constantly have to reset the device by unplugging and plugging back in, re pair the subwoofer, etc. I have removed it from my alexa app and added it back more times than I can count to try and fix issues. It is even worse if you try and listen to Spotify as echo studio is barely compatible. The Spotify DJ does not work at all on the studio and half the time it only plays out of the subwoofer and not the studio itself. All they tell you to do to troubleshoot is to remove the Spotify app and reinstall. I do this about once a week. A simple work around would be to just connect my phone to the studio via Bluetooth to the echo studio and listen that way. But for some reason that escapes all logic, in doing so the subwoofer no longer works so you lose the entire bass end of the experience. It almost feels like all these issues are intentional and an attempt to get you to ditch all other music players and only use Amazon music. After spending hundreds on this setup I refuse to be forced to switch music listening platforms.

Lee,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2020","I don’t consider myself an audiophile but I love good sound. A pair of Studios seemed great value compared to buying a good pair of bookshelf speakers and a decent receiver/amp, or investing in Sonos or the closed off Homepods.

In short, the audio quality is mediocre to my ears and only shines when LOUD. I really wanted to recommend these, but if you want a flexible/high quality audio system, I would look elsewhere. Stereo pairing seems more of an afterthought in the Echo ecosystem, and this limitation is an unacceptable compromise for me.

Features
Alexa works as expected. Creating a stereo pair is easy. Connecting the pair to the Fire TV 4K is a breeze. The 3D features are gimmicky in my opinion and didn’t really add anything to the experience. Aesthetically, I was pleasantly surprised. These look good and build seems high quality.

My main complaint -- creating a stereo pair does not do what you might expect. Pairing does not unify the two Studios as a single and persistent stereo pair -- it merely tells Alexa that stereo playback is available for limited purposes -- namely, playback from qualifying subscription services or via the Fire TV.

Since the stereo pair breaks, you cannot stream music from your phone or the computer from any arbitrary app, and output to the stereo pair (unless you’ve connected to via the Amazon music app from the phone). I really hoped the technology would have been implemented in such a way that you can send audio to one and have it work with both in stereo. You cannot bluetooth or wired line in and maintain the stereo pairing. When scanning for available bluetooth devices, you see each speaker individually only and connecting will be mono to a specific speaker. I was aware of this limitation with respect to wired in, but I was disappointed to learn that bluetooth also breaks the stereo pair. At first, I thought it was user error but learned that this a long requested and ignored feature request across the Echo device line.

Stereo pairing works when connecting via Amazon Music from the iPhone. It takes about 10 seconds to connect and there’s a few seconds lag when controlling via the app, but on the whole it’s usable. Stereo pairing works when telling Studio to play music by voice. It’s not perfect. Often it will inexplicably stop playback or reduce volume. Sometimes playback won’t be in stereo and will come from one or the other speaker (noticeably when asking Alexa to play radio stations) -- but on the whole, it works as expected when working within the confines of the limited feature set. I appreciate being able to voice control these speakers, but I cannot recommend these over a more traditional wired hookup connected to an Echo Dot.

I am left with the impression that there wasn’t enough thought given to using these as an alternative to dedicated home audio devices. They are not suitable replacements for a wired or wireless stereo system. I understood there was no Airplay or equivalent wifi feature to select the pair as the audio output for a mobile/computer device, and I wrongly assumed these had bluetooth as an alternative.

Audio quality
Music sounds significantly better in stereo than mono, but even in stereo the quality is just okay. Sound is muddy and they lack detail I would expect at the price point for two of these. At first I thought one of Studios was broken -- I just couldn’t believe it was so unimpressive given the rave reviews and price point. The Studios start to impress when loud - it does not distort and detail comes alive. They easily fill my large bedroom, but they are lackluster for ordinary listening volumes. To my ears, the Homepods are far superior for audio quality.

I bought these mainly for music but being able to use a pair for TV speakers is a nice bonus if you have a compatible Fire TV.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Lawrence Baxter,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2024","While the sound from the Amazon Smart speaker is good when it works, its integration with my TV is terrible. Started working perfectly and produced great sound. Then suddenly the sound went off. I researched and clearly this is a widespread problem because the official Amazon advice I found was to revert to the TV’s internal sound system. This of course renders a major element of the Smart Speaker useless (and very frustrating given that it went mute in the middle of a show I was watching). I would not recommend until Amazon fixes the software. Trying to get help from Amazon is a whole new drama too!",2.0 out of 5 stars

The sound of this speaker is very good, I have it paired with another for a stereo quality, problem; it occasionally falls out of pairing. My biggest problem with Echo devices is that Alexa which originally as good or better than Google or Siri has fallen so far behind as an AI and support from Amazon that I wish I would have gone with Google to use in my smart house. I often ask Alexa a question and have to ask again to my Apple phone to get a simple answer.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Raymond M.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2023","I bought two of these studio speakers and the subwoofer, which turned out to be a mistake. I spent two weeks trying to get them to work with a 55” Vizio HDTV. I had them connected through an Alexa Cube and they would work for a few hours at a time and then I would come back later and they were no longer working with the TV. I finally got them working, but every time I turned on the TV it would also turn on the TV in another room which was also connected to an Amazon Cube. After trying everything I could find online and Amazon Help files I figured it might be my TV, so I bought a new 55” Amazon FireTV advertised to work great with the Studio Speakers. The speakers wouldn’t even connect to the FireTV so I finally called Amazon support. I avoided calling them before because I used to work in one of these phone support jobs and I have yet to see one that can do much more than very basic troubleshooting with mostly untrained personnel. They are normally evaluated on their call times (how long they are on the phone with a customer) not on their actual troubleshooting abilities or even if they solved the problem. My biggest problem with them is that people eventually figure out that to shorten their call times they simply disconnect the call if they can’t fix the problem relatively quickly. Anyway to make a long story short, I ended up calling Amazon support three times over two days and spent a total of almost four hours on the phone. Out of those three calls I was mysteriously disconnected twice. I finally spoke to a lady (Jess T.) that had me up and running in less than 15 minutes. This young lady deserves a pay raise. I it was very obvious that the other two customer service personnel barely spoke English and had very little knowledge of the equipment they were trying to troubleshoot. One of them actually took me to a section of the Amazon Alexa app for disability settings! Bottom line, unless you’re pretty proficient at setting up Alexa/Echo equipment and are very familiar with the Amazon Alexa app and various TV brands, be prepared for lots of frustration if you buy these. Sadly, I doubt this review will be accepted since it’s about Amazon.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Clint,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2024","I really wanted to love these!
I bought two studios and a sub, at first it was pretty good, after about two or three weeks the first one I bought started cracking up, so I requested a new one.
I then bought the other two devices along with it, at first the sound was amazing!
When these work properly they really are incredible sound for the price!
But then once again after about a week all the new equipment started cutting out and sounding like it was under water!
So I again called customer service, they were helpful, but after following all of their instructions the sound went bad after about three days.
I am not going to pay $590 for a set up that I have to unplug every couple days!
It was $590 because I purchased the three year warranty for each device at $20 a piece.
Really sad they don't work well, I have had a dozen different echos and fire tablets and home automation over the years.
Never had issues until now.
I'll be sending back.
I gave two stars because when they did work they sounded incredible for a day or two.",2.0 out of 5 stars

A. Meller,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2019","Disclaimer: this is not my first Echo device - I have altogether 5 of them at the moment, and have used them for at least 3 years.

Unlike other reviewer who criticized this gadget, I had no problems with setting it up and with using it. It works fine, plays music and answers questions. I am just unhappy with the sound, that was, of course, the primary reason to upgrade from Echo Plus to this device.

The good:
a. Bass is better that on my Echo Plus.

The bad:
a. Trebles are very bad and muddy. Rudimentary equalizer settings (Bass, Midrange, Treble) are not sufficient to adjust the sound properly. I believe the problem is mostly due to phase cancellation effect on a single tweeter that mixes signal from left and right channels. Amazon developers, please consider either adding another tweeter in the next generation, or employing a better algorithm that will minimize phase cancellation effect.
b. The switch for ""Stereo Spatial Enhancement"", that is enabled by default, makes the sound much worse and completely kills the trebles.
c. There is a clear dis-balance in volume between spoken voice (that appears too quiet) and music (too loud). So every time you use it, you need to adjust the volume.
d. Light ring that shows that Alexa is listening for you can be seen only from above, and not from the side, so if you ask Alexa to do something from 3 steps away, you don't know if it can hear you or not.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Original post: I so regret buying these! I bought instead of stereo system thinking I could connect via Bluetooth to my phone and play music, that was my first disappointment, I went to stream music from my phone and found out you can only stream to one device which made this worthless to me! I tried to make the best of it and paid for Amazon music and was pleased with how good it sounded although annoyed that I had to buy a service to listen to music but sounded pretty good at first but since then one or more speakers will cut out, sometimes it wont do anything when you tell it to do something related to music like simply stop playing the music when told. I also have to keep setting up the speaker group to get them working again.

I fired up Spotify... and got the same single speaker performance I have had for the last few years since this speaker debuted. Went into the nightmare that the Alexa app is, trying to figure out why I was not getting stereo sound. Nothing... Did some digging online, to find out the ONLY way you get stereo sound out of paired Alexa devices is via Amazon's music service. Sorry, No. I'm not going to subscribe to another music service just to get this product to work the way it should. The second Echo Studio will be returned, along with the sub-woofer.

The Spotify skill is sporadic, the Samsung skill does not work, and either the speaker will not work with Google Home or it's nearly impossible to find out how to connect this with Google Home. Either way, there doesn't appear to be a way to pair this with speakers that are not Echo to create a group in Google Home.

I would lie down on my bed with the Echo about 8 feet in front of me on my dresser. NOTHING else on my dresser so I gave it PLENTY of space on both sides and had it 8 inches away from the wall. EVERYTHING I played sounded hollow and fake!!! LOL, I noticed the vocals were very low and faint and the music overpowered the vocals too much. ESPECIALLY with songs encoded in Atmos/360.
I adjusted the slider controls taking out some midrange but that made it worse. When I added Midraange I heard the vocals better but it had a fake hollow simulation crap sound!!! I then tried turning the spatial switch off and it was A LOT better but no better than the Google Max I own. As a matter of fact, my Google Max speaker is louder. So I'm returning the Echo tomorrow. The main reason I wanted to try the Echo was for the Atmos/360 sound but that was a mistake. Atmos is GREAT for a soundbar for movies like I have on my TCL 6 series TV. But in my opinion, it is NOT good for music!!! I have the Vizio 5.1 Atmos soundbar and it sounds AMAZING!!

rod,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2022","I have had the echo studio for about two years, but mine finally gave out in a concerning way.

For the time that I had it, the echo studio worked almost perfectly. I used the device for music, ambient sounds, finding my phone, talking on the phone, animal sounds, the news, stories, fact checking, routines, light switches, etc. It somehow became a significant part of my life.

The quality of the speaker itself was awesome, and even on it's own (without the subwoofer), the bass system it provided was sufficient. Music and ambient noise were especially great and I practically used it every day and night.

About a month ago, low frequency sounds became a bit distorted when the volume was past a certain point (about 70-80%), especially when playing the ""space deck"" noise with my ambient sound subscription. It wasn't too big of a deal since most music was at a higher frequency and I could still fall asleep to a majority of the sound options.
However, just a few days ago, something within the crevice of the studio, where sound is amplified, overheated and burned the rubber padding to the point it was actually toxic to inhale. What really scared me about this problem is that the burning happened when I was asleep, as I was peacefully inhaling what was basically carcinogens without ever realizing it.
I understand electrical components fail all the time and warranties exist for this reason, but I was unlucky mine expired a few months before these issues arose (and I feel a little bit salty about it).

I would give this product more stars considering the happy times I had, but these past few days have felt a bit empty and sad by comparison. I lost something that was a pretty big benefit in my everyday life and my experience with the echo studio felt too short lived. The toxic harm it may have caused is more than concerning.

If you are considering of buying this, I would recommend getting it with the 3 year warranty. Although if you use it everyday the way I have, don't expect it to last more than 2 years. I personally won't be buying a new one since I value my health and consider tech like this should be made a little more reliable.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Mitch - Palm Springs, CA","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2023","While I am generally a supporter of Amazon's innovative technology, I feel compelled to share my experience with the Echo Studio Speakers to potentially save other customers from the frustration I've endured.

Upon my initial setup of two Echo Studios to my new Amazon Fire TV, I was genuinely pleased with their sound quality. They produce clear tones, though I must admit they are not as loud as I had anticipated. However, the primary issue lies not in their sound capabilities, but in their connection reliability.

Every day, like clockwork, these speakers lose their wi-fi connection. And no, it's not my internet; every other device in my household remains connected seamlessly. Daily, sometimes even multiple times a day, I find myself dedicating a good 5 minutes (which adds up over time) just to reset them or my Fire TV to get any sound out of them. The very essence of smart speakers should be convenience and ease of use. This constant need to reconnect feels antithetical to their purpose.

To emphasize my disappointment, I initially purchased four of these Echo Studio Speakers. Having faced these connection issues with the first pair, I am now hesitant to unbox and set up the remaining two. They currently sit unopened in my closet, a painful reminder of the money I spent and the frustration that awaits should I decide to use them. Regrettably, I waited too long to set them up and am now past the 30-day return window.

In conclusion, while the Echo Studio Speakers do offer decent sound quality when they work, the hassle of daily reconnecting diminishes their value significantly. I had hoped for a seamless integration into my home entertainment system, but that dream remains unrealized. I implore potential buyers to consider this review carefully before making their purchase, and I hope Amazon addresses these connectivity issues soon.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Raoul Duke online shopper,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2020","Update: Amazon limits the music that can be played on echo studio. If I ask my other echo devices to play a specific song by prof, they will play it. But if I ask echo studio it will play a different song. My other echo devices will play his whole catalog, but my echo studio will play only one of his songs, then play other music. I have a music subscription through Amazon, so not sure why they do this, but is highly frustrating. I am dropping one star from rating for not being able to play the same music all my other echo devices will play on my studio that is specifically made to play music.

I have echo devices in 5 rooms in my house for convenience and to listen to my amazon HD music subscription when cleaning, cooking or working around the house. I have two echo show 8's and a dot that with the small speaker size sound decent but are unable to produce any bass. They do not sound as good as my regular echo. I was looking for something that would have better sound and be able to produce a little more bass. Based on reviews I was also thinking that once I move my current 7.2 home theatre to the basement I could pair two echo studios together instead of using a soundbar on my living room tv.

Due to the larger size the echo studio is able to produce more bass than the shows or regular echo. I am still trying to adjust the mid and treble hoping to get the echo studio to sound better. But for the price I was not impressed. It produces more bass than a regular echo, but overall sound does not seem as good. Depending on how I adjust the mids and treble it tends to either sound muddled or shrill. The volume is decent, but you are unable to turn the volme all the way up without speakers distorting. Not sure if this is the speakers or if there is an amp built in producing thd. It also tends to create sweet spots in the room. You can walk around the room and find areas where the music sounds a little better than other areas. I purchased the higher level amazon music subscription for the 3D music but was not impressed with how it sounded on the echo studio. Maybe it is how I have it located in the room. There were not instructions with it, so havent figured out how to get it to re-analyze the acoustics of the room after you move the device to a new location without having to do a factory reset.

Overall its not bad, but was not impressed with the sound or how it fills the room. I dont think I will purchase the second one to pair with this one and use in place of a soundbar for my tv. If I had it do over, I think I might try the sonos instead. I will keep trying to tinker with the sound adjustments and room location to see if I can get it to sound better.

T. A. Cross,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2024","The quality of the speaker is just fine, but it fails at the most basic level.

I have to pay for too many subscriptions already--I do not want to have to add another. I own tens of thousands of songs already via my cd collection--I shouldn't need to continue paying to use music I already own.

I can go through a convoluted process to connect my iPhone via blutooth and play songs that way, but it won't use voice activation. Even worse, although the speaker works fine with the paired subwoofer when I use Apple Music (which I don't want to use), once I connect my iPhone to it to play the music I actually want to hear, it loses the pairing with the subwoofer.

Chance Ill,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2023","Equalizer simply doesn't work in theater mode. I understand that these types of issues can take time to sort out. However, these speakers have been available for years now and I've discovered that this is a known issue and has been reported. There's no known workaround, explanation or eta on a possible fix.

Despite how disappointed and discouraged I am knowing that this is an ongoing issue with no fix in sight, honestly, I could deal with the equalizer not working in theater mode. Unfortunately, theater mode itself seems to be broken to an extent. While in theater mode, the speakers fall out of sync with themselves and create and echo/tunnel sound which requires a restart. After restarting, it seems like the speakers completely stop communicating with each other and one speaker just doesn't work at all, which requires another restart.

Sometimes, a speaker may just randomly cut out. I have 1 gigabyte speeds up and down connected to a mesh network covering 2000 sq feet so connectivity is unlikely to be the problem.

I decided to troubleshoot and I followed the instructions on the Amazon web site by unplugging the unit then tried again and it still cut out over and over again. So then I went ahead and followed the next move which was to do a complete restart of everything by doing what I would cal a hard reset by holding down the microphone button and the volume down button. Well that didn't help either so I then moved my router closer and still not working. I then reset my router and still nothing.

B.C.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2021","I use Bluetooth to play audio (music, podcasts, etc) from my laptop, and audio from my TV (Netflix, YouTube, etc). I don't want a bunch of cords connected to speakers to do this - especially not to my laptop. (Moving your laptop when it's connected by a wire to your home audio system is potentially dangerous.) The Echo Studio doesn't work well for the Bluetooth case. The problems:

(1) If you have two Echo Studios and want to use them in stereo, you can play Amazon music or Pandora via the Alexa app. But if you want to play audio via Bluetooth it doesn't work. It will only play out of one Echo Studio. This means streaming music off my laptop or playing Netflix/YouTube with bluetooth audio doesn't work in stereo.

(2) Whenever you use bluetooth audio with a video (Netflix, YouTube, etc), there's a visible audio-lag. People's mouths don't line up with their words. This works fine with my old bluetooth speakers, though, so it's obviously not a problem with bluetooth in general. It's a problem with the Echo Studio speakers.

(3) When I was looking at the the Echo Studio, I saw that it can connect to bluetooth speakers. I was hoping that I could add my existing bluetooth speakers to my home surround-sound system. In other words: 2 Echo Studios + 2 existing bluetooth speakers = 4 working speakers for music all over my home. No luck with that. When you connect an Echo Studio to bluetooth speakers, it doesn't play out of it's own speaker. The end result is that, even though I have 4 speakers, I can only use 1 or 2 speakers at any one time because Echo Studio can't handle that case.

I will say that the Echo Studio does sound very good, and if you only want one Echo Studio (i.e. you don't want stereo coverage) or you only want to play music using their Alexa app (i.e. stream Amazon music, Pandora, Spotify, or some other music-streaming service), then it works perfectly well. Be warned, though, that Amazon music requires that you pay a monthly subscription fee - either for Amazon Music Unlimited or Amazon Prime. The whole thing seems like a pretty narrow use-case, and not really aligned with what many people want from their home audio system.

Erwin,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2020","Similar to many others, we have Echos strewn throughout the house and in the living room we added the Echo Studio to the existing Fire Cube TV and Echo Dot. Originally, sound for the Fire Cube TV went through the TV via HDMI to a set of speakers. The Echo Dot was connected to a different set of speakers. I thought I could use the Echo Studio to completely replace the speakers needed. Overall, it did not work out as great as planned because of how the Echo Studio handles the 3.5mm input. It needs a certain volume level to keep it on. Frustrating when watching a program/movie and there is a quiet part and next thing you know is you missed the previous dialogue. Just plain frustrating! I'll go through my observations:

Sound was full and good enough for us and since that is subjective (know many audiophiles), it gets 5 stars. Tastes may vary.

Integration with Fire Cube TV was painful, but figured it out. Instructions/documentation was useless. We have a smart home with over 20 various smart devices (echoes, cameras, lights, etc.) and all successfully connect via Alexa, so I am well-versed in setting up devices in our environment. This was painful.

As I mentioned, I wanted to replace the external speakers and have multiple inputs into the TV, not just the Fire Cube TV. I thought the Echo Studio could be that solution for an echo device and a single speaker output for any media on the TV. With the 3.5mm,/TOS jack, it can, but with that one issue of if the volume level dips down too low, the Echo Studio just stops.

We also have the Echo Connect for our phones and whenever a call came in, we'd lose audio. For that we turn off the ""incoming Call Ringer"" under ""Sounds"" in the Alexa app for this device and many others. I have contemplated just turning on ""Do Not Disturb"" and mute this since it seems that anything that turns on the Echo Studio will interrupt the media coming from the TV.

It seems the only solution when watching media on the TV is to keep the volume up on the TV very high and manage the volume from the Echo Studio, which requires us to get up and change it. Since we are muting it, we can remote from a device, but that is too cumbersome; it's easier to just get up.

The Amazon devices in the living room are now only the Fire Cube TV and Echo Studio. Overall, it works, but that constant managing volume levels is so frustrating since at times we are watching live TV and not able to rewind 10-15 seconds. 2 stars.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Matt C,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2020","As a stand alone unit, this thing is great. Awesome sound, just enough bass and crisp highs. Does everything all the other Echos do as far as Alexa goes. Where the problems come in at, is when you try using it as a home theater for your tv. I have never yelled so much at a tv before in my life. I was using a Bose Cinemate 15 for a few years. It worked great, sounded good and paired nice with my Harmony remote. When the Echo Studio came out with the Home Theater feature, I swapped out my Bose and added the Echo Studio and paired it with my Fire 4k stick and the Echo Sub. Right from the start nothing worked as it should. I could hear the sub, but nothing coming out from the studio. It played a “home theater test video” and all I could hear was the sub and the video was in slow motion. After unpairing and repairing everything a couple times, it finally worked...for a couple days. I stream my tv from YouTube tv and if you fast forward, pause, rewind any video the lip sync is way off. I went into the settings and tried the lip sync adjustments. It worked until the bedtime you fast forward, rewind ect. Then you would have to do it all over again or restart the fire tv. Lately the volume has been going up and down on its own. The remote is super laggy sometimes for the volume adjustment. I have tried moving my wifi router closer and farther with no effect. All my devices say they have excellent wifi signal. It seems like it takes me about 15-20 mins of troubleshooting to finally be able to watch tv every time I want to watch tv. I finally had enough with it and hooked up my Bose Cinemate 15 and got rid of the Echo Studio. As far as the Studio playing music, it sounds great and functions as it should. If you plan on using it for your home theater, stay far away from this thing. I can’t say if it’s a problem with the studio itself or all echos that have the home theater option because I’ve only tried it with the studio and a echo sub. Maybe it works fine all by itself, but once paired with another echo device I had nothing but problems.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2021","Sound is not a notable upgrade over a standard echo plus, despite the price difference. Would not even be that great of an issue, except for the sound latency when watching it with TV, video games, or anything else with a live feed.

You know that awkward feeling you get when you are watching a foreign show, and your constantly seeing their lips say something, but are hearing something completely different? If you can get used to that without any issues, than this will not be a major setback for you. If it bothers you, or you are a competitive gamer who uses every advantage you can, including the sound of the environment, then you will lose that advantage here as well, as you will be anywhere from a slip second to a full second behind what is actually going on.

NOTE This occurs for me with both an inferior bluetooth connection, of which I would say that this is even understandable, as well as amazon's own personal specialized cord that they devise specifically for this device. Having a direct line from the device to your tv or computer and still having a notable sound latency is NOT acceptable

Worst part about this, I have spent several hours trying to comb through forums and other resources to find out what people have done to try to fix this issue. Amazon responses have been basic trouble shooting that does not solve the issue, and eventually to ""escalate"" the problem to their technical team, after which no one seems to get a reply or fix back. This issue spans over several years with no fix found, or at the very least, found by me.

If these issues won't bother you, and you are dead set on purchasing a more expensive echo device, than this might be one for you. If you value your money and your time, buy a different sound setup for yourself. If you are dead set on an echo device, I would suggest the Echo Plus, as it sounds perfectly acceptable for its price point and has all the goodies of an alexa device",2.0 out of 5 stars
Ronald Thompson,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2020","Update: After what feel is unnecessary investigations online, and turning off the awful stereo spatial audio setting which is on by default, the quality and lost layers issue was resolved and general music sounded much better - and at a lower volume - making Alexa’s quiet voice less of an issue. However this hits the 3D audio files a bit as they sounded, less ideal than they would have otherwise. I’m not going to bounce in and out of the app for this setting. Also there's no way this setting should be on by default with it in the state it is currently in. Inexcusable to not screen all formats/genres of music before pushing out a device with a feature that is not advertised.

Alexa’s voice on this device, however (as well as comms) is still far too low. We still need the ability to set these independently from one another if there is going to be these kinds of balancing issues depending on the device type. Was going to provide a slight bump to the score, but this is still bothersome however that using as a basic Alexa device is hamstrung by the audio mixing. A good quality for the $ speaker that is just seemingly going to waste.

——

I gave this a full on shot, tried various music types and the lot, and with many of the non-classical and traditional rock tracks, such as pop and electronic music, a lot of layers, elements, and specifically - vocals - were drowned out by the “rest” of the music. This even occurred in the 3D branded tracks, in where undoubtedly the vocal layer is far too squashed. It sounds great, it’s just uneven. Even Alexa’s voice itself is shockingly way too low compared to the music, and any call to another Echo device, is barely audible unless cranked up. If you have any intention of buying this as an Alexa speaker with improved audio - do consider the unbalanced nature of the audio itself. Overall this product is a disappointment. I also do not own a Fire TV Cube so I will never have the ambition to get a second for Dolby Atmos, unless it’s more broadly supported (which it is not).

Maybe an update fixes it, I’ve received a few already, still have the balancing issues even when tinkering and putting it in a super ideal spot. I just can’t unhear the flaws.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Roger,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2020","I bought 2 of these to set up a theater system. Set up individually, they work AMAZING. The sound is great and as a stand alone smart speaker, it is the best of the ones I own (Echo 1G, Dot 1G and 2G, Show 1G and Show 5).

The problem I have is that the connection between the speaker and my 1G Cube breaks constantly and I have to do a reset ever 2-3 days. TechAssist say that it is because it is switching back and forth between my 2.4 and 5.0 networks even though I have the networks set up separately. Never once during set up did I ever see them connected to my 2.4 network. Tech filed a ticket, but I don't know how much that will do.

After multiple resets and set ups, eventually they do set up and work. Usually it takes about 20 minutes and 3-4 cycles for it to work. But I have to ask myself if it is worth spending the time to set the whole thing up over and over. Sometimes I only have time to watch a movie... and after doing the set up I don't have time to watch it anymore.... which is annoying since that is the very reason I bought them.

If the situation improves I will update the post. If not, I will be returning both speakers. You have until mid-May, Amazon. Please fix this.

It has been 3 weeks since my original post and things have gotten worse. Now my media player which I purchased from the Amazon App store which has worked flawlessly is now out of sync with the Studio speakers... when they work. They seem to work fine watching YouTube or short shows on Netflix or Hulu. But as soon as I settle in to watch an action movie where you really want that big sound.... NOTHING.

I'm tired of waiting for it to get fixed and I'm tired of each tech just having me run through the same thing that the previous ones already had. My issue apparently got escalated... but I can't tell since the tech that was supposedly going to call me back NEVER did. Normally I don't put blame for my dissatisfaction on Amazon, but this time it is your product. Loved it when it worked.... but doesn't work enough.

Pablo,"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2022","For the premium price, somewhat astounded by how much worse this Echo performs compared to its cousins. We regularly see it spinning its blue light without anyone mentioning the wake word, even when arriving home to an empty house. It fails to recognize approximately one out of every three requests, clearly listening, but after a long pause, turning red and saying it *bong* “is having trouble understanding right now, please try again later” (this has occasionally happened with other models, but never like this, and at some times models in other rooms even pick up on us trying repeatedly to get this one to perform, and will carry out the instruction instead). This is particularly aggravating when it misunderstands something and starts playing inappropriate music for the crowd. The sound is an upgrade, but its connection seems so unstable that it often cuts out, and when playing on a “group” of Echos, this one shorts out while others in the same “group” are able to play on. Sometimes, the voice disappears—the light seems to indicate it is listening, and then acting on the request, but no sound comes out. We have to reset the unit several times a day at this point. We’ve experimented with different locations and different setups—even swapping locations with other units—and the issues remain. This is really the worst performing of any model in terms of connectivity and voice recognition. Maybe we have a defective unit, but we were deeply disappointed in what we’d hoped would be a significant upgrade. Overall, still impressed by the Echo tech, but unless these kinds of issues are fixed, I’d suggest sticking with the basic model.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Widebandid,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2021","I don't recommend this, but there's a setup troubleshooting tip at the end of this review you might find useful if you do buy it. Three reasons I'm returning this: 1) The Echo Studio sound is muddy (even with EQ adjustments) and not significantly better than my 6 year old standard Echo. If you're replacing a defective Echo, get a standard Echo. 2) I compared this with a 7 year old Sonos Play 3 and it wasn't even close. Don't get this to replace other pure audio devices (besides, Sonos now makes an Alexa-capable version) 3) I had a problem during setup that is easy to find on the internet. When I fired it up for the first time it kept trying to play on other speakers in the house (with no luck), or would say ""Playing music that you like"" and then go silent. I tried unplugging every other sound device in the house to try to troubleshoot but couldn't make it work. I chatted with Amazon support but they just took me through things I tried after Googling it. I finally figured out that you can tell it ""play x music on this speaker"" and it worked. One of the things I like about Alexa is that it knows you want music to play from the speaker nearest you when you ask, unless you specify otherwise so this was annoying. Side note: When I first set this up it connected to my account OK, but couldn't tell I had Amazon Prime so refused to play Prime Music. The key (per Amazon support) was to tell it to switch profiles to my wife's, then switch back to mine (we both pay for Prime). That at least allowed me to use it to play Prime Music, so long as I told it ""do it here."" Very disappointed for this price.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Casey,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2021","Initially I thought the studio was exactly what I was looking for, powerful clear sound at a reasonable price that I could also connect to my TV as a sound bar.

Amazon has the powerful clear sound at a reasonable price down. I have been able to use the echo studio to replace a much older multi channel stereo system. The studio produces much cleaner, crispier sound, and at a much higher volume. The bass is produced by the single studio is actually far better than I expected.

The downfall, and a big one, for this speaker is that I have had constant issues with it dropping sound through the optical line, which has basically rendered it useless as a sound bar. I have spoken with an amazon tech and went through great lengths to troubleshoot the issues to no avail. Because of the persistent problems Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement for free. Low and behold 2 weeks later the same issues are popping up. I am completely disappointed. There are other ways to connect the studio to my T.V. but all of those require purchasing a completely separate Amazon device, which is ridiculous. If using the optical line isn't going to be supported then why include one on the device, and why sell it as having that capability?

On top of the sound drops, when the studio is working it has major latency issues and no way to fix them. One would think that with all of the capabilities of Alexa and the Alexa app there would be a setting that could fix such an issue, unfortunately there isn't one as of now, unless of course you are using another Amazon device (fire cube, fire stick 4k) to run your studio through.

I am hoping that Amazon makes some adjustments to what has the potential to be a great product soon. If not then this will be like another sports super star that flutters out due to lack of support and hard work.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Amazonian,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2022","This is the worst purchase of an Echo speaker that I have made. I purchased this because I heard a demo at a conference and it sounded great. Of course the was in a empty square room. Once in a real world living room setup without perfect conditions, it just sounds decent. It does not give a surround sound experience. It does sound better than TV speakers, but not anywhere close to an actual surround sound setup.

This leads into the next topic, integration with a fire TV unit. This is horrendous. It constantly disconnects from the home theatre group. On a near weekly basis. The I have to spend 20-30 minutes trying to delete the group and then remake the group. And every time this happens there are sync issues. It is a real pain and always happens at the worst times. I originally thought it was my fire tv device that may be too old causing the problems, but I just bought a brand new 4k Fire TV stick, and same problems. After the original purchase I spent about 4 months on weekly calls to tech support. No longer returnable after all that time. Then they just stopped calling me back. Guess they gave up on it too. Don't know if this is a known issue or if it is just my device, but you would think that Amazon products should be able to integrate with other amazon products. I does seem like it's what they are made to do.

Alas, I am left with an expensive speaker that I can use if I have 20-30 minutes to kill beforehand in frustration.

Chris K.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2020","I purchased the Echo Studio when it was on sale 169.99 and was excited to try this thing out. Well the excitement was short lived. The Bluetooth would connect just fine through Windows 10 PC (connected to my tv via hdmi) and would work fine until I asked Alexa to play a song. Once that happened the Bluetooth would disconnect and proceed to play the song forcing me to reconnect it. This happened every time right on que. Sometimes when the Bluetooth was reconnected there was no sound at all despite Windows 10 showing it connected. In addition the Bluetooth connection would also drop at random moments and while the speaker sounded pretty good at first that was short lived as well. One moment I had a great speaker and then for no reason it suddenly sounded like a cell phone speaker (no woofer/mids). Resetting or unplugging was no help. My Echo Plus was connected in the same fashion and produced none of the above problems working flawlessly. As mentioned in other reviews the placement of the light ring is annoying since you cant see it at eye level (where most people would probably have it) and the voice recognition would sometimes not work. Also I figured I would update the software to possibly fix any problems but the Studio reported back that it had the latest version. When I checked Amazon website the latest Studio software version according to Amazon site is 3389730436 however my Alexa app shows the software version as 3590965380 so I'm not sure if that matters? Well I decided I would give it another try since maybe I got a lemon?

I proceeded to initiate a replacement ticket and was directed to a customer service chat. I was told this was not possible and that I could return the product and just buy it again. When asked about the sale and if they would honor that price the customer service rep just repeated that they could only return it. I asked why and again was just asked if I wanted to return it. This product and process was not what I usually experience at Amazon and the only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the refund process was great as usual.

Then there was a time where I stopped even having the interest of listening to music.
Then i listened to music with 2 echo studios paired and It automatically moved my soul back into listening to music, it even had me subscribe to Spotify for the 1st time

The sound quality is something else with these 2, i carry one around my home and balcony with ease.

So the positive of these are the sound quality, absolutely magical.

The negatives are the annoying faulty pairing speed and faultiness it has.
Alone, it's fine, sounds great.
But if you're interested in surround sound, rich music, it is an annoyance.

I constantly have to figure out how to re-pair them together to play on Spotify.
2 ECHO STUDIOS WILL NOT PLAY MUSIC THROUGH BLUETOOTH

They connect through wifi to each other and play through a service like Spotify, Amazon music, and some other ones. If you have a default player, youtube, or an app like Calm, etc, you won't be able to listen to both at the same time for some strange, annoying reason.

Randomly they will pair together or unpair in the middle of the night or any time. Again, when wanting to play a song, you can't just have a song pop up tap the song you want to play and listen to it.
You have to literally do troubleshooting everytime you want to play it in paired mode and through Spotify in my experience.

If that wasn't an issue, this sound system would be an easy 5 star. Regardless, I'm going to buy them again because the audio is that good and hope that updates will fix the issue.

I bought 2 JBL Flip 5 speakers to compare.
In sound, there's no comparison.
With those it's around 200$ for both, smaller, and pair easily and can play through Bluetooth, which means you can play through any music player most likely.

What really is frustrating is that when Studio is not playing sound for the cube the cube does not play the sound. I you really want this to play with your cube - wait at least two gens so that this syncing issue will not be as frustrating. It also disconnects or is not in sync with some streaming apps. Paramount+ is the worse with it. But, it is the old, not-so-great CBS app that should be scrapped. But, Studio just adds to my frustration with the Paramount+ app. Wish there was a way to choose NOT to play the cube sound on the Studio. Oh, yes, I know it can be changed in the Alexa app - but that doesn't really change it. Very frustrating. Wish I hadn't spend the money on it.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Brian F,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2023","I bought two of these, set them up in a pair and linked to the subwoofer, so I was expecting pretty good sound. They sound OK. Sound quality-wise, they're about on par with my 2nd-generation Echos, but can go a lot louder (and I think the Echos are already loud enough for general usage -- if I want really loud I'll use my home audio setup). I don't think they're worth the cost for the audio quality, which I think is overrated (not bad, just overrated).

However, they cannot hear you. At all. I have some Echo Dots that can hear me across the room while speaking at normal volumes while my music is blasting (it's spooky, really), but these can't hear you if there are any other noises in the room, and especially if they're playing music. Yelling makes no difference. Different people make no difference. It defeats the purpose if you're using them to control and play music by voice.

I think older-generation Echo equipment had better voice recognition than the modern stuff (they also seemed to have more microphones, which may or may not be a factor), but I was really disappointed with how poorly these work. They're basically defective.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Jbird,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2023","Well, this speaker had a lot of potential for enhancing the Amazon eco system in our home. The Echo Show 15 has weak audio so we bought the Echo Studio to fix that. Unfortunately, the Echo Show 15 does not pair with the Echo Studio. This is a major shortcoming in my opinion. After hours of frustration and time with customer support, this is what I found. The Echo Show 15 will pair with the Echo Sub. The Echo Sub will pair with the Echo Studio. However, the Echo Studio will not pair with the Echo Show 15. It was a very confusing and disappointing journey.

Stucco,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2019","Comparing the Echo Studio to this Bose Home Speaker 500, the results reflect the small cost difference. I'm really displeased with the direction Amazon has taken with music, and this is more fuel for the fire. I don't want to have to worry about if my music is 3D and optimized for the Echo Studio device. I also don't want to pay a monthly fee for music, as I already own what I'm interested in, but you know- Amazon no longer lets me upload my music. Yeah- real helpful Amazon- thanks a pant load. Back to the speakers. The Echo device does better as an Alexa host- it's faster to respond and works well. The Bose is slower and the phone app is beyond primitive. However the Bose can go louder. The Echo Studio is reportedly 300 Watts. Bose won't say what the Wattage is, but maybe that's where the ""500"" came from? I kind of doubt that, as the Bose is not so much louder than the Echo. For audio quality, it's the Bose by a not dramatic, but noticeable margin. I also don't know if the mute switch on the Bose is mechanical (like the Echo) or just software, so if you're paranoid, the Echo may be a better fit. The business where Amazon claims the Echo Studio is able to detect the room and adjust the audio accordingly? Yeah- I've not heard anything that'd suggest that's so. I have it in a living room and it's not really ""wow'ing"" me. maybe if you're in a dorm room it's different. Summary- if you were going to get an Echo, get this one. If you want better sound, try Bose, Sonos, or some other Alexa enabled option. Your mileage may very, batteries not included, void where prohibited, etc., etc.",2.0 out of 5 stars

ChrisC,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2023","First off, the sound is everything the other reviews have stated. But after several hours of troubleshooting, let me spare some people my mistakes:

1: Playing music from a Bluetooth source, you’ll only get the studio itself, not any linked Echo subs or other speakers.

2: Same thing on the 3.5 audio coming into the back of the Studio.

3: There’s no voice command, option in the app, or button to change back to the 3.5 aux port. Apparently this -was- an option in older echo devices but no longer. Why? Just why?

I cannot help but expect that when Amazon pushes the narrative of this device as working with home theaters and syncing with one or multiple other speakers, that the functionality to use them all together will be… well… functional. As it is, I feel chastised for assuming that these speakers would function as speakers rather than just very expensive echo dots.

2/5, just buy an echo dot or input and plug them into real speakers. I’ll happily raise my review if Amazon pushes an update to fix this functionality in later software but for now, it’s a broken speaker.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Chris D. Faulk,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2020","Update 02/07/2020, it's been early January that I returned this speaker...Amazon called me within hours of this review and offered to talk to me about my problem so they could send the details to the developers. Nice touch Amazon. Today I called Amazon a 3rd time asking where my refund is after being told 2 previous times wait another 3-5 days. The customer service person never once answered 1 question I asked several time...what is the hold up?! Then told me have a nice day, good bye, and hung up. Good job Amazon, you're losing a 10+ year Prime member.

First of all, the build-quality and sound-quality are top notch. For its' size, this speaker really does produce a great sound. I've owned countless Bluetooth speakers, and this one delivered on sound.

But I'm all about functionality, and this speaker did not deliver on that. I used this speaker in my bedroom for TV sound and to play Spotify (which I do constantly). I have my Mac Mini connected to my TV and have the Echo connected via Bluetooth to my Mac Mini. For a few weeks it performed flawlessly...playing my Spotify when I fired up a playlist, and automatically connecting back to my Mac Mini when I closed out of Spotify. This would be the first Alexa device I've used that functioned properly. One night while watching a movie, the sound dropped out and the speaker disconnected from Bluetooth...now showing up as offline in the Alexa app. From this point on the issues just got progressively worse.

So I've given up on Amazon speakers except for my old Echo Plus (with the rotating volume ring) because it still functions 100% and I've never had to reconnect it to my network.

I am now back to my UE Boom 2 speakers...that when powered up automatically connect to my Mac Mini as they should and simply function. The sound quality is nothing like the Echo Studio, but at least it does what it's supposed to without fail.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2020","So I've been a pretty big fan of Amazon stuff for sometime. I use Amazon Basics stuff whenever I can. I also rarely leave reviews.

But this thing was a big enough disappointment and continues to be a frustration that I figured people need to know some stuff.

First off, as an Alexa device, it's fine. Plays music, does the 4 other things Alexa is able to do (different rant).

But one of the main reasons I got this thing wasn't for Alexa or as just a music player, I wanted to make a 2-studio-1-subwoofer home theater.

Well it really sucks at that so far. Connecting using the Alexa app is fairly simple, but it just refuses to be a reliable home theater system. It constantly drops sound, or has intermittent sound loss. Happens randomly. Sometimes I'll just turn on the TV and only the sub will be working. So I'll have to recreate the entire home theater system. It's also really picky about what it will and won't work with.

Also it refuses to connect via wired Ethernet like its fire TV brethren. And if the fire TV you want to make the home theater with isn't on the same SSID (as in, if my fire TV is connected via wired Ethernet and the studio\sub aren't) then it also makes problems.

As for sound quality, it's good not great. It doesn't quite fill a large, open floor plan family room. If you're looking for a better sound quality home theater than a comparably priced sound bar\sub combo will probably beat whatever studio\sub combo (dollar to dollar). I know going from my 6 year old LG soundbar\sub to the studios\sub did not improve overall sound quality to any noticeable amount. But I also got it for home automation reasons so I was ok with that.

I think if you want this for just a much better version of the echo plus that plays music then you'll be happy, but hold off for at least another 6-12 months if you're looking for a home theater upgrade.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Sharon Benzil,"Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2020","This Echo Studio was purchased with an Echo 3rd gen to provide linked sound from our TV (using a Fire Cube) in the living room and another room (to listen to audio from the TV) and while the literature on the Echo speakers are fuzzy on the ability of these two specific speakers to link together, it is implied they can. Wrong. They cannot. Strike 1. After weeks and weeks of owning the Echo Studio, we have now RECONNECTED a Bose Mini Soundlink to the Fire Cube because after weeks and weeks of factory restarts, reconnecting, linking and pairing, pairing and unpairing, and countless hours on Amazon troubleshooting chats (the SLOWEST customer service chats ever), I have given up on the home theater pairing. Strike 2 and 3. The connections are tenuous, drop constantly, and even when the speaker is linked with the Fire Cube, the sound doesn’t come through the speaker and remains on the TV. So frustrating. The sound link between the speakers for multi room music seems to be fairly reliable and therefore, we have decided they can be used for music but not home theater. We’ve resorted to a less expensive, smaller and older Bose speaker for the TV that is flawless in its linkage and provides adequate and trouble-free sound. The $300 in Echo speakers are, for multi room music only, overpriced and I would have returned these speakers a long time ago except we live outside the US and sending these back to the US is prohibitively expensive, and during these COVID times, almost impossible.

I would not recommend this speaker to anyone. Find something else. Anything else. Because clearly among all the things that Amazon does well, building a reliable, technologically capable, hi fidelity home theater speaker is sure not one of those things.",2.0 out of 5 stars

David A.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2020","So I was very excited to get the new Echo Studio as a Father's Day gift this year. I've been watching them and reading about them since they were first introduced and thought it would be a great addition to my Alexa Family. Well, I guess I was wrong and I'm pretty disappointed, particularly with the sound quality.

I love my music and frequently switch between Amazon Music, Pandora and Spotify. My primary speaker until the studio was a 3rd gen echo which really sounded great. I created a group with the smaller echo spots in my various locations within my open floor plan. It really sounded good, especially the 3rd gen echo which had a surprising low punch and crisp midrange.

So along comes the studio with its room filling 3 D sound and well, it just sounds like crap. My 3rd gen echo sounds so much better. What gives? I've done the room calibration and tried different locations but it just sounds flat and one dimensional. The bass is muddy and the midrange is washed out. Snare drums sound like me tapping my fingers on a table. I'm underwhelmed.

Setup was aggravating too. There is no way to recalibrate the sound other than doing a hard reset and starting all over again. Setting up a speaker group was frustratingly difficult. I had to delete all my groups and start over rather than adding the studio to an existing group.

Setting up the free included Philips Hue bulb was way more complicated than it should have been too. I just can't wait to tackle the dimmer switches I bought too.

On the plus side, its a very sturdy door stop.

Cabin Builder,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2020","Let's review the good and the bad.

In general, we listen to our music at volume 5 or lower (Alexa volume 5).
1. the Studio's sound enhancement is absolutely awful. We turned that off.
2. the Studio's flat EQ makes it sound almost identical to the standard Echo. Testing side-by-side and at volume 4 and under, nobody could tell the difference. at volume 6 you start to hear the difference and higher volumes you start to get the low end of the woofer. But we never listen to our music that loud. so not worth it.
3. the Studio's microphone missed so many things that the Echo never misses. You have to talk louder and closer for it to work.
4. the Studio's music playback doesn't work consistently. Alexa will be silent for 10 seconds and then say there is an issue. However, with the Echo we have never had that response (in years).
5. certain Alexa requests don't work. Alexa repeat - ""there is nothing to repeat"" after pausing...Alexa play ""there is nothing to play"". Again, we never get this response from the echo. It always keeps track of the song that was playing.
6. The Studio needs to be out in the open for it to sound decent. We tried putting it on a shelf but it sounded muffled.
7. The Studio is big for what it puts out. There are better, punchier speakers that are smaller (and less expensive)
8. The Studio doesn't replace the need for a sub. Which is why I bought it. I thought it would have a full sound that would negate the need for a sub. It doesn't, especially at lower volumes.

For the price, you can get a sub speaker combo that will be richer in sound. And at lower volumes, the Echo has nearly identical sound. No one in our household or that visited was impressed.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Well, setup was nice and easy, and the demo sounded great. Although I did note that in order to REALLY get the effect you have to have it center screen. Which means if I keep this I'm going to have to raise my television a few more inches so this behemoth doesn't get in the way. But I would do that...if it worked. I've had it 3 days, used it 2, had to reset it and set it back up at least 7 times so far. Most because I have 2 wifi connections in my home (one for me and one for guests), and although I set this up with the main one and NEVER gave it the password for the guest wifi, it's already in Amazon so it kept switching over. And there is no way in the app or anywhere else to change wifi connections without wiping it and starting over fresh. This happened even after I went in and told Amazon to forget the guest wifi altogether. It's also just come disconnected from the Echo Cube randomly, resulting in having to go into the app and unpair and repair the home theater setup. I haven't made it through a single movie yet without it having to be reset. Sound is great, as long as you have it centered. The home theater is great - when it works.

Setup was easily as always with Amazon devices, and after a quick google I paired with a fire tv stick 4k. Now that it was ready to go, I wanted to try listening to music on it. Tell Alexa to play music ... nothing. Try again ... nothing. Try command I've used on my other Echo ... nothing. I went on the spotify app and selected play music to the Echo Studio, and finally, excellent, rich sound. 15 minutes of a playlist going, and then audio stops. Start music again from the spotify app, everything is great, until a few songs later and audio stops.

I also connected a toslink from the TV to the Echo Studio line-in. Turn on the TV, and the Echo Studio switches to playing audio from the TV ... until it decides to stop playing all audio. I could not find any commands to get audio back up again. Turn off the TV and back on, and great, it's fixed, and 20 minutes later ... you get the picture.

Alexa's voice also had a weird glitch where she would speak in a extremely slow stutter. Not all of the time, just randomly.

The Echo studio produces clear, room filling sound with respectable base. If you're looking for stereo sound, get two, as a single just can't replicate a stereo set up.

For an audiophile, musician and music lover such as myself, this announcement was the holy grail of music. Amazon claimed you can now access millions of tracks in lossless hi resolution audio quality. But let m clear on what this really means to avoid confusion. Typical streaming services such as Spotify stream with audio quality that is sub-par to audio CD's. Amazon's new service boasts both HD audio and Ultra HD audio. When you pull up a track on the service, it designates whether it is an HD audio track, or an Ultra HD audio track. An HD audio track is CD quality, with a bit rate of 16 bits and a sampling rate from 44.1khz to 48kkhz. While many marketers tout this as lossless, it's not really lossless, but it is a big improvement over standard streaming. On the other hand, true lossless is what Ultra HD audio is all about. True lossless Ultra Audio tracks must have a bit rate of 24 bits, and a sample rate that can go as high as 192k. These are true hi-resolution audio tracks that are much better sounding than HD tracks. I was an early adopter of the now defunct DVD-Audio/SACD formats, which were true 24 bit hi-res audio, so I immediately upgraded to the new Amazon Music HD service, excited to have such a vast library of hi-res audio tracks now at my disposal.

I had recently downsized my home, so didn't have the room anymore for a true 5.1 discreet surround system anymore. I'v been using a soundbar and wasn't happy. So when Amazon introduced the Echo Studio, I took notice. After researching, I learned that the Echo Studio supports 24 bit audio, meaning it has the ability to play Ultra HD tracks. So it was time to update my audio system. I went to Best Buy the first day the Studios went on sale there, and invested in 2 Echo Studios and an Echo Sub.

In the Alexa app, you can configure these components for a home theater environment and that was my plan. I had also already owned a Fire TV Cube, which was great for streaming my content and controlling my home theater devices using voice commands. I upgraded my Fire TV Cube to gen 2 in anticipation of integrating it with my Echo Studios and Sub.

If you want Dolby Atmos soundtracks when watching movies, you need to have the Fire TV/Fire TV Cube in the mix, as the Fire TV performs the audio decoding for these surround modes. Through the Alexa app, it was relatively easy to configure the Fire TV Cube, configure each Echo Studio for left and right channel, and the sub. That is my Home Theater Group.

Now this is where things begin to derail. I said to Alexa ""Play Jack Ryan"", and I was immediately impressed with the sound emanating from the 2 Studios and the Sub. It did a great job decoding the Dolby Atmos soundtrack, and short of a true discreet surround setup, I was quite impressed. Center dialog came through nicely, soundtrack effects were presented on a nice wide soundstage, giving a nice surround illusion without actual rear speakers.

Next up, the moment I've been waiting for. Time to listen to some 24 bit hi res audio. Through the Amazon Music HD app in the Fire TV Cube, I searched for some Ultra HD tracks. Again the tracks are designated as HD or Ultra HD. I decided to play The Sound of Silence by Disturbed, which was marked as Ultra HD. ""Alexa, play the Sound of Silence by Disturbed"". Oddly, the song started playing, but it took about 5 seconds for the audio to actually kick in, cutting of the beginning of the song. The other thing I noticed was when I used the voice command, it pulled up the standard HD version of the track. I knew there was an Ultra HD version, as I had just looked for it. So I did a manual search, found the Ultra HD version and started playing it. Oddly, it sounded no different from the other version to me. The label on the screen said Ultra HD now, so this was odd. I clicked on the track information, and was surprised to learn that even though the screen label for the track is Ultra HD, the song was actually streaming at 16 bit, 44.1k audio. This is not hi-res Ultra HD at all. Any laymen would look at the screen and think they're streaming in Ultra HD because it says it's an Ultra HD track, but the track information was telling a different story.

This is where the call to tech support happened. Tech support sent some logs to the development team and them got back to me. What he tried to tell me at first, was that I was indeed listening to 24 bit audio through the Studios. How can that be possible when I'm actively streaming and it clearly says 16 bit, 44.1k. It didn't make any sense to me. Once you have the Cube integrated with the Studios, the voice interaction is between you and the Cube, not you and the Studios. Further, if you need the Cube to decode the Dolby Atmos soundtrack, then it stands to reason that the audio decoding is taking place in the Cube, not the Studios. That was my argument to the tech support guy, and he agreed that made sense. So...I've come to find out that the Cube is only capable of 16 bit audio output, not 24 bit. So the Cube is sending the audio to the Studios in lower resolution, not taking advantage of either the Ultra HD tracks in Amazon Music, or the capabilities of the Studio's hi-res audio capabilities.

So I cannot natively, in my home theater setup, issue a voice command and have Alexa play back an Ultra HD music file through the Echo Studio speakers. This was a huge let down, especially after making all this investment. But I still had one more test. If I bypass the Cube, and use the Amazon Music app in my iPhone to cast directly to the Studios, then this should give me Ultra HD audio in all its glory. I'm doing this for testing purposes only. I should have to, nor would I want to, whip out my phone in my home theater to play Ultra HD tracks. I should simply be able to issue a voice command to my home theater components, and the Amazon Music app in my home theater system should be doing it for me.

The cool thing about the mobile app version though, is when you click on the HD or Ultra HD icon, it displays the full resolution of the track, the bit and sample rates of the equipment it's connected to, and the actual resolution being played. SO now I can validate the bit rate and sampling rate going from my iPhone Amazon Music app directly to the Echo Studios. Only I can't. When I press the Ultra HD icon I get a message that says ""Information not available when casting""! What?? So I can see this info on all my other playback devices such as my car entertainment system, my headphones, but not the Studios? So I still have no idea what the actual nit and sampling rates are bypassing the Cube.

Amazon: You are touting the benefits of Ultra HD hi-res audio. You have created an audiophile speaker with the Echo Studio (supposedly) capable of playing 24 bit Ultra HD tracks. But there is no way for me to stream these Ultra HD tracks natively in my home theater, and no way for me to even validate the audio resolution from my phone direct to the Studios. So here I am with all this new equipment and still can't natively enjoy hi res audio through a simple voice command to either my Echo Studios or the Cube. Seems to me the fix would be a software update to make the Cube 24 bit. Please don't make me buy a third 24 bit Cube!",3.0 out of 5 stars
Riggs Royena,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2020","First and foremost if you are looking for standalone Bluetooth speaker, then the Echo Studio is a must buy. You'll be extremely happy and at 200 dollars its a home run on value and performance. Highly recommended for that aspect.

Now if you are using it as a home theater system, that is a whole another story. Let me first say I was intrigued by the Echo Studio because of the Dolby Atmos, 3D immersive sound, and just the whole complimentary features I would get being a Fire TV Cube 2nd gen user. First impressions, lets be honest, the Studio is big and ugly. But guys we can get over that, my wife hated the look of it as soon as I brought it into the house. It has an unforgiving presence, hate it or love it, kinda feel. Not a deal breaker for me but for some people its a viable reason to pass on the Studio.

Lets proceed, I am going to be honest, I tried my best to set the speaker up as a home theater system on my own going through the Alexa app. The first of many frustrations to come, I ended up having to factory reset it (deregister it) and call Amazon Alexa tech support to help me set it up. In my defense, I came from Homekit/ Siri/ Apple TV world where things are arguably a little more user friendly. The customer service/ tech support for Amazon Alexa services is outstanding. If I ever have to call them again for any issues, I feel confident that I will get my issue resolved over the phone. Alright so with the assistance of an Alexa technician guiding me through the process we were able to connect my Echo Studio to my Fire TV Cube. Thats what I wanted! It was a longer process than I wanted but I was finally there, probably took a couple hours to fiddle with it including the hold time and assistance over the phone. It is what it is, just a meh moment for me. But now I'm all set up and all is working.

Then through out the night we proceed.
Flood gates of frustration opens...

Before I take a dump on the Echo Studio, let me reiterate when sound comes out of the speaker it sounds really good. Standalone Bluetooth speaker its number one. Its without a doubt should be on anyone's radar looking for one. With the flexibility of all the music streaming services, solid mids and highs and house rattling bass, it is definitely a contender in this space. Price and value alone to me its hands down the winner.

Now lets talk about my deal breaking issues with the speaker.

Amazon advertises the Echo Studio as a theater system that supports Dolby Atmos using their latest Fire TV Cube, I told you that earlier and thats what lead me down this path. But there are issues on the software side that needs to be addressed before this even gets close to a theater system replacement.

Audio and video sync issues. Yes I know you are able to go into settings and tweak this, and so I did... various times throughout the night. It seemed like after awhile the audio and video sync would sway off and I would have to go back into the settings and tweak it again. A high frustration, but forgivable for the price. I could live with it and hope for updates to come with better syncing support. As long as nothing else was an issue I could deal with it, But I am now needing a flawless experience from here on out.

Unfortunately, flawless is not in the Studio's vocabulary.

Switching between Bluetooth music from my phone and theater system is an absolute nightmare and some how Amazon Music playing from the Fire Cube TV was thrown into the mix as well. Its like Freddy vs Jason, two nightmares into one. The studio can not handle and decide the proper channel to play the media without a little effort on the user end. Its hard to explain but juggling media playback for a theater system shouldn't have multiple sources; Bluetooth and Fire Cube TV that should be it. It seems like both devices are competing for attention, while the speaker should just be a speaker when connected to a fire cube.

Side note, ""Alexa, Connect to my phone."" never worked. Studio also has a hard time handling more than one Bluetooth connected device. Had to manually connect my wife's and mine's device each and every time to play music. Also a couple times I had to restart the whole set up because music wasn't playing. Restarted the Fire Cube, Studio, and phone to get music playing. My frustration is building at this point.

The final straw though was later that night while watching a show the audio without warning abruptly goes out. Video still playing but the Studio was silent. I was fed up. I wasn't going to bring something in my home that I had to babysit every night. I didn't even try to troubleshoot the issue. I did the final and last factory reset on the Studio and packaged the speaker back up to be returned.

I know I am an edge case and I am being extremely critical on some functionality , but at the end of the day, I dont want to deal with any issues. I want to set it and forget it. Give me the same sound and ugly design with a $100 higher price tag but a flawless seamless integration, I would gladly pay. I dont want to have to think when I come home, I want to flop on the couch and just watch tv. Bottom line I wanted to love the Studio, but in the end with all its perks comes unnecessary issues that I dont really need.

I DONT recommend it as a Fire TV Cube theater system set up.
I DO recommend it as a standalone bluetooth speaker.",3.0 out of 5 stars
D,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2022","UPDATE #1: I found out how to control the sound settings. I just decided to try saying, ""Alexa, decrease bass"" and it flashed and while I could not tell for sure, I tried another command, ""Alexa, decrease bass to minimum"" then afterwards I said ""Alexa, increase bass to max"" and there was a significant difference. Alexa confirmed my settings were applied when I tried to increase bass after being already maxed out and Alexa responded by saying, ""Bass is already set to max."" This also works with Treble. Hope this helps some of you out.

Dolby atmos does not work on PC and it sounds like a mid to low end stereo over bluetooth. This was confirmed through the Dolby Access app for the PC. I hope to find out that I am wrong about this. I did read that I can supposedly get up to 5.1 surround but it requires another adapter that I just placed an order for and will update to see if it actually works. Aux cable does not register to my PC or smartphone at all and customer service technician could not figure out how to get it to work and stated they will send me an email with instructions within 30 minutes. It has been several hours as of this review with no updates.

I always find that most people who say the sound quality of a certain speaker is excellent/audiophile quality usually have no idea what they're talking about. I would bet most are running this over bluetooth and not realizing it does not allow the full features of what this speaker supposedly can put out. It has a punchy bass and that causes the illusion that the speakers sound better. As far as I know, this product requires a cable to utilize its dolby atmos, and the Amazon service tech could not confirm or deny this. However, read the description that says it works with the latest Firesticks and other devices but not with older gen. Perhaps this means for TVs, you can still wireless connect over bluetooth and utilize dolby atmos.

I have not tried it on a TV for dolby atmos but as stated above, the description implies you may need to get an optical cable to connect with your TV for the dolby atmos. However, one of my biggest problems with this is that you cannot adjust sound settings. I don't want the bass on at night because I don't want to disrupt my neighbors, and there is literally no way to adjust that or any other highs/mid/lows. I'm hoping the optical cable will allow me to adjust settings with the sound card driver on my PC.

On a similar note, it is worth mentioning that not being able to adjust the bass affects the sound quality of movies, as it often adds too much bass to the voices of the actors and sounds odd. Additionally, it adds almost a reverb to the voice, which I tried adjusting through windows sound settings by turning off spatial sound and digital surround. Nothing seems to fix the issue. I have loudness equalization turned on and while it helps movies and music, the Alexa notifications come out at a significantly louder volume to the point where I have to turn it down only to have to turn the volume back up when I resume a movie or playlist.

This device doesn't allow you to use the built in mic for the majority of apps outside of Amazon but it will set the default mic on your PC to the Echo Studio. This is annoying because you will have to manually go into every single app that the Echo mic does not work and change it back to your original mic.

In any case, until I can hear how it sounds with dolby atmos or even 5.1 surround, I would say do not believe the hype that these are audiophile quality as they sound worse than my $70 bluetooth speakers. These don't sound bad, just don't expect to be blown away over bluetooth.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Jade,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2024","Works well as a speaker OR as a smart speaker. Functionally it only likes one or the other though. It does not like switching back and forth from the line in audio to streaming media. Any time I give a command to play music or an audio book it works, but when I want it to go back to just being a speaker I have to play with it for 10 minutes to get my computer audio to work. Also Spotify absolutely refuses to work with mine and searching the internet it seems like this has been a problem for years. I could have gotten a soundbar if all I wanted was a good speaker. Really quite bummed, but at least it sounds good.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Townie,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2024","First unit arrived used and damaged, so Amazon sent me a second that was brand new. We are using both for music (mostly). I use Amazon Prime Music HD and my wife uses Spotify. Spotify works very well and seems to be stable. Amazon Prime Music is very buggy. Firstly, if it continues playing similar music, it always replays the last song already played first. Secondly, it cannot distinguish between different artists with the same name and so you get some random musical styles. Thirdly, the Amazon Music phone app and the device lose sync regularly. The Alexa phone app and the device also lose sync regularly, so there is no way to reliably see what is currently playing. Sometimes fast forwarding a song will cause the message ""an error has occurred"" and sometimes a song will not play even though it is available and has played previously. Sometimes songs that are unavailable will play, which is a bonus...

Sound quality wise I find the unit sometimes sounds excellent and balanced and sometimes sounds trebly and sibilant, there is no rhyme or reason to how it will sound. Sometimes the bass speaker will stop working and you have to reboot the unit (I had to reset it and re-set it up from scratch).

The front firing tweeter does not produce any sound with spatial audio disabled (and hardly produces any sound with spatial audio turned on). So most of what you hear is the two side firing speakers and the bass speaker (when it chooses to work). The upward firing speaker seems to also only work with spatial audio enabled. This is an issue because spatial audio does not sound good on all material. Material specifically developed with it in mind sounds great, but everything else sounds echo-ey.

Note also that there is no volume leveling feature for any of the music services, so you will play one song and then the next will be 5 times louder, so you are constantly asking Alexa to change volume. This is, of course, unless you use it with Bluetooth, but the sound quality won't be as good.

As a smart speaker, when the unit works properly it sounds really good - in fact it almost seems to break the laws of physics, it sounds so large. Hopefully there will be a fix for the non-spatial material (getting all the speakers to actually work) and the instability.

As for the smart part, it is useful for news and weather, but trying to get suggestions on where to buy something for example comes up with completely inappropriate results. For example, asking where you can buy ""home décor items"" will get suggestions for coffee shops or bakeries mixed in with chain stores. Also, be careful if you banter with the unit because there is a chance you could accidently subscribe to an entertainment subscription service.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Tall woman,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2021","Once I start this review I would like to mention that I did a lot of research before I purchased the Echo Studio product. My 7 year old Sony sound bar for my TV suddenly died and was not fixable or in order to fix it was too pricey. Let me first say this product is for a second home and the room functions as a bedroom and entertainment room. This room is not a home theater so what I am trying to describe is I didn’t need a robust sound system based on the room size and function. Also, I did want a system (speaker) where I could listen to music and have good sound from the TV. Finally, I should mention I have Play1 Sonos speakers (1st Generation so no smart functions) at my primary home. Okay, understanding all those areas let me provide my review…

I have had the Echo Studio for about 2 ½ months and the sound is very good with the music and playing through the TV in the size of the room as I described above. The smart functions are nice to have but I will be honest I don’t really need to have them. Based on the research I did and reviews on Amazon and outside of Amazon said the sound from speaker was almost as good as the Sonos play1 speakers and I have to disagree. My personal opinion is the sound from Sonos is much better and the functions with Sonos app are 95% better for music lovers. What do I mean by that statement is I feel there are limits with the Echo Studio based on functions and performance for music lovers or as a primary speaker for music and tv in a smaller size room. The following list below includes the limitation of the echo studio.
• Always defaults to Amazon Music ( I recently changed the function within the app to my favorite music platform but Alexa still goes to Amazon music but not as much). If I want it to go to a favorite station of mine I need to be specific in my statement by naming the station exactly. And I am finding this very annoying b/c on my Sonos I have them saved and just go to the app and play them. So I have to look them up everytime if I want the echo studio to play them. This is a big fail for me.
• Unable to save favorite stations
• Doesn’t have the capability to store recent playlist or station. For example, if I like what Alexa did pick I say save that station and she communicates that function does not exist.
• Also, I don’t find the Alex app helpful when it comes to the music element as the Sonos App is. Sonos app is seamless to me. Also, I love the Sonos app in terms of saving the history of what the user has listen to and I can store favorites.
• The search function in the Sonos app is great because I can see all the options to play from all my linked music platforms.
I want to communicate to those individuals who are music lovers and are using many online platforms for their music. And understanding the difference between the two products. If you are reading this review and your in the market in purchasing a speaker for music and to play through the TV. I would highly recommend Sonos speaker b/c it is seamless more flexibility and more functions within the Sonos app that is not offered through the Alex app. This is why I am doing this review b/c that was not mention in my research and if I had known I would have spent more money for those functions and flexibility. I realized that I did get a better price but for me at what cost. I will say I am good with my echo studio and it does sound good. But if I had known what I know now, I would have gone with a Sonos speaker. I wanted to provide this information for anyone who is on the fence like I was….",3.0 out of 5 stars
cefu63,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2024","The sound quality is, of course, better than my Echo Dot but beyond a slight bass boost, it's not that different. I've got it cranked and it doesn't balance with the mid and highs. Only reason I upgraded was to get a fuller and richer sound. The spatial processing makes the sound worse...at least in the room I have it in. Small room...15' x 15'.

*After submitting my review an Amazon Outreach Representative called me to see if they could help and troubleshoot the problem. Basically a reset and maybe move to a different location. So I did and I have to admit, not a whole lot of difference. I did move the speaker closer to where I sit so yes, sound is definitely better but that's just because it's closer. All that being said...I do appreciate that they reached out so they get a star for that. I might still do a full-on factory reset and see what happens...",3.0 out of 5 stars
n0nuf2,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2020","Good day Amazon!

So, I've had a pair of Gen2 Echo+ and Echo Sub for some time. I like overwhelming bass in all music; I don't want to have the volume on +10 to feel the bass. The Echo 6"" sub is decent for what it is. I have the two Echo+ and Sub stereo grouped with FireTV Cube for 2.1 sound while watching TV (only from FireTV). Sounds very good for what it is. Now I've purchased 2 Echo Studio speakers as well in hopes the larger drivers will 'fill' the bottom end. Honestly, if you like your head ripped off by too much midrange (1K, 1.2K, 5K, etc), then these are for you; The Studios have no 'heart'. I used to run sound for our band and I know when there's too much of something in the mix; FWIW. I turn the Studio mids all the way down -6 and drop the treble to -2 and set bass to +6 then the Studios sound just 'ok'. So, I paired my Echo Sub with the Studios to see if that balances it out. Nope... No matter what I set the EQ to or turn spatial on or off, makes no difference with any kind of music (3D or not). The Studios actually attenuate the sound coming out of the Echo Sub. Far less bass paired up with Studio than Echo+. I'm seriously considering returning the Studios and getting 2 more Echo+ and another sub. (all of this stuff would benefit from more user EQ and crossover adjustment). In a final attempt to get 'MY' preferred sound out of all of this I created an Echo+ stereo pair with the Echo Sub, then just stereo paired the Studios together, set all EQ accordingly, then created an ""Everywhere"" group out of all of that. In that configuration the Studios aren't attenuating the sound from the sub. One would think that the size of the drivers on the Studio would trump the Echo+ as far as low end, but nope. W/e these things are doing is wrong IMO. It is true that Studio is clearer than Echo+, but to what end? Not a good one IMO... When I turn the EQ to +6 Bass, I expect the thing to thump (within reason for a 4""+ woofer). If I had a wish it would be that Amazon Echo releases an 8"" 800+ watt Echo Sub (with a decent user adjustable EQ) so those of us who LIKE the low end more than screaming mid range can manually shape the sound and get the sound they want. All in all, after trying high-end Apple, Sonos, Google, Bose and a few other expensive options side by side (yes, bought them all at the same time and tried at same time, then returned the others), the Amazon speakers sound the best, and are the clearest. (By the way, don't believe what you hear in the store or the sound demos... The acoustics are NOT the same as the environment YOU will be using them, and their ""demos"" are adjusted to make 'their' device sound better than it is with real music). I wish I knew where to post this comment that Amazon team would read it; probably wouldn't matter. LOL. All aforementioned devices have been tested on a 400GB connection with Amazon Music, Google Music, Pandora, Spotify, several other streaming services, as well as Bluetooth music from multiple devices. Agree/Disagree, there's my experienced 10 cents worth opinion for anyone considering these devices.

I own a LOT of Echo devices and can't wait for new better Echos to be released. I just hope the Studio is NOT where they are going in the future... Don't get me wrong, it's a nice speaker, but not everyone wants screaming mid range. Example, most everyone I've EVER met uses a "" V "" or "" W "" configuration in their EQ. That represents CUTTING most of the screaming mid range. FWIW.",3.0 out of 5 stars
The Queen Bacon,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2020","This is my review for the 2 studios and sub connected the the cube.
Please be aware that I think that the 2 studios and subwoofer are amazing together. The sound is outstanding, my only setback is that I can't connect a bluetooth record player to the group to listen. I can only listen on one of the studios, and no sub. I am hoping that this is something that amazon fixes in the future...

So I had a regular Fire tv that worked fine, we recently purchased 2 amazon alexa studios (amazing sound! kudos amazon!) and a subwoofer. well amazon got us on the hook for an additional $90.00 because we couldn't connect the group to the fire tv, we needed to upgrade to the 2nd gen cube. FINE, we move the tv into our bedroom lol.
Fast forward, well we watch a lot of shows on amazon video, hulu, and sling. MOSTLY recorded things, sound and function 5+ stars! We love that you can control the hdmi ports and everything with the cube remote/alexa by telling her. I Think its awesome, you want to play video games alexa switch to hdmi 3, ok.
So in the mornings getting the family ready for the day, and when I am working from home I love to have the news on in the background. I notice news12 app doesn't work (local live news app) , do everything, delete cookies, cache, delete redownload the app. So im like EFF IT, put on sling, I Guess im effen stuck with fox/abc, well those won't work with live tv either! wait look amazon has a live news app, download that, oh look that doesn't work either. I factory reset the cube, reset everything back up still doesn't work, even tried hard wiring the cube to the internet to make sure it wasn't our wifi (even though we have 2 fire sticks, and a tv that are working fine with all the apps and live tv). Still doesn't work.
Speak to amazon they work me through everything, still nothing works, they send me a new cube. Set it up, didn't connect it to the speakers, live tv works fine, HOOOOOOOORAY LOOK AT THIS LIVE TV WORKS FINE! Now I can catch up on this whole coronavirus news lmao. Time to set up the speaker group (I mean I just spent $600.00 on amazon speakers to use with the tv/music I mine as well use them) . Live news worked for literally 5 seconds, then freezes. We reset the router, hardwire it, update it, delete cookies and did a little dance and said some prayers around it, still nothing worked for live tv. My husband swears its some kind of cube bug maybe that live tv just doesn't work with it, I said ehh maybe its the speaker group (2 amazon echo studios and subwoofer which happen to be the reason I even bought this god damn cube). I forget the group, live tv starts right up.
In my opinion this should be a glitch worked out before making people buy this device to work with all of these expensive amazon speakers. Some might even be like why do you need stereo surround sound to watch to watch the news? I don't.. but what about sports events, or if I decide to watch a show when it airs instead of pre recording? none of that works. So in a weeks time I spend about $650.00 on an amazon entertainment system that doesn't work. I was already upset that I couldn't hook up a bluetooth device to my entertainment group (I would like to play records on the 2 studios and subwoofer) and can't do that, but now this?

HTD,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2019","This is a nice speaker and a great value as an alternative to an Echo in a bedroom or kitchen or especially, in a multi-room setup. It has everything the new Echo has with better sound and it's only a fifty dollars upgrade (provided you get the hub in both). So the difference in sound quality is well worth it. But understand it's limitations and advantages before you buy one.

I bought 2 Studios and set them up as a stereo pair and the sound get's loud and it stays clear. I compared them to my Definitive Tech speakers and okay, not even close, the $1000 Def's blew them away. But that's a 600 premium. So, let's compare them to my sons HomePods at 300. Much closer comparison. But still, the HomePod's clarity and sound stage win but not by much. But usually you're either in the Apple or Amazon ecosystem so not really relevant. Then I put them next to the new Echo's and at normal volume the Studio win's in both clarity and bass. The Echo's bass is way too boomy (although the sounds not bad in the new Echo) and that affects the clarity. At louder volumes, the Studio's crush. And it's only $50 more, if both have hubs, however even if you compare it to the $99 Echo it's well worth the upgrade. But remember, it's a substitute for an Echo not a dedicated home theater or music.

As for the sound, it's spacious. It fills the room and provides a deep listening environment. However, that does effect the focus. It's hard to identify precisely where instruments are coming from (even when paired in stereo) but to get big, deep sound, that's a problem with all lower-end speakers. The clarity is amazing, no bass boom here. Even fine wind instruments are clearly heard. This was for me the aspect that stood out. Too many speaker makers tend to over-emphasize the bass (Sonos!). But that's what sells to many customers. It seems like Amazon didn't fall into that trap. That's not to say it lacks bass but its not overwhelming. If you want big boom, use an equalizer. So overall I like the sound, especially for a bedroom but don't buy it for GREAT sound. You can do better with 400, but you'll give up the convenience of Alexa and a hub.

Pairing 2 in stereo improves the sound but not to the point it can compete with most dedicated systems so I don't see the point. Yes, it improves the depth and gives better imagining then one but is it really a main listening system worth $400? Especially when you can't play 5.1 and the optical input won't split to allow stereo from an outside source? It doesn't improve the sound to the point it can compare with the sound or function book shelf speakers. Remember you're paying for Alexa and a hub where speaker makers are putting the money into better speakers. Get two put them in different rooms and enjoy what it does best, multi-room music and have Alexa in 2 rooms.

The issue when considering these for a Home Theater system or as a replacement for a soundbar is that they ONLY play with content that comes through the Amazon Fire. That's a problem. Want to replace your sound bar with these? Well not if you have cable, a game system or DVD and don't want mono sound. I know wires are so 2000 but not when you have content from another source without physically connecting and disconnecting the input each time. Especially when the studio's sound can't play stereo let alone compete with a 5.1 or 7.1 system when you use the optical input.

So where do these excel? First - In a multi-room setup this is a great system. You can buy 10 Studio's and still be paying for the wiring of a traditional multi-room set-up. And it would sound great. No doubt, this is a huge positive. Second - In an apartment where you want better sound, have a soundbar for TV and a smaller space to fill with sound. And lastly, if you are considering a new Echo or Echo Plus. For a little more $ you can get better sound and Alexa.

In the end, anywhere you want better sound and Alexa makes this a nice upgrade.",3.0 out of 5 stars
CABeachGal M,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2024","The sound is great. So great, I ordered a second one. When I unboxed this speaker, it was also in a black bag which was extremely chemical/ stinky. I thought that the bag was the source. Today however, upon entering the room where the new speaker is placed, there's still a very, very strong chemical off-gassing odor. It's really unfortunate because I would love to keep this speaker next to where I sleep. But 8 hours of breathing in the glue, fabric, components off-gassing....well, I'm not really sure.

For now, the room is well ventilated. My experience with that new chemical small is that it often takes 6months to 2 years to sometimes never having the material lose that off-gassing.

Bummer. The sound is better than the Sonos spatial audio speaker. Alexa app connects my smart plug devices so well. Really, really easy and good sound. I'm just conscious about the air I breathe.",3.0 out of 5 stars
andrescolombia,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2024","The Echo speaker I recently tried out is decent for basic functionalities but falls short in some key areas, particularly as a home theater option and its connectivity with Fire Stick. The speaker's limitations become evident when you push it beyond basic use. When attempting to use it as part of a home theater setup, the Echo speaker simply doesn't deliver the immersive audio experience needed. The sound lacks the depth and richness required for watching movies or playing high-definition content. It might be adequate for occasional TV shows or background music, but it cannot replace a dedicated home theater system.

The connectivity with Fire Stick is another significant drawback. The pairing process is cumbersome and often unreliable. Even when connected, there is noticeable lag and occasional audio dropouts, which can be quite frustrating. This inconsistent performance severely undermines its utility as a companion to the Fire Stick, especially if you are looking to enjoy a seamless streaming experience.

In summary, while the Echo speaker is a competent device for basic tasks and casual listening, it is not suitable as a home theater alternative. Additionally, its poor connectivity with the Fire Stick makes it a less-than-ideal choice for those looking to integrate it into their entertainment setup. If your needs are simple, this Echo speaker might suffice, but for more demanding audio and streaming applications, you might want to look elsewhere.",3.0 out of 5 stars
mike in mass,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2021","Purchased my first studio from a major chain as Amazon couldn't ship until after Christmas. Purchased my second studio from Amazon about a month later. My setup includes the two studios, 2 original echos, a gen2 echo dot, a 5 inch echo show, two thermostats (honeywell and lux), five cameras (blink and wyse), two lights (feit), and a few plugs (kasa and amazon).

Plus -
Easy setup just like my Echos and Dots. Runs all my devices.
Better bass.
It has some weight to it.
Has an optical cable port.
Can pair two for stereo.
Dolby atmos if paired with some firesticks.
Plays UHD and 3D music via Amazon Music HD subscription

Minus -
Bluetooth pairing – hard to pair with my Bose QC35ii headphones. I could barely hear the sound setting the echo studio to volume 9. Worked better after a firmware update.
Light ring – location is wrong, can't see it from across the room, so never know when you have a notification, never mind if it is processing.
Stereo pair – once you pair two of them together you lose the bluetooth functionality with music. The headphones will connect but only voice will be transmitted, the studio will break the connection to play the music through the stereo pair instead of the headphones. Very frustrating if you are trying to use headphones on a treadmill. Customer service says this is the intended functionality.
Optical port – none of my toslink cables fit this port, it seems to be a combination optical port and a analog port, requires a completely different cable.
Connection issues – sometimes it will lose connection with amazon music requiring a reboot.

Overall – I like the bass, I like the HD music, and the sound isn't bad. It has more bass than my other smart speakers. The microphones work well. Functionality works the same as other echo devices, so I can control all my smart devices via Alexa. I didn't like losing bluetooth connectivity if you use two studios as a stereo pair. I understand the issue but by breaking bluetooth it doesn't give me a lot of incentive to keep paying for Amazon HD music. I had some other issues with the music where it would acknowledge my music choice and then come back and tell me it had trouble playing my music. This can be fixed with a reboot of the studio. I haven't been able to use the optical port as it seems to use a non standard cord. Haven't tried the Atmos via the Fire stick. For the cost it is a better speaker than most but don't expect it to replace your high end surround sound system.

Tips – I now plug the studio into an amazon smart plug, so I can tell another echo to turn off studio and turn on studio, it is easier than having to unplug the studio if you need a reboot. This reboot seems to be required after a firmware update. I gave up on trying to use bluetooth with a stereo pair. I was told I could break the stereo pair to use the headphones but the only way I could do that was to fire up the app each time I wanted to use my headphones. My solution is to use another device for headphones, luckily I have an echo show in the same area, so I use that for the headphones as I run on the treadmill.
Pairing in stereo works well for UHD music but I prefer a single studio for 3D music. Maybe the original concept was not intended for a stereo pair. But It's still a keeper for me.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Amy Scott,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2024","Terrible user/setup experience. Nothing works. The app doesn't work. The speaker doesn't work. Nothing will connect. I've restarted the device over 100 times, redownloaded the app, reset my router. NOTHING. WORKS. This is useless. If I can get it online in the next hour, I'll update my rating to 3 star at most. And that's if the sound blows me away. Otherwise, it's going back to the factory and I'm ordering a normal bluetooth speaker that takes 2.5 seconds to connect. This is ridiculous. I don't need Alexa or anything other than a speaker and I can't even use it for that. Unreal.

Updated review: After two hours and going through every help forum and troubleshooting step, I fumbled my way through the app to find support and they were able to reset my device. This added another 30 or so minutes to setup and ate my entire Sunday afternoon. The problem isn't with the device so much as it is with the app. The user experience is not intuitive, the interface is messy (most of the things you see on the home screen of the app I have no use for), and if you don't use Alexa for anything other than music, this is not a good choice.

NashGrasser,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2021","I've owned my Amazon Echo Studio for almost 24 hours now and was about to return it this morning when I discovered something everyone reading these reviews should be aware of.

Straight out of the box, it sounded AMAZING. Exactly as I had hoped, and maybe even a little better than I expected. Mind you, I was simply playing tracks from my Amazon account. I have two Echo Show's as well, and wanted the studio for the kitchen.

Setup was a breeze and I was up and running in no time flat. Rich full bass, beautifully balanced mids and highs...just fantastic. I was beaming from ear to ear. I could even feel vibration on my tile kitchen floor and it was sitting on a granite counter top!

But then I decided to pair it with my other Echo Show's as well as my Samsung TV Soundbar, for a full room by room home audio immersion experience, and that's when it all went to hell.

I had some issues initially getting everything linked up, but finally they were all working. Great I thought, but suddenly the Echo Studio was putting out about 1/2 the volume. Like the woofer just quit.

No matter what settings I chose in the Alexa App on my iPhone, it sounded thin, somewhat tinny, lifeless, and had low volume even when turned to full blast (mind you it about blew me out of the house when I first out of the box).

So I re-initialized it, fired it up and voila, it was sounding great again as a standalone speaker (not linked to others). So I tried connecting to just one of my Echo Show's and poof, there goes the woofer again. Suddenly, it's a shell of its former self.

I re-initialized again and boom, we're back! So at this point, I have to conclude something is wrong with the bluetooth connection and the firmware. I'm now just using it as a standalone speaker in the kitchen and it sounds superb. This may be in need of a firmware update, but nothing is available as of the writing of this review. I will add that pairing via bluetooth with my iPhone works fine. The problem occurs when pairing with an Echo Show and/or Samsung TV system. At least for me. So I'm just not going to do that now.

Yes, in case you're wondering, I tried turning off the spatial option in the Alexa App, boosted the EQ settings, Checked volume settings, etc. Nothing fixed it except a hard reinitialization. Simply unplugging it wasn't the answer either.

So if your Echo Studio is suffering from low volume and wimpy sounding output, do what I did. Reset it and start over...and don't connect it to any other speakers until someone figures this out. I'm rating 3 stars because of this problem, but will happily upgrade my rating if/when these problems are addressed and resolved.",3.0 out of 5 stars

This wasn't always the case, but it getting more and more prevalent.

Alex,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2024",The sound is better than other alexa devices which are annoyingly low fidelity. It doesn't work as an assistant because it is hard of hearing and the notification light ring is on top where it isn't visible from the side. I guess it's meant for a low table whereas I have it on a shelf that's about 4 feet high. I would have returned it but I got a good deal on it and was in disbelief of its poor hearing. I thought the hearing issue was relative to the other alexa devices I have so this one would learn to respond. It hasn't. I have to stand near it and yell to wake it. I mainly use it as part of a speaker group to listen to podcasts and I like it for that as I have it in the same room as the computer I spend the most time at.

Holt Rowley,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2023","First I will say the speaker is great. Infact if you connect your iPhone to it it becomes a much better speaker because you now have access to SIRI. ALEXA is the thing that ruins all these echos. I have multiple of these including this one.

I got this a little over a year ago and it was great. Well the last 6 months Amazon is deciding to take the feature I liked best and turned Alexa into a salesman.

I loved the voices and charged us for them such as sam Jackson and then just take it away because they don’t want to pay to maintain it. Then every time I talk to Alexa she wants me to order something. This is one of the many reasons siri is better. Sorry if I want to buy something. I’ll say it! I don’t need you to offer and sell to me.

This is because Amazon wants to do everything. From from being a manager with Amazon I can tell you…they want to do a lot of things and then just stop halfway through.. instead of just picking a few things and doing them well.

Just stay in a lane. You have a solid deal with prime and AWS so stay there and perfect that. And maybe slow down and keep things people like. This then cuts into funds that get rid of features we do like.

Kellen,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2023","I had an Alexa about 9 years ago. I stopped using it because it just didn't have that much functionality and was essentially just a neat toy.

I assumed that after all these years, Alexa would feel more advanced. I now have an extensive Hue lightbulb setup in my home, and I almost exclusively stream music from Spotify. So, I wanted something that could control my smart devices, sound better than my Sonos speaker, and was easier to play music with than the truly awful Sonos app.

Even after spending quite a bit of time adjusting the voice commands to control Hue, Alexa really struggles to execute commands. I can't say ""Alexa, turn on the living room lights,"" I have to say ""Alexa, turn on the lights in the living room."" Even saying it exactly as needed, it fails to execute more often than not. I have completely given up on try to get it to change scenes.

I had a routine that turned on lights. I set the command to ""Alexa, good morning."" But, this seems conflict with a default Alexa routine.

The skills store is mostly filled with filler garbage and there's not really a way to filter and sort by most useful. I was expecting a way to find ""Alexa essential apps"" or something, but it's all just ""add this to play fart sounds"" and 20 different ""add ChatGPT to Alexa"" with a ton of terrible reviews.

I've also stopped trying to get it to play music via voice commands. I just open my Spotify app, connect it to Alexa, and play music. It's the definition of a first-world problem, but it kind of defeats the purpose of this purchase. That said, the audio quality is quite good for the price and size.

In the era of ChatGPT, Alexa's inability to infer meaning feels incredibly dated. I fully understand that Alexa has several AI systems that allow it to do a lot of things very quickly, but it feels like 10 year old tech. Alexa isn't so much an assistant as it is voice activated software that you fight with to not have to press a button to make something happen.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Pitt Willet,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2024","I've got two stereo receivers with speakers connected to Echo Dots with Bluetooth. I've found this works well and produces great and reliable sound. I was interested in the Echo Studio to provide some sound to my screened porch area. Being used to traditional stereo sound from my other systems I was generally disappointed in the sound quality. Yes, the sound is better than regular Echo Dots but it surely isn't a replacement for a true sound system using just one unit. With all the claims of room filling sound and Dolby Atmos and such it still sounds like just one speaker playing similar to pairing a single bluetooth speaker to your phone. Maybe it's to do with the room being screened I'm not sure. i have considered buying another to have a stereo pair to improve the sound but at this price point one is better off buying a receiver and speakers. I'm also having problems with the songs randomly stopping which is annoying and not interested in doubling down with another purchase for that reason as well.

R. Lee,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2024","I bought this primarily for use with my wonderful 4K Max Fire TV stick 2nd generation. But once It paired to the fire TV stick, any attempt to decouple left the Echo Studio confused. The only way I can recover its standalone capability to listen and play anything is to re-register the entire echo device. The sound is acceptable for home theatre but once paired, it is a kiss of death to other play features. So even though it is advertised as a portable bluetooth speaker that you can move around and achieve great sound, it is really a stationary speaker in my family room. Amazon does provide very good feature to integrate with its 4K Max stick. But in the paired mode, pressing the volume up/down on the fire TV remote no longer affects the TV sound as all sound is now from the Echo Studio. The volume indicator won’t appear on the screen anymore. So it is not obvious how the volume can be easily controlled after integration. Although the Echo Studio is a good budget option, you are better off buying a TV with great sound or a soundbar connected to the TV instead of using this Echo Studio as a patch.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Annie,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2023","I wanted to enhance the sound quality of my Echo Show 8, so I purchased 2 Denon 250 wireless speakers. I easily connected one to the Echo Show and then grouped them together and threw the stereo switch in the Heos app and the sound was beautiful. Great bass, mid and treble. Great stereo.
Then I read in the reviews of someone who had the Denon speakers and returned them for 2 Echo studios and the Echo Sub. The 3 components were cheaper than one of the Denon speakers and the sound was better. So, to save money and get better sound, I did the same.
You'd think the integration of all Amazon components would be an easy setup. It wasn't. I was on the chat with Amazon for 3 hours just trying to simply use the 2 studios and sub as external bluetooth speakers for the Echo Show 8. Couldn't I just go to settings/bluetooth and connect to the Amazon speakers? No. I had to factory reset them 3 times as well as deleting the Alexa app and reinstalling it.
I was finally able to create a Dining Room Group and had to ask ""Alexa, play music through the Dining Room group"" most of the time. Failed to work sometimes. Meanwhile the first mention of Alexa woke up other Alexa devices.
Very complicated paths to use them as bluetooth speakers for the Echo Show 8.
The sound from them was not nearly as good as the Denon. Especially the bass.
So, I returned them and re-ordered the 2 Denon 250s even before they received my first two returns. I hope they don't think I'm bipolar.
I'm very surprised that Amazon would make it so difficult and unreliable to connect these components, and that there's no 3.5mm out jack on the Echo Show 8. Why? I could have bypassed the bluetooth complications all together.
I would not recommend these for external bluetooth speakers for any device. They sound OK alone, but even alone, I'd go with the Denon.",3.0 out of 5 stars

As I was saying, this Echo Studio is 'okay', and the sound quality is a 6-7 on a scale from 1 to 10. I personally prefer high treble and bass frequencies. If your taste in sound quality isn't too demanding, I feel It gets a passing grade, just as long as your room size isn't too large.

Mercurial,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2021","I’ve wanted a home theater for many years but have never been able to afford one.

When the Echo Studio came out I was interested and I purchased one.

When I found out that it could be used as part of a home theater set up I was very excited!

I already had the Fire Cube so I added a second Echo Studio and the Amazon Subwoofer.

At first I was very hopeful despite the many negative reviews that I’d read about using that set up as a home theater.

Sadly it turns out the negative reviews are correct.

I’ve had nothing but trouble with the Studios going offline for no reason on a very frequent basis.

And there is no reset button that I’m aware of so it means, in my case, climbing over furniture to unplug the Studio from the back of the device since I can’t reach the outlet where they are plugged in.

If this reset was only necessary rarely I wouldn’t mind as much but it’s gotten to be at least every two weeks if not more frequently especially lately.

Also on the Alexa app it keeps showing that the sub needs attention I have no idea what attention it needs but if I click on the sub the warning triangle symbol goes away until the next time I open the Alexa app and scroll through devices.

And the Echo Studios do not play nicely at all with the Amazon Recast.

That’s a daily nightmare with the audio when I watch a recording stuttering repeatedly and breaking up so badly that I have to keep rewinding the recording to try and hear the show.

Very annoying! 😡

I have to reset the Recast which is another pain as often the Recast claims that it’s suddenly not on the network so I can’t restart it via the Fire Cube TV.

Which is bizarre because I’ll check the network at the time and everything is fine, no settings were changed etc.

So then I have to unplug the Recast to get it to reset.

I wish that the Studio at least had a reset button that would cause the Studio to do a reboot as opposed to my having to climb over furniture just to unplug it and reboot the Studio.

All in all my dream of having my own home theater setup remains only that, a dream, because the Echo Studios and a Sub are no substitute for a real home theater set up.

I wanted to be happy with the Echo Studio but I’m not.

It needs more work to be a home theater system.

As a single stand alone speaker it may be adequate but that’s not what I was looking for, I wanted a home theater.

Your experience may differ but I will not recommend it as a home theater at this point.

I have a decent home audio system so I'm probably a bit more discerning than average and the sound quality is good/great, especially for the form factor. Unfortunately the Echo Studio suffers from very limited functionality, puzzling use case choices, and straight up bugs.

JDR in the USA,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2024","Craziest Alexa device.

Would make same peculiar 3 musical tones randomly (similar noise as when my Roku is disconnected). Very annoying to get noises for no reason. Called Amazon device tech support several times, trying to change or turn off various Alexa app settings. Same problem always came back. Then this device would randomly whisper answers to me...might be a nice surprise if I set this or if it was at 3 or 4am but no, it just did it randomly during the day. No, my other prior Alexa devices never whispered and never made 3 random notes.

Anyway, I am awaiting the replacement Studio which has been approved as Amazon agrees my Studio was defective. Hoping the new one works as the musical sound quality was a significant and appreciated improvement from the prior Echo device that I owned!

Pippy Longstockings,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2023","The sound is decent once you adjust via Alexa app (some version if an equalizer). The biggest issue I have is that it no longer hears me well so I have to shout even though it's in the same location as my old Echo Plus was. That's a real pain. We often turn it up thinking maybe it will hear us better but then everything's too loud. Also, same thing happens with dropping in on various rooms. We instinctively feel we have to turn it waaay up just to hear each other which is ridiculous and also a real pain because then everything's way too loyd for actual music or asking Alexa questions. There is also no light to show the volume up/down buttons. It's all black and hard to see in relaxing lighting or shadows. If it doesn't light up it should at least be a different color because - since she can't hear us the majority of the time - we often have to run and turn it down manually cause she won't hear us screaming ""ALEXA! VOLUME DOWN!"" Or volume 5, etc. My final complaint is smaller but it's that when we hooked it up all our old settings had to be redone. All old Echos (not replaced) had to be renamed and all smart bulbs had to be redone which was once again a huge pain (only option was to unscrew bulbs and read the numbers off them which alas was also a pain cause not all the bulbs were in easy-access locations). Not sure why Amazon made so many things difficult this time around. The worst though is her not hearing us and the volume being not clearly marked. Again the sound is very decent once adjusted through the Alexa app so if that were the only function would be a good upgrade. It wasn't though so unfortunately I regret the purchase.

Blindman,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2019","First, I have a 2nd gen Echo, Echo Dots, Echo Input, Echo Auto, Fire TV 4k, many devices controlled by Alexa and subscribe to Amazon Music HD. That being said, I was overly optimistic about the Echo Studio. I was hoping to replace the Echo in my kitchen with a better sounding speaker. Although a Denon receiver in the family room (open to the kitchen area) takes full advantage of Amazon Music HD, the convenience of the Echo tucked away in a corner on top of the cabinets makes it the most used audio component in the house. It's on for much of the day while listening to Sirius XM, Pandora or Amazon Music.
Now for the good, the bad and suggestions for Amazon.
The good:
- It worked out of the box and was effortless to set up (other than with the Fire TV 4k).
- Was reasonably attractive and solidly built.
- The bass response went fairly deep and sounded good on the right material.
- It had enough power to sound ""punchy"" when it needed to.
The bad:
- The 3D effect was non-existent to my ears. I tried the speaker in four different locations (even though is was destined to be in the kitchen).
- The sound quality was not pleasing on most material. This could potentially be corrected if the EQ was expanded from three-band to ten-band. While determining this, I gave the most weight for sonic quality to songs delivered in Ultra HD from Amazon Music since the Sirius XM material is pretty compressed.
- The volume level was never quite right when using the 1 -10 scale. Even using the Alexa app to control it was a pain. Sometimes it did not remember the setting when exiting the app. I don't understand why Amazon can't expand the volume option to either 1 - 100 percent or allowing .5 settings (i.e. ""Alexa: Set the volume to 2.5"", or ""Alexa: Set the volume to 25%"" ). This also hold true for the Echo speaker (as others have voiced online). For my needs, 2.5 or 3.5 (depending on time of day and the music source) are perfect, but going into the Alexa app to change it is not convenient.
- I could not get it to work with the Fire TV 4k.
- The spatial enhancement for stereo music is awful. Just turn it off immediately (it is only available with the latest update for the Alexa app).
- As noted by another reviewer, the blue light is not visible is many placements like it is on the standard Echo. I tried using the audible notification (available in the settings), but it was obnoxious.
My suggestions for Amazon:
- Make the EQ ten bands, not three
- Add more granularity to the voice activated volume adjustments.
- Market it as a full range Alexa enabled speaker with an included hub - not a ""surround sound"" speaker where it fails miserably. Sell that as a bonus feature.
- Improve the quality of the high frequencies. Not sure if it's the tweeter or the amp, but the high end could use some help to produce a more pleasing sound.
I returned it after one week... but would likely have kept it if it had the expanded EQ and ability to voice control the volume in finer increments.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Catherine,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2024","We got this as an upgrade from our other Alexa that was pretty old. I honestly didn’t realize how large it was and I think it’s too large for a counter space but we found a spot on our counter for it anyways. The sound quality on this is supposed to be amazing but I don’t hear a ton of difference between this and our old one. It does get super loud which is great when we want to enjoy loud music. The main issue is every so often is muffles a song. Like it plays the lyrics low and the background music higher then the lyrics slightly where u can’t hear the singing, and I’m not meaning the volume, the volume stays the same but the song muffles. I don’t know why. Also it doesn’t respond as sharply as our other one did, I don’t know if the speaker isn’t hearing us as well but many times we have to repeat to it and then It delays and sometimes freezes up and just shuts off.",3.0 out of 5 stars
W. Carrigan,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2024","I jumped in with two feet at the notion of my firetv + 2 echo studios + echo sub as a home theater pair.
What they don’t tell you before you spend the $1500, is that you have to have Alexa always on, at least on the tv. This causes countless problems with using Alexa in my home. I have an echo spot in the same room. Even with the sub and studios having the mic muted, which forces a very unappealing red glow in the room when watching a movie, if you summon the AI assistant, guarantee it mutes whatever is on tv for 5-30 seconds even if another nearby device has satisfied the query.

Jose Ortiz,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2024","The acoustics are good for a little speaker with a 6in sub. I don't believe the bass specifications are accurate on the website. And I don't really hear the 3D audio effects. Audio I would say is 4/5 stars.

Unfortunately, the Alexa App required for setup is not great. It will crash without explanation during setup, and will sometimes fail to find devices in pairing mode or disconnect from a pairing echo studio during config. The firmware implementation and wifi hardware for these echo studios is also not great. Echo studios have trouble dealing with mesh routers (even Amazon designed routers) and are basically useless outside your own home.

Hector M. Lozano,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2021","I hesitated wanting to do a review. On one hand, the build quality is really nice, it looks great and I’m pleasantly surprised with its sound quality. I use it in my bedroom and the bass fills the room enough (for a bedroom). Highs and lows are really sharp and only seem to distort at the very very top of it’s sound volume. Mids are good too but not as pronounced. I wanted better sound in my bedroom than the tiny sound from the TV (horrible) but it needed to be affordable, that at $200, it is. Lastly, Amazon won me over by offering me monthly payments. Overall, I am pleased but I have major issues that are quite annoying. For reference, I run my network of Eero Mesh Network (3 AP / Small House), a new latest generation Firestick (not 4K) and a 400mbps Internet connection. To get the virtual surround sound (ATMOS) Amazon touts, you need to have a newer Firestick connected through a featured they call Home Theater. This basically connects the Firestick to my Echo Studio through WiFi to pump the HiFi audio. The virtual surround sounds sounds really good. The problem becomes dropped audio that never recovers or freezing my firestick. I actually don’t think the speaker is at fault, the problem is the Firestick. (I have contacted them about it) and since is the only way to get audio to it, well I’m forced to reset my Firestick at least 2 times a day and on some cases much more than that. I’m waiting to see if Amazon releases a new Firestick or software update and that’s my testament on how great this speaker sounds (and obviously the price) that I’m willing to wait. But it’s extremely simply good looks and great sound will not help others buy into it. Stay away if you don’t want these issues because they will happen. Not even the optical input works well and I was hoping to use that. Like i said it works great when it does (85% of the time) but it’s needs a lot of work including this Amazon Alexa ecosystem.

Travis Day,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2020","I bought these thinking I'd use them in my living room as do all speakers that connect to my TV, and listen to music. When I found out they could be paired together, I actually bought two thinking the 3D sound would be awesome in stereo.

First things first, these things are big and heavy. My wife wasn't a fan of how large they looked on our entertainment stand, but I wanted to give them a chance. They're 10 pounds, they've got to have great sound, right?

Conceptually this is cool, the speaker will adjust itself to the room it is in for the best quality of sound, PERFECT! That said, I'm not an audiophile and I didn't notice any difference in sound when I moved it around, which might be the point.

The speaker itself sounds pretty good, if you really want to turn your music up and feel it though, this probably isn't the one for you. The bass was okay, the sound was good, but I was expecting a serious sound system to rival the sound bar I already had. It fell short in that respect.

Now for the main reason I returned them, these aren't cheap, so my expectation was that they would work with my FireTV stick. They did, sometimes, and sometimes, they wouldn't connect at all, or the remote couldn't control the volume. Having to reconnect them multiple times in the first week was a pain, having the volume not work and having to tell alexa to turn up or down sucked. I didn't want to give up though so I bought a optical audio to 3.5mm cord to see if that would work better... oops, you need an optical out to optical 3.5mm cable; wait a few more days and plug it in. Awesome, it's working with the cable, but the volume can only be controlled by talking to Alexa, not ideal when watching TV. Oh, and if you use the cable, they don't connect as a pair, you can only listen through one speaker. Enough was enough, I wasn't going to keep something that was this expensive and didn't do what I needed it to, I had to return them.

That said, if you're using this to replace a standalone alexa speaker and you want something with better sound. I think this is a great unit, you can pair it with others(which you can do with any amazon devices) and have some really good (not great) sound.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Unfortunately, the Echo Studio does not live up to Amazon's hype. The sound quality produced by the several Echo 4rh generation speakers I already owned noticeably exceeds that of the Echo Studio.

Annie,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2021","My relationship with the Amazon Echo Studio is one of love and hate....

The positives... The Echo Studio produces great sound considering its compact size and also in comparison to other blue tooth speakers of similar price points.

The negatives... I was so please with my first Echo Studio that I purchased an second for stereo pairing.

However, i had difficulty getting two Echo Shows to pair and after a lengthy call to Amazon tech support, my issue was escalated.

After waiting 48 hours for a return call from a tier two tech and trying everything possible, my devices were not able to be paired to work together and it was suggested I return and exchange them.

However, After deleting and reinstalling apps and making adjustments and updates to my phone upon their instruction, none of my bluetooth electronics (which were working issue free prior) are now working correctly.
I can't get any speakers, earphones or my much loved, android car play to sync and work.

Ive tried to performing a factory reset on my phone as well as removing, reinstalling / updating apps on all my bluetooth devices but it was of little help.

Occasionally, I can get a device to sync after spending several minutes trying to get it to work.

But the 20% of the time time when it does sync, it still won't play, so it's actually working 10%.

So, I loved Echo Show when I had only one of the speakers and had no sync issues.

But the aftermath of trying to get the second device working has left me incredibly frusted and experiencing inconveniences that appear to have no resolution.

If Amazon would work with me to resolve these issues expedisously, I would not hesitate to offer my highest recommendations on the product.

However, with my current entire bluetooth network now not unusable, I'd strongly recommend careful consideration of the real possibility that you may loose the entire connectivity of all your bluetooth devices before you purchase.

I'm returning both my Amazon Echos Shows. However, many times, ive felt I may get more satisfaction out frustration release out of smashing my them with the nearest hard object within reach over returning and receiving the refund.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Steve McConnell,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2022","I have an Echo Plus in my kitchen that has become one of the main ways I listen to music. Because I listen to it so often, I thought switching to the Echo Studio would be a good upgrade.

The Studio has a much brighter sound. The bass is better, but to hear the bass you have to turn up the volume, which makes the brightness of the treble overwhelming. Using Alexa's tone controls, I could adjust the Studio so the treble wasn't as bright, but all that accomplished was to make the Studio sound like the Echo Plus I already had.

There's no question the Studio can go much louder without distortion than the Echo Plus. If you want an Alexa device that can go much louder than an Echo Dot or an Echo Plus, the Studio fits the bill.

It's possible the listening environment in my kitchen exaggerates the brightness of the Studio. It was sitting on a granite counter with a hard-tile backsplash. But the Echo Plus in the same position sounds really good.

Overall, I'm very happy with the sound from the Echo Plus. The Studio was not the upgrade that I hoped it would be, so I returned it. If I was going to spend $200 to improve the sound quality of my Alexa device, that money would be better spent on a standalone $200 speaker that connects to a cheaper Echo device, e.g., Soundcore Motion+, JBL Charge, Wonderboom, Bose Soundlink, etc.

P.S. Amazon, how about offering a real equalizer in the Alexa app? The 3-band equalizer is lame. For connecting Alexa devices to external speakers, an 8-band equalizer would be super helpful.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Ub3r_T3chie,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2020","The sound quality of this device is the real deal! For a stand alone speaker it sounds beautiful with rich mid-low to even a decent treble! It has okay performance with the low ranges but it certainly would benefit greatly from the echo sub pairing.

The 3D audio is a really fun gimmick though it will never truly replace a true surround sound system because everyone's house/ room is going to be different and there are also so few options to really take advantage of the 3D audio anyways.

The offline voice recognition and zigbee hub is absolutely great! I love being able to control my lights almost instantly without it having to access an online database.

The major drawback that I have is I really wanted to connect my echo studio to my firestick 4k to take advantage of the Dolby Atmos Plus audio of both devices! This unfortunately cannot happen because the studio cannot handle streaming of video and streaming the audio at the same time. (yes, my internet is fine. everyother device in my house can handle streaming 4k) I tried everything and talked to representatives for over 6 cumulative hours trying to diagnose this. It handles streaming amazon music and streaming the album to the tv just fine, but video is where it falls apart. Amazon sent me a replacement device but it still was dropping audio literally every second. Like the packet for the other half of the audio was dropped in communications and so it clips in and out (But not stereoscopically so). This is a huge bummer for me because I really got this device to have a decent sounding wireless speaker to go with the TV but at this point I just wish I could hardwire the Studio to the Firestick 4k and still retain the Dolby Atmos Plus quality (Which you can't in a hardwire from the TV to the Studio, it just treats it like any other speaker).

Overall, this speaker is great as a super Alexa device! If you're looking for a huge but excellent sounding Echo device for a room in your house and are not wanting to use it for streaming movie audio, this speaker is amazing! If you're hoping to make use of the Dolby Atmos Plus for your FireTV though, I'd say to save your money and look elsewhere.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Rich C.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2021","I have two Echo Studios working through a 4K Fire Stick in a Home Theater setup for my TV. Setup is challenging and by exactly following the steps I unknowingly lost the ability to control volume with the TV Remote, and was relegated to using voice commands only. Telling Alexa, or dyslexia as I prefer to call her, to Mute often resulted in her looking up a word that sounded like Mute. I don't have a speech impediment so it seems to me that words like Mute, Louder, or Softer should have been easily recognizable, but they're not always.

Eventually, I figured out how to get control of volume back to the Remote, while trying to address other chronic problems with this setup, such as having the speakers sound like they're in a stadium with reverberation, or having no sound at all accompanying a program, or having sound in only one speaker. While the sound from these Studios is excellent, the glitches are nerve racking and always happen at the most inopportune times. Each failure requires restarting the Fire Stick, unplugging the speakers, etc. Often this results in no audio at all, so the process must be repeated. Telling Dyslexia to turn on Home Theater results in a ""Hymmm, I can't help you with that."" This is unacceptable since when playing music from your Amazon playlists, Alexa is told to play such and such from Home Theater, so it's clearly a recognizable term.

Ultimately, I give these Echo Studios five stars for sound quality and two stars for reliable performance. While they work properly most of the time, the glitches are inexplicable. Settling down for a movie after dinner should not result in a wasted half hour of trouble shooting this neurotic sound system! It's inconceivable to me that Amazon can not do a better job with its products that are designed to work together. I thought about adding the Echo Subwoofer, but after reading the reviews which denote horrible setup problems, I decided against it.

Mark B. Marquis,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2021","It sounds OK. A Sonos or JBL Boombox blows it away. You need the sub with it. Then you have a problem if you want to use Bluetooth to stream to it. You can only connect to one device with Bluetooth and it won't talk to other devices. So for example, I purchased 2 Echo Studios and the Sub to go into a home gym.

If I play music from an Alexa App such as Amazon Music, Apple Music, Spotify, etc. there is no issue. It sounds fine. If you want to stream music from a device it will only connect to and play on one of them. In my case, I set up a Peloton in this ""great Echo sound system"" only to find out that only one speaker will work. You can connect to only one and that one won't connect to any other Echos.

If I instead use JBL Bluetooth speakers like 2 JBL Charge 4s, I can connect to one of them and they connect to each other so I'm doing that. The point is, you can't really stream Bluetooth to more than one Echo device and the technology obviously exists. 2 JBL Charge 4's will cost you a max of $280 total and they are portable and charge your devices. The Echo Studio will cost you $200 to $240 and not work for Bluetooth streaming and isn't portable. Not only that but the JBLs sound good without a Sub and you probably need to add the sub to the Echo Studio costing you another $200+.

Bottom line, if you want to play music off Echo and Alexa services and apps then the Echo Show is their best-sounding solution. If you want to go outside of what you can get through Amazon's world, don't lock into an Amazon Echo.

Full disclosure - I am giving this advice as a person who owns 2 Echo Studios, Echo Sub, 4 Echo Show 8s, 1 Echo Show 5, and numerous other smaller echo speakers. So I do like them, just not for the above usage which is HUGELY disappointing.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I have it in the same place that I had my regular Echo, which is nowhere near walls or anything, and I have to yell at it at the top of my lungs to get it to turn off the lights even though my bed is about 10 ft away at most.

It also doesn't understand me hardly at all, like today I said, ""Alexa, play the original motion picture soundtrack version of Evita"" and after trying to play the original Broadway cast recording three times and me telling it to stop, it just made the booping sound like it couldn't understand me now at all. The other day I was trying to get it to play the Rostropovich versions of the Bach cello suites, and it kept giving me the Yo Yo Ma versions. So if you want your device to play the music you want it to play, be aware that this one is not going to do it for you. These are just two instances of many where it hasn't played the correct thing, and I don't have some kind of heavy accent like those videos you see of Scottish people trying to give Alexa directions. I just have a regular old flat American Midwestern accent. It also can't hear anything apparently without being shouted at, as evidenced by the absolute frustration of me trying to get it to turn my lights on and off every day.

wisconsin wildman,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2020","Ok sounding unit. Not sure it’s worth the price. I won’t attempt to listen in 3D or HD as I’m not going to want to spend the extra later. Huge volume differences between services, but could be the service. Seems to have to be turned up high to get decent sound. In an apartment living room that’s about 17 feet long by 15 wide. Alone it’s sound isn’t that loud (or great) Crazy thing that when linked with an echo dot 3rd gen, it fills room better (the studio on far end of room, the dot on the opposite end, studio at volume 5, dot volume 6). One of my peeves of this whole echo system is equalizer settings and volume settings come and go.

I do hear some depth using tune in as my streaming service. It’s better than the dot alone obviously,but without the dot, it seems a bit blah. I understand the other reviews about it being kind of vocal lacking.

I don’t plan on using it in a home theater type st up as I already have a bose sound bar I’m quite content with that sounds better than this unit. Similar prices also.

I do enjoy linking my five devices (studio, regular echo gen 3, and three dots around the apartment) for full apartment music. Might be the only reason I keep the studio as I’m not that much of a fan. It’s kind of well, unimpressive, but gives a little extra “oomph” to the whole bunch together.

As far as Bluetooth, I find it painful to pair versus any other Bluetooth device. I’ll probably only use it for streaming services and use my Bluetooth speakers for that purpose. This applies to all my echos.

I’ve never listened to a Sonos or the expensive Apple speaker, so I haven’t a clue what to compare it to. I’ve been more impressed by Bluetooth speakers that I have when I first heard them. I’ve had a few by the likes of bose, ue, and Soundcore.

When it comes to speakers, the echo studio is ok. I’ll keep it because of the alexa operation, but have heard better. There’s not a huge “wow” factor for me. Very surprised it’s not better claiming 330 watts.

1. First of all, Amazon customer service is becoming unacceptable. In trying to solve my Echos problem, I was basically told to give up or return the product and on a second try, I was hung up by the customer service representative. This type of behavior is unacceptable, especially from Amazon.

2. The Echos pair together have an AMAZING sound. However, here is the catch. These speakers do not give you the same sound ALL the time as you expect. For some reason, a software issue probably, Amazon has not fixed, you get different sound quality and loudness depending on what you are using them for. In my case, when listening to music from Spotify, the sound is what is expected (loud and rich), but if you use the Spotify app using my fire stick the outcome is depressing. Movies sound good using Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, however, the sound loudness is limited. The same for watching YouTube videos (this is the biggest bummer), the sound is extremely limited. So, if you watch lots of music videos, on YouTube, this product will have you disappointed and frustrated. All my issues come from using my firestick, which I replaced over a year ago trying to solve the same issue when I had only one Echo Studio. Until Amazon does not fix this issue and improve their customer service, I have a mix feeling about recommending the Echo Studio.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2023","I had high hopes for this thing, the sound is not really any sharper or better, the voice recognition is either terrible or taking time to adjust, all in all it feels inferior to my older echo dot. I hope this is something Amazon is working on improving because the round echo dot not the small on but the slightly larger one plays way better than this, for reference I have 3 echo dots small rounds, 1 puck, 1 echo dot round slightly larger and this one, and I honestly think even my puck performs better than this.

Steve Letcher,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2023","The speaker is good, however there are 2 glaring and easily fixable issues that make this thing almost unusable. First and foremost is the insane difference in volume between music and Alexa's voice and no settings to change any of it. If you are listening to music at a comfortable level and ask Alexa anything, the response is so low that you can't understand it. If you increase the volume to a level where you can understand and hear Alexa' voice then ask it to play music, it blows your ear drums out! I can change the volume of the notifications but I can't change the volume of Alexa's voice...why?

Secondly, when you change the EQ and then exit the app. The next day all the settings are changed back to 0!

In doing research, both of these have been issues for years and Amazon hasn't fix them. It's clear that Amazon isn't listening to the people that actually use their products.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Joe F.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2019","The speaker function is outstanding with absolutely great sound but unfortunately the software to make it work as a sound bar replacement isn't there yet. When connected with a mini-optical cable to a 2019 Samsung Series 8 TV, the behavior is almost possessed and I don't know if the issue is with the Echo Studio, the Samsung TV or both.

Sometimes the sound is really great but then it will suddenly just quit completely. It won't work again until you disconnect and reconnect the cables. Searching online, this seems to be a fairly common issue. Other times, the sound will suddenly become what I would describe as fuzzed or distorted. Disconnect and reconnect and it will work fine again.

My TV has a crap shoot of a time selecting the audio source when connected to the Echo Studio. Sometimes it works normally; select OPTICAL and it comes out the Echo Studio, select TV and it comes out of the TV speakers. Other times, it is coming out of the Echo Studio regardless of the source selected. Select OPTICAL and it comes out the Echo Studio, select TV and it comes out both the TV speakers and the Echo Studio (slightly delayed just to be more annoying.) If connected by Bluetooth, that seems to work with both the audio and the source selection but it defeats the purpose of using the optical cable for the best sound quality.

Also, the only way to control the volume when connected with either the optical cable or Bluetooth is by using the hardware buttons on the Echo Studio. The Samsung TV doesn't recognize the Echo Studio as a known sound bar when connected to the optical cable and can't set up the remote; so no remote control of the volume. Even stranger, when connected via Bluetooth or optical, the voice commands via Alexa, while appearing to work, don't actually change the volume. When streaming music, the voice commands work perfectly.

I don't know if the problem is the the TV or the Echo Studio but the two definitely don't play nicely together. I'm hoping that a software update by one or both will finally give me the sound bar I was hoping for. I do love the sound as a speaker though. It is everything I was expecting.",3.0 out of 5 stars

The sound is maybe marginally better and I'm probably imagining that. I've tried all types of music, etc. I don't get it...still considering returning it, but I'm lazy, so it'll probably stay.

J. Olson,"Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2020","I bought the Echo Studio in early April along with a FireTV Cube so that I could have easy voice control over my TV, and good quality sound without spending an arm and leg on the sound quality (like with Bose, Sonos, or other highly rated soundbars with Alexa integrated). Setup was very easy as with other Echo products. But setup and pairing with the FireTV cube was a bit more complex and confusing - took a good 5 minutes. The Studio speaker is not listed in the FireTV soundbar options, only a generic Amazon soundbar. So I was concerned whether everything would work correctly. For the first few days, everything worked beautifully, just as I had expected.

After using it for a few days with the FireTV, Cube we noticed that the audio would just cut out for a couple seconds in the middle of someone saying something on a show. Had to rewind so you could understand what was going on. It didn't seem to matter whether the show was on HBO Now, Netflix, or Amazon Prime. Very annoying. The frequency and amount of time the sound would cut out got worse the longer we used the speaker. To solve the problem, I had to reset the speaker and re-pair it with the Cube - not something you want to deal with in the middle of a show.

I put up with this for another week or so, as it seemed to work OK for several days at time. Then when I was trying to reset/re-pair with the Cube, the speaker would say ""Sorry, the internet is not available right now"". That wasn't true because the Cube was connected over the same Wi-Fi router in the same room. For some reason, it would not recognize my Wi-Fi router. The only way to fix this was to unplug the speaker and start all over again. This happened a couple more times so I gave up and decided to return the speaker. FireTV Cube works great, but not with the Studio speaker. I'm going to break down and spend the extra cash on a Sonos soundbar.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Kenneth gunther,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2019","This is my first impression of the new Amazon Alexa studio

I received two Amazon Alexa studios at 3 o’clock on November 7, 2019. I watched a lot of the reviews on YouTube and liked what I saw so I bought two of them so I can pair them in stereo. Upon getting them call Dan and set up I noticed that the sound was really good. The high fidelity and stereo separation is very noticeable and a great upgrade from the previous three Alexis that I had scattered around my open concept living room/ kitchen /dining room. On the good side they are very well-made and surprisingly heavy. On the downside I wish they were a lot louder, when they are on as loud as they can be I can easily speak over them without yelling. For $435 I thought they would be bangin’

A few features that you should now are that once you pair them in stereo mode they cannot be paired in a group with the other five Amazon echoes that I have in my house. It’s either the Eco Studios or my everywhere group. The big square transformer that is plugged into the wall and all of the other Amazon echo devices is built into the unit on the studio device. You have a typical plug that plugs into the wall. So if that big square plug was an issue on your echo device before that will be gone with the echo studio.
In the first few hours of using the studio in the stereo configuration we Noticed that after about five minutes the music would just stop! I tried everything to figure out what was going on but there was no answers. I asked Alexa what happened and she replied I don’t know that one I went into the app to try to see what was going on and even when I pressed play again in the app it didn’t play and when I press pause it didn’t do anything either. Hopefully this will be taken care of in a software update.

James Hughes,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2020","I purchased the Echo Studio expressly for the purpose of using it as a home theater speaker with my Fire TV Cube. Unfortunately I’ve passed my 30 day return window, otherwise I’d be sending the Studio back. In my experience, it fails miserably as a home theater speaker, and if your considering purchasing the Studio for that purpose - look elsewhere.

Setup of the speaker is just as easy as setting up any Echo device using the Alexa app. The demo was encouraging because the sound quality right off the bat was impressive. Setting up a home theater system and paring the speaker with the Fire TV Cube was easy as well, but it was all down hill from there. At first, there was a noticeable lip sync delay. There is a section in the Fire TV audio settings to adjust for any delay, but it seemed that I had to make that adjustment at least once a day, sometimes multiple times after switching between apps like Netflix and Hulu.

Starting about a week ago, we couldn’t any sound out of the Fire TV after turning it on. After a combination of rebooting the Cube and power cycling the Studio, we’d get sound, but the lip sync delay appeared even worse. Sometimes I’ve had to reset the network settings for the Studio in the Alexa app because it seemed like the Fire TV Cube couldn’t connect to the device, even though both were on the same wifi network. Finally, today, after dealing with the connectivity issues once again, I deleted the home theater feature from Alexa and hooked my Fire TV Cube to a Sonos Beam. Even though the sound isn’t as good (it’s still really good), the connectivity issues are gone.

Since I’m past the return window, I may try to offload the Studio on eBay. Otherwise I’m stuck with a moderately expensive Echo device that will never get used again.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Pairing the Echo Studio is miserable and no fun at all.

After many trials to pairing of the Two Echo Studio, I've replaced and relocated the Router center of the Echo Studio from other side of Room and It is now working as Pairing. As result, Echo Studio [Built-In Wireless Adapter] is performing very poor signals. The Router must be placed near to the each Echo Studio units to success Pairing and maintain the Pairing mode.

Tim G.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020","I don't want to draw this review out so I will just get to the point. My wife got me the Studio for Christmas because I wanted to use it in home as the central Sound system for the main area of the house as we have an open floor plan. This one speaker fills our whole upstairs with plenty of sound for us. The problem is that when I went to bluetooth it to my new Samsung Qled TV it pairs just fine but will not play the audio from my TV. I tried for hours to trouble shoot the problem unpairing and re-pairing, changing audio stream formats, even factory resets a couple times but nothing.
We own Echo Dot(s), Echo Plus, Echo, Echo Tap, 2 4K Fire Sticks, and Fire Tv Cube. As a test, I paired one of our Echo Dots and the Echo Tap to this TV and it worked just fine.
So I gave up and called support. They informed me that this flagship $200.00 Echo Studio Speaker cannot be paired to a TV without the use of an Amazon Fire Stick/Fire Cube. That is just crazy to me. Why can I pair my $29.99 Echo Dot to my TV (Which no one would do) but not this $200 speaker? It took me literally half a day to reconfigure the devices around my house to get the Fire Cube into my living room and set up with the Studio. There is no reason for this, it says right on the box that it supports DOLBY ATMOS, so why do I need to pair it to a Fire product???

Anyways, I just wanted to write this review for anyone looking at this speaker to do what we are using it for and does not feel like dealing with the headache. If I did not already own a Fire Cube and I was not able to rearrange my setup to keep everything working pretty much the same at the end of the day I would have returned it and gave it a 2 star.

Karl Sheldon,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2021","This is an ok to potentially great speaker. I use it with a fire stick. Sound quality listening to music is just ok in my opinion and didn’t blow me away as I was hoping. Where it goes from ok to great is the Dolby atmos. I accidentally turned on the speaker’s demo once and I kid you not I thought I was losing my mind. The sounds I was hearing (I think birds) sounded like they were coming from somewhere else in my house. The sounds felt like they were real and not over a speaker. My dog who does not react to artificial sounds like dogs barking on tv and other trigger sounds, was so confused. He kept walking around and running to different parts of the room... he too thought the sounds were real and was trying to find what was making them, but he never went over to the actual speaker. The issue I have with the Dolby atmos is, after searching for content to play on prime video the sound was underwhelming. In actual viewable media it wasn’t as awesome as its demo which means that the demo was specifically tuned for the device or producers are doing a poor job implementing Dolby atmos into their shows.

As a side note, the studio is slower to respond than my echo. Sometimes (twice now, in 2 or 3 weeks, but I watch tv maybe 4 times a week max) the sound stops or the speaker wakes up when I say “Alexa” but then doesn’t respond to commands. A few mins go by and then it starts to work again. So it can be quite buggy.",3.0 out of 5 stars

There is several features that this PRO is lacking - probably mostly in software. Otherwise it appears to only encourage subscription income for Amazon. 1. When connecting blue tooth to any speakers or other echo devices, it should use them with the PRO's speakers to help with ATMOS NOT replace them. 2. It should offer a way to play music that has been purchased, perhaps using storage (to lessen streaming data needs) within the PRO Echo device or an SD card slot. 3. The software should maintain control of the microphone on the PRO Echo. Calling this PRO is wrong for now. It just has better speakers. Perhaps competitors will have a more reasonable solution.

Jay Bowen,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2019","After much anticipation I received my Echo Studio today!! I immediately opened the box and was like a kid at Christmas!! I immediately set it up and moved on to part two, pairing it to my Fire Cube, or so I thought. What seemed, and for all intents and purposes should have been, a simple process required a phone call to tech support. The technician was very helpful and after 10 to 15 minutes had me up and running YYYYAAAAAAYYYYY!!!! And then my elation turned to utter disappointment. The only means of adjusting the volume is by the traditional, Alexa Volume Up, Alexa Volume down. There is no way to control the volume by your TV remote or even a Fire Cube/Stick remote. Who wants to yell out ""Alexa"" while watching a program. How inconvenient, how disappointing, such a shame. This product could be 10 Stars out of 5, but now is just another 3.5 star very good speaker. And it is that, honestly, it is an excellent speaker for everything other than a sound source as a home theater.
UPDATE>>>>>>>>>>>>While I agree that the Studio is an excellent speaker, it is useless either alone or with a paired Studio as a surround system for your Firestick or Fire Cube. There is not enough bass, at all, and it appears that Amazon has discontinued the production of the Echo Sub Woofer, which would have made this a DYNAMIC paring and very easy to use.
I have two, and bought them for this exact reason after watching multiple videos on the setup, the sound and the reviews, only to find that Amazon will not producing the Sub any longer. Now I have two Echo's on steroids that are just for music, and the usual Alexa stuff. BOOOOOOORING. I have spent hours researching for a compatible sub and there isn't one and I can't get Amazon to give me any idea if and or when they may ever produce another, or allow an off brand the permission to develop one.

Chanda,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2020","I am supremely disappointed with the device I received. I was skeptical about it as soon as it arrived and I saw how it was packaged. It was in it's box from the maufacturer and then, in true Amazon fashion, it was packed in a box 3x the size required with 1 sheet of kraft paper as 'padding'. So, it basically bounced around until it arrived. I guess I should be happy it works at all?

It does not arrive with the needed optical cable to connect it to the television. I had to buy an adapter to make the one I have fit.

I notice about once every 4 or 5 days sound will stop coming out of it completely. Not while I'm using it, but in the morning, first thing. I have to pull power from it for 10 seconds and repower. It will work again for 4 or 5 days and this must be repeated. This is for audio from the TV, I have not tried to play music through it before pulling power. I will try to remember that first thing in the morning when all I really want is coffee and the weather report....

Another thing I just noticed today. While playing music it will randomly drop to volume '0'. Every 10 or 15 minutes. With the music 'Everywhere' option I notice none of my other Echo devices (Echos or dots) will do that. They keep playing.... because that is what they've been asked to do.... Not the Studio. Just decides, mid-song, that it is done. I have to turn it back up.

For the price, it sounds good. This is not top quality, but I was not expecting that. It is good for the price.

MJ,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2021","I purchased a 55” FireTV edition TV to replace an older TV and a FireTV cube in my bedroom. The downside to getting rid of the cube was we had to turn the TV on and use the remote to control our lights abs smart home. The sound of the TV was ok so I purchased two Studios, one for each side of the bed to improve the sound experience and resolve the need to turn on the TV to do smart room commands. It was a little overkill but what the heck.

I received both studios, fired them up and followed the instructions only to find out they don’t pair in theater mode to my new TV.

After some playing around and calling Amazon they told me just to add a cheap Firestick it pair them with. I already have a FireTV, I bought it to free up space and get rid of the cube. Well the cube is back.

With the cube everything paired correctly. The sound is ok, not as amazing and immersive as some would say.

I have these a lower rating for the following reasons.

Don’t pair to devices outside of the fire tv stick and cube family together. Yes you can use Tv’s Bluetooth but only for one and not two.

They haven’t figured out that syncing multiple Alexa devices in the same room would be helpful, especially now that I have three voice activated devices. They get confused easily so I have to mute the two studios.

Linzy,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2022","I bought the Echo Studio in early 2020. Sound quality is wonderful and, of course, it has all of the great Alexa features.

However, since I first received it, I've experienced so many glitches. I have to unplug and restart at least 1-2x a month. Lately, the ES has also been missing alerts/alarms unless I nudge it (for example, this morning the alarm did not go off, neither did my 8 am reminder. When I asked Alexa to turn my light on, EVERYTHING went off at once - the alarm, my reminder, and my morning routine.) I've now made it a habit to have a back-up alarm on my phone (which, I mean, is good in case there's ever a power outage, I suppose).

The most common glitch I have is that ES just stops responding (this happens regularly). Note that I don't have this problem nearly as often with my Echo Dot.

Another glitch I experience is that ES won't connect to my phone until I restart the ES, or it'll randomly connect to my phone (when I did not prompt it to do so) and won't disconnect at my verbal command - I have to go into the phone and manually disconnect.

jeremym,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2022","It's not bad, it's not wow. It sounds fairly good for what it does. It doesn't sound a lot better than an Echo Plus. It has some problems. Bluetooth-controlled volume is consistently wrong, by being about 1/3rd quieter than streaming through asking it to play through one of the services it supports. It just doesn't go very loud, like... not fill the apartment living room loud. As a Bluetooth speaker it is less than fully functional. It's not unusable, but it has less sound oomph than a small bookshelf speaker, despite the hype. I'm very much not the only one.

It doesn't support Youtube Music. I don't intend to have the microphones on most of the time for privacy reasons. My job even forbids it (government). I intended to control it mostly via Bluetooth... so, it's a very quiet corner Bluetooth speaker. Many people have brought this up and there doesn't seem to be any satisfactory solution.

I consider myself an ""amateur audiophile"" if that makes sense. I listen for subtle differences in the quality of same source music being played on different devices. To me the Alexa Studio is just another speaker. I do not find that it excels at anything. I have Amazon's HD Music and I found the 3D audio to be odd. It almost seemed to degrade overall sound quality in trade-off for trying to wow you with sound split between all its speakers. I tried it in several rooms with 3D songs from Amazon and at no point did I feel like the sound was around me. I had my wife walk me into the room blind folded after she randomly placed the Studio and had a 3D song playing. I turned in a circle several times and was able to point directly at the Studios location. To me that says it all. It makes sense really. You take a surround sound system calibration. It uses a mic placed at thr listeners location. It tests each speaker multiple times. The Studio uses its own mics, which are obviously not at the listeners location. At best it will be able to adjust sound for the acoustics of the room but its not going to be able to magically configure 3D sound. Also after initial calibration, it seamlessly calibrates itself when it is moved from room to room.

Dont get me wrong. The speaker sounds good, especially when listening to HD and Ultra HD, but this 3D audio is a gimmick.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Then, powering each separately, I gave them the same commands, and listened to the same music. There wasn't a huge difference in sound, but I give the edge to the Bose. The thing that made the Studio the loser was it's indifference to me. It didn't listen very well. I have a table fan at the opposite end of the breakfast bar. The Echo Dot has always been able to discern my voice over it; the Studio mostly couldn't. From across the room, I had to yell when there was no music playing; with music, it was a lost cause. I listen about half and half to classic country and classical, including choral music. The HD recorded classical music was unpleasant on the Studio with a distinctly separated high, mid, and low. An orchestra should sound blended as one. Did better on the Bose (turns out I may not be a fan of 3D recording vs stereo).

Mr H.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2022","Purchased the Echo studio and Sub combination.

Pros:
They arrived.
They sounded ok, kinda 7/10.

Cons:
Connectivity, they would constantly unpair, playing out of just the echo or the sub. Needed to reset both to reconnect. Tried to trouble shoot for weeks.
The App interface is just horrible. A lot of the trouble with this kit would be solved with just an app overhaul. Ugly, unintuitive, not effective. The sound slider mechanism is clunky, doesnt tell the truth, jerks from 10% to 60% without warning, with a delay. Nightmare.
Lipsynch issues with Tv media. (They claim not to be focussed on tv sound, but it was very irritating having to constantly fiddle with the fire stick lip synch tool)
They dont go very loud as a pair. For the size, which is not small, (measure before ordering) they are fairly tame when full volume. Not great for impressing guests. Especially when they then disconnect from each other.

Amazon returns policy is fair and effective. If you have the time to p**s around with this, they may be right for you. Give it a go.

If you don’t, I’ve just bought a Sonos Move which is instantly 100 times better than this kit. Smaller, better sound, easy to work with the Sonos App. About to integrate with a fuller Sonos house install, ceiling speakers, Amp etc. The experience is night/day.

The sound quality is good for the price. It is loud if playing Spotify directly from it. However, when pairing with a Bluetooth device, the volume is reduced significantly. That’s with Bluetooth audio at max and the echo studio at max volume. You can’t pair it with Apple TV as a dual stereo speaker. Only with Amazon Fire Stick or Fire Cube.

J. A.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2023","Stereo with no balance... What is Amazon thinking? I have never had a stereo that didn't have balance, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but it's such a basic control it makes zero sense to me.

Yes they sound good, yes it was simple to set up, yes they are a good value, read Steve Pugliese's review, I think he sums it up nicely.

However I live in a smaller place where I can't keep moving the speakers around to get balance from my desk.

I searched online, to find comments indicating the same, no balance.
I tried using Amazon support chat, what a waste of time that was, and they didn't know or understand.
I unpaired them, adjusted the volume differently, paired them as stereo again, and the sound synchronizes, which isn't a bad thing
In short, there is no way to have the volumes be different when paired in Stereo mode.
Will be getting Sonos One and will compare.

rpr,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2021","I bought these after reading about the Alexa Home theater (search youtube) using these and a fire tv cube. From the standpoint of just being single speakers they sound decent. However, I dont believe decent enough to be worth their price point. I got two of them and have them paired to have 3d mode and have Dolby atmos. The 3d music is cool but can only be done with a handful of amazon tracks. The Atmos for movies and tv is okay (not amazing) and again it only works with certain media through certain apps. Otherwise they are connected speakers. I had a couple of bookshelf speakers attached before that I think did just as well. Getting the home theater through Alexa setup was a chore. I work in tech and have done home theater for a while and I gave up. My wife ended up figuring out after re-doing it countless times. I also wish I could get audio input through something other than wifi. When we swich inputs on our tv we have no connected audio (more a fire tv issue) but worth noting.

They are nice because everything is connected through alexa, but for a premium speaker they aren't amazing and the setup was just Alright. That song above is recorded through my iphone 12 (mini) and that is one of Amazon's HD tracks. (for reference). I have run FLAC files through it via plex on my fire cube and the sound was about the same.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Erik,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2019","These speakers are a great value for the money, easy to set up, sound great and overall just an awesome way to transform your home into a theatre like experience. In regards to the reviews from the audiophiles trashing the quality; they're just completely off for what these studios are meant for. Actual studio speakers are meant to sound flat for production purposes. A home entertainment system, unless you're going to pay crazy money, is meant to be loud, clear and not distort. These are great for music and streaming in a living room to give you that theatrical feel. If you want to install an actual theater in your house, then yes, go spend way more money on better speakers.

The sounds is really impressive for the price point. I have studio monitors in my music studio that cost hundreds more per speaker, and what can I say? I'm just impressed with what they're delivering for the price.

My current set up is a Fire TV Cube with 2 Echo Studio speakers. One placed on each side of the television for a true stereo experience.

When listening at really low volumes, I double checked a few times to make sure the sound was coming from speakers because the stereo imaging really is that good. Dialogue centers right to the TV and the ambiance is great, not to mention the panning of sound effects from left to right (you'll feel it when you see that plane fly across screen, bullets fly from one side of the room not to mention movie scores sound great). The room analyzer really is fantastic and uses your walls to reflect sounds for a great experience.

The speakers are balanced and my only recommendation for the EQ is to open up the Alexa App, throw your ""Highs"" all the way to the top (to the far right of the slider), your mids to the middle and give yourself just a little boost for the bass. Now we're talking! If you push your bass or mids too far it's going to sound muddy. Again, these aren't studio speakers and I think the EQ provided is more than sufficient.

I've tried watching with just one speaker to see how it sounds. The speaker auto adjusts to the room and does give a convincing stereo feel to your experience, however, if you double the speaker, you double the power—this means you're gonna get way more punch and I can't recommend it enough. If you're on a budget or on the fence, just try one.

Overall the sound is good, set up is easy and EQing them on the app is a breeze. So big checks for all of these things. Within 30 minutes (read about the delay below) I was re-watching favorite action and sci movies just to hear them in my living room and I was really impressed with the quality of the highs, mids and even the bass. I don't understand why one would invest in the Echo Sub — just get 2 Studio speakers and the combined power of them is going to give them all the ""UMMF"" you need. The woofer in these guys is plenty at higher volumes.

In comparison to the apple home pods: As someone who almost exclusively uses apple products, I couldn't be happier with these. Apple is just charging way too much for their speakers for slightly better quality and they will sound not much better to the untrained ear. It's simply not worth the extra money.

So why aren't these getting 5 stars? Well to be honest, I wasn't aware that they would only connect as a studio pair with Fire TV over wi-fi. Read that carefully. Yes, they still have a quarter inch in (like for your headphones on your phone) and they are blue tooth enabled, but in order to take advantage of using them in stereo they need to be connected over wifi and so does the sound source. Therefor, you aren't having a party and letting people just connect to the pair to play their music (unless it's one speaker at a time). Not a big deal if it's mainly for entertainment, but I do wish I would have known.

In addition to that, one of my primary frustrations was purchasing the Fire TV Cube so we could easily stream 4k media without longer buffering or drop outs. Well, the way you do that is by connecting your Cube to your ethernet. Unfortunately, the stereo pair has to be connected to the Fire TV over Wifi, so that means the Cube has to be connected to wifi as well. They will NOT work for your cube/firestick if you're connected over ethernet. This was a bit frustrating and caused some minor hiccups in my setting up... so instead of 10 minutes it took me about 30 to delete and reinstall the pairs.

So this leads me to my one BUYER BE WARE: if you are trying to stream 4k, make sure you have a good internet speed and if not you better have your modem nearby or you'll want to buy a wifi router to plug in to increase the signal near your TV, firestick or cube. In the end, I had a router next to where my TV was to extend our wifi throughout the house, but there's NO WAY everyone has this set up and I would have been really upset if I had major issues watching 4k. Luckily, I have not and I don't have super fast internet (about 55mbps) so I'm hoping most buyers are not put in that position.

With that said, I do believe some of this could be fixed with a firmware or software update, so I'm hopeful. If they do, I'd change my review to 5 stars.

Overall navigating and using Alexa is what it is and there's plenty of reviews about that elsewhere. One thing to note: if you have the cube and 2 speakers, they do not overlap well when listening for voices. I highly recommend you mute 2 of them (I muted one speaker and the cube with the microphone mute button on top of the unit) so we're only giving voice commands to one speaker.

In summary, if you're looking to add theatre like quality sound and punch to your living room, you cannot go wrong with these guys.

Make sure you have descent internet for streaming 4k (55mbps or higher) and don't be afraid to play around in the Alexa app to tweak your set up to your liking.

Even as someone who lives and breathes audio, I was impressed. Not because they are the best sounding speakers but for what they deliver, how easy they do it and for what price they are doing it at.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Cam,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2021","TL;DR for the Echo Studio is that the speaker, whether paired with the Echo Sub or not, running hi-fi music (I’m on Amazon HD) sounds fantastic, but there are so many glitches with it that I’m hard pressed to give it a full recommendation.

I love music, but don’t consider myself an audiophile. I’m a family man and don’t have the luxury of a dedicated “listening room,” and I’m certainly not going to spend thousands on a home sound system. I like listening to music while having my morning tea, relaxing in my bedroom, and when in my car. I have so far been using a pair of Sony XB-43 bluetooth speakers at home and they have been adequate.

I decided to look at upgrade options when I went over to Amazon HD for my streaming service (I also tried Tidal, but that’s for another review). I wanted something convenient, plug & play, and as a parent, relatively childproof. Bluetooth was not an option, as one loses most of the hi-fi benefits over bluetooth. Enter the Echo Studio. I already have a few Echo Dots, Fire TV, and as mentioned, Amazon HD Music, so it seemed like a natural fit. It should be noted however, that although Alexa Cast only works with Amazon Music, you can stream music with the other major services, Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, and others.

So I bought an Echo Studio for the breakfast area where I have my tea, and where I had previously been moving a bluetooth speaker every morning. Setup was quick and painless and I was immediately impressed with the sound. It’s not a high-end home stereo system, but it’s the best single-unit speaker system I have ever had and heard. And it’s $200.

I used the Alexa app to set the EQ, but you can simply tell Alexa to “increase bass” or “reduce treble” or make any other adjustments on the fly, mid-song or whenever you like. I see some reviewers complaining about the sound profile and wonder if they made EQ adjustments for their personal preferences or to suit the type of music being played.

Impressed, I ordered a second Studio and an Echo Sub for my bedroom. Setup and pairing the Sub was equally simple. At first I thought the Sub was defective, or not set up correctly, because I could barely hear anything coming from it. Turns out that for me anyway, it needs to be at a certain volume and playing certain music for it to really be felt. But feel it you will, as the Sub makes the music fill the room in a way that the Studio by itself doesn’t. Make sure you put the Sub on the floor.

The glitches started here, with the bedroom Studio. The music would randomly stop playing, whether during a playlist or simply when I had asked it to play music from a certain artist or genre. When I say that, I mean every single time I used it. Two or three songs and then nothing. Extremely frustrating. My wifi setup is solid, so I looked at suggestions online, and several people recommended putting your Studio on your 5GHz and cordoning it off there (everything else in the house on your 2.4GHz). I tried this, but it did not solve the problem (I ended up leaving the Studios on 2.4GHz and it has been the best option). I unplugged and went through setup on the Studio again and the problem, for the most part, seemed resolved. I took the opportunity to bump my internet tier up to improve my overall household speeds. The music on both my Studios will still stop playing occasionally though, for no apparent reason, with a strong internet connection. And they will go into “red ring” mode too, which is extremely frustrating.

Fast forward to now. Sound quality is noticeably better than my bluetooth speakers, and I mean noticeably. I am hearing guitar strings and cymbal crashes on music that I don’t remember ever hearing before. I used my bluetooth speaker last night for a bit and it was painful. There is no way I can ever go back to standard definition music streaming and bluetooth speakers. Think SD television versus HD television.

Now for the drawbacks. These things are glitchy. Music will stop playing for no reason. Voice recognition of the music or the playlist you asked for is hit and miss. The Studio itself will go into “Sorry, I’m having trouble right now” mode (red ring mode) and won’t play any music for you. At all. For five minutes or for an hour. I have to remind myself that it is a somewhat data-intensive streaming service and think back to the earlier days of Netflix and the like.

Also, while it is convenient to just tell Alexa what you want to listen to, at times I miss having the control of just playing music from my phone, and the Alexa casting is frustrating. Bring up the Amazon Music app, start playing your music (which you have to do before you get the casting button), wait for it to connect, then finally get the music going. Yes, it's probably only seven seconds, but trust me, it feels cumbersome. Again, even Netflix needs to load up.

If you happen to use a voice command directly to the Studio while casting (because when casting, you lose the Alexa voice control function from your Amazon Music app) it reverts back to Alexa app control and you’re out of casting mode (and phone control). Even if you don’t, the casting drops after a bit and you have to go through the connection process again. I’m not going to pair the Studio over bluetooth to get phone control, if I wanted bluetooth quality sound I wouldn’t have bought the Studio. (I did pair it once to check it out, and the music was at a super low volume).

It would be nice to be able to browse the music app and tap a song or playlist at any time and just have it play on the Studio as with a bluetooth connection. As it is, I have to tell Alexa to play it while I’m looking at music choices on the app and hope she gets it right. While on the Alexa app and controlling from there, sometimes it will show me the playlist I’m listening to, sometimes it doesn’t.

I also have Apple Music, as other family members are on Apple Music, and other than one time at the outset, it will play the Apple Music when requested without any problems (Amazon Music is my default setting).

As I sit writing this review, my Studio has played my music flawlessly the entire time and sounds fantastic, and this is what keeps me in the Echo Studio game and considering a third Studio to stereo pair in the bedroom with the Echo Sub (Prime Days?). If it performed this way consistently and the Alexa and Amazon Music apps integrated more smoothly, I would give the Echo Studio a 100% recommendation. I am holding out hope that future software updates will smooth out the rough edges. Until then, know what you’re getting. A sweet-sounding, self-contained hi-fi smart speaker system that will both delight and frustrate you.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Songdog,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2024","I was told by amazon rep that the echo studio was compatible with remote. There is even a option in the alexa app to do so. After many days of frustration another amazon rep tells me that there is no compatible remote for studio. The problem with this (and all echos is that the speaker and microphone are in the same enclosure which means that if you turn the volume up past 6 then the echo becomes deaf and cannot hear you.

Kevin S,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2024","I really love the sound this speaker produces while using Amazon Music. The speaker itself deserves a 5 but Amazon really needs to overhaul their music app. It’s sloppy, clunky and malfunctions and crashes frequently. An improved user interface and full app overhaul and this would be an amazing pair. The speaker however is excellent. I am pairing it with the Tidal Music App and the sound is just amazing. The speaker really does redefine how music is heard. Simply amazing.

One dislike about the speaker is that when you play a song for the first time on any given day Alexa feels the need to announce ""now playing on """" which actually interrupts and cuts off the beginning of the song you are trying to play. Not good. The developers need to update and eliminate that. I bought the speaker to hear music, not Alexa.

Also, out of the blue, Alexa feels the need to announce when the Studio is connected and what it is connected to. This happens randomly at any given hour, even the middle of the night. The developers need to fix this.

Really though, those are minor.

NEURO,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2024","I bought this mostly to get better sound from my Omni FireTV, as well as the benefits of Alexa. The sound quality is terrific, but there's a lot of issues & bugs that need to be resolved and smoothed out from the integration of Alexa/Echo Studio and other devices.

For example:
1) Although I have navigation sounds turned on for my Omni FireTV, Echo either ignores that setting or turns it off. Doesn't matter how many times I turn it back on, it turns it off every time. Before I bought Echo, this issue didn't exist.

2) The volume control on my FireTV is stepped from 1 to 100, yet on Echo it's stepped from 1-10. Why this inconsistency in volume control settings among Amazon products? So when I ask Alexa/Echo to change the volume, I only have a range of 1-10, instead of the finer resolution of the TV's 1-100.

3) Echo has issues remaining connected to the wireless home network. My wireless router is only 20' feet away, yet it's a regular occurrence for Echo to lose the connection, then create its own ad-hoc network to reconnect. Then it's a PITA process that takes several tries to get Echo to reconnect to your preferred home network. My FireTV has no issues remaining connected to my wireless network and never disconnects or drops it. Why does Echo have this issue remaining connected, even when manually chosen in the Alex app?

4) All the different color rings on Echo that mean different things makes you ignore them, because it's ridiculous trying to remember what all the different colors & pulses are supposed to mean when they light up. I ended up saving a PDF doc to my PC & phone that I open when I'm wondering what Echo is doing and flashing certain colors & behaviors. A simple solution would be a concise answer from Alexa if you ask her, 'Alexa...what are you doing?' If we're going to go full-boat on voice control AI, then do it properly & completely.

5) Why does Alexa/Echo sometimes alert you to some notifications, but not others? Why do the alerts contain no info or only vague info? Why doesn't Alexa notify me when an Amazon package is delivered, although I have that setting? All these inconsistent/incomplete behaviors are annoying and useless.

6) We need an Alexa app for the PC, instead of just the phone app, to control settings for the Echo and other Alexa devices. Please make one for the many who use PC's most of the time for home & work.

There's other issues & bugs, but I can't remember them all now.

Jeb,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2024","I'm an audiophile (I love good sound), and this sounds good enough for my kitchen. It gets loud enough for me, but I wouldn't count on it for blasting some ""Snoop Doggy Dog"" at a party (that's an old person joke). I had some trouble learning the command to get it to play music or podcasts when coupled with my other Echo Dot in the living room. It's very specific... ""Alexa play the song Eat It by the band Weird Al on Spotify on the Everywhere group."" It's a mouthful. With little information online I was very frustrated in figuring that out at first, and I had to resort to the Alexa app that you download on your phone for setup to sort-of get the answer. There is a chat bot there which is helpful. Otherwise, not so straight forward, so I'm providing it (the group command) here for anyone else with the same problem. But now that it's working I'm happier with this product. My mother wouldn't be able to set it up alone.
You do have to raise your voice over the music to turn it down with a verbal command.
One thing I don't like is that when you ask it to play a podcast Alexa reads not only the podcast title of the show she is about to play, but also the description of the show that is usually listed below the title. It can be quite a lengthy description, so she may go on for some time before getting to the play button. Also, unless you pay for Prime Music Unlimited membership some musical functions are limited. Like a few times it wouldn't let me skip forward. That's very frustrating when The Eagles come on. Alexa will prompt you to buy the Unlimited feature with a full pitch that takes a good 20 seconds to ge through before the pesky Eagles resume. Eventually I learned how to shut off this ad, but then I got it again today when I asked it to play Led Zeppelin. Not sure why. Eventually I hope to figure out how to shut off all ads.
I also thought this device would speak Chinese, a language I am learning, but strangely it is not included in the list of 20 or so available tongues. Which is a little strange to me since Mandarin is the second most spoken language in the world. Apparently there is a language learning app you can set up, but I haven't figured that out yet.

6. The 1""tweeter delivers bright crisp highs
7. And having a 5¼"" speaker to handle the lower frequencies in the music really makes this speaker sound and feel like a bookshelf style speaker. I may just have to purchase another for pairing into a stereo set.

I'm going to pair the studio with my echo sub just to hear.

I've been playing the echo studio for a bit now. Playing songs from different genres, 80's, 90's, 2K, Amazon music 3D, HD, and ultra HD.
First impression... Compared to echo and echo plus. Eq flat and spatial enhancement on.
1. Noticably louder
2. Highs more present and crisper
3. Vocals not as muffled

I temporarly have the echo studio in a bedroom I converted to a small home theater. Room is 12ftx12ft with 10ft ceiling. Speaker was placed in center of room on foot rest/table. (Amazon suggest having it 6"" from a wall. I'll play with that later when I figure out where it works best in it's possible final destination, the family room.) The echo studio filled the room. I was sitting on the couch in front of the echo studio. With my eyes closed I could follow the sound around the room like a globe. When I would turn off the spatial enhancement you could hear and feel the ""sound globe"" get smaller and closer to the speaker.

The first 3d song on the playlist Alexa tells you to ask to play was a bad example. ""The steps"" by Haim. There are weird distortions in the music. I thought too myself (what a wonderful world. You know that's where your brain wanted to go) this is horrible sounding. Turned off the spatial enhancement (SE) and still not good. Went to the next song and was relieved that it was the song and not the speaker.

As I said earlier I played a handful of songs from Amazon music. Turning on/off the SE, adjusted the EQ a little. It's tough with Amazon music, the sound quality from song to song (unless they're all on one album) is super inconsistent. You don't notice this on the dot and if your listening you can almost kind of hear it on the echo and echo plus. But it's pretty tough to hear unless you know what to listen for. As the quality of your speaker or system gets better, the distortion, compression become more noticeable. Before subscribing to the HD music I couldn't even listen to Amazon music in my car without cringing from the distortion, inconsistent compression, and/or hollow sounding songs (Lincoln Parks ""hybrid theory"" is a good example of distorted highs. And it sounds like it was recorded in a tin can) HD subscription helps the sound quality a lot but doesn't eliminate the issues.

Overall I like what I heard. Definitely need to play with it some more. Let the speakers get broke in. After about 30-50 hours overall sound should warm up and be a bit smoother.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Amanda Benson,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2023","Pros:
If you are using Amazon Music Unlimited and have a large library of Dolby Atmos songs, you will love the depth of sound from the Echo Studio.

Cons
Non Atmos/360 songs sound like a cheap AM radio. Mono/Echo sounding. You can disable the ""Spacial Enhancement"" option in the Alexa app which helps a little, but the speaker should be smart enough to play lower quality formats.

I'm including comments on the Amazon Music app here because the speaker can't be used without ""some"" app, and the Amazon App is what I use.

So many things wrong with the app.

View library by Album and it sorts by recent activity instead of Album name. Same if you view by artist.

If you don't have Music unlimited your playlists are useless. Amazon ""says"" users asked for access to a bigger song library so their solution is to mix random songs into your playlist. BS.

They changed the definition of library. My library used to contain songs I purchased and playlists. Now it contains everything.

Can't see the quality of the song you are playing. Plenty of room to show it on the now playing screen but they don't. Why? They don't want you to see how many songs are not high quality I guess. Maybe they just have bad designers, developers.

No volume control in the app. They have one in the Alexa app. So you have keep both apps running, which you really need to anyway to enable/disable the spacial enhancement option.

Optical line-in port is almost useless. Go read the forums. Too much to include here.

Seems like every ""enhancement"" they've made to the app lately is a step backwards.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Rob in Boston,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2023","""Spatial Audio"" is NOT A SETTING on Echo or Alexa. It's a playlist that you must request verbally while operating Alexa once you have Amazon Music Unlimited (which you must purchase additionally as with other music platforms.) If you are already an Amazon Prime member, the added five bucks is worth it. With Amazon Music Unlimited, Alexa becomes your slave). Understand, with basic Amazon Music, the sound is suppressed (It sucks.) It's better to fork out a few more bucks for the Unlimited (and you're the boss). 2) Once you pay for Amazon Music Unlimited, the sound improves significantly. 3) ""Spatial Sound"" IS NOT A SETTING for your device. It's merely a marketing ploy. It's simply a playlist that only works if you subscribe to Amazon Music Unlimited. THERE IS NO SETTING ON ALEXA FOR ""SPATIAL SOUND."" Once you have Amazon Music Unlimited, you say to Alexa (on your Echo device), ""Alexa, play the best of spatial audio playlist."" What you get is random pop music, most of which is redundant and not rewarding. Keep your settings basic. Do get Amazon Unlimited because you are in command. You can skip without suppression at any time. If you ask Alexa a general question, it's usually okay, but sometimes it's ridiculous how badly a question can be misinterpreted. I like my Echo Studio. It doesn't allow much finessing of the volume. I'm searching for a compatible 16 band equalizer (which probably doesn't exist) but it tells you I'm encouraged by the sound of this device. Don't be confused about ""Spatial Audio."" Also, keep the basic sound settings once you have the Echo Studio speaker. You can adjust simply by commanding: ""Alexa bass up,"" or ""Alexa, mid rage down,"" Or, ""Alexa Treble up 1,""etc. The same with volume. That's all I got.

Judith F Wagner,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2023","I own numerous echo devices, from the Shows to the Dots and Towers and Fire tablets, so I'm all in the Amazon ecosystem. I bought a Fire TV and then this Studio to use as a speaker last year. I have not gotten the Studio to work well with the TV yet. First, I tried Bluetooth, but the sound and lips would not sync, no matter how much I played with it. Then I tried Amazon Home Theater. This eliminated the sync issues, but the TV and the Studio would unpair every couple of DAYS. I did a factory reset on the Studio and then had trouble connecting it to a strong internet signal, so I set it next to the router to connect to the internet. I also tried using an optical cable to hard-wire the two but all I got were crackling noises. So I went back to Amazon Home Theater -- and I always have to reconnect the Studio and TV, after unplugging them both -- a real pain. I was going to get a second Studio and the Echo subwoofer, but not now because of my experience with this Studio and Fire TV (both Amazon products); just not staying connected. If anyone knows how to fix it, please post. Thanks

Aug 22, 2023. I'm updating my review as Amazon Home Theater seems much more stable, so I'm increasing the stars on the Studio to 4. My main problem was never the sound, but the connection between the studio and my Fire TV. I am only losing the connection between the Fire TV with the Studio maybe once every two weeks now vs. once every two days. I'm pretty sure it's on the Studio side as when I go to reconnect, the Fire TV doesn't recognize the Studio that is sitting next to it. I try the next day and it works. So I'm going to be brave and get the second Studio and see if I can really get a home theatre system going. The home theater still baffles me as I have FIOS's top internet package so it should support everything. To give Amazon kudos, someone called me on this, but I couldn't recreate the problem with regularity, so it was impossible to work with them.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Greg W.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2021","While it is true that, to date, the Echo Studio paired with another and the Echo Sub is one of the best ways to listen to Amazon Music Unlimited, there are some drawbacks.

The first is probably the price. You really don't need to pair two together if you can't afford it and the Echo Sub does not automatically add as much bass by default as you would like.

I don't want to split hairs, but the Echo Remote works with the Echo Studio much better in one-speaker format.

In paired mode, you can sync the remote, you can change the volume, and bypass the wake word with the press of a button, but you can't skip forward or go back with two of them working as a 2.1 system just with a press.

I hope Amazon addresses this with a software update or that I am the only one for whom this happens. I sincerely doubt Amazon addresses this as they do not sell the remotes on their website anymore. It's a shame. I really prefer using the remotes.

When you set these devices up on your smartphone or tablet, I learned the hard way that you need to re-enter your same address multiple times and label your rooms correctly for the sake of organization and using the drop-in feature.

As for the sound quality of the streamed music, it's very good, but not excellent.

It's very difficult for streamed music to sound great. I've listened to vinyl records and CD's and DVD Audio and music that was advertised as lossless, but streaming music for the time being is compressed by algorithms. Most people know that. And you know you're being robbed of sounds or data that make the file small enough to stream.

If you are an audiophile, buying one of these Echo Studio devices was never on your to-do list.

But the Echo Studio makes for a decent smart speaker. I like that I can control the thermostat and dim lights without spending much effort.

I've owned previous generation Echo devices that had built-in thermometers. The Studio dropped that feature.

I should tell you that I have also used Google Home and it seems to be more capable of answering my more complex questions.

Yes, your smartphone is smarter. Your computer is obviously smarter.

Basically, what I am saying is the Echo Studio is better than previous models from Amazon.

I got what I paid for because I had realistic expectations. And it sounds very good on its own.

I like that it adjusts to the acoustics of the room automatically when moved to new locations.

To sum up: I like it. It has its limitations, but I like it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
TheFirstMongoose,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2020","Pretty good speaker. Bad exchange policy and customer service. I purchased two of these on Prime Day, since they were $50 off MSRP for a total of $100 savings. Tested both of them out and paired them together with the Echo Sub. Played music fine. Somewhat drowned out the bass from the subwoofer, but music was nice and clear. There really is no way to independently turn up the bass just on the Echo Sub since they are all connected now(two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub). Amazon needs to invest in these tweaks that would make a big difference.

I discovered a day later that one of the Studios had a low static noise whenever I asked Alexa a question. It wasn’t on the other one/speaker. So I tried to troubleshoot and went through everything. Changing the WiFi band from 2.4 to 5.0 and back. Changing to different outlet. Unplugging for a few minutes. Nothing worked. Very noticeable if your within 3 feet and asking Alexa a question. When playing music however, the static seemed to disappear or so I thought. When the music is turned down, the static was still there. So I decided to call Amazon technical services. A tech/representative went through all the troubleshooting methods I had already tried and we determined that the speaker was faulty. I agreed to just have it replaced. When he was telling me on how to ship the faulty speaker back, he mentioned to not include any cords or pamphlets. That raised a red flag and I asked if I was receiving a new or refurbished unit for a replacement. He said he doesn’t know or would not know until it ships. So I end the call with him and go to my Amazon account to look at the replacement being shipped. It’s a REFURBISHED! Nothing wrong with refurbished, but I bought new not refurbished. So Amazon should be replacing with a new one. Right out of the box there was a static. It’s not like I used it for a month. So I called back and tried to explain to a different representative. Come to find out, Amazon’s policy to correct such issues is either to refund your money or replace with new OR refurbished unit(their call), when it comes to Amazon devices. My argument is that this is a brand new device that was defective, sending a refurbished one should have NEVER been an option. What complicates thing now even more is that they are out of stock on new Studios. None expected in until a month and a half later. The second representative ended up canceling the refurbished replacement and said I can wait until they get new Studios in to do the exchange since she can’t even order a replacement due to the lack of stock. Either case, I’m not very happy on how this was all handled. Decent sounding speaker, but if you get a lemon, be prepared to get a refurbished one as an exchange. Or be vigilant like me and question it. I did notice other reviewers stating receiving replacements coming in generic boxes....those are refurbished. And there’s nothing wrong with refurbished if you originally bought refurbished or if you have owned that device for a number of days, weeks, months. That wasn’t my case. Brand new out of the box with a static noise and wasn’t offered a new replacement.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jeff Helmes,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2020","Alexa works flawlessly. Big plus since I bought it to replace a glitchy stereo pair of 3rd Gen Echoes in bedroom used for music & ocean wave sounds to help drift off to sleep. The stereo pairing suffered frustrating dropouts, with one or sometimes both speakers quitting in the middle of songs & very rarely played the ocean sounds through morning. But so far the Studio has worked perfectly.

However, in spite of the Dolby Atmos credentials, the Studio doesn’t sound nearly as spacious as the paired Echoes (which I had in opposite corners of the room on the headboard wall, mounted about 5 feet high on candle sconces.) Paired also with an Echo Sub, this filled the room with sound rather nicely... well, whenever it all worked simultaneously. But the glitches simply became untenable, so I grabbed a Studio during Prime Day...

At first I put the Studio near a corner of the room on a dresser, pointing the front toward the bed. Sounded tinny. Made sure I had upgraded to Amazon HD & played Best of 3D... Still barely any immersion of sound whatsoever. Very disappointing. Moved speaker to center of wall, still on dresser... Better but still not very impressive. (And yes I did keep the Echo Sub, now paired to the Studio.) I let it play all day while at work to break in the speaker & allow the room tuning to recalibrate... No avail.

Finally I moved the Studio to a speaker stand, centered on the far wall facing the bed. The sound was significantly improved. Still not what I’d expect from a product claiming Dolby Atmos, but certainly better sound immersion. I think the side-firing speakers work far better in space, rather than bouncing sound off a near surface. Clearly the Studio is intended to point at the listener’s face & it must to achieve any reasonable degree of sound immersion. Regardless I did prefer the sound of paired Echoes with Sub over the Studio + Sub... but not enough to go back to all the frustrating glitches.

No doubt paired Studios would sound better than the paired Echos, but I don’t want to return to the annoying dropouts. Besides for $300-400, a stereo pair of Sonos Ones would be better sounding with rock solid reliability.

Bottom line is I will stick with the Studio because it has been so reliable & good enough sounding for a bedroom. The Echo pair absolutely demanded a Sub for quality music. However the Studio doesn’t depend on it since it has a woofer, unlike all other Echoes. So at $150 (on sale) I would recommend a Studio for a bedroom or kitchen where music will be played, but stereophile audio quality isn’t required. But for a living room or den where you may prefer excellent sound quality, I would highly recommend a Dot & a stereo pair of Sonos One SLs, or better yet the Sonos Five.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Pablo Freddy Man,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2020","I LOVE LOVE LOVE these speakers. I bought two of them and have them paired up. So far it has been amazing. Here's what I love about them:
- In paired mode, the speakers sound incredible. I have tried both ""spatial"" and ""non-spatial"" settings and both sound pretty good.
- I recently upgraded my fire TV to a fire stick 4K and the dolby sound that comes when watching a movie/show is outstanding
- Speaker is so good that I sold off my regular speakers which were really nice, but I truly don't need them anymore
- microphone pickup is outstanding. even if music is playing I can say Alexa and usually it hears me
- When compared to the google mini I had, I notice that the home automation stuff I have is faster. Like ""Alexa turn on kitchen light"" it responds instantly

Cons:
- I have spotify and frankly spotify integration sort of sucks. I can't say ""shuffle music"", i doesn't work. if i say ""play more songs like this"" it doesn't work. playing of music will just stop mid-stride for no reason. even ""play that song that goes shake it like a polaroid picture"" doesn't work. i'm really disappointed with spotify on echo studios. so i tried out amazon music with a free offer, and guess what? of course everything works perfectly. i'm a little bit bothered that i may have to migrate from spotify or change to a different type of speaker. with my google mini, spotify worked perfectly.
- i have my speakers paired, and because of this, using the communication feature of the echo studio when paired doesn't work. i found out it will only work if i unpair the speakers. i submitted a bug but there's been no fix for weeks. irritating!
- the speakers can be buggy. sometimes the speakers will unpair for no reason. i had initially setup my speakers on a different wi-fi network name. so i changed it to the one I want. i went to amazon and told it to not remember any old wi-fi names. but for some reason, they would randomly re-connect to the old connection. I finally did a factory reset and did it all again and now it seems to work without switching back.

Pretty much what I have come to believe/realize is that these speakers are all about the amazon echo-system. I don't see a priority for it to work with spotify because they want you to switch to amazon music. The hardware itself is great, so I may actually follow what they planned and switch to amazon music. But I'm irritated about it. The alexa app is okay, but kind of buggy.

So I would've given it 5 stars, but give it 4. I'm still extremely happy because I love the sound from teh paired speakers. and watching movies with atmos is amazing, like for the first time i feel like you can hear sounds coming from the side or further away or atmospheric sounds. my old home theater system never sounded this good.

If you're a huge spotify user, I'd stay away and maybe go for the Sonos. But if you're ambivalent about your music service, this works perfect with amazon music. And so far with my fire stick 4k the sound with the paired speakers is amazing.",4.0 out of 5 stars
AC,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2019","I have a myriad of Echoes around my open-floor plan house including five Echo Subs for whole-home audio but some of my Echos are 1st generation. When this game-changer, Echo Studio came out, I was hoping to up the ante by replacing my old Echoes with a few Studios so I started out with one.

First, its greatest feature: the room-measuring, self-adjusting, high-tech “spatial” processing must be disabled in order to hear the highs, at least to my ears. That’s okay since I don’t really care about spacial whatever, I just want to crank it up!

One important feature for me is the ability to pair the Echo Studio with my Echo Sub and enjoy the bass from both devices at the same time. After all, for twice the price, I want twice the bass, right? That’s where I ran into problems.

I initially setup the Studio and played some tunes which sounded spectacular. Then, I eagerly set up my sub and paired it to the Studio, imagining what twice the bass was going to sound like. The pairing went fine with no hiccups. Then I added the new pair to my “Everywhere” group which also went fine. I played some music on my Everywhere group where the Studio performed well again BUT there was nothing coming out of the Echo Sub it was paired with.

I paired, unpaired, paired again, deleted and reinstalled both but the result is the same: the Studio vibrates for all its might while the Echo Sub it was paired with sat completely silent. I was heartbroken, wondering why the Studio would play all the bass and deprive a dedicated Echo Sub from playing any of it!

Amazon tech support actually called me to try to sort out the issue and assured me the Studio should, in fact, play nice with the Echo Sub as they have an identical setup in their own testing room. The tech verified on her screen that the Studio and Sub were active and linked together in a sub pair I labeled “TV room sub pair” in the Alexa app.

However, I only over tested the setup by playing music on my Everywhere group. The tech asked me to first play music specifically on my “TV room sub pair” and suddenly my Studio and Sub came alive together! Then, I tested music on my Everywhere group again and lo and behold, the Studio and Sub played together, giving me the bass I wanted.

I don’t know how or why but I learned: 1. Pair the Studio with the Sub and give the pair a name in the Alexa app, “TV room sub pair” in my case. 2. Ask Alexa to play music, specifically using that pair’s name. It is not enough to just walk up to the Studio and ask Alexa it to play a tune because only the Studio will play and the Sub will sit silent. 3. After playing a tune to ensure the Studio and Sub work together, THEN add the pair to my Everywhere group.

Thanks Amazon tech girl!

MSR Workshop,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2019","So I have an interesting review to write. I Purchased my first echo studio from Best Buy and immediately got it home and playing music. I was immediately underwhelmed by the music that was coming out of the speaker and was confused. I had heard so many good reviews and how much people love this speaker. Was I just too much of an audio snob to appreciate it or was I doing something wrong. I repaired the speaker just in case I had messed something up in the set up process and it still didn’t sound that great the base was poor and the sound that came out was very thin at low-volume. Well the speaker did have good sound at high-volume the low-volume sound was very lacking. I decided that there must be something wrong internally so I immediately returned it and bought a second one. The second one I purchased was just as easy to set up. This one immediately did sound better with the immersive sound function turned on. But I am still on the fence overall.

So what’s the hidden problem you might ask? Many reviewer’s have said to turn the “immersive sound” off, And it will sound much better. No reviewer has mentioned yet that when you turn the “immersive sound” off, it turns two of the speakers off. With the immersive sound on, sound comes from all five speakers. With the immersive sound button turn off, no sound will come from the top firing or the front firing speaker. So essentially you are left with a left and a right and a sub to produce music and sound content. WHY, has amazon chosen to do this, I’m not sure? Maybe someone can chime in and comment on this. I would have thought that all speakers on the system would be active all the time instead of just sometimes.

I have a very high-end home theater system and understand how surroundsound works. Only delivering audio to a specific channel if there is content decoded for it. An example would be a 7.1 surround. The 2 rear channels on this type of system may not produce sound all the time, they are there for when, say a plane flies by or a an object goes behind the listener. Another example is the center channel is designed for speech and the left and right are for other sound affects. But..... this all has to do with the processor. In most processors you can choose to have a multi channel stereo sound where sound is sent equally to all speakers. This is not the case with the echo Studio. Essentially the “immersive sound” button turns your speaker into a 4.1 surround , sending specific sounds to each speaker for the surround affect. Turning the “immersive sound” off, you get a 2.1 stereo sound, killing sound from the top and the front firing speaker. Not sure I’m cool with this. I would much prefer a 4.1 stereo sound when the “immersive sound” is toggled off than a 2 channel stereo.

Amazon..... care to chime in?

Buzzfuster,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2020","Updating my original review and downgrading to 4 stars. Overall, the Echo Studio is a really good device, but it has some inexplicable problems. For example, you can pair an iphone or ipad with an Echo Studio and stream music from your phone/tablet just fine. In theory, you should be able to pair an iMac with an Echo Studio and stream music. But you can't. You can pair an iMac to an Echo Studio via bluetooth, but for some bizarre reason, the Echo Studio just won't stream any sound from the iMac. Other speakers work fine when paired with my iMac. It's just the iMac and Echo Studio that won't play nice. It's also frustrating that the only way to pair an Echo Studio device with a bluetooth device is to use the Alexa app. The Echo Studio (and all Echo devices) are voice controlled for crying out loud! Why can't users simply say, ""Alexa, enter pairing mode""? The other frustrating thing is that you can pair two Echo Studios with an Amazon Fire TV so that the Echo Studios function as left and right stereo speakers. It works great, other than 50% of the time when you power off the TV and later power it back on, the Amazon Fire TV forgets its bluetooth connection with the Echo Studio pair and you have to go into the Fire TV's menu to force it to re-pair with the Echo Studios. You can also theoretically pair one Echo Studio directly with a smart TV, but apparently you cannot pair two Echo Studios with the smart TV to use as a stereo speaker pair. All in all, the Echo Studio UX team needs to do a lot more testing and potentially some development to create a uniform user experience.

I had originally bought a pair of Echo Studios to use with my Fire TV Cube as a stereo speaker pair. There was an annoying bug that I encountered and reported to Amazon, and within a week, the bug was fixed. I have since bought another Studio for another room because the sound quality is amazing. For my ""home theater"" experience, I configured the two Echo Studios as right and left stereo speakers. As a few other reviewers have said, if you use your Studio with a Fire TV device, you do not need to bother with buying the Echo sub woofer. The Studio has a really rich range of sound, including the bass frequencies, and because it configures itself to bounce sound waves off of your walls and ceiling, the Studio creates a pretty amazing immersive sound experience (for movies and shows that support it). I haven't tried the 3D songs on Amazon Music yet -- there aren't a lot so far, but I expect the experience will be great.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jazzyguy,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2019","I have experience with a lot of Alexa devices. I have an echo dot second generation connected to a Samsung soundbar in my living room. My son has an echo dot connected to a dock with a battery and speaker in his bedroom. I have an Ensignia Fire TV in my bedroom, a fire TV stick in my livingroom, and even a fire 10HD tablet. My parents have had an Echo since it first came out.
I purchased the Echo Studio to replace the Echo Plus second generation which I had been using for only a few months in my bedroom. I liked the Echo plus overall, but the soundstage which it created simply was too narrow for my tastes. I wanted to get a device which would make music sound better in my room, and I really wanted something to connect to my TV to improve its sound.
In terms of sound quality, I would go so far as to say that the Studio is impressive. Out of the box, I feel the sound is a little flat, but just a bit of tweaking of the bass and treble settings fixes this. As other reviewers have noted: The bass doesn't quite reach subwoofer frequencies, but it gets close, and it is more than adequate for my application. In contrast to some of the reviews I have read, I find vocals to be clear, and highs are crisp and can even be piercing when properly configured. The soundstage is quite wide, even on regular stereo tracks, and even whnen using music services other than Amazon. Amazon HD music makes the whole thing sound better, and 3D music sounds even better yet. I'm hopeful that more 3D music will become available in the future.
I was disappointed not to be able to configure the Studio with my Fire TV as a home theater setup. Apparently, the TV which I purchased just this past July doesn't contain a late enough version of the Fire TV, and updating firmware doesn't help. I really, really don't want to have to purchase a Fire TV stick for my fire TV; that just seems weird.
Nevertheless, I did connect my bedroom TV to the Studio with a mini optical to optical cable. The sound is fantastic, but there is a catch. If I power off my TV for a half hour or more, then come back and turn it on, I don't get any audio unless I disconnect, then reconnect the audio cable. This is not a deal breaker, but it is annoying, particularly if I have to get out of bed to do it.
Overall, I'm happy with the Echo Studio, but it would be really nice if the optical audio worked better, and it would be nice to have a wireless connectivity option (other than low-quality Bluetooth audio) for my fire TV. I understand that I shouldn't necessarily expect atmos support from my current TV, but something between Bluetooth stereo and wireless atmos would be nice.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Had to have the man repeat himself 3 or 4 times and well,, I managed as well as he. They are sending a replacement which I dont think will be a brand new one.

The speakers sound great most of the time but there are occasional brief episodes of unpleasant bass noise/boom. Alexa HAS issues.

Problem fixed by stopping then restarting wifi, computer and speakers.

After reading the * reveiws I was afraid Id end up returning these but that is not the case. These speakers are my first smart devices but set up and linking to my computer, Amazon Music, Pandora and Sirius was quick and easy. Im happy with the sound. Its full, clear and powerful.

Hailie,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024",So I gave this echo a try and it impressed me. Let me start by saying I have a small apt and this echo studio is perfect for my home theater experience. The atmos is surprisingly crisp not overwhelming. I keep the volume level between 5 or 6 depending if it's a game or movie I'm watching. Easy to set up with Firestick TV. The only issue i have is when you turn the TV on you have to wait few minutes for it to sync to the Firestick. I also have the echo show but the echo studio sounds much better. This is definitely a keeper.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Rebecca,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2024",The sound quality is very good. The connectivity is a bit spotty though. It takes a bit of messing around with to figure out when pairing with different devices. The Alexa app is really annoying when trying to play music. The app itself does not pair well with Spotify or even Amazon Music. One thing that really bothers me (which is why I took away a star) is that it will randomly pair and unpair in the middle of the night which plays a very loud chime.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Gormph,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2023","A self DPS adjusting speaker is why I bought this, and for the price its good although hardly studio grade. Before I go any further I am pleased with this Alexa device and intend to keep it, it gets pretty loud, and sounds fine although I dont believe it will be replacing anyone's dedicated sound system.

Pros:
1. Gets much louder than other Alexa devices
2. Sounds better than other Alexa devices
3. Detects voice better than my older Alexa devices
4. It has an optical input

Cons:
1. Seems slower to process commands than even older gen echo devices.
2. Mid driver is lack luster, mids are mudded, and if you turn off spatial sound its almost like hearing them through a pillow.
3. Sub distorts easily in my opinion, more so if you use the optical input, Do Not connect this to your Xbox as even at low volumes the start up sounds don't agree with it.
4. EQ can mitigate the sound issues, BUT it will not hold EQ settings at least not for me.

While it has some short comings as a speaker its very good as an echo device with improved sound. I do not know who makes the sound drivers for this device but feel that they are the weak point. That being said I got mine for about $150 and think that as a Wi-Fi speaker that is a good deal. If the speaker can be made to retain EQ settings I would even go so far as to recommend it over sound bars in the same range.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Dustun,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2024",I don't know what to say. This speaker is amazing. I tried pairing out with the optional Amazon subwoofer but the aftermarket sub doesn't sound much better so I would just stick with this speaker without the optional sub for now anyway until Amazon comes out with one with more power. That being said The echo studio by itself is a great sounding speaker. Would give it extra star if it had a little bit more base. Maybe a bass boost with an extra 50 to 100 watts minimum on built-in subwoofer power but pretty amazing for what it is. Would recommend. It's aesthetically pleasing on the eyes as well.

Alexa is still glitchy though. Sometimes it takes a couple requests to get the song to play. Sometimes it takes like 20 seconds to play the song…. The single echo dot always loaded the song immediately, so it seems an issue with the Echo Studio.

Spoon,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2020","So you did the echo dot, and you decided alexa was part of your life now. So now you want some better speakers? You played with those Dot docks that sounded horrible. You were tired of having to turn on a separate set of speakers or dealing with bluetooth dropouts. You wanted a simple solution that sounds great? Is this it? Is it the echo studio? No... unfortunately not.

1) Alexa integration is great! as you would expect from a first party amazon product. This does work just as good as that dot you're replacing.

2) It is a tight and clean package! Yes it is. Very easy to setup, and very slick looking on the shelf.

3) The bass is so much better! Well yes it is. The bass is better than that echo plus, and certainly better than the echo dot. That said don't expect much. I've had a bose wave radio in the past and know what bass can be managed in tiny package. This is not as efficient. It is not bad though.

4) The overall sound quality is Audiophile! No it is not. It's not bad. Think sound quality of a mid quality bluetooth speaker. I do have a JBL charge and the JBl charge does sound better (although it is boomier, it has a more pleasing and ""full"" sound). I replaced a Echo dot sourcing in a Bowers and Wilkins Zeppelin Mini. The Zeppelin mini is about the same footprint, but sounds so much better! But running a Zeppelin mini means i have another remote, and have to turn on the Zeppelin when listening to music and hook up the 3.5 cable. This is a ""clean"" solution (see point 2).

So should you get it? Honestly it is a great thing. The speaker will sound great to 95% of the people (as you can see by the reviews). To my ears they sound pretty ok! Inoffensive, honestly that's the best praise. 3 stars for music quality, 5 stars for design. Averaging 4 stars.

What needs to happen to get to 5 stars? Amazon needs to make it easier to make a good alexa product (because the 3rd party ones are not good thus far), or Amazon needs to poach a couple of audiophile speaker designers and have them go at it. I know this was certified by the dolby guys, but dolby knows how to make theatre systems, not musical speakers. Maybe some help from the NHT or Bower & Wilkins guys can help.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Grayslake,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2023","Have two of these now. Bought to replace older Echo Dot pancake, plus older Echo cylinder models (reused elsewhere). Sound is noticeably better and more clear. Bass is there, but in a speaker so small bass performance is limited no matter what. At high volume, this speaker gets a bit muddy. At reasonable levels, it has pretty good midrange performance for voices, most music. Higher frequencies are edgy depending on volume. Found setup with Alexa pretty easy and done in less than a minute. Attractive design too. Conclusion: works much better in small rooms for music listening, but otherwise useful in any room. NOTE: initially had connection issues with my second studio speaker. It was no more than 3 feet from the router through a regular drywall wall. It would lose connection or I would get the famous I can’t understand right now message. Found that positioning the unit is everything as far as connectivity.

M. Marceau,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2022","I've been in and among the pursuit of audio utopia since before there were CDs. I have designed and built several of my own speakers over the years with good success. My stereo setup is currently on par with a ""$100k wall"" from the local high-end shop (B&W 802s/McIntosh setup) but for closer to $6k (I'm still upgrading).
I got the Studio to add some decent sound in our piano room and I am not too disappointed with the performance given it is a smart speaker, however, IMO, the reviews are too generous.
The highs leave much to be desired and the lows fall off pretty quickly below ~70Hz. Granted, there is a subwoofer to help remedy this that I plan on getting.
The spatial sound really impressed me the most, at times, the sound seemed to come from around the house vs. from the speaker that was ~7' away.

The voice commands are okay, although there are tons and tons of ""do you want to purchase/subscribe"" to something I feel should be included given I already subscribe to the hi-def streaming service.
Also, I'll request a specific genre of music, or a playlist that I have played before through the HEOS app (linked to Amazon music) and Alexa really misses the ball. I believe we should be much closer to the Jarvis AI in Iron Man than we are today given the vast IT infrastructure that Amazon possesses.

My main gripe is that it seems you have to have an Alexa device in every room you want to control something (at least in the audio/video realm) despite having fully setup rooms in the Alexa app. I cannot control the Fire TV in my breakfast area since I have already linked it to my receiver in another room. I would completely understand being limited to one device at a time, but this limitation is an artificial limit implemented to drive you to purchase multiple Echo's (they must get a good chunk of $ to be able to tap in to a whole house whenever they want).
Apparently, there is a clause somewhere in the fine print that allows law-enforcement agencies to simply fill out a form with Amazon to invade your privacy at their whim. No warrants or courts are involved and I did not get any notification of this when I setup this device nor do I see a way to opt-out in order to protect my right to privacy...buyer beware!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Foxy5,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2022","When I purchased Echo Studio, I bought 2 because I want to have ""Stereo Pair"" & ""All in one stereo speakers"" integrated with Alexa that can be connect to my PC, phone bluetooth and direct play my Apple Music playlist. Unfortunately that not what this product mean to be, at the end after few days trial and error, I decided to return it because:
1. Stereo pair issue with Google Nest Wifi Pro.
I'm using google nest wifi pro at home, doesn't matter you connect echo studio on main SSID wifi or guest wifi, when you try to create stereo pair, it always show that both echo stofio not in the same network, I've checked, that both have ip address in same network, same SSID, same 5Ghz band. Spent hours research and back & forth open case with google and Amazon, I found article that mention network protocol port requirements to be open, detail read this link (https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D56Q00009D6sCtSAJ/stereo-pairing-wont-work) which is google Nest Wifi Pro can't do anything to open LAN protocol port. Other solution is to use my old Asus wifi router 2.4Ghz (I keep this Asus as my backup offline unit) and connect both Echo Studios to that old Asus wifi and that solve Studio pair but this not what I want, I don't want to manage other Access point beside Google Nest Wifi Pro.
2. PC & Bluetooth connectivity issue with Studio Pair
When you connect to Echo Studio in ""Studio Pair"" mode via bluetooth or 3.5mm cable to one of Echo Studio, only that speaker that you connect have sound, this beat my purpose to have stereo when connect to my PC or phone.
3. Apple Music Playlist issue

J Davis,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2022","It is hard to separate the speaker from the integrated Alexa component.
So lets start with the speaker.
It may be bigger than you expect, but it also has really good sound. I have a decent size house and it fills the entire main floor with music. For the money, it is a very good speaker! I used the original echo for years and it was a decent speaker. This is much better.

Pros: Good speaker quality and clarity
Good value for the quality of the speaker
Alexa integration (but that will be a con too in a minute)

Cons:
The status light ring is recessed so when you talk to alexa you don't always know if the Echo is hearing you because the light indicator is not visible like it is on most other echo's. It has a light indicator recessed on the top and not visible from many angles.
There are better speakers (but not in this price range) - Again, this is a good value - quality for price
Probably overkill if you just want an echo. This is meant for someone who wants to play music, audio books, or other audio through it. Get a cheap echo if you just want an echo.

Now Alexa: Again, I've had one since they beta tested the very first echo. The problem is the Alexa app/service continues to degrade over the years. As they add more features and plug ins, the ability of Alexa to do simple things gets worse. I have 6 echos in my house and they can do less on the first try today, than they could on day one of the echo beta. I constantly have to repeat myself. Alexa constantly gets commands wrong. My entire family finds ourselves yelling at an Echo/Alexa daily to get it to do a simple task like play a popular song, add an item to the shopping list, turn on/off a light, etc. Simple things. I would prefer Amazon spend more time improving the Alexa service and less time growing it at this point. It has gone from a useful, fun, easy service to almost not worth the effort. It's now like a remote with dying batteries. You tell it to change the channel, hit it several times, pop the battery out and back in to get it to work and then you repeat the process 10 minutes later.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Micah,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2021","I bought 2 echo studios and the subwoofer for the home theater feel. It took me ALOT OF TIME on the phone with customer service not only with Amazon but also with my internet provider to get it to work properly. If you are having constant disconnections from your home theater set up than I hope my review came saves you the 5 hours it took me on the phone.

First, the sound is GREAT! Not as loud as ide like. I wish I could get loud enough to feel like you’re in a club but quality of sound is competitive with that of BOSE. The Subwoofer is a MUST. Makes a great difference!

Changing Internet Settings:
1. To get these to stay connected with each other through the home studio set up you may have to make changes to your internet settings.
2. I have AT&T internet and they happen to have me on what’s called a “Mesh Network”. A mesh network combines your 2.4G radio frequencies and your 5.0G frequencies with each other on one network name. If you have this too, than some of your speakers make pick up the 2.4G signal when another one may be on the 5.0G which will disconnect them from each other everyday and even cause a lot of lag.
3. To fix a mesh network, call your internet provider and have them separate your networks. One being 5.0G and the other being 2.4G. Now when you search your networks, you won’t just see one; you will see two to choose from.
4. I chose my speakers to all be on the 5.0G network as the 2.4G was too slow for them and they lagged. Your fire stick also must be connected to the same network as the speakers and 5.0 will allow for faster streaming as well.
5. AT&T also said that having the passwords different from the two networks can cause lag. I don’t know why this was the case but we ended up having to make my passwords the same for both networks. Also, AT&T did not charge me for any of this as this was all done over the phone.
6. The following is a message from Amazon customer support with some other settings I had changed or checked on:
A. We require that the customer have TCP ports 55442, 55443 open to traffic on their Local Area Network (LAN). They do not need to be opened to the general internet.
B. We also require UDP port 55444 to be open on the Local Area Network. This also does not need to be exposed to the general internet.
C. We also require that devices in a cluster be on the same subnet and that they can communicate with each other. On some routers, this requires the devices to be on the same WiFi network (2.4Ghz vs. 5Ghz) since the two wifi networks are firewalled from each other.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon did come up with a partial solution, which was to remove it from the ""room"" that it was tied to. Which, while that did help, then causes me issues when trying to use it to play music to all speakers in a room.

Dane Miller,"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2023","I love the sound quality and the bass, and only have minor critiques.

While music is synchronized perfectly between this and my 4th gen Echo devices, announcements are not, and results in announcements having a weird sort of ""echo"" that can make them harder to understand.

Sometimes when I give a command in another room, the microphone on the Echo studio decides that I'm in the living room, and replies to me through a wall. I'm guessing that it's because it has a better microphone than my 4th gen Echoes, so it misjudges which device I am standing closest to.

I have some slight connectivity issues when I try to use Bluetooth to connect to my Samsung TV (one that does not have the Alexa app on it). If I tell the device to connect, it often declares failure before I can hit confirm on the TV remote, or it connects but doesn't play any sound.
I found that I am able to solve this by initiating the Bluetooth connection from the TV instead of using a voice command from the Echo device. A little annoying, but I programmed a remote to navigate to that menu using a routine, so that's not a huge issue.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I have to connect it to my Fire TV stick because the Alexa app will not pair the Fire TV with the Studio. So the resulting sound is OK but, it's loosing Dolby quality in the connection. I'm hoping to get a couple of Echo Dots soon and hopefully they will finally pair correctly.

The sound quality is amazing. It filled living room with a like and sound better than the Bose Wave Radio. I've been a Bose fan for years owning three of their products now and I can say I'm beyond impressed how room filling the sound is. I took the Studio to work in a large automotive parts room with higher than 18 foot ceilings. It managed to fill every part of the room around corners and such. The bass is also very good for the size speaker that it is. I'm not convinced one would really need a the Echo Sub speaker. Only reason I could see the need is because the frequency ranges in the very low hertz range is lacking. Deep bass testing tracks show what missing and it goes from sounding great with bass to the sound almost disappears.

CJ,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2022","Worthy of 5 stars for the sound quality, excellent bang for the money. Left & Right Studio and a Sun on the floor. Fills my media room and has just enough rumble. Great inexpensive alternative.

Setup was fairly straight forward. Received both studios a day before the sun and set them up in a matter of minutes and had them paired to my 4K fire stick on the projector. Sun came in the next day, and setup became difficult. Had to reconnect each one several times and pair in the correct order to make it work. Once done, worked great.

Then the next day came, and there was no sound… Went through the whole process again, resetting, unpairing, repairing. Seems to be a flaw that once you unpair, you have to roam around your house waiting for the app to tell you you are ready to pair again… Got it going 45 minutes later

4th day, no sound, devices not connected again. Lots of internet searching later, come to find out the problem lies with HOW they are connected.

If you are on a mesh system for your home network, make sure all the devices in the home theater group (fire tv/stick/cube, studio(s), and sub) are all on the same mesh node AND the same frequency. Had to create a guest network dedicated to 2.4 and turn the 2.4 off on main network. Then go into each device and turn of mesh roaming so they don’t change addresses and “lose” each other.

Took nearly a week, but seems to be solid so far. While the lack of paperwork with Amazon devices is nice, sometimes it’s nice to have a physical troubleshooting guide.

Update: 30 days later…

Brian,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2022","As the title states, let me start off with the Pros: The sound quality is amazing, I have it on my nightstand since I listen to music to sleep and can still feel the bass. It has 3D audio and you can also fine tune the sound thanks to the equalizer option. It can be paired with the echo sub and another studio for the ultimate home studio. It can pair to my phone using spotify to play music or can use Bluetooth for anything else.

Cons: It. Is. So. Buggy. I used to have an echo dot, that had its bugs, but I found work arounds or just said dismissed it since it was a gift. Where are the bugs? Oh boy here we go. Amazon Music is unusable on Alexa. Everytime I try to use it on my Alexa, it freaks out and stops working altogether and eventually freezes. Unfortunate since I can't take advantage of the Dolby sound features. Another issue is when I use Alexa for anything, whether playing music, asking general questions or telling it to turn on/off devices with the smart plug. Half the time Alexa keeps the mic open after I give it a command, which then proceeds to blast with the same prompt every time ""I'm sorry, I'm having trouble understanding right now"" Connecting Bluetooth sometimes results in it suddenly disconnecting, then reconnecting and not working properly.

Overall, when the Echo Studio works properly, the sound quality is amazing, especially with the 3D audio features and the ability to customize the equalizer. Just be wary and patient when the bugs *do* appear.",4.0 out of 5 stars

PRO’s
At higher volume, and with the enhanced music, the sound is very solid. The bass is powerful, strong, little noticeable distortion if at all. But that’s at higher volume and after tweaking the bass, mid, and treble settings a bit in the EQ.
Like the other Echo devices, it’s well made, solid, high quality build.
CON’s
At lower volume or just easy listening as background music, it’s very tinny, loses the bass, and has a somewhat hollow sound. Compared side by side to the Echo 2nd gen with premium sound and even the older Echo with the built in hub, the Echo Studio sounds very inferior at lower volume, across a various spectrum of musical genres. The Echo 2nd gen with premium at lower volume sounds rich, with great low bass and clear highs.
Raise the volume on both the Studio and the 2nd gen, the studio starts to kick far better. That’s when it surpasses. BUT, if you want to play music say at volume 5 or 6 the older Echo is much much better. If you want to crank music up to 7 and above the Echo Studio is the way to go. Aside from that’s it’s really mediocre at volume 5/6 and below.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I was planning to use the Eco Studio to provide a source of audio including Dolby Atmos for connecting Amazon Music Unlimited to my stand-along stereo amplifier which is old school not wi-fi or Bluetooth enabled. I ended up using my phone to do the same thing for free. I'm sure the Eco Studio does well for its intended purpose, but this is not what I wanted. Unfortunate assumption on my part.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Tim,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2020","The Echo Studio is a pretty good sounding smart speaker for the price and size. I like many things about this speaker, but it could've been better. So far the smart home hub feature has not worked for the three Phillips hue bulbs I own. I use to have a phillips hub but returned it when I got an Echo Plus. I sold that Echo last year and haven't had a way to control my smart bulbs since then. I am disappointed to say the Echo Studio does not work as a hub for my lights. There is a chance they are all malfunctioning or it is an operator error. As far as voice commands go, I recommend putting it about 12 inches away from any walls or solid objects. Since the speaker has 360 sound it will echo (pun intended) back to the mics and require you to pretty much yell to get Alexa to respond. I originally had it next to a wall and had experienced this so I can say for sure the speaker responds better being at least 12 inches from walls. The last thing I can think of that I really wanted but didn't get with this model is the ability to measure inside temperature like the Echo Plus does. I mean come on, really? I would have paid the extra 25 dollars for this convenience and to he honest I expect this feature from a semi high end speaker. You probably are wondering about the speaker sound at this point. It sounds great honestly. It is truly like a miniature home theater system with out the true stereo quality you get from surround sound speakers. There is a significant amount of bass and it actually blends well with the mids and highs. I can feel it vibrate my floor, but I should mention we have raised floors which are better at transmitting the vibrations than a concrete floor. I would give this speaker 5 stars had the hub feature actually worked and if it came with the ability to measure inside temperature like the Echo Plus. One last thing is not part of the review but more of a suggestion; if you get the Echo Studio, do yourself a favor and subscribe to music HD. I got my first month for half the cost which will normally run you 14.99/month for the cheaper subscription. The sound difference between regular Prime Music and the HD subscription is kind of like the difference between a regular speaker vs bass boosted headphones. Everything sounds more balanced and clear and you hear the sounds you normally only hear with a pair of headphones or a high quality speaker!",4.0 out of 5 stars
L. Murray,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2020","I have pretty much all the Amazon/Echo devices....actually more than my living space requires or needs. My favorite Echo device is still the original 1st generation hub, I was one of the beta testers to use it so we have 5 years of history together. Great sound, sensitive voice recognition, has never missed a beat and is still going strong. But I bought into the 3D audio high-fidelity hype and purchased the Studio to replace my original Echo in the living room.

The Studio is OK, meh, just OK for me. I am not an audiophile so I can't comment on the highs/mids/bass or begin to understand Dolby Atmos technology, you can read the many other reviews for that info. I do however subscribe to Amazon Music so I enjoy streaming music low in the background during my day to day routine or Alexa responding to one of many commands/questions I ask of her each day. Audio texting with my friends (also who all own Echos) is a hoot!

To tell the truth I really feel that my original had just as good sound, maybe not the deep tones but this Studio was not worth spending the extra money for, glad I got it at sale price. I also find it drops wifi frequently (never had that issue before) or I will look up to see the blue ring rotating around and around for no apparent reason and you also have to abide by the Studio space requirements. I think the spoken word is a little muddier, not as crisp, with the Studio (hard to explain). I, at times, have to repeat commands or yell at the Studio to turn on/off lights so I don't think this device is as sensitive to my voice like the original is. I seem to get a little bit more frustrated with using this unit. AND was pretty bummed to discover that the Echo volume remote does not work with this unit either! What the heck! It's an audio device that should have a remote volume control.

I mean I am going to keep it but this is not going to be an Echo device that I will be recommending to family or friends. I just think that some of the other Echo devices have decent enough audio quality, for the average person, uses a smaller foot print that can be placed pretty much anywhere in a room.",4.0 out of 5 stars
LJAY,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2020","Let's just say I've been. Waiting some time deciding what I want as a home audio system. Sonos products look and sound great but I ultimately decided to go with the 3D studio for the more bass sound over highs. I think the studio offers a good balance that's adjustable enough ( we'll come back to these said adjustments in a minute) to get the highs, why not as crisp as Sonos, pretty close indeed.

Ok so let's be clear, the easy setup that I watched tons of videos before the product arrived wasn't easy. Yes it connected to WiFi and adjusted based on the placement of my room but getting it connected to my fire TV was almost a phone call away to tech support. Actually I was on the phone waiting for tech support when I somehow miraculously connected it. It's a moment you will realize as a Firestick 4k owner that your Firestick does not update it's software automatically.

The speaker itself is a little bulky but honestly it makes it look more of a beast than the Sonos product I was considering. The one deciding point was the ability to connect other Bluetooth devices directly to the speaker and I'm glad I did. That feature is the most useful as someone using a phone, tablet, computer and fire TV to listen to music or watch movies it switches effortlessly between whatever audio I decide to play.

The audio setting which allows some tweaking to the bass, treble and mids is probably my only complain for the moment. I definitely think there's limited options for adjustments for the echo studio. There should be some pre-sets to assist with adjustments for movies, music and games. There definitely should be a way to adjust the individual tweeter's that create the 3D sound, that by the way you don't get to hear unless you subscribe to Amazon music service. The surround sound provided by the stereo spacial enhancement does help to mimic that pretty good. Also note adding thrid party software such as the Dolby and Atmos on my PC when using this device showed great improvement. It's unfortunate I can't carry that over to my Firestick and some other devices. My other complaint which I will contact support about is when I adjust the few setting options they give me it doesn't save and keep it. At some point when I open settings option again it resets back to it's original options.

Overall I enjoy the speaker and can't wait to purchase the subwoofer and a additional echo studio to complete the ultimate home audio.",4.0 out of 5 stars

pat,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2021","for me the echo Studio is genuinely a personal assistant. But it sound quality is such that I find myself listening to my favorite music. Alexa does so many things it would be impractical for me to go into all of it but one of the things I like is its ability to learn or should I say it adds more things that it can do for instance I was complaining to myself that I have to say Alexa for every single question it started getting annoying lo and behold 2 months into owning her she asks would I like to enable the multiple questions mode which means I can continue asking her without saying her name as many questions as I'd like the machine offers many opportunities for this type of situation as you get used to it like practicing martial arts the teacher keeps adding more things that you can do I highly recommend this piece of equipment even if you're going to college or you just want to get smarter about your everyday things for instance I am learning the phonetic alphabet, alpha, bravo, charlie, Etc. I'm also learning the periodic table. Obviously Alexa is teaching me all of this and they add many many things as time goes on for instance at the time of this they haven't added it but they told me it would be ready in another month sodoku I'm assuming that they meant audio sodoku I don't know but that should be interesting now for the bad unfortunately she has 10% cannot understand what I'm saying that might not sound like much but if you ask the same question a half a dozen different ways and you still don't get the answer you're looking for it can be annoying the only caveat from that is sometimes when she doesn't understand I learn something new and that'll take me down another road and I'll ask questions about it do yourself a service go online and look up dozens of people tricks that you can do with Alexa and things you can do the more people you watch and learn from and as she teaches you your mind will truly be blown from this machine!",4.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2020","Updated: This thing is so weird, but wonderful when it clicks. Positioning seems vital. By accident I found that *under* my coffee table in my very windowed back porch somehow works amazingly for 3D music. Abbey Road was like having the Beatles doing a private concert in my back porch. Seriously. And really weird: they were standing on the opposite side of the Echo from me playing towards me. Crazy, amazing positioning. I could sense how tall John was as he sang and played to me. One of the best music reproduction experiences I've ever had. Keeping it. Sound quality was kinda loose, but good enough. My main stereo is Linn and Paradigm positioned well and doing room correction for my listening position. That set up is way better than the Echo for sheer quality. But that 3D imaging of the Echo was crazy, and the loose quality of the sound fed into that sense of a live concert, like a small club with questionable sound, the real deal. Maybe a fancy Atmos set up would sound better with the same 3D effect, but I'm not going mess with success and I'll leave the Echo in this horrible spot that somehow makes it kill.

Original review:
Throws gross special effects at the sound, which 80% of the time are horrible, like a 14 year-old discovering makeup. It works freakishly well for solo classical guitar recordings, but that's not enough for me to keep it. Bands/rock becomes a huge mess, like an amateur juggler trying to practice new moves and doing them badly. The spacial enhancement feature is really awful most of the time, it seems to just put a ton of bad reverb and delay on there to seemingly try to make things sound grandiose and epic. It might work for someone's taste, I like my music playback equipment to help me hear what the musician and producers intended, not what a computer science major playing with new functions wants to play with. I'll leave my audio equipment to the pros, not to Amazon. I did not test it for Dolby Atmos, maybe it works as a fairly cheap movie soundbar kind of thing. It's fine for background music at low volume. But for focused listening, it's mostly a mess. Plus, I hate the lights, distraxcting. There might be a way to turn them off. Oh, the Alexa app-Amazon Music-Echo integration is great.",4.0 out of 5 stars

J. Thompson,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2020","I purchased the Echo Studio to kill multiple birds with one stone: to replace a Gen 1 Echo, serve as a soundbar for my bedroom TV, as a smart home hub, and to serve as the master bedroom speaker group with my Fire Stick 4k. I chose this over an Alexa enabled soundbar because it was offered at a discount with a bundled Echo Show 5 and Hue smart bulb.

Pros-It does provide very good sound quality. I would rate it a 4.5. The only drawback in that department is that, at least in my application, the dolby atmos affect is hard to notice. It could be my room or the content I watch, so it's not quite a con in my book. Otherwise, it does all of the things you'd expect an Echo device to do in the ways you'd expect it to do them.

Cons-Normally it would only work as a soundbar when you're watching content from specific devices (like my Fire Stick 4k), but there's a mini-optical line in port that allows you to connect it to a television with an optical out with the proper cable. In my case, it would stop playing this port's signal at least once a day. Suddenly, for the past week it stopped this behavior and I thought an update may have fixed the problem. But alas, it happened again last night. Unplugging and replugging the unit is the only way I've been able to correct the problem. The other major issue is that it is out of sync with my Fire Stick, and not even the lip sync tool can adequately correct the problem. It seems like this should be a relatively easy fix with today's technology.

So as an Echo device only, I would rate the Studio a solid 4.5 overall. But as a replacement for a soundbar (which is clearly an intended purpose of this device, which can even be paired with another Studio and Echo sub in a 2.1 system), I'd rate it somewhere around a 3.5. If they were to fix what I assume are two software issues, I would wholeheartedly recommend it as a soundbar as well!",4.0 out of 5 stars

J Pearson,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2019","The Echo Studio sounds great; I had two paired for stereo and quite enjoyed what I heard. However, when linked to my 2nd generation Fire TV Cube the pair produced only stuttering, distorted noise. The problem turned out to be an apparent defect with one of the Studios; it sounded no better linked alone to the Cube than it did as part of a stereo pair. That one has already been returned. Now, the other Studio sounds fine with the Cube - apart from the very occasional and very annoying drop-out during playback. Also, I notice that when playing the ""Best of 3D"" playlist from Amazon HD every song cuts off just before its end. This happens only when the Studio is playing from a verbal command. It doesn't happen when the same music is played in conjunction with the Amazon HD app on the Cube, nor does it happen with other playlists. Another odd thing - when paired with one Studio or two, for surround sound the Cube defaults to ""Always Dolby Digital Plus"", and this setting cannot be adjusted. ??? Note that all updates were and continue to be applied to every device. I have another Studio due to arrive tomorrow. Hoping to hear then what all those writing rave reviews have heard. If not, I'll hold on to both as long as I can in hopes future updates will remedy all problems.

Update: After replacing the defective Studio and linking the new one with its counterpart and the the Fire Cube, things are looking up. The Studios are playing music and movies in sync with the Cube, and they sound great. The Cube still defaults to """"Always Dolby Digital Plus"", though, which can't be right. So, I've upgraded the rating to four stars in hopes future updates will remedy remaining issues.

Update 2: Amazon has lately issued updates to the Fire Cube at the rate of one approximately every 2-3 days. Today both the Cube and the Studio received updates. And, voila! The Cube is no longer limited to DD+ when linked to the Studios. Amazon's attention to remedying problems with newly released product is creditable. One can't help but wish they'd work out more bugs beforehand rather than rushing stuff out, though.",4.0 out of 5 stars

My family listens to music fairly often on our Echo Dot in the kitchen while cooking, doing chores, etc., so I thought is was worth getting something nicer that still served as our Alexa. The reviews were somewhat mixed but most people said it was night and day between a typical Echo and the Studio. It is certainly better but I expected much more from the Studio, especially considering the decent size standalone subwoofer. On a scale of the Dot being a 1 and a decent stereo system with AVR and dedicated 10"" sub being a 10, I would put the Studio/Sub combo at about a 3, or possibly a 4 in terms of audio quality. While it is certainly better than a Dot, it is still closer to the Dot than an actual audio system. I've had boom boxes and PC speaker/sub combos that have sounded better.

Scott Millard,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2022","I love that this product will sync to you fire tv or stick as long as you have paid Amazon lately for a new Fire TV or Stick. If you have not, the most you can do is use it like a giant over sized Echo Dot. It will only do one or the other, that is, act as a surround sound for your Fire TV or Stick Or bluetooth speaker for your device. If you have it in use as Surround sound and then try to use it as a speaker for your device, it has to be resynced to the fire stick, to resume as surround sound. Sometimes that is easy, and sometimes you wish you'd have just put your ear buds in. There software sucks, and it is highly, ""Buy More"" alexa device centric.

But it is a double edged sword. If this speaker was backward compatible, you might stick with your already paid for, years old stick, instead of buying the much improved 4K Fire Stick Max. You will have to decide.

Though the speaker is compatible with Fire Stick TV Max, it is not compatible, as a surround device for Apple TV or any other set top box. But why would Amazon do that?......................

BoogieNYC,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2020","I prioritize sound quality over convenience so please consider that while reading this review.

The Studio is a heavy, solid speaker that has some serious electronic power and heft behind it. It's not quite on par with Sonos offerings but it's relatively straightforward and integrated Alexa make it more useful than a Sonos option. I have a Sonos Beam (an integrated center channel, Alexa-enabled streaming speaker) which is a great option as well -- but for more money and a much larger footprint it should be.

The Studio is a bit unusual looking -- but my goal is what it sounds like. And when it wails it does so very well. I don't tinker with 3D sound -- seems like a gimmick to me -- but the truth is I think the sound quality is more than adequate just streaming Spotify, Pandora and whatever else you might find to be worth playing. The main issue I find is that when it's rolling it doesn't respond well to Alexa voice commands. Worse, when I ask Alexa for track info for a song that's playing, the response is too quiet to be audible and requires a repeat or tinkering with the volume. So either the music itself is too loud or the interruption -- eg ""Alexa, who is this?"" -- is too quiet. Frustrating.

Given this is a relatively new product, it's acceptable but still something I would prefer to have already been resolved.

The good news is I had no problems integrating this in my smart switches at home -- lighting, my Dyson air purifier, my alarms, etc. -- and that was a plus. I'd definitely buy this again and have no qualms recommending it to potential buyers. I also like the fact the Alexa app allows users to customize their sonic experience. A work in progress, and I believe it will improve -- right now it's not quite there but even if it stays as is I am glad I added this to my home setup.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Icefalken,"Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2020","I purchased 2 of these fantastic speakers because I wanted to enjoy the Stereo Home Theater effect they can do. Setup was a bit tricky but calling into the help line took care of it pretty fast.

The sound quality is really something to behold. I was able to go into a Best Buy to listen to it and compare it to other smart speakers. The 3D audio was what impressed me the most, even when compared to the Bose 500, especially when you consider the large price difference between them! I do realize however, that most audio, in music or movies, is not in 3D at this time.

Even so, there have been a few times the sound effect sounded like it moved to the side or suddenly moved behind me. So, awesome.

The voice recognition through the built-in microphones are very good and no matter what part of the room I am in, they seem to hear me clearly almost each and every time.

There was one thing I was disappointed in. I have the speakers connected to my Fire Stick 4K and was hoping the Alexa assistant in the speakers themselves would have been able to do each and every function the remote control was able to do, but it cannot. I was hoping to never need the Fire Stick remote but certain functions such as, TV input changing, are not available.

I added the Samuel Jackson voice to the speakers and totally love it. While not for everyone, I find the humor and more, ""adult"" conversation to be a definite improvement to the voice control. I'm hoping it will be expanded to give it all the same controls the Alexa voice has.

Overall, I am very happy with these smart speakers and plan to add the sub woofer very soon.",4.0 out of 5 stars
LaC Family,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2019","Pro: the sound quality is very good.

Hooked it up with both a line-in 3.5mm cable as well as blue tooth and both sounded very good.

Bass is above average if not phenomenal, but overall I’m very satisfied with songs, movies and even Alexa. She sounds more natural and warm with this Echo.

Pro: look and feel are high quality

This speaker is heavier than you would think at first glance, especially for its size. It’s not especially compact but it’s smaller than I expected. I like the white light that displays the current volume level.

Con: horrible setup procedure

After powering it up, the instructions say to open my Alexa app on iOS and follow instructions. Nothing appeared. Had to manually add it.

After manually adding it, It was not clear AT ALL how to use it with my Fire TV Stick 4K. Was I supposed to pair it via BlueTooth? Was I supposed to add “Fire TV” streaming service to it so I can allow Alexa to control the Fire Stick TV *through* the Echo Studio? After literally hours of searching the Internet I learned you had to go into the Devices section, click the + button in the upper right and select “Setup Home Theater”. What?! That’s not even intuitive! Even then I had to deregister my Echo Studio and re-add it because the first time I set it up, like most people, I followed standard prompts and added it to a group. But for some reason doing that didn’t let me select it later as part of a home theater. So my advice: be patient, it’s unlikely you’ll get it right the first time.

Overall: if Amazon included clear instructions, or even a link to helpful tips. That would be one thing. But even if you Google “set up echo studio with Fire TV” you will get a dozen Amazon links, none of them pointing you how to “setup a home theater” under the Devices section.

Finally: you’ll want to get the Fire TV remote with volume control. That allows very easy manipulation of the Studio’s volume which is SO much better than constantly asking Alexa to change the volume during a show.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Jonathan D. Busby,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2022","If you have an Echo with high quality audio ( or an Echo paired with external speakers ) then this is a must have. Without a sub-woofer you're really missing out on the auditory experience.

I first had an Echo Sub paired with a 1st generation Echo. While the sound quality was greatly enhanced, there were some problems. Specifically, when I asked my Echo to play a song, the Echo Sub would start up first but the Echo itself would be silent for a little while while the light ring displayed a pattern. Sometimes the Echo itself would *never* start producing audio. When this started, I'd have to cycle power to the Echo. When I bought an Echo Studio, I didn't have the above problem with sound only coming out of the Echo Sub, but, when I told my Echo Studio to eg. ""resume playback"" there'd be a slight delay where sound would only come out of the Echo sub.

As for the Echo Sub itself, it sounds a bit directional to me but that may be due to the geometry of the room in which it's placed. Also, it sounds as if the crossover frequency is a bit low.

All in all though, I can't imagine going back to a setup without a sub-woofer and I highly recommend the Echo Sub.",4.0 out of 5 stars

DrP,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2021","Pros: The voice recognition works very well - even from across a large room. The design is able to blend in with almost any decor. While the largest of the Echo devices, it still fit on our mantle with room to spare. The power supply is built in - there is no external brick to deal with - just plug it into the outlet. The pre-configuration option at purchase makes the setup from out of the box to playing music less than 5 minutes.

The Cons: While significantly better than all other Echo devices, the sound is not “blow me away” “amazing”. If you have only listened to your music using iBuds or bad headphones, you may be amazed. This doesn’t replace the multi-speaker surround-sound capable receiver/amplifier setup tuned to the listening space. Placement definitely impacts the sound quality. The tonal adjustment via the Alexa app is disappointing - just three points and on/off for the spatial enhancement. There should be at least 5 points a a variable spatial enhancement setting. The light ring is only visible from the top of the device - if it is above your line of sight, you can’t see if Alexa is responding/waiting/notifying/off-line.

All that being said, what you get for the price is an amazing value and a huge convenience - which includes some trade offs. It does sound very good if placed properly in the room (yes, it “reads” the room acoustics, but the adjustments it makes are limited). The device is well built, looks good, and works well. Hopefully Amazon makes it better with updates to firmware and the Alexa app.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2019","The Echo Studio is a quantum leap from any other speaker that Amazon has produced to date. Everything else sounds like a transistor radio in comparison. The sound separation is fantastic and you can actually feel the bass at higher volume levels.
There a couple of issues, however. The vaunted 3D sound is a waste on anything other than the songs that are specifically set up for it. DO NOT use it as a default setting. The music that is not 3D will sound muddy and the vocals will be lost in the mix. However, if you turn it off, the music will immediately brighten and the vocals will be clear and crisp. There are a lot of online reviews where they claim that the clarity of the vocals is lacking. That is because they were early reviews and took place before you could turn off the Spatial enhancement option. Second, if you combine the speaker in a group or as stereo pair, playing the amazon music app causes songs to stop playing at random and skip to the next song. I have read online where it stops playing altogether for some people. It does not happen when just playing though a single speaker. I have not experienced the problem, as yet, when playing through the alexa app. However the Alexa app navigation leaves something to be desired. Also the Alexa app doesn’t show the quality of the track that’s playing.
Ok, issues out of the way, I have 2 of the Echo Studio paired for stereo and the sound is a revelation. Listening to the White Album in Ultra HD reveals melodies and instrumentation that I’ve never heard before. The clarity of the voices is amazing. It’s like listening to it for the first time. The 3D tracks sound great as well. There is a massive sound stage. The music really does envelop you. It’s not the same as surround sound. So those looking to relive the days of 5.1 SACD and DVD-HD will be disappointed. It’s impossible to get the same effect from one or two speakers. You won’t hear discrete sounds from behind you, but instead you get a full range from in front of you. It’s difference between sitting the front row for a concert (Echo Studio) and sitting on stage in the middle of the orchestra (5.1 surround). I haven’t tried out the pair for fireTV as yet. The current options for Dolby Atmos are limited and I’ve already watched the new season of Jack Ryan, but I may try this at some point in the future.
The amazon credit for turning in an old Echo, sealed the deal on getting the second Studio. The wait for a second one was too long from Amazon, so I got it at Best Buy. They also participate in the Echo buy back program. So, I turned in an old echo dot and got 25% off the new studio (the discount is the same regardless of which echo you turn in), along with a $5 credit. So instead of $219 (with tax), I got the second studio for $155 (with tax). Great deal and with the discount it’s about the same price as an Echo Plus.
The size may be an issue to some, but it wasn’t with me. In order to accommodate 5 speakers, there is no way for it fit into the same space as the Plus. The space is really need to fit the subwoofer and it certainly makes a difference.
So my final thoughts: It’s a fantastic speaker. Much better than anything else you can get from Amazon. The price is right, especially if you turn in old echo dot (any echo really, but the dot is the cheapest of the bunch and you get the same discount). Don’t use the Stereo Spatial Enhancement. The songs in 3D will play that way regardless of the setting and it makes everything else sound worse (in my opinion). There may be point when Amazon releases an update to fix this, but at this point it’s worthless. I have never had a Bose or a Sonos, so I can’t compare, but I doubt anything in this price range can compete with what the Studio has to offer. If sound quality is important to you and you subscribe the Amazon HD music service (the studio is the only device Amazon offers that can play the Ultra HD music in full 24/196 quality), I would say run don’t walk to get one (or two) of these. You won’t regret it.

UPDATE: I did try out the Dolby Atmos feature last night. I watched some of Jack Ryan and Carnival Row. The effect was just as outstanding as the music. Wide sound stage and clear, crisp dialogue. I do think that for watching movies the subwoofer might be a good addition. The bass was definitely present, but I think that the subwoofer would add some welcome bottom to the sound field (Perhaps that will be a Black Friday/Christmas purchase). The setup was fairly simple after restarting the 4K firestick. Initially the firestick was greyed out in the Alexa app, but after a restart it showed up. Set up involved just following the instructions after that.
As stated before, there are very few options to watch Dolby atmos enabled content on Amazon. It does not allow it from Netflix, and as of yet, does not have the option for the Disney+. Hopefully that will change at some point in the near future (although I’m not holding my breath). However, since my main reason for buying the Studio in the first place was for music playback, I see the Atmos option as an added bonus.

Update 2: they have fixed spatial enhancement mode! It sounds fantastic. If you toggle between the two modes, you can actually hear the sound field shrink. It's now very worthwhile. Also I added a sub to the mix and it does wonders for the sound. If you are using the studio in the kitchen or a home office, one will work spectacularly. If you are using it in a living room or large space then 2 with a sub is the way to go. The sub adds so much depth when you are listening in a larger space. Currently playing through the app is a problem but voice commands still work fine.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bryon L.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2024","I purchased two of the Echo Studios with the Echo Sub, so I write this review with all 3 devices. Also, keep in mind this setup is best completed with the Amazon Fire TV 4k streaming stick or I am sure the Fire TV Cube would work just as well. I was a little frustrated when I first setup the Echo Studios and Echo sub because I was trying to make it all work without the Fire TV 4k Streaming stick. I already had the streaming stick, but just didn't think to configure this setup through the fire stick. Once I setup the two studios and sub in theatre mode through the Fire TV Stick settings, it immediately made the audio work amazing from the TV. Also, once I setup the Fire TV stick to run the audio, it also made it so my other HDMI cables plugged into my TV also ran through the studios and echo sub. We were watching a movie the other night and my son asked me to turn it down because the audio was so loud. So this setup will give you great sound once you have it setup correctly and it reduces the amount of space needed for your audio system. So if you want a great sounding system that takes up a lot less foot print in your room, then this is the way to go.

All you do is plug the studios in first and make sure they are both online. Once online turn on your Echo sub and wait until it is online as well. Once they are all online, you will want to go to the Alexa App and go to devices and click the + in the top right corner and create a group. You will want to select the Theatre option and add the two studios and sub to the group and save your setup. Here is some instructions that I followed to make sure everything was setup correctly and in the right order. Hope this review helps!

Steve Pugliese,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2019","There will be plenty of reviews for the Studio in stand alone, single speaker use. It does sound excellent that way. But if you pair two Studios and throw in the Echo Sub, that is an extraordinary composition! That is the way to do the Echo Studio! That is how I'll review it here.

I decided I must pair two Studios since I had two Echo Plus's stereo paired with an Echo Sub and it sounded pretty darn good. So I had to try the Studio paired in stereo, and since I had the Sub, I threw that in too. What else am I going to do with it? The Sub added a lot to the two Plus's. I wondered would you even notice it with the two Studios? I'm here to say that you definitely notice it. You notice it's not there, I can tell you.

The sound of this whole system (two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub) is quite exceptional. I would have to say it's thrilling! Yes, it costs $530 but that is bound to come down and did I tell you that it sounds incredible? It commands a respect, it really does. There is such a depth to this. The bass is deliberate and authoritative. Very punchy. It has exceptional dynamic range (at high volumes this can be startling) and the stereo image is just stunning. An enormous stage. Those 6 midrange speakers sound sweet indeed. Be sure to turn everything up in the equalizer in Audio Settings of the device in the Alexa App. This thing likes loud! It can easily handle max volume for extensive listening.

You crank this up to ten and it literally takes over the room. If you can listen at that volume for awhile with this system (you must live without neighbors) you will be found with a huge smile on your face.

All of Amazon's music library is now available in lossless CD quality streaming or better, which shines on this. The new celebrated 3D formats also sound excellent, though I thought there'd be more to them (Abbey Road sounded great but I didn't think it was transformed). But anything you play on this will sound exceptional. I really can't believe Amazon has taken it this far from the original Echo. Bravo! I notice that the Apple Homepod is now down to $200 at Best Buy. Would two of them paired sound better than this setup? I truly doubt it. They'd need a subwoofer and none, as far as I know, are available for it.

A few things. The circling Alexa lights are now on top of the speaker. You can no longer really see them from the side, which is unfortunate. I love those lights! And two, the Studio comes with this ""spatial"" setting set. I recommend turning it off. In the Alexa app, go to the device and then Audio Settings and below the equalizer is that on off button for the spatial effect. I don't find it adds anything even though it really changes the acoustics. But if you want to hear music as it was recorded, leave this off.

Oh, and I have to say that Amazon still does not make it super easy to set this all up. You have to start with a new or deregistered speaker. Set up each separately and then pair them. But it's anything but obvious or close to foolproof. Come on, Amazon!

And I feel I must tell you that you can't connect to the Studio by Bluetooth when stereo paired. It will only play through one Studio, the first one you set up. To use the Studios in stereo pair with the Echo Sub, you can only stream. And you can only stream if you pay.

Finally, then, these things are big. Really quite large. And seemingly only available now in black, though there's a gray one in Amazon's web site ads. This is not a speaker that sits demurely upon a table. It's almost as big as the Echo Sub, if that helps visualize it. But you will definitely be challenged as to its home, because that is where this will stay, like forever. Especially if you go for the whole magilla. But I urge you to at least try it (the whole magilla!). But be prepared, I guarantee you won't send them back!

UPDATE: After a software update, the Spatial effect is now the preferred way, so leave it on. Turning it off now makes the music too flat. I think it may even turn off one of the mid range speakers. But something's missing!

ADDENDUM:

After two years, these still shine as brightly as ever. But the thing that must be emphasized is that this system of two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub is designed to take full advantage of Amazon Music’s HD streaming service, since these can work together only with streamed audio. Using that enables you to get at least CD quality audio recorded in lossless FLAC files (what Amazon calls HD, 16-bit/44.1kHz) for everything in the catalog, and Ultra HD (up to 24-bit/192kHz) available on an ever-growing list of recordings. In addition, it is also capable of playing Amazon’s (admittedly still in limited quantity) so called 3D Audio recordings (Amazon Music supports Dolby Atmos and Sony 360 Reality Audio spatial audio formats). If you don’t get the Amazon Music HD package ($12.99 monthly with Prime / $14.99 without), then you will be missing out on what these speakers are designed to deliver. Amazon’s Ultra HD music must be heard on a system that supports it to be appreciated. It truly is something else in audio quality, significantly better sounding than any CD or LP. And Amazon Music’s catalog is growing by leaps and bounds every month. It is currently quite vast, even its Classical Music selection which has exploded in the two years since the Echo Studio was introduced.

Using the Amazon Echo Link ($140), you could get this same quality streaming audio (or even better depending on your amp and speakers) for an existing Hi-Fi setup (at least I think you can- there seems to be some confusion about whether it supports the full 24-bit/192kHz Ultra HD), although you could not get 3D Audio with the Link. You could also use the Echo Link to attach any other sub-woofer to your Echo Studio pair but that would also require an additional amplifier thrown in. However, if you don’t have that Hi-Fi system already, these (2 paired Echo Studios and the Echo Sub) are the way to go to take full advantage of Amazon Music HD at a very favorable price. Just compare their cost to that of a good Hi-Fi system consisting of amplifier, pre-amp, two speakers and a sub-woofer as well as the Echo Link you’d need. The Echo speakers here are a definite bargain for getting excellent audio with minimal wires or fuss!",5.0 out of 5 stars
jarreeddd,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2020","Amazon really came through with this product. A few things to take into consideration:

Sound Quality:

While the sound quality is extremely good, especially given the price range, it’s definitely not on the top of the audiophile list. That being said, for the average person, this is a great speaker. It lacks luster in the mids so lyrics themselves aren’t as crisp as other high fidelity speakers on the market. However, the bass is awesome. No distortion. Also, this thing gets LOUD. Great for a house party or if you feel like rocking out.

Alexa:
While this may not be the BEST speaker out there, the Alexa integration and capability is great. The mics will pick up your voice from across the room even with music blasting. If you’re a heavy Alexa user then the great sound quality and seamless Alexa integration makes this the speaker for you. I personally run all my smart home devices through Alexa so having one more assistant in the room is great.

Size:

This speaker is chubby. Kind of looks like a chopped off robot head. It will definitely not just blend in the background. I have it on the corner of my desk 60x30 and still have plenty of room multiple screens and peripherals.

Room adaptation:

This speaker will definitely fool the room with sound. As far as the “3D Sound goes”, it’s really going to depend on the placement and structure of the room. If you place this in the corner of a room and try to listen to it from the opposite corner, you do loose some of that full sound effect. Also, the size and material of your room are going to effect the acoustics and how the sound bounces off the walls. It seems you really only get that full 3D sound effect if it’s directly in front of you and you have 4 solid walls for the sound to bounce off of. I have mine on the corner of the desk with the front speaker facing me. When I’m sitting at my desk I really get the full 3D effect. To manually reset/calibrate to a room hold down the command button for about 15 seconds.

3D MUSIC:

This speaker performs optimally when playing 3D Music from Amazon. Something to keep in mind though is that there are only about 1,000+ 3D song a offered. Who knows what the future has in store but that shouldn’t be the selling point if you’re looking at this speaker. Either way, you’re still getting great sound from any music app.

Built in Zigbee:

I don’t use any zigbee devices so I can’t comment on this. I also couldn’t figure out how it really works.

Competition:

For the same prize you could purchase a smaller Sonos One. Which one has better sound quality is up for debate but what’s lacking in the Sonos is Bluetooth connectivity. Also, the built in Alexa is limited.

Using it as a sound bar:

I personally only use this for listening to music while I’m at my desk. I can’t really see this being better than a a bar and subwoofer around the same price range or even slightly more expensive. I think it would work great with two Studio’s but then again ... there might be better options at that price range. User preference.

Summary:

I truly am impressed with this speaker and really enjoy using it. If you’re a casual music listener Like me and currently or plan to utilize Alexa, this is a great speaker. If you really want to fill the room then I would consider buying two and strategically placing them somewhere in the desired room.",5.0 out of 5 stars
REM52,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2019","(Note: This was written by me and posted elsewhere, so ignore the personal references – I have simply pasted it here so that I didn’t have to write it again!) Two regular Echo speakers paired in stereo mode don't even come close to the ear-pleasing sound that comes from two Echo Studios in stereo mode. As you said, Ty, you listened to only one Studio speaker, and some of that listening was in a surround mode. The Echo Studio does not ""shine"" with just one Studio (when playing regular stereo music files, which are the most common). Two of them paired in stereo mode sound exponentially better. I humbly ask you to reconsider your 7 rating for sound quality and change it to 9 or 10, for the benefit of potential buyers interested in purchasing high quality equipment. If using two Echo Studios in stereo mode, turn off the ""Upmixing"" toggle switch in the Alexa app. Upmixing tries to adapt 2-channel stereo music to the 3D potential of the Studio. If you don't turn off upmixing, the sound will not be that clear and direct, and you will get the wrong impression about how good these speakers really are. That is why some reviewers gave the Echo Studio a low rating when it first came out because you could not turn off the “upmixing” (Stereo Spatial Enhancement) feature, but now you can. With that feature turned on, the speaker will try to add some processing to the sound and that doesn't sound very good in stereo mode with two Studios. That processing may sound ok with one Studio, but even then it's hit-and-miss, depending on which song is playing. Up-mixing is not perfect and not best for all songs.

Comparison of the Echo Studio to the Regular Echo:
The regular $99 Echo has drivers (internal speaker units) whose sound gets somewhat trapped inside the enclosure case, as the separate woofer and tweeter drivers face each other with a small space between them (they point down and up, not out -- one pointing at the other!) instead of facing outwardly like the Echo Studio’s drivers. But the 3 midrange drivers and one tweeter inside each Echo Studio are facing outward and project the sound outside of the enclosure. That makes a big difference -- there's much more clarity and presence in the midrange and treble. It does not get muffled or trapped inside the enclosure at all; it is allowed to come out clearly and completely. I am hearing detail in songs I’ve been playing for decades -- details I’ve never heard before. Those details are clear as can be without being harsh or grating to the ears. The outward facing circular arrangement of the midrange and tweeter array act like sort of a wide-dispersion tweeter – no matter where you are standing you hear each speaker channel’s sound very clearly (ideal for when you are moving around, working in the kitchen, etc. And I am talking about stereo mode here, not a surround mode). The bass is clear and mostly tight – just right without overdoing it. And if you listen to talk radio on these, the sound (EQ) automatically adjusts itself so that the talker's voice doesn’t sound boomy (those built-in monitoring microphones work well).

Finally, it is recommended to adjust the EQ settings using the Alexa app, and set the EQ to: Bass middle (5 on the scale), Midrange boosted to about 6 or 7 out of 10, and Treble to about 8 out of 10 (this sounds best in the very small alcove that I have these speakers set up in). Use a good-sounding music file for test listening – an audio file that has never been compressed more than once, and has been encoded well, and been recorded in high quality (not necessarily a hi-res file). An excellent sounding sample to buy and use for testing purposes is Rudolf from Burl Ives’ album “Have a Holly Jolly Christmas”. Sure, it’s an old-fashioned song but it is extremely well-recorded and encoded (at least on the specific album I mentioned). You can purchase it for 99 cents on Amazon’s online digital music store if you want to have it stored in the cloud and playable on demand -- on these speakers.

Note about Setup: if you have a weak Wi-Fi signal, the slow signal from your Wi-Fi router may cause some confusing delays during setup, so if you encounter this, begin by finding a way to get an adequate signal strength to these excellent speakers. Move your router closer or maybe buy a Wi-Fi extender if your Wi-Fi signal is weak in the spot where the two Studios are located. After a minute or so of getting established, they will find their way to sync with each other and play in perfect, flawless stereo without you having to do anything after the setup.

Sucram,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2019","UPDATE
I’ve had the 2.1 setup connected to a 4K Stick for 5 months, which has been used as a sound bar/stereo in our master bedroom. From a music perspective, it sounds it’s pretty good! The sound stage is full and produces decent bass. I wish it got a little louder. I find the bass response better for music than movies (I LOVE heavy bass in action scenes). If you like heavy bass for action movies, you may be a little disappointed. .

I have, but no longer experience the connectivity issues others have written about. Mine were limited to music playback, however the issue subsided a few months ago.

I’ll address three improvement areas:
1) When connected with the sub, all the lows go through the sub and the woofers on the studios are rendered useless, unless the volume is high. The trade-off is clearer sound than when the studios are paired alone. Personally, I look at it as a design flaw. All three units should produce lows (or at least have the settings in the EQ to do so) for a better, more immersive bass experience. What good is a 5.25’ Studio driver if it won’t be used when paired?? 🤔

2) As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a lip syncing issue when used as a home theater. Depending on the source the fire stick is decoding, there can be a noticeable sound lag. I have not discovered a way to address this issue.

3) The Studios have the ability to play lossless tracks (24bit). However, paired with a Fire device (Cube, 4K stick... doesn’t matter) the output drops to 16bit, because the sound is decoded in the Fire device and played through the Studio. This simply means that fidelity/musical clarity is lost . The limitation lies within the Fire device, not the Studio. However, it’s worth mentioning because when connected to a Fire device, the Studios will be limited to the capability of the decoding device. If they’re used as a stand-alone stereo for music only, you can use the Studios to their full ability.

BOTTOM LINE
I like the setup. I already owned the Eco Sub so its cost had no bearing on my buying decision. The Studios were an add-on for me. In fairness, I came out off of pocket $240 for both Studios combined. With that said, FOR ME I find great value and functionality.

The question is, if I was to start over and pay full retail ($400 for two Studios + $130 for the sub) for a wireless stereo/sound bar system, what would I think? Could I find a better wireless Atmos Sound bar + woofer with no lip syncing issues for the money? YEP! Could I find a better wireless Smart stereo for the money? I’m not so sure! Could I find one that does both pretty well? I doubt it! Could I split the money between two decent systems, one for music and one for theater? Not why would I go do that??? I’d get one that could do multiple things.

FOR THE MONEY it’s good buy. It’s not a Sonos Playbar + Sub (which is 2x the cost) nor a B&W sound bar & Sub (which is 4x the cost). It’s good for the money.

If you can look past the intermittent lip sync issue, go for it. If that's a deal breaker, spend more and get a sound bar that also produces good music.

————————————————————

The speakers sounds great! No complaints; simple setup, quick calibration and I was off to the races.

From a price point, it's comparable to the Sonos One. From a sound quality, it far exceeds. Sonos One is probably slightly clearer, but that's where the comparisons stop. Echo Studio has a wider/fuller sound stage, more bass, gets louder. The closest comparison is probably the HomePod or Play 3. IMO, this sounds better than both.

I already own an Echo Sub and ordered an additional Studio for pairing. I have yet to connect to FireTV 4k to test the home theater setting.

In summary, this produces very good sound, the price is reasonable and it's the best smart speaker on the market... in my humble opinion...",5.0 out of 5 stars

Multi-room Music issues

I found a solution to not being able to get more than one speaker to work at a time, paired, or set up a “Multi-Room Music” in the Alexa app. This solution also fixed my inability to get Apple enabled devices connected into HomeKit, or even Google Nest Hubs to set up, period.

Quick answer: 
Deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation” when activating your 2.4 Wi-Fi broadcast on your router.

I also took all speakers off guest wifi. But I’ll try to put them back to see if that is necessary now.

Back story: 
Months of issues with HomeKit, (only weeks with Echo Multi-Room Music), I gave up trying and decided to try Alexa and Google to replace my Apple smart home efforts. I spent way too much time. After the fix, I’ll live a blended tech life. I’ll give a quick answer, followed by my backstory: 

Last week I was at my wits end in utter frustration over three major roadblocks. I acquiesced and decided to try Alexa because I couldn’t get almost any of my Apple HomeKit enabled devices into HomeKit, except for new Apple products. 

I knew it had to be something small I was missing. 

Alexa was sooooo easy and quick to connect to everything, before I figured out the fix. (I dislike the echo show advertising, their echo speakers are better.) While they seemed a breeze to connect everything, for some reason I couldn’t get more than one echo speaker to work at a time. I was continually blocked from setting up Multi-Room Music or even connect a pair to play together.  

Hundreds of tries. I deleted, reset, rebooted, spent over 4 hours with Comcast yesterday (thankfully a Boston native who did not put me on hold every minute like certain countries) getting my internet working again. I had rebooted my modem and router so many times, my computer got molasses slow and I feared I went too far

In interest I also decided to try a few Google nest hub speakers. Black Friday had great sales on all this stuff. Trying to set up googles hub 7 was impossible. It wouldn’t stay connected to the internet for more than a split second before “Something went wrong” message. Probably over 70 tries. (Google is better than Echo Show. Apple HomePod mini sounds crisper and better than Amazon echo 4 and mini 5’s. But Alexa is way friendlier to interact with verbally, and price point, well...)

Frustration. Thursday, I broke down and bought my first Apple Homepod Mini to see if I can get that working and see if it works better than the Apple TV 4k Ethernet connection. The HomePod mini gave me a hint how to solve all these l connection and internet blocks. 

The HomePod mini kept telling me that I don’t have “peer-to-peer connection” allowed on my network.

Now, I’m a little techy, but it took three days (ehem, months) to finally take a chance on a for granted setting I always enable on my netgear router. It’s the blasted first Wireless page when enabling a wifi broadcast.

I had to deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation.”

That was it. It solved every issue I have come across with smart home tech for the last 4 months, ..year.

For the months that I could not solve these problems, Amazons Multi-Player Music issue made me dig deeper. I did not find anyone suggesting this particular router setting, so I thought I’d share with ppl. 

Tonight, I finally am able to simultaneously play music on all of my Echo speakers, connect my HomeKit enabled and Google nest hubs.

I’m not sure what this will do for my/your internet security. But I’m going with it for now. And I’ll try to put all devices back onto guest Wi-Fi. I’ll never really leave Apple, but after interacting with other smart speakers, it’s probably not going to be my main go to for speaker or answers to questions. Or I’ll just get too creeped out by Google and Amazon invasiveness and acquiesce with Apple instead. 

Echo Dot 5 (this is such a sprite, great speaker!)
Echo 4
are my favorite for Amazon Echo

Echo Studio
seems the least smart, most deaf, quiet, combative, difficult to interact with, of the three speakers. Hopefully the Multi-Room music fix will improve my experience with it

Echo Show 8
Meh. Far too much and annoying advertising of non-solicited or wanted advertisements. Least user friendly screen to work with. It sits unplugged for the most part. I mostly got this for a friend who visits who wants a YouTube fireplace playing on the tv.

SIDE NOTE on other Smart Home Amazon (online, or physical store) products, related to this topic:
I have been pleased with Smartbot plugs, switches and app, the Levoit 600s air purifiers and app (app goes by VeSync), and Lutron Caséta Light Switches and Dimmers, and hub. Lutron has the most stable and reliable app out there. I was fine running their apps separately. They are very nice, better than the big 3 apps. Well, back to listening to music throughout my house instead of one or two rooms. Joy!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Andy San Diego,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2024","I've had the ""Echo 3rd gen Smart Speaker"" for 4 years, and am surprised to see it cost $99, close to the $150 I just (July 2024) paid for the subject Echo Studio (refurbished). What a big upgrade! But not to be compared with a big hi fi speaker set-up I used to have, Harman Kardon. In Ravel's Bolero, the big crash at the peak of the crescendo would actually stop my heart. I'm trying that now on the Echo Studio, but I'm sure it won't even break any glass.
Adding this edit a few days later. The companion Echo Subwoofer will arrive today. I can't wait to see what it will add. I am optimistic. I note that the Studio delivers that special sound of Italian tenors, one I can stand for only a few minutes at a time. The point I was trying to make in my original review is that the Studio does not give out that brilliant lifelike large cymbal-like deafening crash you get with a true hi fi LP player/tuner/cabinet speakers. But, coupled with Amazon Music, the Studio, hopefully augmented by the Subwoofer, is highly pleasurable. I'll update this after I try the Sub. The performance of Bolero that Alexa came up with is not the performance I had on LP with the big speakers, so that is also a factor.
Edit August 5, 2024: First, regarding the Sub, I was not able to get it going even with about an hour on the phone with Amazon Customer Service. I couldn't pair the Sub with the Studio, and had to return it. However, I picked up the tip from another review that Alexa will increase or decrease the Studio's treble and bass. I said twice, ""Alexa, turn up the bass."" And today I asked her to play J.S. Bach. Many of his compositions include solos by viola or cello, and I find the Studio's bass satisfactory. For comparison, I reset the Studio to its original settings (hold the mic button and the volume down button for 20 seconds) and I couldn't hear any difference in the bass. Both settings sound fine.
August 8, 2024 To reinforce my favorable opinion. I just listened to the entire Sibelius violin concerto with Hilary Hahn and my morning coffee, no distractions, and enjoyed it so much. My favorite piece so far.
Today will try pairing my ""Echo 3rd gen Smart Speaker"" in another part of this room, both about 20 feet from where I sit.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Patricia West,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024","This was great until a few months ago when I noticed that they would drop out and I would only hear the bass (separate unit) It would do this erratically, but it’s getting worse. You cannot reasonably expect these units to last forever. After a time, you will need to buy more and send these to the landfill. I guess that’s what Amazon wants.

Update 8/31/24: Argh, I take it back. I got new Echo Studios and the same thing happened. Finally, through trial and error, I realized that the real problem was some kind of newly developed incompatibility between the echo subwoofer and the speakers. The subwoofer would play, but the speakers would not. Now I disconnected the subwoofer and have it in my Goodwill donation box. No further Problems with the old echo studios.

From the first song, the sound was rich and full, with clear acoustics and detailed percussion that filled my living room beautifully. The Echo Studio not only plays music; it enhances every note.

Setting it up was straightforward. With the Alexa app, I easily adjusted the bass, midrange, and treble to my liking. Whether quickly calibrating or fine-tuning the settings, the Echo Studio made it simple to enjoy enhanced sound that complements my space perfectly.

Happy One,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2024","I've now had time to listen to pop, classical, and jazz on my new Alexa ""Studio"" device. I bought it WITH the Alexa studio sub-woofer because I knew I want as 'full' as experience as possible.
The old Echo Plus was displaced in my living room by the ""Studio"" and, although the whole set-up was more expensive than I would have liked, it's probably worth it! The sound is REALLY good and makes the Echo Plus (even though the Echo Plus was 'good') sound like a tin can with a string stretched to another tin can. Well, that may be extreme. But still, the Studio version just sounds GREAT! With classical music, the bass added by the sub-woofer is marvelous! To MY ears, there's so much bass in pop music anyway that the added bass seems barely worth it to me. But classical and jazz? Definitely worth it!
The set up was really simple. (Getting the Echo Plus to work in another room - which had an Echo Dot in it previously - has so far been fruitless. Nothing I've done in the app or otherwise has succeeded and I hesitate calling Amazon support because (1) I have a phone phobia and (2) that phobia was caused by agonizing attempts at phone support elsewhere.

Sami,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024","I actually ended up here to write this review because I thought they didn't make these anymore. I remember hearing about the Amazon hardware group suffering cuts last year, so when I saw this thing hasn't been axed yet, I wanted to offer my support since I have loved it for 4 years now.

I'm not an audiophile, but I care more about sound quality than your average person. Also, I'm not one of those people that has the luxury of buying 10 different products and comparing them, so my assessment is somewhat limited in that regard. But all that really matters, I think, is that this thing blew me away day one, and it's going strong 4 years later.

We have it in our main living room/kitchen/dinette which has 10 foot ceilings and is an open concept with total footprint of about 30'x20' and this thing does a very solid job of filling the room. Of course, bigger, dedicated speakers would sound better, but then you have to screw around with an AV receiver, multiple pieces, running wires (or at least power for each speaker), and trying to make it all look good. This thing looks sleek at one end of the 20'x30' room, has a single necessary cord (power), and provides impressive sound given the tight package everything is crammed in.

I understand there are other speakers out there that would sound just as good, if not better (Bose, Sonos, etc.), but I want to emphasize that this is phenomenal for the $200 price point.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Jason,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2023","My reviews are long to provide my reason for purchase, how I like it, etc...if you don't care for all that...here's the short version: Sound is amazing coming from a 3rd Gen dot, not quite the highs or lows a proper speaker setup provides, but it's space saving compared to that and produces very balanced room filling sound.

Full Review:
I purchased this as an early family present to replace a Gen 3 dot and Gen 1 dot, the sound blows of those away. Even at first plugin, it started up with a tone that more or less spanned the range of what the Studio can handle...everyone's head turned at me in awe, including myself. My family loves music..lots of music...from K-Pop to Metal, and everything in between. The size of the Studio is definitely larger than the dots, comparable to a medium sized pot. While the sound quality is better b
than the Gen 3 dot in both fidelity and clarity, it is still behind proper 2 or 2.1ch+ speaker setups, in case there are some hoping to replace that (again we love music and enjoy it as close to how t was intended). That said, if it's
an upgrade to one of the smaller Echo models and/or tired of connecting to a larger speaker system (this is my case) for sound, the Studio is the way to go. The sound the Studio puts out is well balanced: highs, mids and lows are not muddied together nor tinny. The fidelity and clarity is wonderful coming from a single small device and with the multiple speakers built in, the Studio fills a room with sound with ease; whether it be for background music or for listening to the latest album. I still prefer the sound that my tower speakers and sub produces...but it satisfies my families ears without the need to tell Alexa to first connect to speaker...really it's so good that I'm looking into getting a second to further enhance the Soundstage, better separation of left and right, of an already phenomenal Echo speaker.",5.0 out of 5 stars
GreatNorth,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2022","To start with: the Amazon Music App and Alexa app don't play nice together, but its getting better; Alexa app likes priority power! Also flipping from app to Fire 4K Max has interface issues. It's getting old unpairing speakers and clearing caches... When music or movies stop for 10 minutes, it should default to next command pinging it and not mate for life!!....

The software issues aired... I bought two of these with the sub to justify my monthly unlimited music fee along with the Prime membership; both of which keep going north.... I am old enough to remember when the Dire Straights Brothers in Arms CD DDD cost $26 bucks, but if you had a CD player, this was a life changing listening experience! So I'm conditioned within reason, but am a frugal value buyer.

I am a self proclaimed audiophile, but that is arbitrary based on your music, room, ears and budget, but I have always paid up for ""Hearing"" sound value. A $10k amp/pre sounds only as good as your speakers. No the Studios aren't that, but for a smart Alexa speaker you can't engineer or make a speaker set for your $200 investment. Amazon is even or losing on selling these to get you enrolled in the unlimited music; HD, ultra HD, Atomos, 3D etc... and it works. Very smart.

Will they make a TV sound experience better, obviously, compared to factory tv pairings. Will they play your music subscriptions epic on your go to listening personal high end system, blow your hair back, chair? That is your call. Prime: return if not. My easy answer is that Amazon doesn't currently make a better speaker with the versatility the studio has, and I own everything they sell related to sound... truly.

Amazon isn't intentionally trying to price themselves out of the music streaming services and the value here is that they are committed to getting it right. Many of the settings adjustments have been firmware updated to work as it should of been from origin, but tip of the hat for addressing weaknesses. Most high end audiophile speaker companies aren't going to swap out the cross-overs or update the digital footprint because you spent $35k on a set of speakers you think should clear the air better. Get a calculator out. $200x amazon customers, x customers who subscribe to music and movies..... it's millions
$$$! Amazon will stay proactive and reactive when necessary to keep us happy! Buy the speaker/s, it's a brilliant 150-200 dollar investment considering a tank of gas is $100. Money well spent, stress well relieved and a chance to re-listen to music, that doesn't sound the same as it did over the years.

Clinton W. Salvato,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2020","I had been looking at, and watching reviews of the Echo Studio since it was announced last year, and had decided, it was a product, that I initially wanted to get my hands on, and at least test.

Since I have been happy with my Echo Plus 2nd Gen, and Echo Dot 3rd Gen, I put the studio on the back burner.
Earlier this month, I just happened to be at my local Best Buy, and they had a couple in stock, so I decided to grab one.

First Impressions:
The studio looks and feels to be well built
It seems to be able to fit into a good amount of places, although I've only had it in one so far, but (judging by that location) leads me to believe, even though the largest echo speaker, that it can fit anywhere (within reason).
The sound is extremely well balanced, at least for the majority of music I listen to, and even a good stereo mix is immersive on this speaker, the left and right channels come out clear, and it's NOT just stereo, it does immerse you, however, I have noticed that it depends on the style and recording quality of the music as to how well that works. As others have mentioned in reviews, by default the Echo Studio has a Spacial feature enabled to enhance stereo. I'll leave this up to YOU to turn it off, or leave it on. I will leave this suggestion, if you don't have a technical background in audio, and want to keep things simple turn this off in the Alexa app under settings:device settings: your echo studio:audio settings. I say this because it's essentially what Dolby Pro Logic, and other similar technologies do to simulate surround sound from stereo. Some music it actually helps and gives a nice affect to, and others it distorts, and actually makes sound worse. Putting that aside though Audio sounds really good through this device, and the bottom line is, to get the best performance, you can't always use the defaults, or someone else's settings, because there are too many variables. that can change.

Other things I've found to share, Initially I had WiFi issues with the 5ghz channel, because the Echo doesn't get full signal where it's at here, but switching to the 2.4ghz channel has made things more stable, not just for the echo studio, but features like multi room music, and overall performance. My advice here is:

Yes, 2.4ghz is going to be a slower channel then the 5Ghz one in many cases. However, for an audio only device such as an echo without a screen, it's not going t make a difference in performance. So if issues with Wifi, and it's on the 5ghz channel, try setting it to 2.4. Amazon even recommends this, in their help article on updating and troubleshooting Wifi settings with echo products. Let me rephrase that, they suggest 5ghz for faster performance but suggest 2.4 for better stability and signal range.

Bottom Line:
The echo studio is a great smart speaker with a unique design and purpose. As always, while the sound is great from this device, it's not a replacement for a dedicated surround system. If you're ok with this fact, and still want to try this product, I recommend it 100%.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Big Dog,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2021","We bought the first generation Echo along with a couple of Echo Dots four years ago and have been using it in the kitchen. It took some counter space but was not really in the way. The sound was decent, much better than the Echo Dots. I wanted some better sound. I looked at the Studio along with a couple of high end speakers with Alexa capability. The issues with Alexa performance noted in the reviews of the high end speakers turned me off on them. We use Alexa a lot and I didn't want something that didn't work well with it. I thought the specs on the Studio looked good so I decided to try it.

I love it when Amazon puts things on sale. The Cyber Monday price was really good. Unfortunately, it was back ordered and couldn't get here by Christmas. It came a couple of days ago. I opened the box with great anticipation. I moved the first generation Echo and put this in it's place. It was overwhelming on the kitchen counter. My wife really didn't like it there. We have a split level house where the family room is down stairs from the kitchen. There is an open space in the family room wall into the kitchen. We decided to put the Studio on the desk in the family room. Problem solved!

The Studio sound is night and day different from the Echo. It's like comparing a tricycle to a sports car. The Studio sound is not only powerful enough to fill the family room and the kitchen. At full volume, it will fill the whole house!

A setup comment. The Alexa app asked me which room the speaker was in. I originally had it in the kitchen. I told it kitchen. I didn't realize that it had created a group called kitchen and put all my echo devices in that group. I have a smart switch named kitchen. Alexa could not turn that switch on and off. When I realized that the group was conflicting, I removed it and the problem was solved. I don't know why it asks for a room. Other Echo devices don't do that.

There are adjustments in the Alexa app for base, mid-range and treble. I have read where some have complained that this is inadequate. I don't claim to be an audiophile. I do appreciate good sound. My favorite place to listen to music has been in my Mercedes which has a really nice sound system. My new favorite is becoming the kitchen and family room.

This may not be a Sonos or Bose name brand and I don't have their speakers to compare. This is an excellent product and sounds amazing! It's price is very attractive. I highly recommend the Echo Studio.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Morgan,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2023","Pros:
1. **Exceptional Audio Quality:** The Echo Studio lives up to its claim as Amazon's best-sounding smart speaker, delivering an impressive audio experience with clear highs, rich mids, and deep bass, providing a well-rounded sound profile.

2. **Dolby Atmos Support:** The inclusion of Dolby Atmos enhances the audio immersion, creating a three-dimensional sound experience that adds depth and realism to music, movies, and other audio content.

3. **Spatial Audio Processing:** The spatial audio processing technology contributes to a sense of surround sound, making the listening experience more immersive and engaging, especially for those who appreciate a high-quality audio setup.

Cons:
1. **Large Size:** The Echo Studio's substantial size may be a drawback for users with limited space, as it requires a significant footprint. Consideration of available space is essential before incorporating it into your home.

2. **Higher Price Point:** While the audio quality justifies the cost, the Echo Studio's higher price may be a limiting factor for budget-conscious consumers seeking a more affordable smart speaker option.

3. **Alexa Integration Learning Curve:** For users new to smart speakers or voice-activated assistants, the integration with Alexa may take some time to master. Learning the various voice commands and features could be challenging for beginners.

4. **Limited Color Options:** The availability of the Echo Studio in only a charcoal color may be a limitation for those who prefer more diverse options to match their home decor.

Final Statement:
The Echo Studio undoubtedly stands out as a top-tier smart speaker, offering an unparalleled audio experience with Dolby Atmos and spatial audio processing. While its size, price, and learning curve with Alexa may be considerations, the exceptional sound quality makes it a worthwhile investment for audio enthusiasts. I highly recommend the Echo Studio for those who prioritize an immersive and high-fidelity audio experience in their smart home setup.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I know I could've gotten that feature with any of the other available devices, but the sound quality is so much better on the Echo Studio, making it worth the few extra dollars.

Z.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2023","I bought one of these during Amazon Prime Days. When I first set it up and plugged it in, I was really disappointed. Then I searched the Alexa App for possible settings, and tweaked everything higher. The sound quality now is fabulous! Even though I’m completely happy with the sound, I’m still finding myself contemplating picking up a second, and possibly even the subwoofer that never goes on sale. I mean, if ONE sounds this good, how much better can things get? I’d really like to find out!

The only criticism is with Alexa, who is the very best and (thankfully rarely) the worst parts of the Echo ecosystem, seeming to vary at times between brilliant and dumb as a rock, sometimes within minutes. I asked what Propylene glycol alginate was three days ago, and she went into a speech about vaginal lubricants, I kid you not! I often ask for a playlist with my first name and “chill” and they pull up an artist with the same first name and (hopefully obviously) last name that IS NOT “CHILL”!

Still, I can’t imagine my life - or my home, or even my 17 year-old car! - without my various Echo devices making things smarter and better, especially as someone that loves music! I hope Amazon realizes that people may not necessarily shop directly FROM an Echo, because phones and computers are simply a superior shopping experience, even over an Echo with a screen. But Alexa *absolutely* contributes strongly to my overall relationship with Amazon, including my Amazon Prime subscription, which drives purchases. So I hope Amazon keeps this in mind, and continues maintaining and building on the Alexa experience.

If you’re looking for a reasonably compact smart speaker that offers tremendous sound for the size and price (especially on sale!), look no further. Just be sure to go into the Alexa App and play with the sound settings, or you’ll be wondering what the big deal is!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Keith M.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2022","I purchased two Echo Studios for an outdoor listening environment. I set them up in a stereo pair. Initially the sound was unimpressive. I tried repositioning the speakers, which led me on a long and winding road to find out how to ask Alexa to re-calibrate the speakers. I never found that answer, but I did come across something very useful.

The Echo Studio has several built in sound ""modes"". Like NIGHT, SPORT, TV. and MUSIC. Apparently, the default mode for my Studios was not MUSIC.

""Alexa, set music mode"" made a world of difference in the quality of my listening experience.

Once in music mode, I further refined the sound by asking Alexa to turn up the treble, turn down the mids, and turn up the bass. ""Alexa, set the bass to 3"", ""Alexa, set the treble to 2"", ""Alexa, set the mids to -1"". Awesome!

The other biggie, for me anyway, was the height of the speakers in relationship to my listening position. The speakers need to be at, or slightly above, ear level for the best sonic experience.

Initially I had the Studios on an aire conditioner exchange unit and a BBQ. THe sound was really good (after the steps above). But my plan was to hang the speakers in macrame plant hangers about 24"" under the eves, which put them about 7' in the air. I lost all the great stereo imaging and treble detail.

I used nylon cord to lower the Studios to about 5' off the ground. Back to being very cool!

Finally, the sweet spot for listening is not huge. The Studios do not sound bad from 20' away, but sitting about 8' in front of the pair with about 6' of separation between left and right speakers is a completely different listening experience. I am pleasantly surprised at how great these sound.

I am extremely happy with my Studio pair. And Alexa kicks it over Siri. Altogether a great system for my usage.

(and my reference system is not too shaby - B&W 802d 5.1 with Emotiva preprocessor and class A amps...)

Now if Amazon Music Unlimited and Echo Studio worked together to keep a relatively constant volume output as I cycle through decades of varying musical genres, I would be totally blown away!

Bryan,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2022","I had a 3rd generation Amazon Echo (pillar shape). For the money, it had a truly wonderful sound. Nothing wrong with it at all.

In early 2020, I tried the Amazon Echo Studio and thought it sounded muddy - literally worse than the regular Echo. So I returned it.

Then, a few weeks back, I saw news of very positive reviews of Studio Echo's major software upgrade. Fortunately, it was on sale for 20% off - from $199.99 to $159.99, less another 25% of the discounted price if I traded in my Echo, less 10% using my Amazon Prime Chase VISA credit card (rather than the usual 5%), less $25 for the trade-in price for the Echo device itself. So, with sales tax and less all these discounts, my final price was $89.75.

I decided to try it again, side by side with the Echo I had already, and the improvement was monumental - hugely significantly positive. It was like an entirely different speaker compared to the first time I tried it.

As others have said, it is a much larger speaker, so be prepared for the size. I have it on the floor, so it's not an issue, but may be for you if you have a narrow shelf or small table. Note also that it has a bit harder time hearing the wake word when music is playing compared with my prior Echo. Lastly, the volume needs to be a bit higher than the prior Echo to have a good sound. For a quality sound, it needs to be at 25% or higher. Just turn it up a bit to get the same level of sound. You'll have plenty of upside volume to get it far louder than you'd ever want it.

Fulfillment was solid. Ordered and received the same day, and I dropped off my Echo trade-in that same afternoon at a nearby Whole Foods.

Bottom line: Probably worth it at full price, but I wouldn't pay it since the regular Echo was really very good. if you can stack the discounts and get it for under $100, most definitely buy it. You won't be disappointed.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Pete,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2023","It took me 10 years to try a device with Alexa, but I am very impressed. It is better than I expected. I have previously used Pandora, but I like my Echo Studio with Amazon Music much better. I have been impressed with the followup songs that Echo Studio plays, along with the quality of the sound and the ease to skip a song, turn up/down the volume, or pause the music.

I didn't think that I would ask Alexa many questions, but I have found that instead of ""Googling"" something, it is much more convenient to ask Alexa. The quality of the answers are sufficient for what I am asking, and often times there are followup questions that I can conveniently ask. Plus, the ease to just find out the time without looking at my phone. I can work and just ask what time it is. Simple but very useful.

Another useful feature, is that I hooked up an old iPhone 6s using the headphone jack, and play delta wave music at night. I really appreciate being able to play my own music through the Echo Studio. It is also nice to have Alexa to turn up/down the volume.

Paul Tjostem,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2023","I bought an Echo Studio and immediately had my Fire Cube pair with it. OMG!!! The sound was absolutely mind blowing. I felt like I was in a movie theater!! And all this was coming from just one speaker!

Well, I figured if one speaker can do all that, I need to go and buy a second Echo Studio. I also added the Amazon Sub-woofer. With these three speakers I was able to create the Amazon Home Theater on my Fire Stick / Cube. It's great to have a FULL stereo sound with a deep rich bass.

I was initially frustrated with the Fire Cube and it's inability to locate the Echo Studio's. But I did some quick research and found out that I had paired the speakers on the Alexa iPhone app. Once I unpaired them, my Fire Cube quickly located my speakers and I was able to connect them. Just make sure you DO NOT create a theater pairing in the phone app....let the Fire Cube sound menu do that for you!!! And if your Fire Cube or Fire Stick isn't locating your Studio Speakers, you might want to check your Alexa App on your phone to make sure it's not paired!

As others have said, these speakers sound amazing! I've had Bose speakers before and these Amazon Studio speakers easily match anything that I've had from Bose. The Dolby Atmos sound from them literally fills the room. I love that each speaker listens to the rooms acoustics and fine tunes the sound to fit the room.

These speakers have given me exactly what I was looking for, namely a movie theater sound experience in my own home. I wouldn't hesitate to buy a Amazon Studio speaker or Sub-Woofer. They quality and the sound are mind blowing. And I can't believe they can create this sound with such an affordable price. I didn't have to spend thousands of dollars on a big surround sound system.

I can't recommend these enough. Truly an amazing sound experience. I love it!",5.0 out of 5 stars
everawesome,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2023","Ok, so I'm not an expert, engineer, or even a tech savvy person, but I'll give me two cents worth for this Alexa Studio. I bought this to jam to on our back patio, replacing the Roku TV that was too big and, in the way, and all we used it for was to stream music. I wanted something small but could push out good sounding music when needed. This little sound system has exceeded my expectations! The sound is amazing, rich in tones and has the bass that we all crave. It is easily adjustable to the genera of music you're listening to, just tell Alexa to turn up/down the range and there you go, quite literally your very own studio that's customizable to your tastes in music. She was fairly easy to set up, many people have stated she's a little slow in responding but I've not had too much trouble that would be worth noting at this time. She is big compared to an Echo/Dot etc, but that's what you'd expect for a music driven system, it's not ungodly big about the size of a family sized can of coffee. She's heavy, but solid, no fear of tipping over. Buttons are easy to find and navigate if manual operation is needed/wanted. Voice commands are easy to learn and are standard Alexa language. The only drawback is she is corded and not ""portable"". You can unplug her and move her around easily enough, but that would be the only negative thing I could post about this product. I was concerned about the $200 price tag, but now that I've used her, I am amazed they aren't asking more. I've not paired her with any other speakers/devices, just stand alone and she provides more than enough sound to make us happy!

J. Woody,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2023","I have had Alexa-enabled devices around my house for years. My living room still sports a 1st Generation Echo I was lucky enough to get through the public beta way back. So when I was looking to replace the Echo in my garage in order to get better music quality while working, I started looking for an Echo that did better audio, while not sacrificing the utility.

Fortunately I found this beast of a machine. I say beast, because I ordered this expecting a slightly larger than normal echo, only to discover just how wrong I was. This thing stands as tall as my 1st gen, and is 2.5x wider than my 3rd gen echo. This is without the optional subwoofer that you can also purchase.

On firing it up, it also did audio tests in my space as part of the set up process to dial in the sound quality. After that I fed it some various music to test how it performed. In a three-car garage, with this mounted roughly 1/3rd of the way over, it still generated an impressive sound that was clear no matter where I was. Additionally it has the capacity to get very loud, which is great for situations where you want music while also doing loud work. The only temporary issue I found was the downward firing speaker; having this sitting on the top of a metal toolbox, when the downspeaker fired it created a tinny reverb due to the hollow metal of the toolbox. After relocating it, this went away.

In all I'm quite pleased. After the initial size surprise, it's been an excellent performing asset. It's cheaper, smaller, and easier to keep clean than some other, higher-quality sound dock options, but it maintains a very crisp clear sound that I would put on par with sound docks. The option to extend it with an attached subwoofer also would take the range and quality likely above a lot of similarly priced and sized systems.",5.0 out of 5 stars
HL,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2023","Like so many others, I wanted to try the studio. I had the 4th gen Echoes with premium sound paired with the Echo Sub and loved it. Could not imagine how it could get a whole lot better until I read some of the reviews that spoke so highly of having two Studios paired with the sub. I was intrigued and just kept my eye out and even started looking on Ebay for some used ones.

Finally, I caught a sale on two refurbed Studios for $159 each and took the plunge. Got it set up in Home Theatre mode rather easily.

These things have completely re-ignited my passion for music! I have not been this consumed with listening to music since the early 2000's.

I would HIGHLY suggest, if possible, that you buy two of these and the sub. You won't be disappointed. Would also recommend a Firestick 4k Max and a monitor that supports CEC/ARC. It will allow you to run all your computer sound through the Studio Home Theater System. I use my 2018 Intel Macbook Pro to run Ultra HD music through the Amazon Music App. I listen to music constantly when I'm working from home, but also use it for zoom calls, videos, etc, Direct TV Stream off of a window in Chrome and when I'm done working will switch over to the Firestick Home and watch a movie in Atmos.

I must warn you, you will want to subscribe to Amazon Music and gain access to 24 bit Ultra HD music. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't tell a difference. You can DEFINITELY tell a difference, especially with this sound system. Even still, the 16 bit stuff sounds fantastic. For a completely wireless system that fits on a desk, it sounds better than all my audiophile equipment that cost thousands, required a rack and lots of space over 20 years ago. The spatial audio puts you in the middle of the music like nothing else I've heard.

Eric,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2023","I’m continually amazed that this little speaker outperforms a number of other sound bars on the market that are 2-4+ times the cost. Two of these combined with a FireStick has better sound quality (imo) than a surround sound system a family member had installed that cost them thousands of dollars.

But for most people, one speaker is plenty as long as your TV is wall-mounted and there’s room under the TV, otherwise there’s nowhere to put it but to the side. It works good enough behind the TV, though you do of course lose some of the higher frequencies. But even then, I’m impressed that it doesn’t sound muddied behind the TV, with its ability to analyze the acoustics of the room and recalibrate itself.

The bass is boomy and the 3D audio is nice when supported. It also has the ability to simulate 3D audio and I find that it’s able to produce a pretty immersive feeling with a lot of songs that aren’t technically 3D. There are a number of songs I’ve listened to on this thing where I’ve been tripped out a few times because it sounded like the music was coming from behind me. Dolby Atmos is also great if you have a FireTV or Stick that supports it.

It’s definitely not the prettiest speaker to use as a sound bar, given its form factor, but I don’t see how else it would output the sound it can. Plus, the new, white version looks much more modern and actually looks good compared to the black one, in my opinion.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Kat in Austin, TX","Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2022","The sound is fabulous in my great room with my high cathedral ceilings. The sound really fills up the space without being too loud or tinny. I’ve linked it in a group with my living room speakers, so I can listen to the same music throughout the space. My own personal concert! It sounds wonderful. This is my seventh Alexa speaker as we have one or two in every room. This one is by far my favorite, but it would probably be too much in a small room where a dot or echo would work just fine, but it is perfect for a large space. I really like the quality of the speaker sound for music, and I listen to a lot of Amazon music playlists. I especially love that the speakers plug in and don’t depend on batteries that eventually fail.

I also enjoy all the other Alexa features, especially timers and reminders. Alexa is 50/50 on being able to answer random questions, but is good at math and celebrity information. Sometimes she doesn’t understand you and gives you bizarre answers no matter how well you enunciate. I like that all my speakers are connected with wi-fi and managed through the Alexa app. You can build and mange routines through the app, access Amazon music, and learn new features with ease. She will also manage other smart devices. I’ve got a routine that turns on and off all the lights in my bird room every day at preset times, and plays them different music throughout the day. She doesn’t change their waters, but it makes things so much easier for me to manage their routine. Alexa also tells me when my Amazon packages arrive, so I never have to worry about them sitting outside for long. She will also put my cookies in my cart when I tell her I’ve run out.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Robert M.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2019","I'll get the conclusion out the way: The speaker sounds surprisingly great

For context, I own 2 Sonos One speakers and an Apple Homepod. I've always been lukewarm on the Sonos as their sound, while fairly good, doesn't match their price in my opinion. The Homepod, too, has always felt overpriced if not a decent sounding speaker.

When the Echo Studio was announced, I figured I'd give it a shot given I could always send it back with Amazon's excellent return policy if it didn't live up to snuff. $200 put it below the Homepod and right around the Sonos One pricepoint so my expectations were set around there.

Setup was simple as the device came pre-linked with my Amazon account. It goes through an initial room test where it plays some tones to measure the size and placement within the room (something it does continually should you move it around anyway). After that, all that was left was to listen to some music.

I started with some Sinatra to get a feel for the vocals, and was immediately impressed with the tone & clarity. You could easily pick up on the subtle percussion on the background and the band hits packed a punch when they came in behind him. Next I tried some classical to get a feel for the range and, again, came away impressed. You could feel the lows of the brass section just as well as the high strings. The material was all represented well.

Ok, so how about something that thumps. I asked Alexa to play some Chemical Brothers and this is where I got really impressed. Too many speakers, in my opinion, emphasize the volume of bass over accuracy. You end up with a boomy sound that doesn't reflect the music properly. Not the Echo Studio. The bass was punchy, loud and accurate. I tried some Daft Punk and Deadmau5 and came away equally impressed with the tight bass and crisp highs.

Next I tried some Metallica. I feel if there's a critique I'd have with the Echo Studio it'd be here. The mid guitars lack a little feel and all start to sound a bit muddied together. You get the bass, you get the highs, but the guitars lack a little range. This isn't at all uncommon on speakers like this (the Sonos are quite bad in this regard in my opinion), but it could definitely be better).

I tried a handful of the 3D audio selections on Amazon Music. In short, you do get a wider soundstage which is interesting, but you lose something in the clarity of the music. It feels a little gimmicky maybe, but not necessarily in a bad way. Just an ""I don't know if this is actually an improvement or not"" kind of way.

In short, I'm very, very impressed with the Echo Studio. It's priced right at $200, has tighter and more accurate bass than the Homepod and a much fuller range than the Sonos One. If you're looking for a good speaker for music (with the bonus of having Alexa built in), I can't recommend this one enough.

I came in skeptical. I came away impressed.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Greg,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2021","It's important to say that my Echo-Studio was a gift. I did not seek out and purchase this item for myself. The giver knew my taste for classical music and for this it was a well-chosen gift. There are so many reviews of the Echo Studio that I can only say this device does what it claims to do. Initially, I did not like the non-directional sound, but the longer I've used it, the more I see the benefit of the room-filling sound, especially when one needs to get up and move around. The sound is uniform at almost any point in the room. The Studio is sturdy and heavy, which means no rattles or buzzing when playing music at a higher volume level.

Is the sound as good as advertised? Frankly, it *is* good, though not as good as my old Bose Mini which has superb clarity and a wide stereo sound stage. Then the Bose does not have the connectivity and other features of the Echo Studio. I tried Amazon 3D audio and was only mildly impressed. It wasn't so superior as to induce me to subscribe.

Then, it must be said that the Echo Studio, like all Amazon devices, is at some level a conduit for enticing one to buy more from Amazon. Here it's more subtle, but once Alexa learns the owner's voice, it can be used to purchase items from Amazon by verbal command. I wave no red flag. I've been an Amazon customer for over two decades with no desire to end that relationship.

The only negative I have experienced so far was a verbal notification from Amazon. Alexa asked me to review the Echo Studio! I answered with an emphatic NO! Please, Amazon, take note! We get spam by email, spam by text, and if spam starts to come by Alexa on my devices, I will shut them down.

Alexa is a primary feature of the Echo Studio, I must say that it can be difficult to get her to fetch the music one wants. If you seek Justin Bieber or Katy Perry, no problem. As a subscriber to Amazon Music Unlimited, I ought to have access to millions of 'songs'. When I asked to hear Mozart's opera The Marriage of Figaro, I got the overture to the Barber of Seville by Rossini. Granted, Figaro is the protagonist in both works, but multiple tries to play the correct music caused Alexa to shut down! I later searched for the music I wanted on the Amazon Music app on my mobile and there were multiple versions of the opera to enjoy. Alexa may be handy but she is no deus ex machina.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Brian,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2023","I'd been meaning to get one of these, but the price put me off. Much of that hesitation was in my expectation that this was just a echo with a few more speakers. I am deep into the Alexa smart speaker world, as I have many... and I just expected this to be a slightly fatter addition. However, many third party reviewers give it very positive ratings, so I splurged.

My expectations were way smaller than the final product. This is a very substantial piece of hardware. Larger and heavier than I imagined. Whatever is under the hood in this thing, it is definately not sized for show. It has enough heft that they package it in a box with a handle strap, and inside the box the Studio is in a tote bag with a handle to help you safely pull it out.

As an apostle of Amazon Alexa works, my studio came pre-loaded with my info. I plugged it in, it connected to my network, and performed a series of sound testing to setup itself up for the acoustics of the room and its place in it. Once that was completed, I checked my Alexa app and all is ready.

My first test was the season 1 soundtrack to West World. This music has low tones that did not play well on Echo dot 2nd gen that the studio is replacing. (it was precisely that reason that I decided to finally get the Studio). I can report the Echo Studio played with richness and depth, and absolutely fulfilled my hopes.

My second test was ""Maggot Brain"" by Funkadelic. Again, Studio kicked it with supernatural power.

So let the word go forth that this is the speaker you are looking for.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Robbie Cooper,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2020","I was actually looking for ways to improve the sound on my TV and saw a promo of the Studio. I went ahead and order one and got it quickly, set it up in my master and played around with it. I have Amazon Music, played some of their 3D demo music and was sold on Rocket Man. Immediately upgraded to Prime 3D Music. Connected it to the TV and pulled up Blade Runner 2049, Thor Dark World and Avengers EndGame and on a single Studio was wowed by the sound filling my master. So withing days, I order a second Studio and upon arrival, moved both into our family room and now have it fully integrated with our large TV. That room has 26 foot ceilings and opens to several other rooms but the sound reached everywhere. It also sets up with left and right speakers and you can hear some really crazy subtle noises that I don't even remember hearing in the theater. I now stream every app I can through the Fire Stick (get with the program on HBO Max, Amazon!!!)

As for just music, the bass can be a bit overwhelming and there is not a lot of control in the equalizer on the Alexa app. I don't claim to be an audiophile but I own thousands of songs via iTunes and know good v great sound quality. Amazon is better than good and on most songs, especially those that are in 3D, the quality is pretty fantastic. But I also really like heavy metal and given drums and bass dominance in bands like Tool, the really deep tones can be a little overwhelming. But Tool also has tracks in 3D and the nuances that sneak through the heavy bass are really interesting. On more pop or pop rock music, it's not as prevalent and really quite enjoyable. We'll see if I can survive the holiday season streaming my wife's Christmas music.

If you subscribe to Amazon Music, I recommend pairing this with a TV whether you intend to use it for a sound system or not. With Fire TV, the remote syncs to the Studio and controls TV and speakers. It makes access to the music catalog and all of their HD and Ultra HD quality music fairly simple. There could be some improvements like better access to genres and then sub sections within but overall a decent way to get artists or albums to play. They also have quite a few playlists pre-created, some of which are pretty good.

Overall, for $400 to get 2 Studio's and a couple more Hue lights, I can't think of a better way to get a serious TV sound improvement (that really will rattle the rafters) and a much better than good smart speaker.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bobo Blackboots,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2019","edit: Over two years later and Studio is still selling for the original price I paid SEP 2019. Also, she still sounds great in our main open area. This studio handles our 3,000 sqft rancher minus 4 bedrooms. I had an amazon sub in there for maybe a month before moving it out. The studio doesn't reach down enough (nor the sub) to sound good when spatially displaced from each other. It sounds better with just the studio's 5.3"" driver than with the sub at the side of the room. The studio sits on our bar, rather central, and projects very well and plenty deep enough for the family's tastes.
---------------------------------------
Great upgrade for my open floorplan. I started with a dot and worked my way up until I had the previous top model (3"" woofer and .8"" tweeter) paired with the matching sub. While that pair was great across the spectrum, the soundstage was off due to the sub sitting against the wall, rather than next to the echo. I had reservations that the front firing tweeter on the Studio wouldn't disperse well from the center of the house, however that isn't an issue. The studio sits on my kitchen bar and points away from the kitchen. It does great at filling the central part of the house with music, including the kitchen ""behind"" it. Had I not done my research, I probably wouldn't have realized it had a front firing tweeter, vice up or down.
I moved the sub into the master bedroom where it's near that echo. This added the low end to the bedroom without the spatial blur of the sub sitting away from the mids/highs.
Back to the Studio... it delivers premium sound to the bulk of my first floor and now that the woofer is integrated into the echo, the soundstage is no longer off/annoying.

There has been a steady improvement in audio quality over the past several models and generations, now that the Studio delivers premium sound in a single package... I'm not sure where Amazon will go next. I'd buy a smaller future device IF it delivered equal sound quality. I am not interested in sacrificing range or depth for size though. The Studio fits fine on the bar and I can crank it up when the wife is out.

Considering the Studio is full range in a single device, I am very pleased with the pricing. If Amazon offers any holiday deals, you should definitely give in and upgrade to at least one studio. If no deals soon, give in and pay full price like I did. I think it's still a bargain at full price.

For comparison, downstairs I have the studio, a premium echo with sub paired, another premium, 1 echo in the garage, and dots in the kids' rooms. I guess towers will eventually work their way into the kids' rooms... upstairs I run Monitor Audio Silver 7.2 with SVS cylinder subs and I still have a dot hooked up to my receiver to listen to audio commands.

Well done Amazon. Oh, one final nod to incorporating a spectral automatic equalizer to immediately adjust the Studio's audio output to match it specifically to your room's configuration.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Huai J. Gong,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2020","You can't find anything that will compare at this price point. I bought one and added a second to make a pair a week later. Yes it will work as a stand alone speaker but it is so much better as a pair.

As a powered speaker it is amazing. What happens with powered speakers typically is that if you crank the volume up the built in amplifier clips at loud passages. That means the amp cannot supply enough power to drive the speakers resulting in really bad distortion. I cannot get Studio to get clip. That means they have been engineered with plenty of reserve power. They are rated at 330 watts each but I believe that's very coservative and they handle peak power demand much higher.

As stand alone speakers they handle mids and highs very well. Playback of streaming 3D content from Amazon was very good. My 13 yr old son who is not an audiophile(yet), remarked while listening to Shawn Mendes Unplugged in Ultra HD. ""It is like being in the front row""

Are they audiophile grade? No. Why? There is no bass. Frequency response is only down to 50hz. You can hear bass but you cannot feel it. What do I mean? If you have been to a live venue, the drummer steps on the kick drum pedal and a thump hits you in the chest. That's what I am talking about. You need a powered subwoofer to take the setup to the next level. There is the Echo Sub but I cannot recommend it as it has only a 6"" driver. The limits of physics. Bass is all about moving large amounts of air. A 6"" driver only moves 1/4 the amount of air as a 12"" driver. Unfortunately the Studio does not play well with non Echo equipment.

Wanting to see how far I could take the Studios, I took a chance and figured out a work around. I bought an Echo Link and hooked it up to a 12"" 1000 watt powered subwoofer. With much difficulty I now have it working with the Studios using a multi-room setup hack. Right now 2 x Studios, Link and a large powered subwoofer is easily producing a listening experience similar to that of using equipment costing thousands of dollars. And you have the added bonus of voice control. If you have the Fire Stick, you can stream Dolby Atmos content to the speakers. Good Dolby Atmos Home theater sound for under $1000.

I think Amazon has done an excellent job here. No other audio equipment manufacturer can touch the Studio in terms of value and being able to add to. Sonos, Apple and Google are miles behind.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Oktyabr,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2020","From an audiophile: I've been an Alexa user for awhile now and have dots pretty much all over my house. I caught a sale recently and decided to give the ""Studio"" a go. Placed in my master bedroom just one of these fills the room with sound (that whole end of the house!) and it's quality stuff too! The bass, especially, is impressive for such a small woofer (it out thumps my 2.1 desktop system with ease).

Is your money spent better elsewhere? I have a dot in my kitchen plugged into a Bowers & Wilkens A5. This is a $400 speaker from a very reputable audio company. The B&W seems to have ""drier"" mids and highs, which may make me think it's slightly ""more accurate"" sounding, but it doesn't have the deep reach at the bass end of the frequencies as the Studio does. Both are of comparable volume, maxed out, and both are of similar size and weight. And the B&W costs TWICE as much! Let's cover this idea for a minute... Yes, the B&W may present more of an ""audiophile"" sound but if I had to do it again? I'd take two Studios and pair them over the A5, for the same amount of money!

I have a fairly elaborate home theater/music system in the living room that cost about as much as a good used car. Again, an echo dot acts as a source to feed music through custom built dipoles powered by a stack of amps. I love my music (and movies) and enjoy spending time in the living room doing just that. But the Studio in my bedroom keeps me satisfied to the point that my living room time has gone down significantly.

Is the Studio perfect? I think the mids and highs may be rolled off a bit, producing a more ""laid back"" sound. Some EQ in the Alexa app may adjust it more to your liking, if this sound isn't it. For me, it's great just the way it came shipped. The 3D audio is VERY good and while I'm tempted to pair it with a second one, one has proven to satisfy my listening pleasure far more than I expected. The bass is deep, without sounding muddy or ""booming"", although I wonder if it wouldn't tone that down a bit automagically, if paired with an Echo Sub. The Alexa implementation is, as you might expect, excellent. It's fast, responsive, and the mics are plenty sensitive.

I'd love to see what Amazon could do with a 5.1 or even 4.1 implementation of this speaker, for a surround sound setup.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I thought it was pretty good considering the size, but didn't care for having to adjust the actual speaker volume in conjunction with Alexa's volume. I decided to add something to my room to have paired music in both ends of the house. Little did I know, the Amazon Studio speaker surpasses the Wave radio quite noticeably. The bass is deeper and at 80% its sound quality is far superior to Bose. It was crazy easy to set up after it was already linked to my account.

I have 4 Echo speakers of various models.
I assumed the Studio would sound much better since it is twice as big as the other Echo speakers. It doesn’t sound any better!
I have adjusted all the equalizer settings, but nothing seemed to help.
I started to send it back, but my wife says she can hear a small improvement over the old Echo speakers.
After 3 months, I would like to replace the Studio with a new Studio in hopes that it would sound better. The return or replace option does not work for this device.

Update 05/30/2024: After searching the web I found a video that shows how to reset the speaker. After following this procedure, the speaker sounds great! The trick is, you have to hold the reset button down for about 30 seconds, not just a few seconds as the instructions indicate.
Make sure you have the speaker setting where you intend to use it when you first plug it in. If you move it, you need to go through the reset procedure again or it wont sound good.

After about an hour I contacted Amazon chat customer service and told them the deal. The agent said try plugging it in a different outlet. So I did, and it worked, WTF? So I plugged it back into the outlet in the room I wanted it in. Nothing. Had to pair it again. After 5 minute then it worked. The sound was great. I was like ok.

Bryon L.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2024","I purchased two of the Echo Studios with the Echo Sub, so I write this review with all 3 devices. Also, keep in mind this setup is best completed with the Amazon Fire TV 4k streaming stick or I am sure the Fire TV Cube would work just as well. I was a little frustrated when I first setup the Echo Studios and Echo sub because I was trying to make it all work without the Fire TV 4k Streaming stick. I already had the streaming stick, but just didn't think to configure this setup through the fire stick. Once I setup the two studios and sub in theatre mode through the Fire TV Stick settings, it immediately made the audio work amazing from the TV. Also, once I setup the Fire TV stick to run the audio, it also made it so my other HDMI cables plugged into my TV also ran through the studios and echo sub. We were watching a movie the other night and my son asked me to turn it down because the audio was so loud. So this setup will give you great sound once you have it setup correctly and it reduces the amount of space needed for your audio system. So if you want a great sounding system that takes up a lot less foot print in your room, then this is the way to go.

All you do is plug the studios in first and make sure they are both online. Once online turn on your Echo sub and wait until it is online as well. Once they are all online, you will want to go to the Alexa App and go to devices and click the + in the top right corner and create a group. You will want to select the Theatre option and add the two studios and sub to the group and save your setup. Here is some instructions that I followed to make sure everything was setup correctly and in the right order. Hope this review helps!

Tyler H,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2024","I purchased the studio/studio sub & have had problem after problem. If you manage to get them to work, the sound quality is good - but good luck with that. 9 times out of 10 Spotify doesn't recognize that this speaker is on my wifi. If this happens I have to jump through dozens of hoops and pray that it works. Most times nothing does.

It's also important to know, that the sub ONLY works while wifi streaming. If you connect via Bluetooth it does not work - it will only play through the speaker. In addition to this, if the speaker isn't connected to WiFi (whether it be an outage or whatever) it will not connect to your phone via Bluetooth. Making it completely useless.

All in all, the sound quality is great. But it's such a pain in the ass to get everything to work that this speaker & the sub that I purchased separately were a complete waste of money. Do with this information what you will - but personally, I will never spend another penny on anything ""Amazon echo"". I'm pissed that I have this crap to begin with but hopefully this review will help others to not make the same mistake",1.0 out of 5 stars

I don't know what happened with whatever updates that they've done somewhere because my echo device is used to work beautifully and flawlessly and now I find myself arguing and screaming at my echo devices so much to the point that I am angry because the technology isn't working even when asking it to perform simple tasks.

Colin,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2024","This might be the worst technological purchase I’ve ever made. Amazon tried their hardest to create a product, and it delivered in the sense that it works. Mostly.

Audio quality? Pretty decent. Can be a little flat by itself, which is why I also purchased the Amazon echo sub. That’s about all the good things I can say about it.

Performance: abysmal. I have pretty internet, up to 400 mb/s. The frequency at which the speaker would lose connection, or if your internet flickers for a second, you’re waiting another 5-10 minutes for it to reconnect to the firestick TV.

On that note: the most baffling thing about this device is how poorly it works with anything Amazon. Want to stream Amazon music through the speaker? If it’s connected to your firestick, it has to use the Amazon music app on the firestick. And inevitably, it will freeze up mid-song, requiring you to close and restart the app. “Just use Bluetooth!” you might say. Good luck. You have to connect to the speaker via Bluetooth using the Alexa app. Remember how I mentioned the Amazon-amazon relationship is trash? Well surprise surprise, using it as a Bluetooth speaker is also an exercise in patience (if and when it decides to work).

The real kicker is this: trying to watch any show on Amazon prime video. This is a firestick tv, plugged into an Amazon-branded firetv, connected to an Amazon speaker system, utilizing an Amazon app. And I couldn’t get more than 5 minutes into the show before the audio would de-sync by 5-10 seconds. Every troubleshooting method, trolling Reddit and the Amazon forums, led me to one solution; replace the piece of ****

Don’t buy this. Buy the Vizio m-class 5.1 system. I’ve had it for a few days, and the surround sound is very solid (actual extra speakers rather than a simulated experience), and a subwoofer that doesn’t boom like I’m trying to wake up the neighborhood (which the echo sub does on the lowest possible setting, which you can only change in the Alexa app).

D in California,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2024","I just deregistered my Echo Studio to switch to an Apple HomePod. Why? Because the HomePod will let me listen to my own music. Amazon played a bait-and-switch on Echo users who started with the first devices. The appeal then was that we could upload our music libraries and play them through the Echo speakers in our homes. Then, after Amazon had lots of information on what people listened to, it took away the option to upload our libraries and listen to our own music. Then it took away the option of listening to just the artists we wanted to unless we subscribed to Amazon Music, replacing a request to listen to an artist with listening to ""similar artists."" The MyMedia for Alexa app was supposedly a workaround, but it hasn't been updated in years and the results with it lately have been too frustrating to bother with. So, it is time to say goodbye to Echo as a source of music. It's still useful as an intercom, a timer, and, in a pinch, and Echo Show can be used to watch a movie, but the reason for buying it in the first place has been destroyed by the seller. If you're interested in paying for something that will only play popular music and you don't mind paying a subscription every month — and WON'T play music you already own — this might be the device for you, but it is no longer the device for me.",1.0 out of 5 stars

*After submitting my review an Amazon Outreach Representative called me to see if they could help and troubleshoot the problem. Basically a reset and maybe move to a different location. So I did and I have to admit, not a whole lot of difference. I did move the speaker closer to where I sit so yes, sound is definitely better but that's just because it's closer.

I was sorry to do so because of audio quality but if it doesn’t operate to suit my application then it’s useless to me. After that I spent 25 seconds pairing with my trusted JBL and was up and running.

Kevin S,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2024","I really love the sound this speaker produces while using Amazon Music. The speaker itself deserves a 5 but Amazon really needs to overhaul their music app. It’s sloppy, clunky and malfunctions and crashes frequently. An improved user interface and full app overhaul and this would be an amazing pair. The speaker however is excellent. I am pairing it with the Tidal Music App and the sound is just amazing. The speaker really does redefine how music is heard. Simply amazing.

One dislike about the speaker is that when you play a song for the first time on any given day Alexa feels the need to announce ""now playing on """" which actually interrupts and cuts off the beginning of the song you are trying to play. Not good. The developers need to update and eliminate that. I bought the speaker to hear music, not Alexa.

Also, out of the blue, Alexa feels the need to announce when the Studio is connected and what it is connected to. This happens randomly at any given hour, even the middle of the night. The developers need to fix this.

Really though, those are minor.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2019","The Echo Studio is a quantum leap from any other speaker that Amazon has produced to date. Everything else sounds like a transistor radio in comparison. The sound separation is fantastic and you can actually feel the bass at higher volume levels.
There a couple of issues, however. The vaunted 3D sound is a waste on anything other than the songs that are specifically set up for it. DO NOT use it as a default setting. The music that is not 3D will sound muddy and the vocals will be lost in the mix. However, if you turn it off, the music will immediately brighten and the vocals will be clear and crisp. There are a lot of online reviews where they claim that the clarity of the vocals is lacking. That is because they were early reviews and took place before you could turn off the Spatial enhancement option. Second, if you combine the speaker in a group or as stereo pair, playing the amazon music app causes songs to stop playing at random and skip to the next song. I have read online where it stops playing altogether for some people. It does not happen when just playing though a single speaker. I have not experienced the problem, as yet, when playing through the alexa app. However the Alexa app navigation leaves something to be desired. Also the Alexa app doesn’t show the quality of the track that’s playing.
Ok, issues out of the way, I have 2 of the Echo Studio paired for stereo and the sound is a revelation. Listening to the White Album in Ultra HD reveals melodies and instrumentation that I’ve never heard before. The clarity of the voices is amazing. It’s like listening to it for the first time. The 3D tracks sound great as well. There is a massive sound stage. The music really does envelop you. It’s not the same as surround sound. So those looking to relive the days of 5.1 SACD and DVD-HD will be disappointed. It’s impossible to get the same effect from one or two speakers. You won’t hear discrete sounds from behind you, but instead you get a full range from in front of you. It’s difference between sitting the front row for a concert (Echo Studio) and sitting on stage in the middle of the orchestra (5.1 surround). I haven’t tried out the pair for fireTV as yet. The current options for Dolby Atmos are limited and I’ve already watched the new season of Jack Ryan, but I may try this at some point in the future.
The amazon credit for turning in an old Echo, sealed the deal on getting the second Studio. The wait for a second one was too long from Amazon, so I got it at Best Buy. They also participate in the Echo buy back program. So, I turned in an old echo dot and got 25% off the new studio (the discount is the same regardless of which echo you turn in), along with a $5 credit. So instead of $219 (with tax), I got the second studio for $155 (with tax). Great deal and with the discount it’s about the same price as an Echo Plus.
The size may be an issue to some, but it wasn’t with me. In order to accommodate 5 speakers, there is no way for it fit into the same space as the Plus. The space is really need to fit the subwoofer and it certainly makes a difference.
So my final thoughts: It’s a fantastic speaker. Much better than anything else you can get from Amazon. The price is right, especially if you turn in old echo dot (any echo really, but the dot is the cheapest of the bunch and you get the same discount). Don’t use the Stereo Spatial Enhancement. The songs in 3D will play that way regardless of the setting and it makes everything else sound worse (in my opinion). There may be point when Amazon releases an update to fix this, but at this point it’s worthless. I have never had a Bose or a Sonos, so I can’t compare, but I doubt anything in this price range can compete with what the Studio has to offer. If sound quality is important to you and you subscribe the Amazon HD music service (the studio is the only device Amazon offers that can play the Ultra HD music in full 24/196 quality), I would say run don’t walk to get one (or two) of these. You won’t regret it.

UPDATE: I did try out the Dolby Atmos feature last night. I watched some of Jack Ryan and Carnival Row. The effect was just as outstanding as the music. Wide sound stage and clear, crisp dialogue. I do think that for watching movies the subwoofer might be a good addition. The bass was definitely present, but I think that the subwoofer would add some welcome bottom to the sound field (Perhaps that will be a Black Friday/Christmas purchase). The setup was fairly simple after restarting the 4K firestick. Initially the firestick was greyed out in the Alexa app, but after a restart it showed up. Set up involved just following the instructions after that.
As stated before, there are very few options to watch Dolby atmos enabled content on Amazon. It does not allow it from Netflix, and as of yet, does not have the option for the Disney+. Hopefully that will change at some point in the near future (although I’m not holding my breath). However, since my main reason for buying the Studio in the first place was for music playback, I see the Atmos option as an added bonus.

Update 2: they have fixed spatial enhancement mode! It sounds fantastic. If you toggle between the two modes, you can actually hear the sound field shrink. It's now very worthwhile. Also I added a sub to the mix and it does wonders for the sound. If you are using the studio in the kitchen or a home office, one will work spectacularly. If you are using it in a living room or large space then 2 with a sub is the way to go. The sub adds so much depth when you are listening in a larger space. Currently playing through the app is a problem but voice commands still work fine.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bryon L.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2024","I purchased two of the Echo Studios with the Echo Sub, so I write this review with all 3 devices. Also, keep in mind this setup is best completed with the Amazon Fire TV 4k streaming stick or I am sure the Fire TV Cube would work just as well. I was a little frustrated when I first setup the Echo Studios and Echo sub because I was trying to make it all work without the Fire TV 4k Streaming stick. I already had the streaming stick, but just didn't think to configure this setup through the fire stick. Once I setup the two studios and sub in theatre mode through the Fire TV Stick settings, it immediately made the audio work amazing from the TV. Also, once I setup the Fire TV stick to run the audio, it also made it so my other HDMI cables plugged into my TV also ran through the studios and echo sub. We were watching a movie the other night and my son asked me to turn it down because the audio was so loud. So this setup will give you great sound once you have it setup correctly and it reduces the amount of space needed for your audio system. So if you want a great sounding system that takes up a lot less foot print in your room, then this is the way to go.

All you do is plug the studios in first and make sure they are both online. Once online turn on your Echo sub and wait until it is online as well. Once they are all online, you will want to go to the Alexa App and go to devices and click the + in the top right corner and create a group. You will want to select the Theatre option and add the two studios and sub to the group and save your setup. Here is some instructions that I followed to make sure everything was setup correctly and in the right order. Hope this review helps!

Steve Pugliese,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2019","There will be plenty of reviews for the Studio in stand alone, single speaker use. It does sound excellent that way. But if you pair two Studios and throw in the Echo Sub, that is an extraordinary composition! That is the way to do the Echo Studio! That is how I'll review it here.

I decided I must pair two Studios since I had two Echo Plus's stereo paired with an Echo Sub and it sounded pretty darn good. So I had to try the Studio paired in stereo, and since I had the Sub, I threw that in too. What else am I going to do with it? The Sub added a lot to the two Plus's. I wondered would you even notice it with the two Studios? I'm here to say that you definitely notice it. You notice it's not there, I can tell you.

The sound of this whole system (two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub) is quite exceptional. I would have to say it's thrilling! Yes, it costs $530 but that is bound to come down and did I tell you that it sounds incredible? It commands a respect, it really does. There is such a depth to this. The bass is deliberate and authoritative. Very punchy. It has exceptional dynamic range (at high volumes this can be startling) and the stereo image is just stunning. An enormous stage. Those 6 midrange speakers sound sweet indeed. Be sure to turn everything up in the equalizer in Audio Settings of the device in the Alexa App. This thing likes loud! It can easily handle max volume for extensive listening.

You crank this up to ten and it literally takes over the room. If you can listen at that volume for awhile with this system (you must live without neighbors) you will be found with a huge smile on your face.

All of Amazon's music library is now available in lossless CD quality streaming or better, which shines on this. The new celebrated 3D formats also sound excellent, though I thought there'd be more to them (Abbey Road sounded great but I didn't think it was transformed). But anything you play on this will sound exceptional. I really can't believe Amazon has taken it this far from the original Echo. Bravo! I notice that the Apple Homepod is now down to $200 at Best Buy. Would two of them paired sound better than this setup? I truly doubt it. They'd need a subwoofer and none, as far as I know, are available for it.

A few things. The circling Alexa lights are now on top of the speaker. You can no longer really see them from the side, which is unfortunate. I love those lights! And two, the Studio comes with this ""spatial"" setting set. I recommend turning it off. In the Alexa app, go to the device and then Audio Settings and below the equalizer is that on off button for the spatial effect. I don't find it adds anything even though it really changes the acoustics. But if you want to hear music as it was recorded, leave this off.

Oh, and I have to say that Amazon still does not make it super easy to set this all up. You have to start with a new or deregistered speaker. Set up each separately and then pair them. But it's anything but obvious or close to foolproof. Come on, Amazon!

And I feel I must tell you that you can't connect to the Studio by Bluetooth when stereo paired. It will only play through one Studio, the first one you set up. To use the Studios in stereo pair with the Echo Sub, you can only stream. And you can only stream if you pay.

Finally, then, these things are big. Really quite large. And seemingly only available now in black, though there's a gray one in Amazon's web site ads. This is not a speaker that sits demurely upon a table. It's almost as big as the Echo Sub, if that helps visualize it. But you will definitely be challenged as to its home, because that is where this will stay, like forever. Especially if you go for the whole magilla. But I urge you to at least try it (the whole magilla!). But be prepared, I guarantee you won't send them back!

UPDATE: After a software update, the Spatial effect is now the preferred way, so leave it on. Turning it off now makes the music too flat. I think it may even turn off one of the mid range speakers. But something's missing!

ADDENDUM:

After two years, these still shine as brightly as ever. But the thing that must be emphasized is that this system of two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub is designed to take full advantage of Amazon Music’s HD streaming service, since these can work together only with streamed audio. Using that enables you to get at least CD quality audio recorded in lossless FLAC files (what Amazon calls HD, 16-bit/44.1kHz) for everything in the catalog, and Ultra HD (up to 24-bit/192kHz) available on an ever-growing list of recordings. In addition, it is also capable of playing Amazon’s (admittedly still in limited quantity) so called 3D Audio recordings (Amazon Music supports Dolby Atmos and Sony 360 Reality Audio spatial audio formats). If you don’t get the Amazon Music HD package ($12.99 monthly with Prime / $14.99 without), then you will be missing out on what these speakers are designed to deliver. Amazon’s Ultra HD music must be heard on a system that supports it to be appreciated. It truly is something else in audio quality, significantly better sounding than any CD or LP. And Amazon Music’s catalog is growing by leaps and bounds every month. It is currently quite vast, even its Classical Music selection which has exploded in the two years since the Echo Studio was introduced.

Using the Amazon Echo Link ($140), you could get this same quality streaming audio (or even better depending on your amp and speakers) for an existing Hi-Fi setup (at least I think you can- there seems to be some confusion about whether it supports the full 24-bit/192kHz Ultra HD), although you could not get 3D Audio with the Link. You could also use the Echo Link to attach any other sub-woofer to your Echo Studio pair but that would also require an additional amplifier thrown in. However, if you don’t have that Hi-Fi system already, these (2 paired Echo Studios and the Echo Sub) are the way to go to take full advantage of Amazon Music HD at a very favorable price. Just compare their cost to that of a good Hi-Fi system consisting of amplifier, pre-amp, two speakers and a sub-woofer as well as the Echo Link you’d need. The Echo speakers here are a definite bargain for getting excellent audio with minimal wires or fuss!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Erik,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2019","These speakers are a great value for the money, easy to set up, sound great and overall just an awesome way to transform your home into a theatre like experience. In regards to the reviews from the audiophiles trashing the quality; they're just completely off for what these studios are meant for. Actual studio speakers are meant to sound flat for production purposes. A home entertainment system, unless you're going to pay crazy money, is meant to be loud, clear and not distort. These are great for music and streaming in a living room to give you that theatrical feel. If you want to install an actual theater in your house, then yes, go spend way more money on better speakers.

The sounds is really impressive for the price point. I have studio monitors in my music studio that cost hundreds more per speaker, and what can I say? I'm just impressed with what they're delivering for the price.

My current set up is a Fire TV Cube with 2 Echo Studio speakers. One placed on each side of the television for a true stereo experience.

When listening at really low volumes, I double checked a few times to make sure the sound was coming from speakers because the stereo imaging really is that good. Dialogue centers right to the TV and the ambiance is great, not to mention the panning of sound effects from left to right (you'll feel it when you see that plane fly across screen, bullets fly from one side of the room not to mention movie scores sound great). The room analyzer really is fantastic and uses your walls to reflect sounds for a great experience.

The speakers are balanced and my only recommendation for the EQ is to open up the Alexa App, throw your ""Highs"" all the way to the top (to the far right of the slider), your mids to the middle and give yourself just a little boost for the bass. Now we're talking! If you push your bass or mids too far it's going to sound muddy. Again, these aren't studio speakers and I think the EQ provided is more than sufficient.

I've tried watching with just one speaker to see how it sounds. The speaker auto adjusts to the room and does give a convincing stereo feel to your experience, however, if you double the speaker, you double the power—this means you're gonna get way more punch and I can't recommend it enough. If you're on a budget or on the fence, just try one.

Overall the sound is good, set up is easy and EQing them on the app is a breeze. So big checks for all of these things. Within 30 minutes (read about the delay below) I was re-watching favorite action and sci movies just to hear them in my living room and I was really impressed with the quality of the highs, mids and even the bass. I don't understand why one would invest in the Echo Sub — just get 2 Studio speakers and the combined power of them is going to give them all the ""UMMF"" you need. The woofer in these guys is plenty at higher volumes.

In comparison to the apple home pods: As someone who almost exclusively uses apple products, I couldn't be happier with these. Apple is just charging way too much for their speakers for slightly better quality and they will sound not much better to the untrained ear. It's simply not worth the extra money.

So why aren't these getting 5 stars? Well to be honest, I wasn't aware that they would only connect as a studio pair with Fire TV over wi-fi. Read that carefully. Yes, they still have a quarter inch in (like for your headphones on your phone) and they are blue tooth enabled, but in order to take advantage of using them in stereo they need to be connected over wifi and so does the sound source. Therefor, you aren't having a party and letting people just connect to the pair to play their music (unless it's one speaker at a time). Not a big deal if it's mainly for entertainment, but I do wish I would have known.

In addition to that, one of my primary frustrations was purchasing the Fire TV Cube so we could easily stream 4k media without longer buffering or drop outs. Well, the way you do that is by connecting your Cube to your ethernet. Unfortunately, the stereo pair has to be connected to the Fire TV over Wifi, so that means the Cube has to be connected to wifi as well. They will NOT work for your cube/firestick if you're connected over ethernet. This was a bit frustrating and caused some minor hiccups in my setting up... so instead of 10 minutes it took me about 30 to delete and reinstall the pairs.

So this leads me to my one BUYER BE WARE: if you are trying to stream 4k, make sure you have a good internet speed and if not you better have your modem nearby or you'll want to buy a wifi router to plug in to increase the signal near your TV, firestick or cube. In the end, I had a router next to where my TV was to extend our wifi throughout the house, but there's NO WAY everyone has this set up and I would have been really upset if I had major issues watching 4k. Luckily, I have not and I don't have super fast internet (about 55mbps) so I'm hoping most buyers are not put in that position.

With that said, I do believe some of this could be fixed with a firmware or software update, so I'm hopeful. If they do, I'd change my review to 5 stars.

Overall navigating and using Alexa is what it is and there's plenty of reviews about that elsewhere. One thing to note: if you have the cube and 2 speakers, they do not overlap well when listening for voices. I highly recommend you mute 2 of them (I muted one speaker and the cube with the microphone mute button on top of the unit) so we're only giving voice commands to one speaker.

In summary, if you're looking to add theatre like quality sound and punch to your living room, you cannot go wrong with these guys.

Make sure you have descent internet for streaming 4k (55mbps or higher) and don't be afraid to play around in the Alexa app to tweak your set up to your liking.

Even as someone who lives and breathes audio, I was impressed. Not because they are the best sounding speakers but for what they deliver, how easy they do it and for what price they are doing it at.",4.0 out of 5 stars
jarreeddd,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2020","Amazon really came through with this product. A few things to take into consideration:

Sound Quality:

While the sound quality is extremely good, especially given the price range, it’s definitely not on the top of the audiophile list. That being said, for the average person, this is a great speaker. It lacks luster in the mids so lyrics themselves aren’t as crisp as other high fidelity speakers on the market. However, the bass is awesome. No distortion. Also, this thing gets LOUD. Great for a house party or if you feel like rocking out.

Alexa:
While this may not be the BEST speaker out there, the Alexa integration and capability is great. The mics will pick up your voice from across the room even with music blasting. If you’re a heavy Alexa user then the great sound quality and seamless Alexa integration makes this the speaker for you. I personally run all my smart home devices through Alexa so having one more assistant in the room is great.

Size:

This speaker is chubby. Kind of looks like a chopped off robot head. It will definitely not just blend in the background. I have it on the corner of my desk 60x30 and still have plenty of room multiple screens and peripherals.

Room adaptation:

This speaker will definitely fool the room with sound. As far as the “3D Sound goes”, it’s really going to depend on the placement and structure of the room. If you place this in the corner of a room and try to listen to it from the opposite corner, you do loose some of that full sound effect. Also, the size and material of your room are going to effect the acoustics and how the sound bounces off the walls. It seems you really only get that full 3D sound effect if it’s directly in front of you and you have 4 solid walls for the sound to bounce off of. I have mine on the corner of the desk with the front speaker facing me. When I’m sitting at my desk I really get the full 3D effect. To manually reset/calibrate to a room hold down the command button for about 15 seconds.

3D MUSIC:

This speaker performs optimally when playing 3D Music from Amazon. Something to keep in mind though is that there are only about 1,000+ 3D song a offered. Who knows what the future has in store but that shouldn’t be the selling point if you’re looking at this speaker. Either way, you’re still getting great sound from any music app.

Built in Zigbee:

I don’t use any zigbee devices so I can’t comment on this. I also couldn’t figure out how it really works.

Competition:

For the same prize you could purchase a smaller Sonos One. Which one has better sound quality is up for debate but what’s lacking in the Sonos is Bluetooth connectivity. Also, the built in Alexa is limited.

Using it as a sound bar:

I personally only use this for listening to music while I’m at my desk. I can’t really see this being better than a a bar and subwoofer around the same price range or even slightly more expensive. I think it would work great with two Studio’s but then again ... there might be better options at that price range. User preference.

Summary:

I truly am impressed with this speaker and really enjoy using it. If you’re a casual music listener Like me and currently or plan to utilize Alexa, this is a great speaker. If you really want to fill the room then I would consider buying two and strategically placing them somewhere in the desired room.",5.0 out of 5 stars
REM52,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2019","(Note: This was written by me and posted elsewhere, so ignore the personal references – I have simply pasted it here so that I didn’t have to write it again!) Two regular Echo speakers paired in stereo mode don't even come close to the ear-pleasing sound that comes from two Echo Studios in stereo mode. As you said, Ty, you listened to only one Studio speaker, and some of that listening was in a surround mode. The Echo Studio does not ""shine"" with just one Studio (when playing regular stereo music files, which are the most common). Two of them paired in stereo mode sound exponentially better. I humbly ask you to reconsider your 7 rating for sound quality and change it to 9 or 10, for the benefit of potential buyers interested in purchasing high quality equipment. If using two Echo Studios in stereo mode, turn off the ""Upmixing"" toggle switch in the Alexa app. Upmixing tries to adapt 2-channel stereo music to the 3D potential of the Studio. If you don't turn off upmixing, the sound will not be that clear and direct, and you will get the wrong impression about how good these speakers really are. That is why some reviewers gave the Echo Studio a low rating when it first came out because you could not turn off the “upmixing” (Stereo Spatial Enhancement) feature, but now you can. With that feature turned on, the speaker will try to add some processing to the sound and that doesn't sound very good in stereo mode with two Studios. That processing may sound ok with one Studio, but even then it's hit-and-miss, depending on which song is playing. Up-mixing is not perfect and not best for all songs.

Comparison of the Echo Studio to the Regular Echo:
The regular $99 Echo has drivers (internal speaker units) whose sound gets somewhat trapped inside the enclosure case, as the separate woofer and tweeter drivers face each other with a small space between them (they point down and up, not out -- one pointing at the other!) instead of facing outwardly like the Echo Studio’s drivers. But the 3 midrange drivers and one tweeter inside each Echo Studio are facing outward and project the sound outside of the enclosure. That makes a big difference -- there's much more clarity and presence in the midrange and treble. It does not get muffled or trapped inside the enclosure at all; it is allowed to come out clearly and completely. I am hearing detail in songs I’ve been playing for decades -- details I’ve never heard before. Those details are clear as can be without being harsh or grating to the ears. The outward facing circular arrangement of the midrange and tweeter array act like sort of a wide-dispersion tweeter – no matter where you are standing you hear each speaker channel’s sound very clearly (ideal for when you are moving around, working in the kitchen, etc. And I am talking about stereo mode here, not a surround mode). The bass is clear and mostly tight – just right without overdoing it. And if you listen to talk radio on these, the sound (EQ) automatically adjusts itself so that the talker's voice doesn’t sound boomy (those built-in monitoring microphones work well).

Finally, it is recommended to adjust the EQ settings using the Alexa app, and set the EQ to: Bass middle (5 on the scale), Midrange boosted to about 6 or 7 out of 10, and Treble to about 8 out of 10 (this sounds best in the very small alcove that I have these speakers set up in). Use a good-sounding music file for test listening – an audio file that has never been compressed more than once, and has been encoded well, and been recorded in high quality (not necessarily a hi-res file). An excellent sounding sample to buy and use for testing purposes is Rudolf from Burl Ives’ album “Have a Holly Jolly Christmas”. Sure, it’s an old-fashioned song but it is extremely well-recorded and encoded (at least on the specific album I mentioned). You can purchase it for 99 cents on Amazon’s online digital music store if you want to have it stored in the cloud and playable on demand -- on these speakers.

Note about Setup: if you have a weak Wi-Fi signal, the slow signal from your Wi-Fi router may cause some confusing delays during setup, so if you encounter this, begin by finding a way to get an adequate signal strength to these excellent speakers. Move your router closer or maybe buy a Wi-Fi extender if your Wi-Fi signal is weak in the spot where the two Studios are located. After a minute or so of getting established, they will find their way to sync with each other and play in perfect, flawless stereo without you having to do anything after the setup.

Sucram,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2019","UPDATE
I’ve had the 2.1 setup connected to a 4K Stick for 5 months, which has been used as a sound bar/stereo in our master bedroom. From a music perspective, it sounds it’s pretty good! The sound stage is full and produces decent bass. I wish it got a little louder. I find the bass response better for music than movies (I LOVE heavy bass in action scenes). If you like heavy bass for action movies, you may be a little disappointed. .

I have, but no longer experience the connectivity issues others have written about. Mine were limited to music playback, however the issue subsided a few months ago.

I’ll address three improvement areas:
1) When connected with the sub, all the lows go through the sub and the woofers on the studios are rendered useless, unless the volume is high. The trade-off is clearer sound than when the studios are paired alone. Personally, I look at it as a design flaw. All three units should produce lows (or at least have the settings in the EQ to do so) for a better, more immersive bass experience. What good is a 5.25’ Studio driver if it won’t be used when paired?? 🤔

2) As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a lip syncing issue when used as a home theater. Depending on the source the fire stick is decoding, there can be a noticeable sound lag. I have not discovered a way to address this issue.

3) The Studios have the ability to play lossless tracks (24bit). However, paired with a Fire device (Cube, 4K stick... doesn’t matter) the output drops to 16bit, because the sound is decoded in the Fire device and played through the Studio. This simply means that fidelity/musical clarity is lost . The limitation lies within the Fire device, not the Studio. However, it’s worth mentioning because when connected to a Fire device, the Studios will be limited to the capability of the decoding device. If they’re used as a stand-alone stereo for music only, you can use the Studios to their full ability.

BOTTOM LINE
I like the setup. I already owned the Eco Sub so its cost had no bearing on my buying decision. The Studios were an add-on for me. In fairness, I came out off of pocket $240 for both Studios combined. With that said, FOR ME I find great value and functionality.

The question is, if I was to start over and pay full retail ($400 for two Studios + $130 for the sub) for a wireless stereo/sound bar system, what would I think? Could I find a better wireless Atmos Sound bar + woofer with no lip syncing issues for the money? YEP! Could I find a better wireless Smart stereo for the money? I’m not so sure! Could I find one that does both pretty well? I doubt it! Could I split the money between two decent systems, one for music and one for theater? Not why would I go do that??? I’d get one that could do multiple things.

FOR THE MONEY it’s good buy. It’s not a Sonos Playbar + Sub (which is 2x the cost) nor a B&W sound bar & Sub (which is 4x the cost). It’s good for the money.

If you can look past the intermittent lip sync issue, go for it. If that's a deal breaker, spend more and get a sound bar that also produces good music.

————————————————————

The speakers sounds great! No complaints; simple setup, quick calibration and I was off to the races.

From a price point, it's comparable to the Sonos One. From a sound quality, it far exceeds. Sonos One is probably slightly clearer, but that's where the comparisons stop. Echo Studio has a wider/fuller sound stage, more bass, gets louder. The closest comparison is probably the HomePod or Play 3. IMO, this sounds better than both.

I already own an Echo Sub and ordered an additional Studio for pairing. I have yet to connect to FireTV 4k to test the home theater setting.

In summary, this produces very good sound, the price is reasonable and it's the best smart speaker on the market... in my humble opinion...",5.0 out of 5 stars

Multi-room Music issues

I found a solution to not being able to get more than one speaker to work at a time, paired, or set up a “Multi-Room Music” in the Alexa app. This solution also fixed my inability to get Apple enabled devices connected into HomeKit, or even Google Nest Hubs to set up, period.

Quick answer: 
Deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation” when activating your 2.4 Wi-Fi broadcast on your router.

I also took all speakers off guest wifi. But I’ll try to put them back to see if that is necessary now.

Back story: 
Months of issues with HomeKit, (only weeks with Echo Multi-Room Music), I gave up trying and decided to try Alexa and Google to replace my Apple smart home efforts. I spent way too much time. After the fix, I’ll live a blended tech life. I’ll give a quick answer, followed by my backstory: 

Last week I was at my wits end in utter frustration over three major roadblocks. I acquiesced and decided to try Alexa because I couldn’t get almost any of my Apple HomeKit enabled devices into HomeKit, except for new Apple products. 

I knew it had to be something small I was missing. 

Alexa was sooooo easy and quick to connect to everything, before I figured out the fix. (I dislike the echo show advertising, their echo speakers are better.) While they seemed a breeze to connect everything, for some reason I couldn’t get more than one echo speaker to work at a time. I was continually blocked from setting up Multi-Room Music or even connect a pair to play together.  

Hundreds of tries. I deleted, reset, rebooted, spent over 4 hours with Comcast yesterday (thankfully a Boston native who did not put me on hold every minute like certain countries) getting my internet working again. I had rebooted my modem and router so many times, my computer got molasses slow and I feared I went too far

In interest I also decided to try a few Google nest hub speakers. Black Friday had great sales on all this stuff. Trying to set up googles hub 7 was impossible. It wouldn’t stay connected to the internet for more than a split second before “Something went wrong” message. Probably over 70 tries. (Google is better than Echo Show. Apple HomePod mini sounds crisper and better than Amazon echo 4 and mini 5’s. But Alexa is way friendlier to interact with verbally, and price point, well...)

Frustration. Thursday, I broke down and bought my first Apple Homepod Mini to see if I can get that working and see if it works better than the Apple TV 4k Ethernet connection. The HomePod mini gave me a hint how to solve all these l connection and internet blocks. 

The HomePod mini kept telling me that I don’t have “peer-to-peer connection” allowed on my network.

Now, I’m a little techy, but it took three days (ehem, months) to finally take a chance on a for granted setting I always enable on my netgear router. It’s the blasted first Wireless page when enabling a wifi broadcast.

I had to deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation.”

That was it. It solved every issue I have come across with smart home tech for the last 4 months, ..year.

For the months that I could not solve these problems, Amazons Multi-Player Music issue made me dig deeper. I did not find anyone suggesting this particular router setting, so I thought I’d share with ppl. 

Tonight, I finally am able to simultaneously play music on all of my Echo speakers, connect my HomeKit enabled and Google nest hubs.

I’m not sure what this will do for my/your internet security. But I’m going with it for now. And I’ll try to put all devices back onto guest Wi-Fi. I’ll never really leave Apple, but after interacting with other smart speakers, it’s probably not going to be my main go to for speaker or answers to questions. Or I’ll just get too creeped out by Google and Amazon invasiveness and acquiesce with Apple instead.

Echo Studio
seems the least smart, most deaf, quiet, combative, difficult to interact with, of the three speakers. Hopefully the Multi-Room music fix will improve my experience with it

Meh. Far too much and annoying advertising of non-solicited or wanted advertisements. Least user friendly screen to work with. It sits unplugged for the most part. I mostly got this for a friend who visits who wants a YouTube fireplace playing on the tv.

I have been pleased with Smartbot plugs, switches and app, the Levoit 600s air purifiers and app (app goes by VeSync), and Lutron Caséta Light Switches and Dimmers, and hub. Lutron has the most stable and reliable app out there. I was fine running their apps separately. They are very nice, better than the big 3 apps. Well, back to listening to music throughout my house instead of one or two rooms. Joy!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Andy San Diego,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2024","I've had the ""Echo 3rd gen Smart Speaker"" for 4 years, and am surprised to see it cost $99, close to the $150 I just (July 2024) paid for the subject Echo Studio (refurbished). What a big upgrade! But not to be compared with a big hi fi speaker set-up I used to have, Harman Kardon. In Ravel's Bolero, the big crash at the peak of the crescendo would actually stop my heart. I'm trying that now on the Echo Studio, but I'm sure it won't even break any glass.
Adding this edit a few days later. The companion Echo Subwoofer will arrive today. I can't wait to see what it will add. I am optimistic. I note that the Studio delivers that special sound of Italian tenors, one I can stand for only a few minutes at a time. The point I was trying to make in my original review is that the Studio does not give out that brilliant lifelike large cymbal-like deafening crash you get with a true hi fi LP player/tuner/cabinet speakers. But, coupled with Amazon Music, the Studio, hopefully augmented by the Subwoofer, is highly pleasurable. I'll update this after I try the Sub. The performance of Bolero that Alexa came up with is not the performance I had on LP with the big speakers, so that is also a factor.
Edit August 5, 2024: First, regarding the Sub, I was not able to get it going even with about an hour on the phone with Amazon Customer Service. I couldn't pair the Sub with the Studio, and had to return it. However, I picked up the tip from another review that Alexa will increase or decrease the Studio's treble and bass. I said twice, ""Alexa, turn up the bass."" And today I asked her to play J.S. Bach. Many of his compositions include solos by viola or cello, and I find the Studio's bass satisfactory. For comparison, I reset the Studio to its original settings (hold the mic button and the volume down button for 20 seconds) and I couldn't hear any difference in the bass. Both settings sound fine.
August 8, 2024 To reinforce my favorable opinion. I just listened to the entire Sibelius violin concerto with Hilary Hahn and my morning coffee, no distractions, and enjoyed it so much. My favorite piece so far.
Today will try pairing my ""Echo 3rd gen Smart Speaker"" in another part of this room, both about 20 feet from where I sit.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Dean,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2019","This journey got started when Amazon recently announced their newly upgraded music service, Amazon Music HD.
For an audiophile, musician and music lover such as myself, this announcement was the holy grail of music. Amazon claimed you can now access millions of tracks in lossless hi resolution audio quality. But let m clear on what this really means to avoid confusion. Typical streaming services such as Spotify stream with audio quality that is sub-par to audio CD's. Amazon's new service boasts both HD audio and Ultra HD audio. When you pull up a track on the service, it designates whether it is an HD audio track, or an Ultra HD audio track. An HD audio track is CD quality, with a bit rate of 16 bits and a sampling rate from 44.1khz to 48kkhz. While many marketers tout this as lossless, it's not really lossless, but it is a big improvement over standard streaming. On the other hand, true lossless is what Ultra HD audio is all about. True lossless Ultra Audio tracks must have a bit rate of 24 bits, and a sample rate that can go as high as 192k. These are true hi-resolution audio tracks that are much better sounding than HD tracks. I was an early adopter of the now defunct DVD-Audio/SACD formats, which were true 24 bit hi-res audio, so I immediately upgraded to the new Amazon Music HD service, excited to have such a vast library of hi-res audio tracks now at my disposal.

I had recently downsized my home, so didn't have the room anymore for a true 5.1 discreet surround system anymore. I'v been using a soundbar and wasn't happy. So when Amazon introduced the Echo Studio, I took notice. After researching, I learned that the Echo Studio supports 24 bit audio, meaning it has the ability to play Ultra HD tracks. So it was time to update my audio system. I went to Best Buy the first day the Studios went on sale there, and invested in 2 Echo Studios and an Echo Sub.

In the Alexa app, you can configure these components for a home theater environment and that was my plan. I had also already owned a Fire TV Cube, which was great for streaming my content and controlling my home theater devices using voice commands. I upgraded my Fire TV Cube to gen 2 in anticipation of integrating it with my Echo Studios and Sub.

If you want Dolby Atmos soundtracks when watching movies, you need to have the Fire TV/Fire TV Cube in the mix, as the Fire TV performs the audio decoding for these surround modes. Through the Alexa app, it was relatively easy to configure the Fire TV Cube, configure each Echo Studio for left and right channel, and the sub. That is my Home Theater Group.

Now this is where things begin to derail. I said to Alexa ""Play Jack Ryan"", and I was immediately impressed with the sound emanating from the 2 Studios and the Sub. It did a great job decoding the Dolby Atmos soundtrack, and short of a true discreet surround setup, I was quite impressed. Center dialog came through nicely, soundtrack effects were presented on a nice wide soundstage, giving a nice surround illusion without actual rear speakers.

Next up, the moment I've been waiting for. Time to listen to some 24 bit hi res audio. Through the Amazon Music HD app in the Fire TV Cube, I searched for some Ultra HD tracks. Again the tracks are designated as HD or Ultra HD. I decided to play The Sound of Silence by Disturbed, which was marked as Ultra HD. ""Alexa, play the Sound of Silence by Disturbed"". Oddly, the song started playing, but it took about 5 seconds for the audio to actually kick in, cutting of the beginning of the song. The other thing I noticed was when I used the voice command, it pulled up the standard HD version of the track. I knew there was an Ultra HD version, as I had just looked for it. So I did a manual search, found the Ultra HD version and started playing it. Oddly, it sounded no different from the other version to me. The label on the screen said Ultra HD now, so this was odd. I clicked on the track information, and was surprised to learn that even though the screen label for the track is Ultra HD, the song was actually streaming at 16 bit, 44.1k audio. This is not hi-res Ultra HD at all. Any laymen would look at the screen and think they're streaming in Ultra HD because it says it's an Ultra HD track, but the track information was telling a different story.

This is where the call to tech support happened. Tech support sent some logs to the development team and them got back to me. What he tried to tell me at first, was that I was indeed listening to 24 bit audio through the Studios. How can that be possible when I'm actively streaming and it clearly says 16 bit, 44.1k. It didn't make any sense to me. Once you have the Cube integrated with the Studios, the voice interaction is between you and the Cube, not you and the Studios. Further, if you need the Cube to decode the Dolby Atmos soundtrack, then it stands to reason that the audio decoding is taking place in the Cube, not the Studios. That was my argument to the tech support guy, and he agreed that made sense. So...I've come to find out that the Cube is only capable of 16 bit audio output, not 24 bit. So the Cube is sending the audio to the Studios in lower resolution, not taking advantage of either the Ultra HD tracks in Amazon Music, or the capabilities of the Studio's hi-res audio capabilities.

So I cannot natively, in my home theater setup, issue a voice command and have Alexa play back an Ultra HD music file through the Echo Studio speakers. This was a huge let down, especially after making all this investment. But I still had one more test. If I bypass the Cube, and use the Amazon Music app in my iPhone to cast directly to the Studios, then this should give me Ultra HD audio in all its glory. I'm doing this for testing purposes only. I should have to, nor would I want to, whip out my phone in my home theater to play Ultra HD tracks. I should simply be able to issue a voice command to my home theater components, and the Amazon Music app in my home theater system should be doing it for me.

The cool thing about the mobile app version though, is when you click on the HD or Ultra HD icon, it displays the full resolution of the track, the bit and sample rates of the equipment it's connected to, and the actual resolution being played. SO now I can validate the bit rate and sampling rate going from my iPhone Amazon Music app directly to the Echo Studios. Only I can't. When I press the Ultra HD icon I get a message that says ""Information not available when casting""! What?? So I can see this info on all my other playback devices such as my car entertainment system, my headphones, but not the Studios? So I still have no idea what the actual nit and sampling rates are bypassing the Cube.

Amazon: You are touting the benefits of Ultra HD hi-res audio. You have created an audiophile speaker with the Echo Studio (supposedly) capable of playing 24 bit Ultra HD tracks. But there is no way for me to stream these Ultra HD tracks natively in my home theater, and no way for me to even validate the audio resolution from my phone direct to the Studios. So here I am with all this new equipment and still can't natively enjoy hi res audio through a simple voice command to either my Echo Studios or the Cube. Seems to me the fix would be a software update to make the Cube 24 bit. Please don't make me buy a third 24 bit Cube!",3.0 out of 5 stars
Cam,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2021","TL;DR for the Echo Studio is that the speaker, whether paired with the Echo Sub or not, running hi-fi music (I’m on Amazon HD) sounds fantastic, but there are so many glitches with it that I’m hard pressed to give it a full recommendation.

I love music, but don’t consider myself an audiophile. I’m a family man and don’t have the luxury of a dedicated “listening room,” and I’m certainly not going to spend thousands on a home sound system. I like listening to music while having my morning tea, relaxing in my bedroom, and when in my car. I have so far been using a pair of Sony XB-43 bluetooth speakers at home and they have been adequate.

I decided to look at upgrade options when I went over to Amazon HD for my streaming service (I also tried Tidal, but that’s for another review). I wanted something convenient, plug & play, and as a parent, relatively childproof. Bluetooth was not an option, as one loses most of the hi-fi benefits over bluetooth. Enter the Echo Studio. I already have a few Echo Dots, Fire TV, and as mentioned, Amazon HD Music, so it seemed like a natural fit. It should be noted however, that although Alexa Cast only works with Amazon Music, you can stream music with the other major services, Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, and others.

So I bought an Echo Studio for the breakfast area where I have my tea, and where I had previously been moving a bluetooth speaker every morning. Setup was quick and painless and I was immediately impressed with the sound. It’s not a high-end home stereo system, but it’s the best single-unit speaker system I have ever had and heard. And it’s $200.

I used the Alexa app to set the EQ, but you can simply tell Alexa to “increase bass” or “reduce treble” or make any other adjustments on the fly, mid-song or whenever you like. I see some reviewers complaining about the sound profile and wonder if they made EQ adjustments for their personal preferences or to suit the type of music being played.

Impressed, I ordered a second Studio and an Echo Sub for my bedroom. Setup and pairing the Sub was equally simple. At first I thought the Sub was defective, or not set up correctly, because I could barely hear anything coming from it. Turns out that for me anyway, it needs to be at a certain volume and playing certain music for it to really be felt. But feel it you will, as the Sub makes the music fill the room in a way that the Studio by itself doesn’t. Make sure you put the Sub on the floor.

The glitches started here, with the bedroom Studio. The music would randomly stop playing, whether during a playlist or simply when I had asked it to play music from a certain artist or genre. When I say that, I mean every single time I used it. Two or three songs and then nothing. Extremely frustrating. My wifi setup is solid, so I looked at suggestions online, and several people recommended putting your Studio on your 5GHz and cordoning it off there (everything else in the house on your 2.4GHz). I tried this, but it did not solve the problem (I ended up leaving the Studios on 2.4GHz and it has been the best option). I unplugged and went through setup on the Studio again and the problem, for the most part, seemed resolved. I took the opportunity to bump my internet tier up to improve my overall household speeds. The music on both my Studios will still stop playing occasionally though, for no apparent reason, with a strong internet connection. And they will go into “red ring” mode too, which is extremely frustrating.

Fast forward to now. Sound quality is noticeably better than my bluetooth speakers, and I mean noticeably. I am hearing guitar strings and cymbal crashes on music that I don’t remember ever hearing before. I used my bluetooth speaker last night for a bit and it was painful. There is no way I can ever go back to standard definition music streaming and bluetooth speakers. Think SD television versus HD television.

Now for the drawbacks. These things are glitchy. Music will stop playing for no reason. Voice recognition of the music or the playlist you asked for is hit and miss. The Studio itself will go into “Sorry, I’m having trouble right now” mode (red ring mode) and won’t play any music for you. At all. For five minutes or for an hour. I have to remind myself that it is a somewhat data-intensive streaming service and think back to the earlier days of Netflix and the like.

Also, while it is convenient to just tell Alexa what you want to listen to, at times I miss having the control of just playing music from my phone, and the Alexa casting is frustrating. Bring up the Amazon Music app, start playing your music (which you have to do before you get the casting button), wait for it to connect, then finally get the music going. Yes, it's probably only seven seconds, but trust me, it feels cumbersome. Again, even Netflix needs to load up.

If you happen to use a voice command directly to the Studio while casting (because when casting, you lose the Alexa voice control function from your Amazon Music app) it reverts back to Alexa app control and you’re out of casting mode (and phone control). Even if you don’t, the casting drops after a bit and you have to go through the connection process again. I’m not going to pair the Studio over bluetooth to get phone control, if I wanted bluetooth quality sound I wouldn’t have bought the Studio. (I did pair it once to check it out, and the music was at a super low volume).

It would be nice to be able to browse the music app and tap a song or playlist at any time and just have it play on the Studio as with a bluetooth connection. As it is, I have to tell Alexa to play it while I’m looking at music choices on the app and hope she gets it right. While on the Alexa app and controlling from there, sometimes it will show me the playlist I’m listening to, sometimes it doesn’t.

I also have Apple Music, as other family members are on Apple Music, and other than one time at the outset, it will play the Apple Music when requested without any problems (Amazon Music is my default setting).

As I sit writing this review, my Studio has played my music flawlessly the entire time and sounds fantastic, and this is what keeps me in the Echo Studio game and considering a third Studio to stereo pair in the bedroom with the Echo Sub (Prime Days?). If it performed this way consistently and the Alexa and Amazon Music apps integrated more smoothly, I would give the Echo Studio a 100% recommendation. I am holding out hope that future software updates will smooth out the rough edges. Until then, know what you’re getting. A sweet-sounding, self-contained hi-fi smart speaker system that will both delight and frustrate you.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Patricia West,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024","This was great until a few months ago when I noticed that they would drop out and I would only hear the bass (separate unit) It would do this erratically, but it’s getting worse. You cannot reasonably expect these units to last forever. After a time, you will need to buy more and send these to the landfill. I guess that’s what Amazon wants.

Update 8/31/24: Argh, I take it back. I got new Echo Studios and the same thing happened. Finally, through trial and error, I realized that the real problem was some kind of newly developed incompatibility between the echo subwoofer and the speakers. The subwoofer would play, but the speakers would not. Now I disconnected the subwoofer and have it in my Goodwill donation box. No further Problems with the old echo studios.

Songdog,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2024","I was told by amazon rep that the echo studio was compatible with remote. There is even a option in the alexa app to do so. After many days of frustration another amazon rep tells me that there is no compatible remote for studio. The problem with this (and all echos is that the speaker and microphone are in the same enclosure which means that if you turn the volume up past 6 then the echo becomes deaf and cannot hear you.

I have a pair of these along with a sub, and they sound really beautiful, but it sure would be nice if I could turn the volume up and still have them respond. I seriously think they need to make a compatible remote for echos. They used to make one, but no longer support it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Kevin S,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2024","I really love the sound this speaker produces while using Amazon Music. The speaker itself deserves a 5 but Amazon really needs to overhaul their music app. It’s sloppy, clunky and malfunctions and crashes frequently. An improved user interface and full app overhaul and this would be an amazing pair. The speaker however is excellent. I am pairing it with the Tidal Music App and the sound is just amazing. The speaker really does redefine how music is heard. Simply amazing.

One dislike about the speaker is that when you play a song for the first time on any given day Alexa feels the need to announce ""now playing on """" which actually interrupts and cuts off the beginning of the song you are trying to play. Not good. The developers need to update and eliminate that. I bought the speaker to hear music, not Alexa.

Also, out of the blue, Alexa feels the need to announce when the Studio is connected and what it is connected to. This happens randomly at any given hour, even the middle of the night. The developers need to fix this.

Really though, those are minor.

NEURO,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2024","I bought this mostly to get better sound from my Omni FireTV, as well as the benefits of Alexa. The sound quality is terrific, but there's a lot of issues & bugs that need to be resolved and smoothed out from the integration of Alexa/Echo Studio and other devices.

For example:
1) Although I have navigation sounds turned on for my Omni FireTV, Echo either ignores that setting or turns it off. Doesn't matter how many times I turn it back on, it turns it off every time. Before I bought Echo, this issue didn't exist.

2) The volume control on my FireTV is stepped from 1 to 100, yet on Echo it's stepped from 1-10. Why this inconsistency in volume control settings among Amazon products? So when I ask Alexa/Echo to change the volume, I only have a range of 1-10, instead of the finer resolution of the TV's 1-100.

3) Echo has issues remaining connected to the wireless home network. My wireless router is only 20' feet away, yet it's a regular occurrence for Echo to lose the connection, then create its own ad-hoc network to reconnect. Then it's a PITA process that takes several tries to get Echo to reconnect to your preferred home network. My FireTV has no issues remaining connected to my wireless network and never disconnects or drops it. Why does Echo have this issue remaining connected, even when manually chosen in the Alex app?

4) All the different color rings on Echo that mean different things makes you ignore them, because it's ridiculous trying to remember what all the different colors & pulses are supposed to mean when they light up. I ended up saving a PDF doc to my PC & phone that I open when I'm wondering what Echo is doing and flashing certain colors & behaviors. A simple solution would be a concise answer from Alexa if you ask her, 'Alexa...what are you doing?' If we're going to go full-boat on voice control AI, then do it properly & completely.

5) Why does Alexa/Echo sometimes alert you to some notifications, but not others? Why do the alerts contain no info or only vague info? Why doesn't Alexa notify me when an Amazon package is delivered, although I have that setting? All these inconsistent/incomplete behaviors are annoying and useless.

6) We need an Alexa app for the PC, instead of just the phone app, to control settings for the Echo and other Alexa devices. Please make one for the many who use PC's most of the time for home & work.

There's other issues & bugs, but I can't remember them all now.

Would I buy an Echo Studio again? Yes, because the sound is great and Alexa is handy to have for some things...but there's also numerous issues to resolve & improvements that need to be made to the Echo Studio & Alexa.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Riggs Royena,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2020","First and foremost if you are looking for standalone Bluetooth speaker, then the Echo Studio is a must buy. You'll be extremely happy and at 200 dollars its a home run on value and performance. Highly recommended for that aspect.

Now if you are using it as a home theater system, that is a whole another story. Let me first say I was intrigued by the Echo Studio because of the Dolby Atmos, 3D immersive sound, and just the whole complimentary features I would get being a Fire TV Cube 2nd gen user. First impressions, lets be honest, the Studio is big and ugly. But guys we can get over that, my wife hated the look of it as soon as I brought it into the house. It has an unforgiving presence, hate it or love it, kinda feel. Not a deal breaker for me but for some people its a viable reason to pass on the Studio.

Lets proceed, I am going to be honest, I tried my best to set the speaker up as a home theater system on my own going through the Alexa app. The first of many frustrations to come, I ended up having to factory reset it (deregister it) and call Amazon Alexa tech support to help me set it up. In my defense, I came from Homekit/ Siri/ Apple TV world where things are arguably a little more user friendly. The customer service/ tech support for Amazon Alexa services is outstanding. If I ever have to call them again for any issues, I feel confident that I will get my issue resolved over the phone. Alright so with the assistance of an Alexa technician guiding me through the process we were able to connect my Echo Studio to my Fire TV Cube. Thats what I wanted! It was a longer process than I wanted but I was finally there, probably took a couple hours to fiddle with it including the hold time and assistance over the phone. It is what it is, just a meh moment for me. But now I'm all set up and all is working.

Then through out the night we proceed.
Flood gates of frustration opens...

Before I take a dump on the Echo Studio, let me reiterate when sound comes out of the speaker it sounds really good. Standalone Bluetooth speaker its number one. Its without a doubt should be on anyone's radar looking for one. With the flexibility of all the music streaming services, solid mids and highs and house rattling bass, it is definitely a contender in this space. Price and value alone to me its hands down the winner.

Now lets talk about my deal breaking issues with the speaker.

Amazon advertises the Echo Studio as a theater system that supports Dolby Atmos using their latest Fire TV Cube, I told you that earlier and thats what lead me down this path. But there are issues on the software side that needs to be addressed before this even gets close to a theater system replacement.

Audio and video sync issues. Yes I know you are able to go into settings and tweak this, and so I did... various times throughout the night. It seemed like after awhile the audio and video sync would sway off and I would have to go back into the settings and tweak it again. A high frustration, but forgivable for the price. I could live with it and hope for updates to come with better syncing support. As long as nothing else was an issue I could deal with it, But I am now needing a flawless experience from here on out.

Unfortunately, flawless is not in the Studio's vocabulary.

Switching between Bluetooth music from my phone and theater system is an absolute nightmare and some how Amazon Music playing from the Fire Cube TV was thrown into the mix as well. Its like Freddy vs Jason, two nightmares into one. The studio can not handle and decide the proper channel to play the media without a little effort on the user end. Its hard to explain but juggling media playback for a theater system shouldn't have multiple sources; Bluetooth and Fire Cube TV that should be it. It seems like both devices are competing for attention, while the speaker should just be a speaker when connected to a fire cube.

Side note, ""Alexa, Connect to my phone."" never worked. Studio also has a hard time handling more than one Bluetooth connected device. Had to manually connect my wife's and mine's device each and every time to play music. Also a couple times I had to restart the whole set up because music wasn't playing. Restarted the Fire Cube, Studio, and phone to get music playing. My frustration is building at this point.

The final straw though was later that night while watching a show the audio without warning abruptly goes out. Video still playing but the Studio was silent. I was fed up. I wasn't going to bring something in my home that I had to babysit every night. I didn't even try to troubleshoot the issue. I did the final and last factory reset on the Studio and packaged the speaker back up to be returned.

I know I am an edge case and I am being extremely critical on some functionality , but at the end of the day, I dont want to deal with any issues. I want to set it and forget it. Give me the same sound and ugly design with a $100 higher price tag but a flawless seamless integration, I would gladly pay. I dont want to have to think when I come home, I want to flop on the couch and just watch tv. Bottom line I wanted to love the Studio, but in the end with all its perks comes unnecessary issues that I dont really need.

I DONT recommend it as a Fire TV Cube theater system set up.
I DO recommend it as a standalone bluetooth speaker.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Happy One,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2024","I've now had time to listen to pop, classical, and jazz on my new Alexa ""Studio"" device. I bought it WITH the Alexa studio sub-woofer because I knew I want as 'full' as experience as possible.
The old Echo Plus was displaced in my living room by the ""Studio"" and, although the whole set-up was more expensive than I would have liked, it's probably worth it! The sound is REALLY good and makes the Echo Plus (even though the Echo Plus was 'good') sound like a tin can with a string stretched to another tin can. Well, that may be extreme. But still, the Studio version just sounds GREAT! With classical music, the bass added by the sub-woofer is marvelous! To MY ears, there's so much bass in pop music anyway that the added bass seems barely worth it to me. But classical and jazz? Definitely worth it!
The set up was really simple. (Getting the Echo Plus to work in another room - which had an Echo Dot in it previously - has so far been fruitless. Nothing I've done in the app or otherwise has succeeded and I hesitate calling Amazon support because (1) I have a phone phobia and (2) that phobia was caused by agonizing attempts at phone support elsewhere.

I'm an audiophile (I love good sound), and this sounds good enough for my kitchen. It gets loud enough for me, but I wouldn't count on it for blasting some ""Snoop Doggy Dog"" at a party (that's an old person joke). I had some trouble learning the command to get it to play music or podcasts when coupled with my other Echo Dot in the living room. It's very specific... ""Alexa play the song Eat It by the band Weird Al on Spotify on the Everywhere group."" It's a mouthful. With little information online I was very frustrated in figuring that out at first, and I had to resort to the Alexa app that you download on your phone for setup to sort-of get the answer. There is a chat bot there which is helpful. Otherwise, not so straight forward, so I'm providing it (the group command) here for anyone else with the same problem. But now that it's working I'm happier with this product. My mother wouldn't be able to set it up alone.
You do have to raise your voice over the music to turn it down with a verbal command.
One thing I don't like is that when you ask it to play a podcast Alexa reads not only the podcast title of the show she is about to play, but also the description of the show that is usually listed below the title. It can be quite a lengthy description, so she may go on for some time before getting to the play button. Also, unless you pay for Prime Music Unlimited membership some musical functions are limited. Like a few times it wouldn't let me skip forward. That's very frustrating when The Eagles come on. Alexa will prompt you to buy the Unlimited feature with a full pitch that takes a good 20 seconds to ge through before the pesky Eagles resume. Eventually I learned how to shut off this ad, but then I got it again today when I asked it to play Led Zeppelin. Not sure why. Eventually I hope to figure out how to shut off all ads.
I also thought this device would speak Chinese, a language I am learning, but strangely it is not included in the list of 20 or so available tongues. Which is a little strange to me since Mandarin is the second most spoken language in the world. Apparently there is a language learning app you can set up, but I haven't figured that out yet. If I do I will update this review.
Beyond those issues I'm very happy with this product. If Amazon were to make a home stereo system that was wireless for your entire house, they'd do well.",4.0 out of 5 stars
cowboy,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023","If they made it easier to connect too it would be great. Im considering sending mine back to get a sonos, only because our fire tv wont connect to it, and its such a hassle using a firetv stick on a fire tv just to get audio. If they would push the home theater option to all fire tv's and sticks and what not, it would be an ok setup. But your regular tv wont connect to it, your fire tv wont connect to it.

its a real expensive speaker to add to the living room, when its so hard to integrate with the tv.
Yes i could buy a echo link. That would solve my problem. But that brings cost of the single speaker audio setup to over $350 after tax and all. You really need two studios and a link for any kind of decent theater audio. That brings total cost too $583 in washington. Tooo much for what it is.

You can hear all of the audio coming from the single point of the echo. No technical foolery they are using changes that. Its sound coming from a single point. So get two they say. The echo balls are not a great option because of lack of living room theater mounting options not to mention an audio quality mismatch with the studio. And another studio is darned expensive to fix what they sell as a one speaker theater setup. A sound bar is soooooo much better. Im going to go back to my old boston sound bar in the mean time. Sounds so much better. And i get no single point of sound problem with it.

9/3/23 Update: The connection issues have not improved for me yet. Now when i talk to them, at least twice a day, they tell me that cant help me with that because they have dropped internet connection. its not my network. i have no issues with any other devices on my wifi. I believe that the theater wifi connection and the connection to my router is too much for the studios to handle. Probably its a software issue there.
However!:
I somehow missed that it has an optical input. I have hooked them up via a fiber cable to the tv and now, every single issue ive had with connection to just the tv is solved. Now the only glaring problems is if i want to use more than one device and the constant disconnecting from wifi. I have not been able to get the Theater setup to accept that optical input. If they would allow a theater group to be set up sans TV, and then allow the audio for the group to come from a single optical input on one of the devices, it would be a much more simple and foolproof way to get the audio into the theater system. Connection issues would become far less of a problem. There may be an almost insignificant audio timing issue with that sort of setup, but thats a tiny issue thats not difficult to fix.
Anyhow if your looking for a great sound and dont mind the optical cable hooking to the back of your tv, everything including xboxs, playstations, and streaming devices like rokus will send their audio through hdmi to your tv and out via optical to your speaker.

My one last thought on the optical cable to solve problems. If you split your optical cable into two, and use two studios like i am on either side of the tv it sounds pretty great, though its not even stereo. The one thing that would make it better is if in the alexa app i could select which channel i wanted to play on each echo unit. The optical is delivering atmos, because im using passthrough on my tv. Each of the Studios could, in their onboard software, selectively play a single channel from that 8.1 channel optical signal. But the whole reason this Studio/Theater software is taking so long to fix glaring issues is because of the cuts in personnel in the alexa/echo branches of amazon. So my hope is very small.
9/19/23 update.
Im now just pissed i spent the money on them. Ive had them to long for return. They just dont work. The optical connectio has two huge issues. The DAC or something freezes and you get no audio. Have to power cycle the device to get audio back. Which is a real pain since you cant reset it through the app. The ither issue is that there is some insane crackle that goes on with audio being to loud. At those volume its fine if your connected via bluetooth.
The atmos is pure fiction with this thing. Songs i know real well are completely missing frequencies and there isnt an eq accessible in the app for the speaker. It needs so much improvement it hurts. Worth maybe $70, only because they can get pretty loud. Complete ripoff otherwise. Trash is what they are as far as i can tell.",2.0 out of 5 stars

inger lise,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","Update 3/30/24. I'm disabled and use a wheelchair. This AI Alexa thing has started doing its own routines and hunches and is now turning off my wheelchair charger at night when it's supposed to be charging-because it hears me go to sleep. It also turns lights off at night that I need left on so I can find my wheelchair. It also decides to turn on every light in the house, whether I want them on or not just because I did once.
I thought I had the Alexa hunch issue fixed by deleting all routines and schedules in the app regarding everything! However that isn't a solution either because it turned off the plug for my wheelchair charger again again last night for the fourth time! I woke to a dead wheelchair again this morning! Had to spend the day in bed letting it charge. It's plug had been turned off again during the night! For the app it does this as ""hunches"" and evidently there doesn't seem any way to turn the ""hunches"" off!
Additionally, this afternoon I discovered the Studio Sub was offline because it's plug had been turned off too by Amazon Alexa without my permission! It also turns light bulbs off at night when I need them left on so I can see to find my wheelchair!
So I called Amazon tech support just now to get help. He wasn't much more helpful than Alexa herself. He suggested I remove the routines from Alexa app. When I told him I'd done had I had already done that days ago but it only helped for a bit,, He had no solutions- no answers beyond apologizing. He did ask though if I was using Apple? So maybe this thing is not Android friendly in spite of them saying it is?
My advice is do not get anything relying on Alexa, if you are handicapped or elderly- it extremely dangerous! Amazon AI is not smart enough for disabled or elderly people yet. Alexa also has major issues hearing elderly people who have dentures, or any sort of an accent or speech impediment or stuttering
Amazon should buy this stuff back-way too primitive and dangerous.

+++ February 2024 update!
I've had this speaker for about a month. Also have it's sub. At this moment I'm sitting here spending Friday night typing instead of watching my movie, because the Studio as usual
just disconnected the speakers from the TV with a half hour yet to go on a movie! No sound at all and I can't get it reconnected! The fire stick remote won't work and Alexa Studio just keeps saying something to the effect of ""it's having issues and can't think"".....
So I decided to take a break, calm down, and write this review update! Sadly this happens on a daily basis- the connectivity issue with this thing is real, frequent and terrible! The TV, Studio Speaker and Sub are all within 10 feet of our router! No reason for all the issues! When it's good it sounds amazing- but unfortunately having it cut out in the middle of the movie is nothing but frustration. The Studio also has trouble understanding things. It has trouble understanding the simplest of commands and stops movies or YouTube shows, for no reason, or starts talking about topics or showing topics on YouTube that I didn't even ask for- eavesdrops a lot. If I actually need anything Alexa related I usually go back to the bedroom and ask the Echo Dot instead!
I had Amazon tech support contact me because of my one star original review and unhappiness with this. They were able to resolve the buzzing issue the speakers had. Turns out moving them further away from our older metal filled TV helps. So they're now 5 ft away from the TV and in the middle of the room and the buzzing issue is resolved.
However they're in the middle of the room.....
I find the connectivity issue appalling in view of the fact that everything else made nowadays comes Plug and Play!
Because of this ongoing issue that Amazon seems to not be able to resolve, I still do not recommend this Studio speaker at all!

Original review -
This has been a problem since setup- it's definitely not Plug and Play. You would think that something from the same company would hook up easily together, but sluggish updates and incompatible connectivity issues made it take an entire weekend to set up. And if you move it? You have to start all over again. This speaker is buzzy already and I've only had it a few weeks. Have to keep it at low volume which defeats the whole purpose of having it.
Additionally it's about half as smart as the Dot I have in the bedroom. 'Studio"" doesn't listen or understand me most of the time. For example, I asked it to play Teskey Brothers. And it starts talking about super bowl instead! And it stops the music on the rare occasions it does play what I want- so it can play commercials for things that it wants to sell from Amazon!
I so regret that the return window has passed.
Save your money for something else. This thing's 10% enjoyment and 90% aggravation.

I just decided to try saying, ""Alexa, decrease bass"" and it flashed and while I could not tell for sure, I tried another command, ""Alexa, decrease bass to minimum"" then afterwards I said ""Alexa, increase bass to max"" and there was a significant difference. Alexa confirmed my settings were applied when I tried to increase bass after being already maxed out and Alexa responded by saying, ""Bass is already set to max."" This also works with Treble. Hope this helps some of you out.

Dolby atmos does not work on PC and it sounds like a mid to low end stereo over bluetooth. This was confirmed through the Dolby Access app for the PC. I hope to find out that I am wrong about this. I did read that I can supposedly get up to 5.1 surround but it requires another adapter that I just placed an order for and will update to see if it actually works. Aux cable does not register to my PC or smartphone at all and customer service technician could not figure out how to get it to work and stated they will send me an email with instructions within 30 minutes. It has been several hours as of this review with no updates.

I always find that most people who say the sound quality of a certain speaker is excellent/audiophile quality usually have no idea what they're talking about. I would bet most are running this over bluetooth and not realizing it does not allow the full features of what this speaker supposedly can put out. It has a punchy bass and that causes the illusion that the speakers sound better. As far as I know, this product requires a cable to utilize its dolby atmos, and the Amazon service tech could not confirm or deny this. However, read the description that says it works with the latest Firesticks and other devices but not with older gen. Perhaps this means for TVs, you can still wireless connect over bluetooth and utilize dolby atmos.

I have not tried it on a TV for dolby atmos but as stated above, the description implies you may need to get an optical cable to connect with your TV for the dolby atmos. However, one of my biggest problems with this is that you cannot adjust sound settings. I don't want the bass on at night because I don't want to disrupt my neighbors, and there is literally no way to adjust that or any other highs/mid/lows. I'm hoping the optical cable will allow me to adjust settings with the sound card driver on my PC.

On a similar note, it is worth mentioning that not being able to adjust the bass affects the sound quality of movies, as it often adds too much bass to the voices of the actors and sounds odd. Additionally, it adds almost a reverb to the voice, which I tried adjusting through windows sound settings by turning off spatial sound and digital surround. Nothing seems to fix the issue. I have loudness equalization turned on and while it helps movies and music, the Alexa notifications come out at a significantly louder volume to the point where I have to turn it down only to have to turn the volume back up when I resume a movie or playlist.

This device doesn't allow you to use the built in mic for the majority of apps outside of Amazon but it will set the default mic on your PC to the Echo Studio. This is annoying because you will have to manually go into every single app that the Echo mic does not work and change it back to your original mic.

In any case, until I can hear how it sounds with dolby atmos or even 5.1 surround, I would say do not believe the hype that these are audiophile quality as they sound worse than my $70 bluetooth speakers. These don't sound bad, just don't expect to be blown away over bluetooth.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Sami,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024","I actually ended up here to write this review because I thought they didn't make these anymore. I remember hearing about the Amazon hardware group suffering cuts last year, so when I saw this thing hasn't been axed yet, I wanted to offer my support since I have loved it for 4 years now.

I'm not an audiophile, but I care more about sound quality than your average person. Also, I'm not one of those people that has the luxury of buying 10 different products and comparing them, so my assessment is somewhat limited in that regard. But all that really matters, I think, is that this thing blew me away day one, and it's going strong 4 years later.

We have it in our main living room/kitchen/dinette which has 10 foot ceilings and is an open concept with total footprint of about 30'x20' and this thing does a very solid job of filling the room. Of course, bigger, dedicated speakers would sound better, but then you have to screw around with an AV receiver, multiple pieces, running wires (or at least power for each speaker), and trying to make it all look good. This thing looks sleek at one end of the 20'x30' room, has a single necessary cord (power), and provides impressive sound given the tight package everything is crammed in.

I understand there are other speakers out there that would sound just as good, if not better (Bose, Sonos, etc.), but I want to emphasize that this is phenomenal for the $200 price point.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Townie,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2024","First unit arrived used and damaged, so Amazon sent me a second that was brand new. We are using both for music (mostly). I use Amazon Prime Music HD and my wife uses Spotify. Spotify works very well and seems to be stable. Amazon Prime Music is very buggy. Firstly, if it continues playing similar music, it always replays the last song already played first. Secondly, it cannot distinguish between different artists with the same name and so you get some random musical styles. Thirdly, the Amazon Music phone app and the device lose sync regularly. The Alexa phone app and the device also lose sync regularly, so there is no way to reliably see what is currently playing. Sometimes fast forwarding a song will cause the message ""an error has occurred"" and sometimes a song will not play even though it is available and has played previously. Sometimes songs that are unavailable will play, which is a bonus...

Sound quality wise I find the unit sometimes sounds excellent and balanced and sometimes sounds trebly and sibilant, there is no rhyme or reason to how it will sound. Sometimes the bass speaker will stop working and you have to reboot the unit (I had to reset it and re-set it up from scratch).

The front firing tweeter does not produce any sound with spatial audio disabled (and hardly produces any sound with spatial audio turned on). So most of what you hear is the two side firing speakers and the bass speaker (when it chooses to work). The upward firing speaker seems to also only work with spatial audio enabled. This is an issue because spatial audio does not sound good on all material. Material specifically developed with it in mind sounds great, but everything else sounds echo-ey.

Note also that there is no volume leveling feature for any of the music services, so you will play one song and then the next will be 5 times louder, so you are constantly asking Alexa to change volume. This is, of course, unless you use it with Bluetooth, but the sound quality won't be as good.

As a smart speaker, when the unit works properly it sounds really good - in fact it almost seems to break the laws of physics, it sounds so large. Hopefully there will be a fix for the non-spatial material (getting all the speakers to actually work) and the instability.

As for the smart part, it is useful for news and weather, but trying to get suggestions on where to buy something for example comes up with completely inappropriate results. For example, asking where you can buy ""home décor items"" will get suggestions for coffee shops or bakeries mixed in with chain stores. Also, be careful if you banter with the unit because there is a chance you could accidently subscribe to an entertainment subscription service.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Dopest Nerd on the Block,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2020","Received the echo studio yesterday, I've only got about an hour of listening in. Wrote the following while listening and setting it up.
1. Could not get studio connected to my 5g network, only 2.4g. I haven't looked into it yet.
2. Setup and integration into my existing Alexa set-up was easy.
3. Looks great
4. It's no audiophile speaker but definite improvement over the echo and echo plus.
5. Immediately the vocals are center stage. The three 2"" mid driver's project the sound around the room while not letting the vocals get lost.
6. The 1""tweeter delivers bright crisp highs
7. And having a 5¼"" speaker to handle the lower frequencies in the music really makes this speaker sound and feel like a bookshelf style speaker. I may just have to purchase another for pairing into a stereo set.

I'm going to pair the studio with my echo sub just to hear.

I've been playing the echo studio for a bit now. Playing songs from different genres, 80's, 90's, 2K, Amazon music 3D, HD, and ultra HD.
First impression... Compared to echo and echo plus. Eq flat and spatial enhancement on.
1. Noticably louder
2. Highs more present and crisper
3. Vocals not as muffled

I temporarly have the echo studio in a bedroom I converted to a small home theater. Room is 12ftx12ft with 10ft ceiling. Speaker was placed in center of room on foot rest/table. (Amazon suggest having it 6"" from a wall. I'll play with that later when I figure out where it works best in it's possible final destination, the family room.) The echo studio filled the room. I was sitting on the couch in front of the echo studio. With my eyes closed I could follow the sound around the room like a globe. When I would turn off the spatial enhancement you could hear and feel the ""sound globe"" get smaller and closer to the speaker.

The first 3d song on the playlist Alexa tells you to ask to play was a bad example. ""The steps"" by Haim. There are weird distortions in the music. I thought too myself (what a wonderful world. You know that's where your brain wanted to go) this is horrible sounding. Turned off the spatial enhancement (SE) and still not good. Went to the next song and was relieved that it was the song and not the speaker.

As I said earlier I played a handful of songs from Amazon music. Turning on/off the SE, adjusted the EQ a little. It's tough with Amazon music, the sound quality from song to song (unless they're all on one album) is super inconsistent. You don't notice this on the dot and if your listening you can almost kind of hear it on the echo and echo plus. But it's pretty tough to hear unless you know what to listen for. As the quality of your speaker or system gets better, the distortion, compression become more noticeable. Before subscribing to the HD music I couldn't even listen to Amazon music in my car without cringing from the distortion, inconsistent compression, and/or hollow sounding songs (Lincoln Parks ""hybrid theory"" is a good example of distorted highs. And it sounds like it was recorded in a tin can) HD subscription helps the sound quality a lot but doesn't eliminate the issues.

Overall I like what I heard. Definitely need to play with it some more. Let the speakers get broke in. After about 30-50 hours overall sound should warm up and be a bit smoother.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jason,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2023","My reviews are long to provide my reason for purchase, how I like it, etc...if you don't care for all that...here's the short version: Sound is amazing coming from a 3rd Gen dot, not quite the highs or lows a proper speaker setup provides, but it's space saving compared to that and produces very balanced room filling sound.

Full Review:
I purchased this as an early family present to replace a Gen 3 dot and Gen 1 dot, the sound blows of those away. Even at first plugin, it started up with a tone that more or less spanned the range of what the Studio can handle...everyone's head turned at me in awe, including myself. My family loves music..lots of music...from K-Pop to Metal, and everything in between. The size of the Studio is definitely larger than the dots, comparable to a medium sized pot. While the sound quality is better b
than the Gen 3 dot in both fidelity and clarity, it is still behind proper 2 or 2.1ch+ speaker setups, in case there are some hoping to replace that (again we love music and enjoy it as close to how t was intended). That said, if it's
an upgrade to one of the smaller Echo models and/or tired of connecting to a larger speaker system (this is my case) for sound, the Studio is the way to go. The sound the Studio puts out is well balanced: highs, mids and lows are not muddied together nor tinny. The fidelity and clarity is wonderful coming from a single small device and with the multiple speakers built in, the Studio fills a room with sound with ease; whether it be for background music or for listening to the latest album. I still prefer the sound that my tower speakers and sub produces...but it satisfies my families ears without the need to tell Alexa to first connect to speaker...really it's so good that I'm looking into getting a second to further enhance the Soundstage, better separation of left and right, of an already phenomenal Echo speaker.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Tall woman,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2021","Once I start this review I would like to mention that I did a lot of research before I purchased the Echo Studio product. My 7 year old Sony sound bar for my TV suddenly died and was not fixable or in order to fix it was too pricey. Let me first say this product is for a second home and the room functions as a bedroom and entertainment room. This room is not a home theater so what I am trying to describe is I didn’t need a robust sound system based on the room size and function. Also, I did want a system (speaker) where I could listen to music and have good sound from the TV. Finally, I should mention I have Play1 Sonos speakers (1st Generation so no smart functions) at my primary home. Okay, understanding all those areas let me provide my review…

I have had the Echo Studio for about 2 ½ months and the sound is very good with the music and playing through the TV in the size of the room as I described above. The smart functions are nice to have but I will be honest I don’t really need to have them. Based on the research I did and reviews on Amazon and outside of Amazon said the sound from speaker was almost as good as the Sonos play1 speakers and I have to disagree. My personal opinion is the sound from Sonos is much better and the functions with Sonos app are 95% better for music lovers. What do I mean by that statement is I feel there are limits with the Echo Studio based on functions and performance for music lovers or as a primary speaker for music and tv in a smaller size room. The following list below includes the limitation of the echo studio.
• Always defaults to Amazon Music ( I recently changed the function within the app to my favorite music platform but Alexa still goes to Amazon music but not as much). If I want it to go to a favorite station of mine I need to be specific in my statement by naming the station exactly. And I am finding this very annoying b/c on my Sonos I have them saved and just go to the app and play them. So I have to look them up everytime if I want the echo studio to play them. This is a big fail for me.
• Unable to save favorite stations
• Doesn’t have the capability to store recent playlist or station. For example, if I like what Alexa did pick I say save that station and she communicates that function does not exist.
• Also, I don’t find the Alex app helpful when it comes to the music element as the Sonos App is. Sonos app is seamless to me. Also, I love the Sonos app in terms of saving the history of what the user has listen to and I can store favorites.
• The search function in the Sonos app is great because I can see all the options to play from all my linked music platforms.
I want to communicate to those individuals who are music lovers and are using many online platforms for their music. And understanding the difference between the two products. If you are reading this review and your in the market in purchasing a speaker for music and to play through the TV. I would highly recommend Sonos speaker b/c it is seamless more flexibility and more functions within the Sonos app that is not offered through the Alex app. This is why I am doing this review b/c that was not mention in my research and if I had known I would have spent more money for those functions and flexibility. I realized that I did get a better price but for me at what cost. I will say I am good with my echo studio and it does sound good. But if I had known what I know now, I would have gone with a Sonos speaker. I wanted to provide this information for anyone who is on the fence like I was….",3.0 out of 5 stars
Amanda Benson,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2023","Pros:
If you are using Amazon Music Unlimited and have a large library of Dolby Atmos songs, you will love the depth of sound from the Echo Studio.

Cons
Non Atmos/360 songs sound like a cheap AM radio. Mono/Echo sounding. You can disable the ""Spacial Enhancement"" option in the Alexa app which helps a little, but the speaker should be smart enough to play lower quality formats.

I'm including comments on the Amazon Music app here because the speaker can't be used without ""some"" app, and the Amazon App is what I use.

So many things wrong with the app.

View library by Album and it sorts by recent activity instead of Album name. Same if you view by artist.

If you don't have Music unlimited your playlists are useless. Amazon ""says"" users asked for access to a bigger song library so their solution is to mix random songs into your playlist. BS.

They changed the definition of library. My library used to contain songs I purchased and playlists. Now it contains everything.

Can't see the quality of the song you are playing. Plenty of room to show it on the now playing screen but they don't. Why? They don't want you to see how many songs are not high quality I guess. Maybe they just have bad designers, developers.

No volume control in the app. They have one in the Alexa app. So you have keep both apps running, which you really need to anyway to enable/disable the spacial enhancement option.

Optical line-in port is almost useless. Go read the forums. Too much to include here.

Seems like every ""enhancement"" they've made to the app lately is a step backwards.",4.0 out of 5 stars
GreatNorth,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2022","To start with: the Amazon Music App and Alexa app don't play nice together, but its getting better; Alexa app likes priority power! Also flipping from app to Fire 4K Max has interface issues. It's getting old unpairing speakers and clearing caches... When music or movies stop for 10 minutes, it should default to next command pinging it and not mate for life!!....

The software issues aired... I bought two of these with the sub to justify my monthly unlimited music fee along with the Prime membership; both of which keep going north.... I am old enough to remember when the Dire Straights Brothers in Arms CD DDD cost $26 bucks, but if you had a CD player, this was a life changing listening experience! So I'm conditioned within reason, but am a frugal value buyer.

I am a self proclaimed audiophile, but that is arbitrary based on your music, room, ears and budget, but I have always paid up for ""Hearing"" sound value. A $10k amp/pre sounds only as good as your speakers. No the Studios aren't that, but for a smart Alexa speaker you can't engineer or make a speaker set for your $200 investment. Amazon is even or losing on selling these to get you enrolled in the unlimited music; HD, ultra HD, Atomos, 3D etc... and it works. Very smart.

Will they make a TV sound experience better, obviously, compared to factory tv pairings. Will they play your music subscriptions epic on your go to listening personal high end system, blow your hair back, chair? That is your call. Prime: return if not. My easy answer is that Amazon doesn't currently make a better speaker with the versatility the studio has, and I own everything they sell related to sound... truly.

Amazon isn't intentionally trying to price themselves out of the music streaming services and the value here is that they are committed to getting it right. Many of the settings adjustments have been firmware updated to work as it should of been from origin, but tip of the hat for addressing weaknesses. Most high end audiophile speaker companies aren't going to swap out the cross-overs or update the digital footprint because you spent $35k on a set of speakers you think should clear the air better. Get a calculator out. $200x amazon customers, x customers who subscribe to music and movies..... it's millions
$$$! Amazon will stay proactive and reactive when necessary to keep us happy! Buy the speaker/s, it's a brilliant 150-200 dollar investment considering a tank of gas is $100. Money well spent, stress well relieved and a chance to re-listen to music, that doesn't sound the same as it did over the years. It's incredible what smaller size chambers/arrangements deliver these days, it's a new digital ballgame; Get in it!",5.0 out of 5 stars

The spatial processing makes the sound worse...at least in the room I have it in. Small room...15' x 15'.

*After submitting my review an Amazon Outreach Representative called me to see if they could help and troubleshoot the problem. Basically a reset and maybe move to a different location. So I did and I have to admit, not a whole lot of difference. I did move the speaker closer to where I sit so yes, sound is definitely better but that's just because it's closer. All that being said...I do appreciate that they reached out so they get a star for that. I might still do a full-on factory reset and see what happens...",3.0 out of 5 stars
Rob in Boston,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2023","""Spatial Audio"" is NOT A SETTING on Echo or Alexa. It's a playlist that you must request verbally while operating Alexa once you have Amazon Music Unlimited (which you must purchase additionally as with other music platforms.) If you are already an Amazon Prime member, the added five bucks is worth it. With Amazon Music Unlimited, Alexa becomes your slave). Understand, with basic Amazon Music, the sound is suppressed (It sucks.) It's better to fork out a few more bucks for the Unlimited (and you're the boss). 2) Once you pay for Amazon Music Unlimited, the sound improves significantly. 3) ""Spatial Sound"" IS NOT A SETTING for your device. It's merely a marketing ploy. It's simply a playlist that only works if you subscribe to Amazon Music Unlimited. THERE IS NO SETTING ON ALEXA FOR ""SPATIAL SOUND."" Once you have Amazon Music Unlimited, you say to Alexa (on your Echo device), ""Alexa, play the best of spatial audio playlist."" What you get is random pop music, most of which is redundant and not rewarding. Keep your settings basic. Do get Amazon Unlimited because you are in command. You can skip without suppression at any time. If you ask Alexa a general question, it's usually okay, but sometimes it's ridiculous how badly a question can be misinterpreted. I like my Echo Studio. It doesn't allow much finessing of the volume. I'm searching for a compatible 16 band equalizer (which probably doesn't exist) but it tells you I'm encouraged by the sound of this device. Don't be confused about ""Spatial Audio."" Also, keep the basic sound settings once you have the Echo Studio speaker. You can adjust simply by commanding: ""Alexa bass up,"" or ""Alexa, mid rage down,"" Or, ""Alexa Treble up 1,""etc. The same with volume. That's all I got.

Judith F Wagner,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2023","I own numerous echo devices, from the Shows to the Dots and Towers and Fire tablets, so I'm all in the Amazon ecosystem. I bought a Fire TV and then this Studio to use as a speaker last year. I have not gotten the Studio to work well with the TV yet. First, I tried Bluetooth, but the sound and lips would not sync, no matter how much I played with it. Then I tried Amazon Home Theater. This eliminated the sync issues, but the TV and the Studio would unpair every couple of DAYS. I did a factory reset on the Studio and then had trouble connecting it to a strong internet signal, so I set it next to the router to connect to the internet. I also tried using an optical cable to hard-wire the two but all I got were crackling noises. So I went back to Amazon Home Theater -- and I always have to reconnect the Studio and TV, after unplugging them both -- a real pain. I was going to get a second Studio and the Echo subwoofer, but not now because of my experience with this Studio and Fire TV (both Amazon products); just not staying connected. If anyone knows how to fix it, please post. Thanks

Aug 22, 2023. I'm updating my review as Amazon Home Theater seems much more stable, so I'm increasing the stars on the Studio to 4. My main problem was never the sound, but the connection between the studio and my Fire TV. I am only losing the connection between the Fire TV with the Studio maybe once every two weeks now vs. once every two days. I'm pretty sure it's on the Studio side as when I go to reconnect, the Fire TV doesn't recognize the Studio that is sitting next to it. I try the next day and it works. So I'm going to be brave and get the second Studio and see if I can really get a home theatre system going. The home theater still baffles me as I have FIOS's top internet package so it should support everything. To give Amazon kudos, someone called me on this, but I couldn't recreate the problem with regularity, so it was impossible to work with them.",4.0 out of 5 stars

To install you plug them in and wait for the orange flashing circle on top, which indicates setup mode. Then open your Alexa app with your phone near the studio, and follow directions. Both units gave me some connection issues initially, but I got them resolved. The one in my living room wouldn't connect to the 2.4 Ghz wifi. I had to connect to the 5GHZ. The router is 8' away. Also, it asks which room it is in. For the one in the bedroom I answered Bedroom. The light switch in the bedroom then had to be renamed. The same thing happened in the living room. So, the install was a bit of a hassle.

Greg W.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2021","While it is true that, to date, the Echo Studio paired with another and the Echo Sub is one of the best ways to listen to Amazon Music Unlimited, there are some drawbacks.

The first is probably the price. You really don't need to pair two together if you can't afford it and the Echo Sub does not automatically add as much bass by default as you would like.

I don't want to split hairs, but the Echo Remote works with the Echo Studio much better in one-speaker format.

In paired mode, you can sync the remote, you can change the volume, and bypass the wake word with the press of a button, but you can't skip forward or go back with two of them working as a 2.1 system just with a press.

I hope Amazon addresses this with a software update or that I am the only one for whom this happens. I sincerely doubt Amazon addresses this as they do not sell the remotes on their website anymore. It's a shame. I really prefer using the remotes.

When you set these devices up on your smartphone or tablet, I learned the hard way that you need to re-enter your same address multiple times and label your rooms correctly for the sake of organization and using the drop-in feature.

As for the sound quality of the streamed music, it's very good, but not excellent.

It's very difficult for streamed music to sound great. I've listened to vinyl records and CD's and DVD Audio and music that was advertised as lossless, but streaming music for the time being is compressed by algorithms. Most people know that. And you know you're being robbed of sounds or data that make the file small enough to stream.

If you are an audiophile, buying one of these Echo Studio devices was never on your to-do list.

But the Echo Studio makes for a decent smart speaker. I like that I can control the thermostat and dim lights without spending much effort.

I've owned previous generation Echo devices that had built-in thermometers. The Studio dropped that feature.

I should tell you that I have also used Google Home and it seems to be more capable of answering my more complex questions.

Yes, your smartphone is smarter. Your computer is obviously smarter.

Basically, what I am saying is the Echo Studio is better than previous models from Amazon.

I got what I paid for because I had realistic expectations. And it sounds very good on its own.

I like that it adjusts to the acoustics of the room automatically when moved to new locations.

To sum up: I like it. It has its limitations, but I like it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
TheFirstMongoose,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2020","Pretty good speaker. Bad exchange policy and customer service. I purchased two of these on Prime Day, since they were $50 off MSRP for a total of $100 savings. Tested both of them out and paired them together with the Echo Sub. Played music fine. Somewhat drowned out the bass from the subwoofer, but music was nice and clear. There really is no way to independently turn up the bass just on the Echo Sub since they are all connected now(two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub). Amazon needs to invest in these tweaks that would make a big difference.

I discovered a day later that one of the Studios had a low static noise whenever I asked Alexa a question. It wasn’t on the other one/speaker. So I tried to troubleshoot and went through everything. Changing the WiFi band from 2.4 to 5.0 and back. Changing to different outlet. Unplugging for a few minutes. Nothing worked. Very noticeable if your within 3 feet and asking Alexa a question. When playing music however, the static seemed to disappear or so I thought. When the music is turned down, the static was still there. So I decided to call Amazon technical services. A tech/representative went through all the troubleshooting methods I had already tried and we determined that the speaker was faulty. I agreed to just have it replaced. When he was telling me on how to ship the faulty speaker back, he mentioned to not include any cords or pamphlets. That raised a red flag and I asked if I was receiving a new or refurbished unit for a replacement. He said he doesn’t know or would not know until it ships. So I end the call with him and go to my Amazon account to look at the replacement being shipped. It’s a REFURBISHED! Nothing wrong with refurbished, but I bought new not refurbished. So Amazon should be replacing with a new one. Right out of the box there was a static. It’s not like I used it for a month. So I called back and tried to explain to a different representative. Come to find out, Amazon’s policy to correct such issues is either to refund your money or replace with new OR refurbished unit(their call), when it comes to Amazon devices. My argument is that this is a brand new device that was defective, sending a refurbished one should have NEVER been an option. What complicates thing now even more is that they are out of stock on new Studios. None expected in until a month and a half later. The second representative ended up canceling the refurbished replacement and said I can wait until they get new Studios in to do the exchange since she can’t even order a replacement due to the lack of stock. Either case, I’m not very happy on how this was all handled. Decent sounding speaker, but if you get a lemon, be prepared to get a refurbished one as an exchange. Or be vigilant like me and question it. I did notice other reviewers stating receiving replacements coming in generic boxes....those are refurbished. And there’s nothing wrong with refurbished if you originally bought refurbished or if you have owned that device for a number of days, weeks, months. That wasn’t my case.

Clinton W. Salvato,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2020","I had been looking at, and watching reviews of the Echo Studio since it was announced last year, and had decided, it was a product, that I initially wanted to get my hands on, and at least test.

Since I have been happy with my Echo Plus 2nd Gen, and Echo Dot 3rd Gen, I put the studio on the back burner.
Earlier this month, I just happened to be at my local Best Buy, and they had a couple in stock, so I decided to grab one.

First Impressions:
The studio looks and feels to be well built
It seems to be able to fit into a good amount of places, although I've only had it in one so far, but (judging by that location) leads me to believe, even though the largest echo speaker, that it can fit anywhere (within reason).
The sound is extremely well balanced, at least for the majority of music I listen to, and even a good stereo mix is immersive on this speaker, the left and right channels come out clear, and it's NOT just stereo, it does immerse you, however, I have noticed that it depends on the style and recording quality of the music as to how well that works. As others have mentioned in reviews, by default the Echo Studio has a Spacial feature enabled to enhance stereo. I'll leave this up to YOU to turn it off, or leave it on. I will leave this suggestion, if you don't have a technical background in audio, and want to keep things simple turn this off in the Alexa app under settings:device settings: your echo studio:audio settings. I say this because it's essentially what Dolby Pro Logic, and other similar technologies do to simulate surround sound from stereo. Some music it actually helps and gives a nice affect to, and others it distorts, and actually makes sound worse. Putting that aside though Audio sounds really good through this device, and the bottom line is, to get the best performance, you can't always use the defaults, or someone else's settings, because there are too many variables. that can change.

Other things I've found to share, Initially I had WiFi issues with the 5ghz channel, because the Echo doesn't get full signal where it's at here, but switching to the 2.4ghz channel has made things more stable, not just for the echo studio, but features like multi room music, and overall performance. My advice here is:

Yes, 2.4ghz is going to be a slower channel then the 5Ghz one in many cases. However, for an audio only device such as an echo without a screen, it's not going t make a difference in performance. So if issues with Wifi, and it's on the 5ghz channel, try setting it to 2.4. Amazon even recommends this, in their help article on updating and troubleshooting Wifi settings with echo products. Let me rephrase that, they suggest 5ghz for faster performance but suggest 2.4 for better stability and signal range.

Bottom Line:
The echo studio is a great smart speaker with a unique design and purpose. As always, while the sound is great from this device, it's not a replacement for a dedicated surround system. If you're ok with this fact, and still want to try this product, I recommend it 100%.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jeff Helmes,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2020","Alexa works flawlessly. Big plus since I bought it to replace a glitchy stereo pair of 3rd Gen Echoes in bedroom used for music & ocean wave sounds to help drift off to sleep. The stereo pairing suffered frustrating dropouts, with one or sometimes both speakers quitting in the middle of songs & very rarely played the ocean sounds through morning. But so far the Studio has worked perfectly.

However, in spite of the Dolby Atmos credentials, the Studio doesn’t sound nearly as spacious as the paired Echoes (which I had in opposite corners of the room on the headboard wall, mounted about 5 feet high on candle sconces.) Paired also with an Echo Sub, this filled the room with sound rather nicely... well, whenever it all worked simultaneously. But the glitches simply became untenable, so I grabbed a Studio during Prime Day...

At first I put the Studio near a corner of the room on a dresser, pointing the front toward the bed. Sounded tinny. Made sure I had upgraded to Amazon HD & played Best of 3D... Still barely any immersion of sound whatsoever. Very disappointing. Moved speaker to center of wall, still on dresser... Better but still not very impressive. (And yes I did keep the Echo Sub, now paired to the Studio.) I let it play all day while at work to break in the speaker & allow the room tuning to recalibrate... No avail.

Finally I moved the Studio to a speaker stand, centered on the far wall facing the bed. The sound was significantly improved. Still not what I’d expect from a product claiming Dolby Atmos, but certainly better sound immersion. I think the side-firing speakers work far better in space, rather than bouncing sound off a near surface. Clearly the Studio is intended to point at the listener’s face & it must to achieve any reasonable degree of sound immersion. Regardless I did prefer the sound of paired Echoes with Sub over the Studio + Sub... but not enough to go back to all the frustrating glitches.

No doubt paired Studios would sound better than the paired Echos, but I don’t want to return to the annoying dropouts. Besides for $300-400, a stereo pair of Sonos Ones would be better sounding with rock solid reliability.

Bottom line is I will stick with the Studio because it has been so reliable & good enough sounding for a bedroom. The Echo pair absolutely demanded a Sub for quality music. However the Studio doesn’t depend on it since it has a woofer, unlike all other Echoes. So at $150 (on sale) I would recommend a Studio for a bedroom or kitchen where music will be played, but stereophile audio quality isn’t required. But for a living room or den where you may prefer excellent sound quality, I would highly recommend a Dot & a stereo pair of Sonos One SLs, or better yet the Sonos Five.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Pablo Freddy Man,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2020","I LOVE LOVE LOVE these speakers. I bought two of them and have them paired up. So far it has been amazing. Here's what I love about them:
- In paired mode, the speakers sound incredible. I have tried both ""spatial"" and ""non-spatial"" settings and both sound pretty good.
- I recently upgraded my fire TV to a fire stick 4K and the dolby sound that comes when watching a movie/show is outstanding
- Speaker is so good that I sold off my regular speakers which were really nice, but I truly don't need them anymore
- microphone pickup is outstanding. even if music is playing I can say Alexa and usually it hears me
- When compared to the google mini I had, I notice that the home automation stuff I have is faster. Like ""Alexa turn on kitchen light"" it responds instantly

Cons:
- I have spotify and frankly spotify integration sort of sucks. I can't say ""shuffle music"", i doesn't work. if i say ""play more songs like this"" it doesn't work. playing of music will just stop mid-stride for no reason. even ""play that song that goes shake it like a polaroid picture"" doesn't work. i'm really disappointed with spotify on echo studios. so i tried out amazon music with a free offer, and guess what? of course everything works perfectly. i'm a little bit bothered that i may have to migrate from spotify or change to a different type of speaker. with my google mini, spotify worked perfectly.
- i have my speakers paired, and because of this, using the communication feature of the echo studio when paired doesn't work. i found out it will only work if i unpair the speakers. i submitted a bug but there's been no fix for weeks. irritating!
- the speakers can be buggy. sometimes the speakers will unpair for no reason. i had initially setup my speakers on a different wi-fi network name. so i changed it to the one I want. i went to amazon and told it to not remember any old wi-fi names. but for some reason, they would randomly re-connect to the old connection. I finally did a factory reset and did it all again and now it seems to work without switching back.

Pretty much what I have come to believe/realize is that these speakers are all about the amazon echo-system. I don't see a priority for it to work with spotify because they want you to switch to amazon music. The hardware itself is great, so I may actually follow what they planned and switch to amazon music. But I'm irritated about it. The alexa app is okay, but kind of buggy.

So I would've given it 5 stars, but give it 4. I'm still extremely happy because I love the sound from teh paired speakers. and watching movies with atmos is amazing, like for the first time i feel like you can hear sounds coming from the side or further away or atmospheric sounds. my old home theater system never sounded this good.

If you're a huge spotify user, I'd stay away and maybe go for the Sonos. But if you're ambivalent about your music service, this works perfect with amazon music. And so far with my fire stick 4k the sound with the paired speakers is amazing.",4.0 out of 5 stars

So, I've had a pair of Gen2 Echo+ and Echo Sub for some time. I like overwhelming bass in all music; I don't want to have the volume on +10 to feel the bass. The Echo 6"" sub is decent for what it is. I have the two Echo+ and Sub stereo grouped with FireTV Cube for 2.1 sound while watching TV (only from FireTV). Sounds very good for what it is. Now I've purchased 2 Echo Studio speakers as well in hopes the larger drivers will 'fill' the bottom end. Honestly, if you like your head ripped off by too much midrange (1K, 1.2K, 5K, etc), then these are for you; The Studios have no 'heart'. I used to run sound for our band and I know when there's too much of something in the mix; FWIW. I turn the Studio mids all the way down -6 and drop the treble to -2 and set bass to +6 then the Studios sound just 'ok'. So, I paired my Echo Sub with the Studios to see if that balances it out. Nope... No matter what I set the EQ to or turn spatial on or off, makes no difference with any kind of music (3D or not). The Studios actually attenuate the sound coming out of the Echo Sub. Far less bass paired up with Studio than Echo+. I'm seriously considering returning the Studios and getting 2 more Echo+ and another sub. (all of this stuff would benefit from more user EQ and crossover adjustment). In a final attempt to get 'MY' preferred sound out of all of this I created an Echo+ stereo pair with the Echo Sub, then just stereo paired the Studios together, set all EQ accordingly, then created an ""Everywhere"" group out of all of that. In that configuration the Studios aren't attenuating the sound from the sub. One would think that the size of the drivers on the Studio would trump the Echo+ as far as low end, but nope. W/e these things are doing is wrong IMO. It is true that Studio is clearer than Echo+, but to what end? Not a good one IMO... When I turn the EQ to +6 Bass, I expect the thing to thump (within reason for a 4""+ woofer). If I had a wish it would be that Amazon Echo releases an 8"" 800+ watt Echo Sub (with a decent user adjustable EQ) so those of us who LIKE the low end more than screaming mid range can manually shape the sound and get the sound they want. All in all, after trying high-end Apple, Sonos, Google, Bose and a few other expensive options side by side (yes, bought them all at the same time and tried at same time, then returned the others), the Amazon speakers sound the best, and are the clearest. (By the way, don't believe what you hear in the store or the sound demos... The acoustics are NOT the same as the environment YOU will be using them, and their ""demos"" are adjusted to make 'their' device sound better than it is with real music). I wish I knew where to post this comment that Amazon team would read it; probably wouldn't matter. LOL. All aforementioned devices have been tested on a 400GB connection with Amazon Music, Google Music, Pandora, Spotify, several other streaming services, as well as Bluetooth music from multiple devices. Agree/Disagree, there's my experienced 10 cents worth opinion for anyone considering these devices.

I own a LOT of Echo devices and can't wait for new better Echos to be released. I just hope the Studio is NOT where they are going in the future... Don't get me wrong, it's a nice speaker, but not everyone wants screaming mid range. Example, most everyone I've EVER met uses a "" V "" or "" W "" configuration in their EQ. That represents CUTTING most of the screaming mid range. FWIW.",3.0 out of 5 stars
The Queen Bacon,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2020","This is my review for the 2 studios and sub connected the the cube.
Please be aware that I think that the 2 studios and subwoofer are amazing together. The sound is outstanding, my only setback is that I can't connect a bluetooth record player to the group to listen. I can only listen on one of the studios, and no sub. I am hoping that this is something that amazon fixes in the future...

So I had a regular Fire tv that worked fine, we recently purchased 2 amazon alexa studios (amazing sound! kudos amazon!) and a subwoofer. well amazon got us on the hook for an additional $90.00 because we couldn't connect the group to the fire tv, we needed to upgrade to the 2nd gen cube. FINE, we move the tv into our bedroom lol.
Fast forward, well we watch a lot of shows on amazon video, hulu, and sling. MOSTLY recorded things, sound and function 5+ stars! We love that you can control the hdmi ports and everything with the cube remote/alexa by telling her. I Think its awesome, you want to play video games alexa switch to hdmi 3, ok.
So in the mornings getting the family ready for the day, and when I am working from home I love to have the news on in the background. I notice news12 app doesn't work (local live news app) , do everything, delete cookies, cache, delete redownload the app. So im like EFF IT, put on sling, I Guess im effen stuck with fox/abc, well those won't work with live tv either! wait look amazon has a live news app, download that, oh look that doesn't work either. I factory reset the cube, reset everything back up still doesn't work, even tried hard wiring the cube to the internet to make sure it wasn't our wifi (even though we have 2 fire sticks, and a tv that are working fine with all the apps and live tv). Still doesn't work.
Speak to amazon they work me through everything, still nothing works, they send me a new cube. Set it up, didn't connect it to the speakers, live tv works fine, HOOOOOOOORAY LOOK AT THIS LIVE TV WORKS FINE! Now I can catch up on this whole coronavirus news lmao. Time to set up the speaker group (I mean I just spent $600.00 on amazon speakers to use with the tv/music I mine as well use them) . Live news worked for literally 5 seconds, then freezes. We reset the router, hardwire it, update it, delete cookies and did a little dance and said some prayers around it, still nothing worked for live tv. My husband swears its some kind of cube bug maybe that live tv just doesn't work with it, I said ehh maybe its the speaker group (2 amazon echo studios and subwoofer which happen to be the reason I even bought this god damn cube). I forget the group, live tv starts right up.
In my opinion this should be a glitch worked out before making people buy this device to work with all of these expensive amazon speakers. Some might even be like why do you need stereo surround sound to watch to watch the news? I don't.. but what about sports events, or if I decide to watch a show when it airs instead of pre recording? none of that works. So in a weeks time I spend about $650.00 on an amazon entertainment system that doesn't work. I was already upset that I couldn't hook up a bluetooth device to my entertainment group (I would like to play records on the 2 studios and subwoofer) and can't do that, but now this? Amazon please come up with a resolution asap. Once you do, let me know and you will get 1000 stars.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Keogh,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2024","Sound isn't blowing me away, apparently I would need to pay more to get higher quality tracks (3D stuff)... and Alexa is none to shy about reminding me of that. This thing is too heavy, doesn't have battery time and can't be in 'no listen' mode without a huge red glowing ring displayed. Unfortunate that the Alexa App has made pairing and changing WiFi connectivity on my Tap next to impossible. Overall, even audiophiles might want to consider the smaller portable options out there.",3.0 out of 5 stars
AC,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2019","I have a myriad of Echoes around my open-floor plan house including five Echo Subs for whole-home audio but some of my Echos are 1st generation. When this game-changer, Echo Studio came out, I was hoping to up the ante by replacing my old Echoes with a few Studios so I started out with one.

First, its greatest feature: the room-measuring, self-adjusting, high-tech “spatial” processing must be disabled in order to hear the highs, at least to my ears. That’s okay since I don’t really care about spacial whatever, I just want to crank it up!

One important feature for me is the ability to pair the Echo Studio with my Echo Sub and enjoy the bass from both devices at the same time. After all, for twice the price, I want twice the bass, right? That’s where I ran into problems.

I initially setup the Studio and played some tunes which sounded spectacular. Then, I eagerly set up my sub and paired it to the Studio, imagining what twice the bass was going to sound like. The pairing went fine with no hiccups. Then I added the new pair to my “Everywhere” group which also went fine. I played some music on my Everywhere group where the Studio performed well again BUT there was nothing coming out of the Echo Sub it was paired with.

I paired, unpaired, paired again, deleted and reinstalled both but the result is the same: the Studio vibrates for all its might while the Echo Sub it was paired with sat completely silent. I was heartbroken, wondering why the Studio would play all the bass and deprive a dedicated Echo Sub from playing any of it!

Amazon tech support actually called me to try to sort out the issue and assured me the Studio should, in fact, play nice with the Echo Sub as they have an identical setup in their own testing room. The tech verified on her screen that the Studio and Sub were active and linked together in a sub pair I labeled “TV room sub pair” in the Alexa app.

However, I only over tested the setup by playing music on my Everywhere group. The tech asked me to first play music specifically on my “TV room sub pair” and suddenly my Studio and Sub came alive together! Then, I tested music on my Everywhere group again and lo and behold, the Studio and Sub played together, giving me the bass I wanted.

I don’t know how or why but I learned: 1. Pair the Studio with the Sub and give the pair a name in the Alexa app, “TV room sub pair” in my case. 2. Ask Alexa to play music, specifically using that pair’s name. It is not enough to just walk up to the Studio and ask Alexa it to play a tune because only the Studio will play and the Sub will sit silent. 3. After playing a tune to ensure the Studio and Sub work together, THEN add the pair to my Everywhere group.

Thanks Amazon tech girl!

MSR Workshop,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2019","So I have an interesting review to write. I Purchased my first echo studio from Best Buy and immediately got it home and playing music. I was immediately underwhelmed by the music that was coming out of the speaker and was confused. I had heard so many good reviews and how much people love this speaker. Was I just too much of an audio snob to appreciate it or was I doing something wrong. I repaired the speaker just in case I had messed something up in the set up process and it still didn’t sound that great the base was poor and the sound that came out was very thin at low-volume. Well the speaker did have good sound at high-volume the low-volume sound was very lacking. I decided that there must be something wrong internally so I immediately returned it and bought a second one. The second one I purchased was just as easy to set up. This one immediately did sound better with the immersive sound function turned on. But I am still on the fence overall.

So what’s the hidden problem you might ask? Many reviewer’s have said to turn the “immersive sound” off, And it will sound much better. No reviewer has mentioned yet that when you turn the “immersive sound” off, it turns two of the speakers off. With the immersive sound on, sound comes from all five speakers. With the immersive sound button turn off, no sound will come from the top firing or the front firing speaker. So essentially you are left with a left and a right and a sub to produce music and sound content. WHY, has amazon chosen to do this, I’m not sure? Maybe someone can chime in and comment on this. I would have thought that all speakers on the system would be active all the time instead of just sometimes.

I have a very high-end home theater system and understand how surroundsound works. Only delivering audio to a specific channel if there is content decoded for it. An example would be a 7.1 surround. The 2 rear channels on this type of system may not produce sound all the time, they are there for when, say a plane flies by or a an object goes behind the listener. Another example is the center channel is designed for speech and the left and right are for other sound affects. But..... this all has to do with the processor. In most processors you can choose to have a multi channel stereo sound where sound is sent equally to all speakers. This is not the case with the echo Studio. Essentially the “immersive sound” button turns your speaker into a 4.1 surround , sending specific sounds to each speaker for the surround affect. Turning the “immersive sound” off, you get a 2.1 stereo sound, killing sound from the top and the front firing speaker. Not sure I’m cool with this. I would much prefer a 4.1 stereo sound when the “immersive sound” is toggled off than a 2 channel stereo.

Amazon..... care to chime in?

I’ll play with this more and report back what I find and update this review, but in the mean time I’m not sure I’m gonna keep this 🤔",4.0 out of 5 stars
