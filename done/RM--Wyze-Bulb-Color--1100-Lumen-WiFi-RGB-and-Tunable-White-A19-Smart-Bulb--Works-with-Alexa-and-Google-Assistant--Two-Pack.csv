José Mundo,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2023","My kids love these light bulbs because they can turn them to the color that they want depending on the mood and occasion. The color that they like the most is the blue one.

Going to technical stuff:
1. They only connect to 2.4GHZ wifi which is not good, and in may case even worst, because the network that works the best in my house is the 5.0 GHZ one
2. From time to time they get disconnected or starts to work erratically. The solution turn the light off and on again
3. Connecting and configuring them is really easy",5.0 out of 5 stars
Tyler Carbonelli,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024","We recently got a few Wyze Bulb Color four-packs, and these bulbs are amazing! They are super bright at 1100 lumens, way brighter than the usual 800 lumens we had before. They can also dim down to 30 lumens, so we can get the perfect lighting for any mood.
With 16 million colors to pick from, it’s easy to set the vibe for any occasion, from game days to chill wine nights. The Wyze app makes it really simple to change colors and create custom presets for quick scene changes. Plus, the white light temperature control is great for cooling down the light for focus or warming it up for relaxation.
The 90+ CRI rating is fantastic, making colors look more vibrant and accurate. It’s been a lifesaver in the closet, where I no longer mistake navy for black. The bulbs also have cool notification features, allowing us to set time-based color events or automate them with other Wyze devices for handy visual alerts.
Our whole house now has Wyze light bulbs in each room, along with our Wyze air purifier, Wyze plugs, Wyze Robot Vacuum, and Wyze hand vacuum. Having all these Wyze products has turned our home into a super smart and convenient space.
Overall, these Wyze Bulb Color smart bulbs are bright, versatile, and fun to use. They’ve really improved the lighting in our home, and I highly recommend them for anyone wanting to upgrade their lighting!",5.0 out of 5 stars
zoomlittlewing,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2023","We replaced all of our stand alone light bulbs in our house with Wyze bulbs over the last 6 months. We love our movie nights, dates nights and evening wind-downs thanks to these bulbs. They truly can create almost any color you can think of and we love that the brightness and tone is adjustable with just a few tweaks. The dimming feature allows for me to stay up reading with my bedside lamp on while my husband turns off his bedside lamp sleeps.
Solid 4 star product - easy to install, easy to pair and easy to set up on the app (there may be a learning curve if you’re not very familiar with how modern-day mobile applications pair with devices).
The reason it’s not 5 stars is largely because the developer software updates being buggy. Sometimes it won’t connect to their devices at all, or it will connect but have a lag time for any adjustments you make or making adjustments can crash the app. The only way to fix this is you have to uninstall/reinstall it. Fortunately it doesn’t erase your devices or history, and it only happens every few months (lately haven’t had issues), so it’s not the end of the world.
We were also shocked it’s not compatible with Siri, but works with Alexa and other voice command apps. We didn’t even think to research this when researching since the iPhone is the leading mobile device out there. That seems like a huge miss on the Wyze development team’s part - its clear they don’t want to pay Apple’s ridiculously high fees in the App Store and for Siri development APIs. Hopefully, they will one make the investment and upgrade their app to include it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Alison,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2023","I bought this bulb when I was looking for a sunrise alarm clock, but I couldn't find one with the functions I wanted in my price range. I knew I wanted to be able to set it on my phone in case I wanted to wake up at a different time one day. I really like the sunrise function on this bulb. I can easily set it on my phone and have it only run the sunrise on weekdays (or days of your choice). Although I can't set more than one time on different days, it's easy enough to change if I need to. I don't think I would wake up from the sunrise alone, but I use it in a floor lamp, so it may work if you had it closer to your face. I set a regular alarm and start the sunrise at the alarm time, and have it end by the time I hit snooze a couple of times. I do feel more awake at the end of the sunrise. If you have the sun color match setting on, the sunrise comes all the way up to a bluer daylight and then resets to the sun shade for the time of day.
I also really enjoy the sunset feature. I run it while scrolling on my phone and by the time the sunrise is over, I know it's time to go to sleep. I even feel sleepier at the end of the sunset than I do without it. You can set the length of time you want the sunset to span (same with the sunrise). The shortest amount of time is 20 mins, but I wish I could set it for a speedier 10 min sunset when I want a quick unwind.
The app is easy to use, and if you have other Wyze products, they all live in the same app. I recommend setting up a widget for your home screen for easy on/off. It's super convenient to turn the light on from another room when you're walking to your room at night, or turn it off if you forgot to when leaving the room.
I haven't used too many of the other fun colors, but from playing around with them they are really cool! You can set any color you want and the app even has color and brightness options for different moods. The bulb is bright enough to light a decent sized room in a floor lamp, though the cooler colors seem brighter than the warmer colors. It's very easy to play with the color wheel to pick your perfect color/warmth and brightness though.
Overall, this bulb exceeded my expectations for the sunrise function I was looking for, and I'm enjoying playing with the other color and mood options as well! I never thought I would write such a long review for a lightbulb, but I'm really loving it that much.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Cory,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2024","I want to like these, the concept is great, change color, dim the lights, by using an APP or voice command, so I bought 20 and put them all over my house.... Bad IDEA!!!! It has been more trouble than the benefits. I have already had to go through customer support to exchange at least 4 light bulbs and now I am just throwing them away, waste of money, time and frustration.
A few example's of the fun that awaits you
1 out of 6 lights in a fixture will not turn on sometimes
1 out of 6 lights in a fixture will not turn off sometimes
1 light out of a group will decided it no longer wants to match the other colors no matter what you try
1 light out of a group will just stop working
Oh no you forgot and used the light switch once and now when you turn them on or off using voice command, or the APP, you will play Russian roulette with them, because in random order all but one of them will work.
These are good if you only want to use one or two of them in a fixture and don't mind replacing them potentially within a year.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Wm D. S.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2022","I bought two of these, one for my wife's lame and one for mine. She loves them! We put them on the color or our favorite sports teams while watching games and we both love that we can turn them on and off from anywhere. For example, we can turn them on in the living room from bed in the morning when it's still dark out so we don't have to turn on overhead lights along the way. Or at night we leave them on when we leave the couch on our way to bed and then turn them off once we are in our bedroom. Heck of a lot better than stubbing your toes walking around in the dark looking for light switches!!! The only suggesting I have for these would be if we could put them on some kind of random color mode so they would just adjust on their own. Instead they are constantly whatever color you set them to and have to be manually adjusted. It can't listen to music and make cool color changes or anything like that either. It's just a wireless remote controlled light bulb that you can change the color on using the app. It also has a vacation mode but doesn't say what the timing will be for that. It also lacks a timer mode which would be cool if you could set it to turn on and off with different colors at different times of the day. Over all it's probably a waste of money but we like them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Robert A Fogg,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024","I bought 8 wyze color bulbs, 2 4-packs, and of those initial 8, 18 months later, only 3 remain. 1 stopped changing color and would only turn on green. 3 have stopped communicating with the wifi and are non responsive and one connects and shows as there but doesn't light. I'll be switching to other products that have longer lifespan guarantees. When a standard LED bulb can last for decades it's ridiculous that an IoT bulb doesn't last for 2 years...",3.0 out of 5 stars
Joshua Frasher,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2023","The Wyze Bulb Color has truly elevated my lighting experience with its exceptional features. The 1100-lumen brightness provides ample illumination, creating a vibrant and inviting atmosphere in any room. The dimming capability allows for versatile control, effortlessly transitioning between different moods and activities with a simple adjustment.
One of the standout features is the absence of flickering or blinking during operation. The steady and consistent light output enhances comfort and prevents eye strain, making it ideal for prolonged use. The reliability of the Wyze Bulb Color instills confidence, ensuring a stable and enjoyable lighting experience.
The fit into my smart home ecosystem was seamless, thanks to its WiFi connectivity. The Wyze app facilitates convenient control, allowing me to manage the bulb's color and intensity with ease. The appearance of the bulb is sleek and modern, adding a touch of sophistication to my living spaces.
In summary, the Wyze Bulb Color excels in providing a bright, versatile, and comfortable lighting solution. Its dimming capabilities, flicker-free operation, and stylish appearance make it a standout choice for those seeking both functionality and aesthetics in smart lighting.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Vikki,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2024",Initially a pain to hook up. One bulb was a cinch but the 2nd bulb refused to sync up and work with Alexa. Called customer service. The gal I spoke to wasn't the friendliest person I've ever dealt with but she was tenacious and kept working at walking me through (repeatedly) all the steps until it finally decided to work correctly. I'm happy with the white color of the bulb - it's very very bright white; unlike other smart bulbs I've had.,4.0 out of 5 stars

jbcorcor,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2024","These are really cool - we have 2 in the overhead light in our kids' room and they love it. We set it to do a wake-up brightening routine and a bed-time darkening routine and it's been helpful on both sides.
The brightness and color range are great - covers the spectrum pretty well, especially when you have more than one bulb.
Downsides:
- They respond quite slowly when you make changes in the app, which means I often click the wrong thing or end up pushing buttons too many times because I think it didn't register the change the first time.
- Because there's no physical switch, all of the changes have to be made in the app. I don't really let my kids tool around on my phone and we don't use Alexa (or any other voice assistant), so it means that any lighting changes have to go through me or my husband.
Side note: We also got some strip lighting for their room (Govee brand) and I like how those can play ""scenes"" with moving lights. It feels a little more fun to me.
All that being said, I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend them to people who aren't going to make frequent changes to the lighting settings.",4.0 out of 5 stars

HeySupDan,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2024","I love the Wyze products, I have issues with cameras and outdoor plugs, but for the most part you can’t beat their prices",4.0 out of 5 stars
Shay,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2022","The good: Really happy with the brightness of these lights as well as the customization. They keep my home well lit at night - and I like my home to feel like it's in daylight at all hours, so that's saying something. Even when you use the colored light settings, the brightness stays consistently strong (unlike with a cheaper colored smart bulb I have tried from Genii). You can customize by brightness, color as well as saturation (white to colored), and while the colors tend to lose definition disproportionately quickly as you desaturate, I haven't had a single setting I've tried that looked bad. Sometimes I have to tweak to get exactly the color I want, but the range is good enough that I can typically find the effect I want. Have used these bulbs for several months now and haven't had to replace any yet.
The bad: If you get a faulty bulb, customer service WILL give you the runaround. Ostensibly they will replace faulty bulbs, but I've been going back and forth with them for weeks to try to get them to send me a replacement bulb. Every couple of weeks a different customer service agent responds to the thread to say they need the MAC address or bulb ID; then I respond that I've provided all the text the bulb had on it and no longer have the device connected, so can't confirm any information, so can they please just send me a replacement? And then they respond again saying ""okay yes let's try something else can you send me the MAC address it should be on the outside of the bulb."" So, make sure you test your bulbs as soon as you get them so you can go through Amazon returns and don't have to deal with the Wyze team.
The other problem I encounter is every so often, some/all of my bulbs just stop responding to commands. Sometimes this just goes away if I wait a few minutes. Sometimes I have to fix this by reconnecting the Alexa skill and/or operating through the Wyze app until I find a minute to reset. Sometimes, neither the skill nor the app work, and if the light is frozen in the off position when this happens, I can't tell if it's ""on"" or ""off"", and then it doesn't go to reset mode right away after I flip the lights three times, and I keep turning the switch slowly on and off for several minutes until I get signs of life. I'll try unplugging the light altogether or unscrewing the bulb but haven't figured out a consistent workaround to get them to promptly reset when this happens. It's possible it's a sync issue with my router, but I have very high internet speeds, a really heavy duty router, and a really small house, so that's less likely.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Lawrence Sterne,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2024","These bulbs are really cool. You can adjust the color, brightness and warmth using a plain (i.e., not 3 way, socket). You can create any ”environment“you want. If you are reading, for example, you might want something brigher. You can replicate sunlight or moonlight. You can make any color you want. Best of all, you can just ask Alexa to do it for you. On the downside, I had to replace a three-way socket and one completely variable socket because the lights flickered. But that's a one-time event.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Troy McKinlay,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2024","I used to have the 2019 version and omg, this is so much better. The blubs are lighter which is cool, and they pair so so easily. Screw it in, follow the apps instructions. No wifi bs, just connected. The color is really, really cool and the variety is great. I love a warm, warm light and these are perfect. The controls are intuitive and you can set up schedules so I use the lights to help wake me. There are also quick buttons you can make- I have one that turns on all the lights for when I get home.

Scott,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2022","The hardest smart device to set up I've bought in a long time. And I've bought quite a few. Long story short: the Wyze App said White bulb, this is color, there was no other option until it was set up, then Color appeared; while the bulb pulsed right away, meaning ready to set up, the app refused to accept my Wifi password as valid, even after I rebooted the Wifi as instructed. Have to use 2.4 g, which is ok, but it took about 8 tries before it finally accepted my password. But then it still would not link to the bulb. I turned the bulb off and back on, as instructed, rebooted, as instructed, no luck. FINALLY, after about 15 ties, for no apparent reason it then linked successfully. B
But then it said I needed a firmware update. Yet every time I tried to update, the app told me the device was offline, not linked to internet. So I could not set up any of the functions i wanted. Alexa app immediately recognized the bulb, but Alexa could not perform any of the functions, either. Time and again I turned my Wifi off and back on, bulb off and back on, only to be told it was still offline. All my other Wifi devices in the house were performing fine in the meantime. There was nothing wrong with my Wifi. Finally, about two hours later, I came back and tried again. Finally, on about the 15th or 20th time trying to update, the firmware updated. And I was able to set a time schedule.
But just now I discovered the time schedule I saved only saved the start time, it was showing no end time set. So I have again set the end time. But WHAT AN ORDEAL!
I should add that it is not easy to find the menu item where one sets a time schedule. It is NOT under Schedule. It is under Rules. And when it turned on today, it did not turn on to the brightness I had set.
So all in all, the jury is still out on this. Alexa can now turn the light off and on, adjust its brightness, and even change the color. SO this may turn out to be terrific. But getting there was NOT half the fun.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2023","These bulbs are nifty and can be set to do neat things like go on automatically at sunset wherever you are, and off at a particular time. But it takes some time and effort to figure out how to get them to do this. Once you finally figure out how to set the color bulb it is fun and helpful. For the bulb to follow a schedule you have to set up a “rule”. The instructions on how to do this are a bit obscure.
I was having trouble making the bulb work so called their support desk. After about a half hour, and no joy, I went back to trying to figure it out on my own.
The instructions on the Wyze website under support Using Rules with Wyze Color Bulb are helpful but they leave out an important step. You will find couple of different ways to get to the “Add Rule” screen but there is no instruction for how to connect to the bulb you want to control. It just says “Add the bulb you want to connect.” What is missing if that you have to select “Add action” and then select the bulb.
To summarize: Set up your bulb so it is seen by your phone app. Name it. Select the color you want to use and bulb brightness. Save as a “scene”. Go to Rules tab (from color screen or home screen) Select +(plus) Select “add rule” and then schedule. Select add action. Select the bulb you want to assign a schedule. Select “turn on” – Save. Set “start time” and “end time”. Name the sequence. Save.
We are quite pleased with the bulb and all its capabilities now that it is working correctly.",4.0 out of 5 stars
music lover,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2021","I now have a total of 5 Wyze devices, 3 plugs, and 2 color smart bulbs (Master Bedroom - furthest point from router/modem)), all are working flawlessly. Many of the reviews mention the app and wifi connectivity being an issue. To be clear connectivity is a function of the wifi service available in conjunction with the app. Every wifi connected device draws from the available download speeds as received from the internet provider. In my case I have download speeds of 500 Mbps, this may sound like a lot, however the speeds change depending if the network is hard wired (ethernet), or wireless. Wireless can in itself reduce the download speeds by as much as 50%, and if a VPN is being used the download speeds are reduced again (see where this is going?). I run a combination of ethernet and wireless. Ethernet runs my desktop, VPN, 4 security cameras, printer, and NAS. Wireless runs 4 Firesticks, 2 laptops, 2 phones, garage door opener, Nest thermostat, Echo Dot (Alexa), and the 5 Wyze products. This is a total of 24 devices drawing from a download speed of 500 Mbps. Now for example, if someone has let’s say a service of 100 to 200 Mbps, and many devices connected, connectivity issues could be a real problem. Taking this one step further, the 2 Wyze color smart bulbs are installed in the Master Bedroom and closet which are furthest away from the modem/router. When I originally connected/paired the devices to the app (using the 2G connection), the lights worked, but there was a definite lag when powering on/off and/or changing color scenes, or using voice control (Alexa) which was even worse, sort of frustrating. My home network is broken out to 6 different connections, a 2G, 5G, 2G EXT, 5G EXT, Guest 2G and Guest 5G. The fix for the issues in the Master Bedroom and closet was changing the wifi connection on the 2 Wyze bulbs from 2G to 2G EXT, as I have a NETGEAR network extender plugged into the bedroom outlet, problem solved. The real reason for this review is to provide information as to how download speeds and number of connected devices work, and share the internet signal. Hope this provides some useful information!
OBTW an alternative solution in leu of adding individual wifi devices is going with a product that runs off of a hub, which is connected via an ethernet cable directly to the router/modem, and the individual devices are controlled by the hub and associated app, the hub counts as only one connection!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Cameron Wilde,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2022","I really appreciate the Wyze brand for having so many smart products at such a low price. This is where their products shine, and the Wyze Color Bulb is no different. Now, I will say that the software side of these does have some small problems occasionally, but all I do is say, “eh, but I didn’t pay that much for ‘em,” and I’m perfectly happy.
I can’t speak toward the Alexa integration, because I haven’t used it, but I will say that these bulbs get better in conjunction with other Wyze products. For example, I have a Wyze Watch that has Shortcuts created in the app to turn them on or off, or change color or brightness settings. I have motion detection with my Wyze Cam that, when it detects a person in the middle of the night (so, distinct from my dog), then it’ll turn the lights on at low brightness for five minutes and then turn back off.
Even without ancillary Wyze devices, they do very well simply on schedules alone. The lights turn themselves on in the morning, they turn themselves off when I leave for work, and I have them set to turn on when I approach within 1000 feet of my house if it’s between certain times of day.
The colors work great. I use several different Scenes in the app to create mood lighting for when I host Dungeons and Dragons at my house. With different light settings, I can make our living room feel like a cozy tavern, an open country field, or an unexplored ancient cavern. I use the color settings of these lightbulbs on a weekly basis.

KS,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2023","I purchased several Wyze color bulbs from Amazon (two 2-packs), and they’re frustrating to use because the Wyze app needed to use and control the bulbs is often very slow and severely glitchy, as it keeps freezing up and/or crashing, over and over and over, despite numerous attempts to try to fix the problem.
As I describe below, I’m far from the only one experiencing these problems with the app (and resulting inability to use Wyze bulbs correctly) and many others have been reporting essentially the same problems with the Wyze app - on forums around the internet, Wyze help pages, reviews on the Apple App Store, etc. Despite this, Wyze has still failed to fix the problem.
Because of these ongoing and continuing problems with the app (an app that is needed to use and control the Wyze color bulbs), the 4 Wyze color bulbs I purchased are extremely frustrating to use.
I have an iPhone 12 Pro updated with the latest version(s) of iOS (iOS 16.2 when I first got the Wyze color bulbs and first started trying to use the Wyze app, and currently iOS 16.3.1) and I've tried several things to try and fix this problem, including: closing and re-opening the Wyze app many, many times; fully turning off my phone and rebooting it several times; and deleting/uninstalling the Wyze app and re-installing it repeatedly over the course of weeks ... all to no avail.
Every time I delete/uninstall then re-install the Wyze app, it works okay for a day or three, and then the problems begin all over again with the app taking a long time to load/open, freezing up as I try to control my lights with it, crashing and closing, etc.
Just this evening, I tried to dim two of the Wyze smart bulbs in my living room in order to try and watch a movie, and it took about 5 minutes - just to dim 2 bulbs - because the app was so slow, crashed repeatedly and was just generally unresponsive.
Having and trying to use the Wyze bulbs is like having a smart TV that physically works, but that you can’t use without a remote control and the remote control barely works half the time and doesn’t work at all the other half - and so, as a result of the faulty remote control, the TV itself ranges from being frustrating to use to borderline unusable, depending on the day.
NOTE: when reading reviews of the Wyze bulbs and Wyze app needed to control them here and elsewhere (e.g. the Apple App Store), choose the “most recent” reviews option and read the reviews going back a few months from the present day - because it looks like the app used to be more usable in the not too distant past, but that after “updates” sometime in 2022 and since then, the Wyze app’s usability (and thus the usability of Wyze products that are controlled through the app) has fallen off a proverbial cliff.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Eric,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2024","I initially loved Wyze products because of their price-point and seemingly being quality products. After owning more than 15 different Wyze products, they have progressively started to fail. 3 color bulbs have completely stopped working, 1 color bulb works for a few minutes and then starts blinking before it goes offline, 1 regular bulb lost half its color functionality and can only emit high temperature bright white light, two motion sensors no long are able to connect.
I still think they are great products for the price and a good choice for cheaply getting started with smart devices and seeing if you like them. I do have a Wyze Vacuum that still works great so far. But it seems like the quality of their products overall is lacking, and they start to fail after two years or so. So if you're looking to invest long term, it would probably be best to pay the higher price for more expensive IoT brands known for better longevity.",3.0 out of 5 stars
DC Tech,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2022","UPDATE 2/17/2022
So, being outside the Amazon return window, I went to the Wyze.com support website. I was greeted by a chatbot that after a few questions gave me an (in window) form to fill out. Literally, 5 minutes later, Lynette, from Wyze customer service, responded. I simply needed to provide my shipping info, a screenshot of the device info, a PDF of my amazon invoice, and have logged into a Wyze.com account one time with my e-mail address.
LESS THAN 10 MINUTES LATER!!.... I receive an e-mail from Lynette with an order invoice stating that a replacement item is on its way. No hassle, no return of faulty product, no credit card info, just outstanding customer service response. I have never experienced e-mail customer service that was this fast. Unexpected, to say the least, from a company that I have never dealt with directly before.
I don't know if Wyze customer service is always like this, in general, or if I just got their best rep, on the roll of the dice, but ""Well done!"", Lynette. Thank you. One single customer service representative literally reversed my opinion of Wyze products. Total wait time 15 minutes, from start to finish. That includes me filling out the info, responding to the e-mail, etc. They may need to improve quality control, as I have had to return (through Amazon) 2 of their products in the last 12 months. However, regarding customer service, they clearly stand behind their products. This has been my experience, and my 2 cents, anyway.

Brandon,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2022","The product itself is what you expect. It has its own app to set things up, the apps features aren't as extensive as Philips hue or LifX. It's cool though, you won't use those 90% of the time so no biggie considering the price. If you don't have the app open and ready you can flick the switch twice to go into natural lighting and skip the cycling the lights will go through automatically if they aren't set up. All far as color and brightness they are brighter than most will ever need them and easily comparable to the second gen LifX bulbs I've used prior.
I have no complaints at all about these bulbs all things considered. I do ask that you open your packages immediately though. I ordered a bunch of these directly from Amazon and I ended up with a used box that was retaped and had the bulbs replaced with Intek (some Chinese knock off) bulbs that predictably did not work. The move in process to the new place was slow so i didn't notice until it was passed the 30 day return window. So inspect upon delivery is the key.

S B,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2022","I like that this bulb has a wide brightness range and high CRI Rating. I, however, cannot give it more than 3 Stars given that it is still having significant firmware update issues.
Setup went smoothly and everything I've tried so far works fine except for the firmware update. I followed all of the troubleshooting instructions, sent my app logs to support, and chatted with a support person. After going over the same troubleshooting steps I had already tried, the support person said it's a known issue and to wait for their developers to fix it. I'm fine with waiting but after doing a search on firmware in these Amazon reviews, it looks like firmware updates have been an issue for many people for a while now.
I don't know if I should keep this bulb or not since I don't know if I'll ever be able to receive firmware updates. Even though it's a brand new bulb, I already cannot use the Sun Match feature without upgrading the firmware.
UPDATE (08/02/2022): I tried two of these brand new bulbs (sold directly from Amazon) and was unable to update the firmware on either one using an Android phone or an Apple iPad. I tried everything in their troubleshooting steps and everything their support representative suggested (including switching my WiFi router to use just 2.4 GHz). The support representative eventually said there was nothing they could do, that this was a known issue, and to wait for their development team to come up with a fix.

jasoncli,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2023","I've tried multiple smart bulbs from several manufactures, and I like the bulb but the app is a problem. As the title says, I have a Fold 4 and these smart bulbs are about as good as their apps. Sadly, I have problems with the app.
- I can't update the firmware and therefore can't use some features of the bulb. I'm stuck on firmware 12.0.359. When try to update the lightbulb seems to crash? Unsure.... but I have to reset (on/off several times) the bulb every time for the app to work again. Tried to update firmware when bulb is powered off and on.
- My phone (Fold 4) has 2 screens. The front screen and the unfolded screen. On the front screen everything seems to work fine. When on the unfolded (main) screen the color wheel disappears.
I understand that some consider the Fold 4 as a niche phone so hopefully they will fix this problem. I don't plan to return the bulb but want to buy about 5 more when the product works better.
The good things
- This bulb has great color
- This bulb is bright which is perfect for video conference meetings where an 800 lumens bulb is too dim.
- The app connects to the bulb quickly unlike almost all other smart bulb apps
- Connection seems stable
- Good Android widget options",3.0 out of 5 stars

But the final one wouldn’t budge, I gave up on it and came back to it a few weeks later and it finally went through after a few tries. The support did give solid advice that did work to get them to update but at the end of the day these bulbs are still and electronic, and as anyone with a phone or computer will know, sometimes they just don’t agree with you. I also wish they had the ability to color shift. Right now you are getting static light but I’m sure sometime down the road they can implement it.

varia,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2021","I purchased a two-pack of 1100 lumen Wyze Color Bulbs. The bulbs themselves seem perfectly solid and a good value for their price. The reviews led me to think they'd appear a bit brighter than they actually are, however, it is true that they are noticeably brighter than the 800 lumen bulbs that I already own, so it was probably a case of my expectations being too high rather than a fault of the product.
However, as was noted by several other reviewers, while these devices DO work with Alexa, it's not without some fiddling. The steps I followed, provided by a review of the Wyze skill for Alexa, by Travis:
1) Installed the Wyze app on my mobile device, set up a Wyze account, and set up the lights to work properly with it.
2) Linked accounts (I did it through the Wyze app, not sure if it makes a difference whether you do it from Wyze or Alexa).
3) Enabled the Wyze skill in the Alexa app. Wyze devices do not show up yet at this point.
4) Re-named each of the Wyze Color Bulbs in the Wyze app (don't need to change the name, just edit it and then re-save it). As each one was saved, Alexa immediately detected them, but they showed up as unresponsive in Alexa.
5) Disabled the Wyze skill (which unlinked the Wyze and Amazon accounts) and re-enabled it (which required me to log back in and re-link accounts, this time through Alexa app instead of Wyze app).

God forbid I lose power for a minute or someone accidentally turn one of these off at the switch, and the entire connection is permanently lost. The only option is a full reset and go through the entire reconnection process. You'd think this could be mitigated in the app by recognizing a previously connected device and streamlining the reconnection process, but nope. And this has been an issue across multiple iterations for years. My family has dozens of Wyze devices at three different houses and the problems are consistent. I used to highly recommend them to everyone but can't honestly do that anymore.

06/2023 update: When I first wrote this review, the Wyze app for Apple iOS devices was just about unusable. I could only get anywhere with the Android version of their software. I'm pleased to report that although it took several months for them to realize, and in spite of their providing an irrelevant canned response to my review on the Apple App Store, Wyze did finally fix just about everything that was wrong with their application.

It was very easy to set up. The Wyze app allows you to also save custom light settings to make it easy to change the bulb to a specific color. Changing the color and switching the light on/off from the Wyze app is immediate. Playing around with all the colors is so fun it makes me feel like a kid again admiring all the pretty colors!

We used almost one bulb nightly for 9 months it suddenly stopped working. The other we ran maybe 50 hours in a room we rarely inhabit, it also stopped working on the same day. Wondering if it has something to due with the software update I was provided. I am not sure what caused all 4 bulbs to stop working but after a few hours of Wyze tech support the agent offered to replace the 2 we couldn't fix because they were less than a year old. Their warranty states after 3 months you're out of luck. So guess I am lucky and truly thankful that they stood by their product. Wonder how long the two that work will last....

Brian j,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2022","Edit: After 6 months of 10 bulbs, I have had 2 fail already. They don’t seem to be the highest quality in terms of longevity. They are great when they work, but seem to have a short lifespan.
I have Wyze cameras, plugs, switches, and locks. The bulbs may be their best product. You can turn on/off, change colors, save settings, or choose from their preset scenes.
This is a solution to those pesky fan light pull strings. Group these bulbs in the app to turn them on when you unlock the house or a Wyze camera detects motion.
Highly recommend pairing these with at least one Wyze wall switch. If you don’t have a switch you find yourself constantly opening the app to customize the bulbs. With a switch, you can program the wall switch to turn on/off multiple bulbs at one time, use “double press” and “triple press” functions on the switch to dim or change colors of the lights. Program the switch so “press and hold” shuts off multiple bulbs at one time.
I can’t speak to the longevity yet. As a tech person, I love the unlocked potential to making a older home into a smart house without changes to wiring, etc. If you already use Wyze products, these are an easy addition to automation.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Stumpus,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2022","I like these, especially the reasonable price-point relative to Philips Hue. However:
1. The app is somewhat buggy, but it is certainly functional and usable.

3. I really miss what I consider to be an easy-to-implement feature... a simple, repeating, cycle through all available colors.
4. The bulbs themselves work well, though there is a half-a-second delay when turning on that is on that threshold of being annoying.
5. There is a lack of variety of bulb types (like GU10's).
6. There is a lack of variety of controls, like switches that do not require wiring.

Zach,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2023","I bought six Wyze color bulbs for my apartment to do a bit of home automation with my Google nest hub.
While setup was not too difficult, the bulbs frequently became disconnected. This happened about once per month for each individual bulb, meaning that of the six at least one would stop working roughly every week.
When the bulbs become disconnected, usually turning the switch on and off will reset them, though it may take some time to be recognized in the app. However, sometimes this would not be enough and the bulb would require a factory reset, which means deleting it from the app and going through the full setup again.
I should note here that while I was using them with Google Home, the bulbs were becoming unusable from within the native Wyze app, so I don't believe this is a problem that can be fixed by using them with Amazon or another home automation system.
After about six months, one of the bulbs would no longer respond even after a full reset. Wyze support was responsive and walked through some troubleshooting, eventually determining the bulb was faulty and sending me a new one. However, not long after it arrived a second bulb from the original bunch also stopped responding and I simply don't have the time or energy to go through that process again for some lightbulbs.
It's unfortunate because they do look nice and respond to well to voice commands when they are working!

Google integration was easy as I have other devices from wyze setup already they pop right in there and were ready to use with my google devices. The only knock I would give it is that each bulb is suppose to be 1100 lumens I would say in my opinion that its not 1100 lumens but thats just my opinion. It does offer plenty of light for my overhead lights in my office but I was expecting more from them being 1100 lumens but otherwise does what it suppose to do so cant knock it entirely.

dkeith,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2023","My sense is that WYZE has focused on marketing at the expense of functionality.
Set up is pretty easy. The bulb has good brightness and every color you'd want. Creating a rule is straightforward. My bulbs turn on properly at the time I scheduled. One bulb that I scheduled to turn off at Sunrise is actually off several hours before that. I've tried 3 bulbs so far. None will reliably turn on the the programmed color.
I have rebooted the bulbs, cleared cache, and updated firmware. When I asked a customer service person why the bulb turns off at a random time, he suggested I wait for a firmware update.
The ""History"" tab inside Edit Rules does not show what the bulb did. In my case, it says it was turned off at Sunrise even though I know it was off well before then. On the other hand, the Rule for a bulb may say to use color X, but the history will show color Y was requested. Just weird.
As other reviewers have stated, I have also found the app to be slow and glitchy. It crashes often. I use IOS 16.4.1.
WYZE Bulb Color is an early stage product. The WYZE Bulbs I have tried are not able to deliver on their promise. Perhaps bugs will get worked out in time. Unless you're willing to fuss with them and cope with the frustration of bugs, I'd steer clear of them for now.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Lucas Everett,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2022","The bulb itself is great. The saturation of colors is just as good as my more expensive LIFX bulbs. I have no concerns about the Wyze bulb being a good replacement for a LIFX bulb.
However, the app is too basic. It's missing important features that I use daily in the LIFX app. The biggest loss from LIFX is not being able to save the current setting of all or specific lights as a Scene that can be used with Alexa or IFTTT. Over the years I've become very dependent on using Scenes with Alexa and IFTTT.
Based on the high praise in reviews I had hoped that I could save money by replacing my oldest LIFX bulbs that are nearing death after 6 years, but the Wyze app just isn't good enough to replace the LIFX app.
If this is your first smart bulb, you will likely be happy with it because you won't have any expectations from experience with LIFX as I do, but if you're looking at Wyze bulbs as an alternative to LIFX bulbs, you will likely be disappointed.",3.0 out of 5 stars

CaptainRoy,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2021","These were an impulse purchase for me - I liked the idea of being able to set the lights to the movie and gaming settings. I bought 2 boxes - 4 bulbs. I had a few problems with pairing them at first, so I looked a little closer at the instructions - the turn on/turn off 3 times in a row thing wasn’t something I would have figured out on my own. I also had a few problems setting them up with Alexa - Amazon is really at fault there, I think, because it wasn’t clear what to do if the pairing didn’t work.
As far as the bulbs go, they look great. The app is kind of clunky though - it could definitely be much easier to use. I think it’s outweighed by the fact that they’re inexpensive and you don’t need a hub to use them. I’m pretty satisfied with the bulbs themselves - it’s just that the software on both sides of the fence could be better.",4.0 out of 5 stars
NickY.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2022","First of all if you are reading this because you are consider buying these, don't. Save yourself the headache and trouble. But, if you are like me and you believed all the good reviews and now your stuck with these bulbs hopefully I can make your day.
I won't tell you how long it took me to install these light bulbs because it is embarrassing. Tech support couldn't help one bit when I told them I could not control the bulbs from Alexa (server is not responding error) they offered a warranty replacement in 7-10 business days. I said ""no way Jose"" and went back to troubleshooting because I am stubborn. I finally got them to work but it was quite stupid what I had to do to make it happen.
So I have some very important advice for you if you intend to pair these with Alexa.
IGNORE THE FIRMWARE UPDATE OFFERED after you connect them to wifi, trust me don't do it now, do it later if you want. Next connect the bulbs in the Wyze App but DO NOT CONNECT to alexa from the wyze app. From the Wyze app set your color for all the bulbs being installed to ""Energized"" preset and SET BRIGHTNESS ON ALL BULBS to 100% (the default is 50%). Now go to Alexa App and click add device, light bulb, Wyze, Color Bulb. If you do it this way it will work. If you do it other ways it can take you hours to install these. Huge waste of my time.

Jared Lenn,"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2023","My first bulb came DOA, but thankfully wyze sent me a new one. Unfortunately they didn't go through amazon, so I had to wait 2 weeks for my replacement. The new one worked, and it is pretty much as advertised. It is quite bright, which is nice, and you can set it to pretty much every color.
However, the main reason I bought the bulb was so I could cycle my room's color temperature throughout the day and have a nice warm glow at night. The app has a section where you get a wheel (??? color temperature is a linear scale) to select color temperature, and they all look awful. Anything white or soft white has a fluorescent quality to it and the warmer colors have a sickly greenish cast. I was also unimpressed by the other colors, which didn't really have any depth or intensity to them and just made my room a weird pale version of that color.
If you're getting this light to make fun tiktok videos then go ahead, but I would get something else (have heard good things about the philips warm glow) if you want something nice to live with.

Dr. Ken,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2022","These Wyze lightbulbs work very well - they give off a good amount of light, you can select the temperature and color of the light, and they integrate well with Alexa. For example, you can have your system set up so that if a driveway cam detects people motion, it turns the lights ON in the front room so that it appears that someone woke up and is responding to activity in the driveway. (Used to be able to do this exact same thing with Nest until Google took over and took away that functionality.)

Apoc,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2022","Oh man, was I really looking forward to getting these, and oh man, was I so disappointed in the end. At first, these were great. Looked nice, easy to setup and work with. It didn't take too long for the cracks to start to show, though.
The first thing that annoyed me was that the Wyze app widget on iOS doesn't support the bulbs. Not a deal breaker, but a disappointment for sure. I managed to cobble together a working solution with Voice Monkey and Alexa using Shortcuts, so it's fine.
Then, certain lights would fail to turn on or off and I would have to repeat commands, often multiple times, half the time giving up and having to manually open the app simply because the bulbs are not responding to Alexa.
Then the power outages started. That setting for remembering the previous state of the light in the event of a power loss? Well, they apparently forgot to engineer the component that allows the bulbs to remember their settings, because every time we have a power outage for even a second, every light is on, and won't reconnect to the Wi-Fi without being manually power cycled anywhere from 1-20 times. Be prepared to do this on a per-bulb basis. Don't even bother changing the setting back, because it doesn't do anything. This almost entirely negates their usefulness as a ""smart"" device because they require too much manual intervention.
Annoyingly, these also seem to briefly cycle through the entire color spectrum each time they are powered on/off, and do so incredibly brightly, enough to hurt my eyes.

I called customer service, and after being on hold for almost 30 minutes they said they would replace the bulbs. I was then sent an email asking for all this information to replace the product:

- Please provide the Wyze order number or a screenshot of the Proof of Purchase.
- Share the MAC address, Serial Number, and Model ID located on your device’s label.
- Provide a screenshot of the product’s Device Info page or a picture of the label of your product.
- The Device Info page is in the Wyze app under the product’s Settings.
I get the proof of purchase part, but going around and collecting all this information, especially since they can get it all from my account connected to their system, is another hour of time I will waste on this product.

Benjamin,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2023","I rarely review products these days - Amazon ratings seem broken or gamed most of the time - but I'm actually taking a few minutes to describe just how stunningly bad these bulbs actually are. Like others here, I ordered these after reading a Wirecutter review and thinking that the time was right to actually try a smart bulb. Three takeaways:
1) The firmware situation, wherein bulbs are shipped with old firmware and are unable to be updated from the app, holds true well over a year after being first described. I managed to get a few randomly updated after several hours of trying and retrying, but others are stuck, making it impossible for me to group them into rooms or use current features.
2) The app is hot garbage. Extremely slow to open, crashes often. (Currently in some weird cycle where it will not in fact open.) Lag of ten seconds or more to turn a bulb on or off. Lots of ads in the app for rules and widgets, but the actual functionality I'd want from a widget - the ability to turn a bulb or group easily on and off from the home screen - doesn't exist, it just opens up the app instead, where you wait in some prolonged purgatory state for it to open.
3) The bulb colors are just kind of sickly. I don't know if it's low CRI or just the way the color algorithm works, but the daylight looks like an operating room and the soft white looks like everyone has jaundice.

Jeenyus,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2023","When I first bought these bulbs I was in love with them! They are so bright and the colors are beautiful in my vintage lamp. Everything was fine for a couple of years and many people asked about them and likely also purchased them. But then sometime in 2022 the app and bulbs started having major issues. The bulbs often disconnect and I can’t turn them on and occasionally can’t turn them off, either. The app freezes immediately and consistently upon opening, sometimes working after that and sometimes just repeatedly crashing (iPhone). Between every action it freezes and it’s coin flip on whether or not it will work. Things were so great in the beginning, and much like a bad relationship, I keep holding out for the people at Wyze to get it ironed out. But now I’ve finally had it. My young daughter was ill and vomiting in the middle of the night and I attempted to use our Alexa to turn the light on. It wouldn’t work, despite my repeated nighttime pleas it “wasn’t responding” and we were left with a sick child and huge mess in the dark until we had a free hand to unplug the light. That was a terrible and frustrating experience. I do have another brand, not a major brand, and despite it being dimmer it has worked consistently for years (I got it before Wyze and made the switch, ugh).

Garvin,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2023","if you buy these bulbs be prepared to be disappointed and frustrated. The light output is great and the colors were fine, but the app is horrible.

So after you've spent hours frustratingly dialing in everything exactly the way you want it with, pray to god that your power never goes out.
If your power ever flickers or fails then you will be forced to delete the lights from the app and Alexa along with every setting that you've created and start over again.

Version 2 bulbs for me have a failure rate of 80% and higher. I live outside the US, and I can't think of any reason for this level of failure. And Wyze support was useless. The last for the first pairing, then the first 30 minutes, then they turn off, turn color (like green or purple, and they stay that color for 30 seconds AFTER you remove them from the lamp - see photo) then they never turn back on. This happened with 3 boxes of v2 color bulbs. I returned them. Then I got two v2 of the tunable ""white"". SAME PROBLEM. Now, before you conclude this must be my electric system - it is not - we have 30 Wyze version zero and v1 bulbs in color and tunable ""white"" and they do NOT have this problem and are continue to work daily for the last years. Be very careful of this bulb.

I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the Wyze LED light bulbs and the corresponding application. From the beginning, these light bulbs have had severe connection issues, often losing connection and rendering them unusable through the application. Additionally, the application has constantly crashed, and even though they have made updates, every single update has been meaningless, and simply meant to make me feel as if they were working on improving the application. This experience has been extremely frustrating and has made me regret my purchase every day.
I have contacted Wyze's customer support on multiple occasions to try and resolve the issues but haven’t received any assistance. I have also tried various troubleshooting steps, including resetting the lightbulbs, deleting the app and reinstalling, and ensuring my phone was up-to-date, but none of these solutions helped to stop the issue.
As a result, I believe that the product is so bad that only getting my money back would be a viable solution. If a meaningful resolution doesn't happen, I will be reporting this to the Better Business Bureau. Furthermore, I would strongly urge anyone considering purchasing this product to skip this brand altogether, and even spend extra money on a better brand if they have to.

Jesse Brown,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2023","Wyze's app is absolutely horrible, quite literally makes these products useless.
The lights have issues staying connected to the app. They'll be fine for a few weeks, then they'll start disconnecting after I activate a shortcut or rule, sometimes they'll randomly disconnect altogether and cause my timed rules to not go off (yay missed alarms). Each time this issue arises I have to reset the lights, delete them from the app, add them back into the app, and log them back into my wifi, just for them to disconnect again a few hours later.
The color selector for the lightbulbs is also bugged and you can't use the colors on the bottom of the wheel correctly, so any red, orange, purple, or blue you choose will be badly washed out. Although for some reason the color selector in the shortcut-creation section works perfectly, so if you want to use the light's full color spectrum, you have to go through the process of creating a shortcut for each individual device and color, adding it to the toolbar, then going back to the main screen to test it and see if it's actually the color you wanted.",1.0 out of 5 stars
kanjii,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2023","Do not believe the 4-1/2 star rating. If you sort all reviews from most recent to oldest, you will see that most recent reviews give this product one star. It may have worked once, but the latest iteration is crap.
Original review:
I purchased these bulbs for two things:
- their sunrise/sunset routines
- voice control via Alexa
Three of the bulbs were relatively easy to set up. The fourth was trouble from the start,but eventually got the smart features working (for less than a week). Over the next four weeks each bulb failed in a different way.
The smart features stopped working on all the other bulbs. The first bulb stopped putting out any light whatsoever. The second bulb is stuck in a 10% red setting. The third is stuck in a 100% bright white light setting. When switched on, the fourth bulb flashes green indicating it wants to pair but doesn't pair, and then switches to bright white.
This says buggy software and poor quality control to me. Smart features were great while they lasted but none lasted more than a month.
Cannot recommend.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Gabi,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2023","First things first: I love this brand. My entire home ecosystem is from this brand. But the reliability of the light bulbs is so bad. This is the second time an entire batch burns and stops working hours after installing. Last time I contacted them and they sent me a new (4 bulb) box from which if I remember correctly 1 burned a few days in but the rest continued to work for a while. Still, the longevity of the 'working' ones compared to regular bulbs is BAD. That's what got me to this situation, to have to buy another box. This time I bought the color ones thinking I may have more luck. No. Not at all. Box of 2 bulbs, both burned within hours. I really want to continue betting on this company since I have my entire home setup with their products but also because I like their mindset. But this is not working. I would recommend other products from them but sadly stay away from the bulbs.",1.0 out of 5 stars

B Lee,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2023","You are REQUIRED to sign up for a Wyze account before you can do anything. This is not clearly stated, nor is it in any way optional. I'm not really okay with that, but maybe it's not that bad. Look at the permissions required, and nope--it's definitely not a good thing at all.
Even after signing up for an account, the app then demanded location permissions, which is not required for a lightbulb, or even a camera, lock, or any of the other things I've seen from this company. After that, the app would not connect to my lightbulbs (probably because I'm still using a 4G phone) and after wasting close to an hour of time, mostly because of no clear or detailed instructions, I chose to return them the same day I got them.
Now I can't seem to locate a way to delete my account information from Wyze; I suspect this is just another Big Data grab by some West-Taiwanese company. No thanks, and I'd suggest you pass on it, too, if you have any respect for your own privacy.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Support service is poor because of lack of skill and, most importantly, complete indifference to providing service.

Terrence Ryan,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2023","DO NOT BUY WYZE PRODUCTS
The bulbs seem fine but I haven't thad a much of a chance to really use them because the app is garbage. It takes AT LEAST three attempts for the app to open without crashing. When it does finally open, there's a 5 second lag to do anything. When I do finally open the interface to a light I can do exactly one change before the app freezes and/or crashes. You want to change the color and the brightness? Nope. Choose one and you better get it right because it will be at least three minutes before you get the opportunity to do it again.
I only bought these because I also use their camera system. It's cheap but at least kinda worked. The lights have rendered the security cameras useless because when there is someone at my door or in my yard I can't get the app to open in time to see what is actually going on.

Alvin Oei,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2021","We purchased this light on Amazon Prime Day for $1 as it was a featured product. Reviews really weren't that important because, well...it was $1 and a good intro into the world of smart color LED bulbs.
We own an Amazon Echo Studio and were excited to pair this light with it, figuring it would be very easy, like most user-friendly products these days.
The first steps, right out of the box, are basically to screw it in. It turns on and in order to put it into pairing mode, you turn it off/on for 3 times. That seemed very easy and straight to the point.
It was the next part that completely ruined the experience for me, and the attached photo is why. In order for my Wifi network to ""find"" the bulb, I first need to log out of my home Wifi and into the ""Wyze_smartbulb_apxxx"" network. It doesn't really show up, so I have to type it in manually. Problem is, it needs a PASSWORD. After multiple tries, I honestly gave up and didn't understand why the FIRSTS STEP was so difficult. After reaching out to WYZE a week ago, and without a response...I wondered if all LED Alexa lights were like this. I'm not sure where all these great reviews are honestly coming from. Maybe everyone got lucky and were able to access ""Wyze_smartbulb_apxxx"" automatically, but there's just...so....many...steps. Why bother?
Bought a SENGLED, since it came highly recommended. Turned it on. Amazon Echo Studio found it immediately and I literally had to do nothing. It's all controlled from within the Alexa app.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Jonathan Snyder,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2023","Bought two of these for my living room in mid March 2023. By November I noticed the bulbs were showing as offline in the app. Ended up resetting my wifi router one evening and they worked fine the rest of the day. But the next day they were back to showing offline. Did a little more research and found a firmware update they were missing......TOTALL HEADACHE. Multiple router resets and still only one of the two updated. I gave up and figured I'd come back the next day. I did so....and the bulb that DID update its firmware was back to showing offline. From what I've seen Wyze's solution is to mail people new bulbs that are also missing current firmware updates and have the same issue updating.
I've removed the bulbs and don't plan on buying a Wyze produce ever again. They were great for a few months, but in the long run they are total garbage.",1.0 out of 5 stars
D. Luciano,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2023","I started hearing alot about Smart Bulbs and I decided to give them a shot. I read good reviews on several brands but decided to go with Wyze because they were the brand that had the most wattage per bulb. Also, Amazon had a great deal that week if you purchased the 4-pack, so I did. The problem came when I was installing them.
The lights turned on ok and I was able to control them with the Wyze app but the app offered a firmware update to take advantage of additional features. To this day, and I purchased these bulbs several months ago, I have been unable to update the firmware. I went online to investigate it further, only to learn that many others were experiencing the same issue. Any possible solution I discovered online has not worked for me.

I can't because it won't recognize the log-in and password I set. Even without these annoyances, the app is not easy to use.

Walter Kurtz,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2022","I have smart home products from a number of manufacturers. The Wyze are the worst I have seen so far. I bought 8 of the colored smart bulbs. Every single one was a struggle to set up. They required multiple resets etc. Then after I got them connected, they all lost the wifi connection after a couple of days. All of them.
I work in a high-tech field so I know all the ins and outs of wifi and routers as well as tips and tricks for getting smart home products working. Wyze bulbs don't.
By contrast, all of the other smart home products I have (smart switches, bulbs, lamps) from other companies were much easier to set up and they have never been a problem. They stayed connected when the Wyze didn't. I'll be returning all of my Wyze bulbs.
Follow-up: I returned the Wyze bulbs and replaced them with another brand. I won't say which lest I be accused of shilling. The other brand's bulb were a breeze to set up and I haven't had any problems with them at all. Nothing changed. Same router, same wifi etc. Just the brand of bulb.

Music Lover,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2022","One ""Bulb Color"" has worked well while a second has needed to be reset several times. Now it will not connect to Alexa at all even though you can access it through the Wyze app. Wyze integration with Alexa just periodically stops with different bulbs having the same firmware. This is an issue with this specific bulb but they also have issues with the connection between the Alexa and Wyze servers. That service link has gone down a couple of times for BOTH bulbs in the few months that I have owned them.
I called Wyze after a couple of hours of troubleshooting. They asked me to send in a log file but refused to replace the bulb. I have a second bulb that works fine so this issue has to be with the one bulb. They actually told me to ""wait until the next firmware upgrade.""
If you are hoping to use this with Alexa I would suggest waiting until Wyze sorts this out or, better yet, just try another company.

I tested it out on another l2 lamps that are three way switches and they work. The other problem is I get a notification to update the firmware, but it never will update and I get the “Oops” message that other reviewers had mentioned. After that, it loses contact with even their own app. It will not integrate with Alexa as it cannot find the bulbs. Probably because it disconnected.

CT,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","I liked the range of light colors, mostly to fiddle with how white the light is. I managed to connect them with no serious issues, although what everybody says about the app and connecting is true. Unfortunately, they are unreliable. I have two that are supposed to light up together on one voice command, or separately on other voice commands. They are also supposed to turn on when someone emters the room. Well.
One or both might light up at first, or they might not. Sometimes they light up for about a second, then go out. One might light up, while the other lights up and goes out. Sometimes, they even work the way they’re supposed to! This is rare.
I uninstalled, re-installed, tried different light bulb sockets, and various mechanisms to manipulate them, i.e., Alexa, tablet, phone, Alexa app, Wyze app. Nothing works any better than anything else.

PickyChick,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2022","I got one of these bulbs a few months ago, and although the set up proved painful and confusing, I did eventually get it connecting to the network and operating correctly. This time no dice. The app couldn't find the bulb. When I finally got it to connect, then there is a firmware update that you HAVE TO install to operate the bulb. This fails over and over again. I pore over the Wyze website and the internet in general looking for troubleshooting advice. None of it works. This is not worth the aggravation.
The original bulb I did get to work had some annoying traits: I set it to turn on and off on a schedule. Often the off part wouldn't work- no idea why. The color select palate is tricky to hone in on what you actually want. Difficult to get a decent slightly warm white. Also- I find that having to use my phone to turn it on or dim it is a hassle.

barkler,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2023",I bought two of these. I was only able to get one to connect to the app. Both are visible in Bluetooth but the app will not find one of them no matter what I tried. The one that was able to connect to the app did not respond to any commands from the app. Would not change color/profile. If you attempted to turn it off it would not respond for about 45 seconds to a minute. Which means it would randomly turn off much later inconsistent with instruction from the app. I was hoping these would work because I have a wyze can and it seems to do fine. Unfortunately I'll have to look at choosing a whole separate environment/app to smart automation.,1.0 out of 5 stars
Gregory T,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2022","There’s not much to like. I bought 3 packs of these bulbs on a Black Friday deal and they’re infuriating. After downloading the app and taking the time to set each one up, I quickly discovered that they randomly un-pair from the app and need to be set up again.
What’s infuriating is that when they unpair they turn to a flashing green color for three minutes. Then, if you don’t pair them they turn into an obnoxious ultra-bright white light that can’t be changed… unless you pair them.
Most of them can’t stay paired for more than a few hours. None of them last the day. I’ve tried multiple outlets, chandeliers, lamps. I even have a lamp plugged into a power conditioner I use for audio equipment.

Anonymous_Reviewer,"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2022","Of the 40 bulbs I purchased three months ago, 2 were dead out of the box, 2 would not accept a firmware update, and 6 have failed LEDs. Additional hardware issues include frequent network disconnects, not turning on until removed from power for 10 seconds, and bulbs getting hung in a strobe light effect instead of turning completely off.
The application frequently fails to do what I request, but shows it was successful. For example, if you power on the lights from the application, it will ignore any brightness or color adjustments you make but shows the changes are active.
Having come from the original Wyze bulbs, this is disappointing. 2 years of those bulbs resulted in 1 failure out of 40. Here, we have 10 failures in 3 months. These are clearly not ready for production or they had a bad production run. Either way, it may be worth looking into more reliable vendors, even if the costs are higher.",1.0 out of 5 stars

This bulb has plenty of color range and brightness, but as a ""smart"" product, it's trash, with a trash app, and trash customer support. If you try to call them, it's literally the same message on loop, without break, again and again, endlessly until you give up.

D. Harrison,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2022","This was a great bulb for about a week. I bought two. Both have the same issue. After the first week they fell off the network. They are supposed to become discoverable by turning them on and off three times in a row. They will pulse when they are discoverable. Unfortunately they do not pulse when you turn them on and off three time, or any number of times. They only pulse the first time you install them. After that they are just a regular light bulb: no color changes, no dimming, no Wyze app, no Alexa. Just an expensive dim bulb.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Shannon Snow,"Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2023","I wish I had tried these bulbs before I was past the return date. Life got in the way and I stashed these bulbs until I had the time to figure out the set up. I replaced existing Edison style smart bulbs with the hopes of getting more productive grow style lights for my plant wall. The point of smart bulbs is to control remotely. These are NEVER connected. I’m lucky if one actually goes on when scheduled. Currently it’s says the “plant wall” group is off on the app but clearly 2/3 are on. The only way to correct that is to power cycle them. Easy enough, unless the knob to the light fixture is 8feet up your wall and over a dresser. I’m literally trying to sleep with these lights on because I cannot turn them off manually right now. I’m debating just putting my other bulbs back in here and chucking these bulbs. I hate to be out the $ but it’s not worth the frustration. I’ll stick with Cync bulbs and deal with less brightness",2.0 out of 5 stars
D-M0NEY,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2021","I've been a big fan of Wyze ever since I bought their $40 pan and tilt camera 2 years ago. It has always worked great (until recently). But now reading reviews about all the other Wyze products it looks like they're losing their touch. Lots of connection loss and syncing issues. Lots of issues with the Wyze app in general. My camera notifies me all the time with movement outside the detection zone. Wyze is just a hit-or-miss company, there's luck involved with their products working right. They're not reliable anymore. Anyway, this bulb always tells me to upgrade firmware, but it will not connect to my network. And yes, I have it on a 2.4ghz internet connection, not a 5ghz. Its the SAME network another Wyze product is already on! I've tried 5 times now and it just disconnects after a few minutes and makes me go through the pairing process again. The app does connect to the bulb during pairing and I can control some of the features but other features say I need to upgrade firmware to use it. So I'm stuck without the timer feature, the feature I bought it for. Again my Wyze cam is synced and updates fine. The bulb will not update. Also, the sleep routine option doesn't work correctly. It turns on but does not turn off at the specified time. Hopefully I get the firmware updated and all is well. As of now I'm disappointed in Wyze. Thought I found my forever brand....",2.0 out of 5 stars
Brian Jensen,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2021","Similar to many, with the shortages of Hue-related bulbs on the market, I decided to try Wyze' color bulbs. I thought I knew what I was getting into (I have a few other Wyze products around the house), and bought three x4 packs of bulbs. On delivery, 2 of the 12 bulbs were clearly defective -- colors would flicker, or wouldn't illuminate at all -- so Amazon was great and provided for an exchange.
Less than 2 months later, several other bulbs have died (or are in the process of failing). Tried to get support from Wyze first (in the Wyze control app) -- it's laughable at best. At worst, you suspect that this is truly the epitome of using poorly designed chatbots to cut as many corners as possible.
Reached back out to Customer Support at Amazon, and again, they were great. Put my on the phone with a Wyze rep directly, and that's where it went bad again. After a lengthy conversation about all the things we should try to resolve the issue, we got to the point of sorting out a RMA for the multiple bad bulbs, and the Wyze rep promised to follow back up via email as next steps.
3 days later, no response from Wyze, and Amazon is stuck. To be fair, the bulbs (when they work) seem a fair stopgap solution until Hue stock is back to normal, but don't fool yourself that a ~$12 smart color lightbulb is going to perform (or be supported) similar to Hue devices.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Quahog,"Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2022","I own multiple Wyze products and they offer nice capabilities at a good price when they work. Unfortunately, the Wyze Bulb Color does not measure up. In order to function properly, the bulb's firmware must be kept up to date. As you can see from my screenshot, one bulb is up to date, the other refuses to update successfully. The failed bulb referenced in the screenshot is a replacement for a previously failed Wyze Bulb Color that exhibited the same problem. The bulbs are being used side by side in a ceiling fixture (no dimmer switch on the wall) and are located in the same room as one node of my mesh wifi system, so signal strength is not an issue. I'm now waiting on yet another replacement.
This all comes as a surprise since Wirecutter named this bulb their pick among all smart bulbs. A little research (sadly made after the purchase) shows the problem I am having is a persistent problem with the Wyze Bulb Color. There are hundreds of support queries for this exact issue on Wyze's own support page, and thousands across the web, going back multiple years. Two extended Wyze support chats got me no closer to a solution other than trying another bulb. 🙄",2.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2023","Wouldn't buy again. Just ok, the cheap Phillips Wiz lights work better and do more. Music mode requires a light strip with a microphone to be paired to it. Not the most fluid or intuitive app control. Can't create a pair in the master account and a different pairing in another users account so that's annoying or you can't add the lights to another group if they are in one already. The color production and saturation is nice but they don't get dim enough and don't get super bright either. A couple bulbs also either get frozen and you can't control them or had trouble pairing initially. A few lights also lose connection entirely at random.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Chuck,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2022","I ordered these bulbs with high expectations and was very excited. I received them in a timely manner and installed them. When trying to upgrade is where experienced some difficulty. I had to reinstall them over and over again because it wouldn’t take the upgrade. They kept erroring out. Finally I got them to accept the upgrade in the firmware because that’s the only way they will let Alexa control them. I originally bout 2 of the 4 packs of bulbs and it’s been about 2 weeks and 2 of the 8 bulbs have already burned out and I can’t return them for replacement unless I return all four of a pack. They seem to be great bulbs as far as brightness and color, but if they can’t resolve the quality of the construction of the bulb then they are hardly worth it. I hope they improve because they could be a great bulb and the Wyze company offers a lot of tech products now which makes it great as a one stop shop, but if the quality of these color changing bulbs are a testament to the quality of the rest of their products, they could go down in flames and I’d hate to see that happen as I was looking forward to buying more of their products. As for now I’m going to hold off until they resolve this issue.",2.0 out of 5 stars
jacob,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2023","Was hoping to use these to fix the miserable notification speed that the video doorbell has. Someone could break in and clear house before you were told the doorbell was pressed. Tested out using a Tuya smart bulb to illuminate using IFTTT (free, 3rd party integration service) which would trigger my Google Assistant speaker to announce the visitors. Unfortunately, this hack solution works BETTER than using an all-Wyze ecosystem. Bulb is even more miserably slow to respond to the doorbell, and Wyze has some of the worst Google Home integration I've ever encountered. Despite being just rebranded Chinese white-label products, they perform worse than the cheaper alternatives from the same market. No reason to stay in the ecosystem when it doesn't play nice with itself. Sorry, Wyze. Not so willing to stick with your products since you made the original Sense product-line worthless, swept that under the rug, and just tried again with new products - without any guarantee there was any fix.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Anthony,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2023","These bulbs are great when they work but really suck when they don't. For the most part, things work smoothly. I can ask Google to turn any lights on in any room, there's usually a delay for me for about 5 to 10 seconds before the light actually responds, but that doesn't really matter to me as long as they work. Every month to two months the lights just randomly stopped working. And I have to go through a setup for each light to get them back working and connected with Google. The most recent time I did it they're still not connecting right and it's annoying to not have a sync properly in Google Home or the wyze app for that matter",2.0 out of 5 stars
Bill Andrews,"Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2023","Setting up the bulbs on the network was painless, but updating firmware was spoty. Discovered as others have noted, update each bulb individually, not as a group.
The second cumbersome task was understanding the menu design. It took viewing several YouTube podcasts to understand how to create groups, seriously!
The third burdensome task was applying color and temperature characteristics. Applying these to one device, no problem; however, multiple bulbs, super complicated, not user friendly!
Last, turning on a group, like bedroom lights, might result in one bulb turning on in the group. I tried many scenarios to get the group to work, but found this a hit or miss operation. What a headache!
I know these issues will not resolve themselves soon. So, I may give up, and remove the groups and operate the bulbs individually. Very disappointing, but considering the cost, keeps the door open for other lighting solutions.",2.0 out of 5 stars

If I want to turn in a bulb, change the color, and brightness I need to open the app at least 3 times. For two bulbs, it becomes 6+ times.

But today was the last straw. The bulbs require a Wyze server to send commands from Alexa, to the server, to the bulbs. Every time you want to turn it on or off. But what happens when there are server issues?
You get to sit in the dark because they won't turn on, or you get to sit in a fully lit room because they all came on and you can't turn them off.

My problem is that it won't work with two of my (normal) lamps with no reason apparent to me as to why not, plus I cannot get Alexa to recognize it so it has to have it's own separate app w no voice control that I have to use instead as opposed to my other smart bulbs which all have synced up with Alexa brilliantly and can be controlled conveniently with my echo dot.

The post is well within my wireless network's range and is not on a dimmer. The only thing I think that might be causing the problem is that it is on a two-way switch.
I'm also disappointed that there are not themes that would cycle through a few color combinations like red/white/blue or red/green for the holidays or just cycle through the basic colors like you find on a light strip.

BuyTheThings,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024","Wyze caused all of my bulbs (and all my cameras) to restart at 2am in the morning recently. Because the lights turn on after they've restarted, that means all my lights in my bedroom came on. I have a sleep routine set so that they start to come on 20 minutes before my alarm - which made me think it was almost time to get up. I kept falling asleep waiting for the alarm and waking back up because of the lights. That happened for hours before I realized something was wrong. Wyze had no answer for me as to why they did that - they just ""passed along"" my message to the developers. We'll see if this happens again. Knowing Wyze, it probably will.
BTW I had no rules set to make them restart/turn on/etc at 2am. Wyze must have sent some sort of update to bulbs and cameras precisely at 2:00am (it's common for IT departments to issue updates to devices in the middle of the night).
I also know I could disable the feature that makes the light turn on after power is restored, but I want that feature on in case of an emergency if I needed to turn the lights on quickly. I can press the wall switch twice to quickly turn them off and then back on without having to involve Google Assistant or the Wyze app.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Olof Johnsson,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2021","Very capable bulb. Colorful, bright, dim--you choose! But it could benefit by addition of granular color and color temperature controls (RGB, HSB, or hex), and a precise (numeric) Kelvin color temperature selector. The color wheel seems a little imprecise, so choosing a specific color (eg, chartreuse, sea green, African violet, etc) is ""hit-and-miss,"" which is why granular input would be a big benefit. It would also help to see exact Kelvin temperature gradations for White (eg, 1000K, 2000K, 3000K, etc). Other than those nitpicks and the first-time connection (a bit of a challenge, but finally got it right), Wyze Bulb Color is a great product with sturdy packaging.

DK.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2021","I have a few Kasa bulbs already so no stranger to rgb bulbs. I got my first two Wyze the other day and had troubles. They would both go thru the setup, the router would assign them an address, Alexa recognized them with no input from me. That was the end of the initial good experience. Once joined and in the app they would do nothing at all, including getting the updated firmware that was prompted instead of asked for. They would not update, nor would the Wyze app or Alexa control them.
I looked online and saw a few other folk had the same problem with no written solution. I chatted with Wyze who wanted me to ship them to Wyze for replacement, almost immediately. We did no testing but I was extremely thorough in what I had already done.
I used Amazon and their super amazing Prime return policy to get another pair. The second pair both worked as they should have (absolutely no hick-ups).
These bulbs are bright, fast, and seem like great quality. I truly think that the first two bulbs were part of a bad or premature shipment as they both did not work correctly in the exact same way. It happens I guess.
The 1100 lumen Wyse is about a 75w equivalent, the 850 lumen Kasa is about 60w equivalent. They both operate at full brightness quite warm. The Wyze only slightly warmer than the Kasa.
I would not put either in an enclosed fixture. The heat alone would cause them to fail faster.
I'll buy more.",4.0 out of 5 stars

It’s my first smart light bulb, and I am way more delighted with the range of colors than anticipated. I love that you can select any color, vary the brightness, and vary the whiteness (super bright white to a deep orange perfect for bedtime). I do wish it went a bit dimmer, even 1% feels relatively bright just before bed, but it probably wouldn’t be an issue if it wasn’t directly over my head. It was a bit finicky to get set up on the app (said my wifi password was incorrect when I knew it wasn’t) but it didn’t take all too long to get totally set up.

Desert Backpacker,"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2022","The max brightness is perfect. All other colored smart bulbs have been too dim for anything other than one lamp in a room or a place that doesn't need to be bright like a living room (how I prefer). This includes the $200 Philips set 3 bulb set which has been retired to the bedroom.
The app is a little basic...not a lot of preset color modes.
I have never been able to successfully update the bulb. If anyone knows how to resolve it, let me know.
I will likely buy another soon. The 16-17 year old cat sleeping on my lap insists on it. Getting up to turn off the light across the room disturbs his beauty sleep.",5.0 out of 5 stars
David Berrios,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2021","These bulbs seem great. I had no issues adding them to the Wyze app, connecting them to Wifi, and grouping them. Also, adding them to Google Home was easy.
The Wyze app has more functionality with these bulbs but Google Home is easier to use to turn the bulbs on and off. The grouping also shows up correctly in Google Home. I use three in a bathroom above the mirror. I also use a Kasa Smart switch to allow me to turn the bulbs off physically with a switch when needed.
The only annoying thing is: don't toggle the light switch three times in a row rapidly unless you really do want to reset them and put them in pairing mode. When you do this, the bulbs pulse green and eventually go back to the previous state. After this happens, they don't seem to connect or recover the previous bulb settings with respect to the Wyze app or Google Home. You'll have to set them up and group them all over again.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The app Wyze is easy to use and can't speak for Alexa integration but I'm sure it's phenomenal since I have it synced with Google home and it works wonders! A simple ""hey Google, turn on lights"" or anything you can think of Google works really well! I couldn't be more happier with this purchase!

The Alexa integration is nice. It would be great if voice commands to change colors and brightness easier but as of now these types of changes require you to program scenes. Really not that difficult but I sometimes find myself going into the Wyze app to adjust some settings.

They have an excellent color range and have been working great with Google and Alexa integration as well as the Wyze app. They are a little more expensive than some of the other options out there but worth the extra cost.,5.0 out of 5 stars
r015mg,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2023","Very happy with these. Colors are great, brightness is great. Smoothness and transitions and responsiveness are great.

Joshua Brooks,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2022","i have alot of wyze products and im still impressed by their stuff. i use these mostly with my google home i have over 20 around the house my favorite thing is i can turn off all the lights from the app if kids leave them on and they love being able to change the color just with using the google homes, very bright",5.0 out of 5 stars
James Burton,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2021",If you are like me and bought the wyze cam v3 and spotlight then you would have been disappointed with the spotlights inability to Turn itself off after turning on based on a rule. With the bulb you can set off timers after it’s been on for a certain amount of time. This is great because it can then be linked to The spotlight to turn off. It’s a roundabout way to fix something that shouldn’t be a problem with their other products but it’s a good way to do it.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Kyle Kunkle,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2023","Works great! Good color options, and you can group your lights by room if you want, and set your own presets, or choose from existing ones! Setup with wyze app was super simple and easy, but I haven't tried to attach them to a voice assistant yet",5.0 out of 5 stars
Wh33tbread,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2022","I don't have an Echo, so I can't speak to their Alexa abilities. What I do have, however, is a Google Home product, and these work very well with it. The colors are nice, the pairing process was alright, and it does the job just fine.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Tom Zbruz,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2022",I currently own eight of these. They are brighter than others I’ve tried even when dimmed the colors are nice and bright. I love the feature that when power goes out they can be set to stay off so my house doesn’t light up like a Christmas tree. Will definitely buy more and I would recommend them to others.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Smiles3,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2022","I have it set up with my Wyze door lock and the geo fencing to turn green after the geo fence unlocks my door. I just look through the door glass and if it green no reason to enter the code on the keypad or get my phone out, I know the door is unlocked. The Wyze app has all the rules you can pick to get it to do most anything",5.0 out of 5 stars
Wolfe Vacation Rentals,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2022",This is a great product. I have used Wyze products for over a year. They stay connected unlike some of the other brands I've tried. There was people talking about the firmware not updating but you just have to turn the bulb off via the app first before you update and then they will update fine.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Chaos,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2021","I have never found a set of smart lights that were so easy to use and setup before. You want to set up one bulb, two bulbs, four bulbs, ten bulbs; takes max 15 seconds to complete setup for any number of colour bulbs. Great Alexa integration with routines as well. Does not actually have motion detection capabilities but it’s a LIGHT BULB. Those usually don’t have any motion sensors built into them. Would certainly purchase again in bulk to automate my entire apartment.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Leonardo F,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2022","Bought a set of these to help illuminate my otherwise dim kitchen/living room and they made a huge difference. The original light bulbs were waaay too dim compared to these.
Now we can actually see what we're cooking and eating and afterward switch it to dim ambient light while watching a movie on the couch.
Excited to see what else Wyze comes out with (hopefully more creative, affordable lighting solutions)",5.0 out of 5 stars

The Bus,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2022","The first day I plugged these in, I had no luck getting my wyze account paired with alexa. But I tried again today and as of 3/2/22 I can say they connected just fine and now that I have played with them a little, I love them every bit as much as my wyze scale. Note: I have declined the color bulb firmware update up to this point.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Mars Trader,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2022","As others mentioned, you can cut the power and not lose settings.

Alexander Oelke,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2022","I bought these wanting to have a sunrise alarm clock without paying a huge price for standalone ones. Wyze has a feature just for this need and its a great way to wake up in the morning.
I've also used them for a few alexa integrations like a warmer golden hue for going to bed and they've been great.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Alisha,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2022",Works well with Alexa and the app. My only issue is that at times the light has a mind of its own and will change colors without me initiating it. I am wondering if that means the light is going out?,5.0 out of 5 stars

so far no response from them at all... so as far as Im concerned there is no warranty on the product if you cant get any help from the manufacturer.... if you are thinking of buying this....you are 100% on your own if there is an issue",2.0 out of 5 stars

I am someone who bought into the whole wyze ecosystem (cameras, switches, bulbs, led strips, plugs) and was mostly happy with their stuff. But these bulbs seem to be turds.

Ambler,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2023","The bulbs work OK, but the app deleted the password. The process for resetting it is a circular nightmare. It doesn't matter whether I use the strong password offered by the Wyze site or my own, in the end it isn't valid.
