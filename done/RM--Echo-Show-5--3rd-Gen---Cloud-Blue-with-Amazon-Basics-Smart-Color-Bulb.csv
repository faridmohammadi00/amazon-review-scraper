Maxlee,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2024","This unit has the best sound. Hard to beat spatial speakers. It does a lot of fun things. displays your photos, plays Amazon music, works well with the Ring doorbell system. Alexa can perform simple task but has difficulty finding music albums that I ask for, and do not ask her a technical question. She dies on the vine. I gave mine to my granddaughter. The decision to dump it was it started playing commercials over my photographs. I did not purchase this unit to see adds over my photos. Good by Echo Show. Not ever again.
Doesn't Amazon make enough money elsewhere? Also, you must know you cannot place the screen face down. It goes crazy changing music every few notes. The screen starts flashing and nothing works. I had a hard time getting to the programming buttons to reset it back to factory and start over. It works well after that. A very weak control board!",5.0 out of 5 stars

We turned off the camera as it is not the best feature on the Alexa product. The camera works but does not move so it is kinda useless. We love all the other features.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Remy McNamara,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2024","I've been using the Amazon Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen, 2023 release) for a few weeks now, and I am thoroughly impressed with its performance. The Echo Show 5 has always been a reliable smart display, but this latest version truly steps up the game, especially in terms of sound quality.

**Sound Quality:**
One of the standout features of this Echo Show is its upgraded sound system. With 2x the bass and clearer sound than its predecessors, the audio quality is surprisingly robust for such a compact device. Whether I'm listening to music, catching up on the news, or watching videos, the sound is rich and immersive. It's perfect for smaller rooms, like the kitchen or bedroom, where you want good audio without the need for a larger speaker.
**Display and Design:**
The 5.5-inch screen is sharp and vibrant, making it great for watching short clips, checking the weather, or making video calls. The compact design fits easily on any shelf or counter, and the Charcoal color gives it a sleek, modern look that blends well with any decor. The screen's adaptive brightness is a nice touch, adjusting automatically based on the room's lighting.
**Smart Features and Alexa Integration:**
As expected from an Echo device, the Alexa integration is seamless. Voice commands are picked up easily, even from across the room, and the responses are quick and accurate. I use it to control my smart home devices, set reminders, and even follow along with recipes. The new smart display features also make it easier to see and control multiple smart home devices at once, which is a huge plus for someone like me who has a lot of them.
**Privacy and Security:**
Amazon has included a physical shutter for the camera, which provides peace of mind for those who are concerned about privacy. There's also a mic/camera off button, which is easy to use and effectively disables both the microphone and camera.
**Overall Performance:**
The Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) is a fantastic addition to any smart home setup. It offers a great balance of audio quality, smart features, and privacy controls. Whether you're new to smart displays or looking to upgrade, this device is definitely worth considering. It's small but mighty, and I find myself using it more than I expected for everything from checking my calendar to watching cooking videos.",5.0 out of 5 stars

D. Kodgis,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024","It is simple to use and would be simple to set up but the brightness level comes at 50% so it is very hard to see. With glasses on I could barely make out the pull down settings. I was able to put brightness up to make it easy. 4 buttons on top from left: mute, down volume, up volume, and finally to the right side, camera on or off with a slide button. Easy. It did not take my setup name from the email I got telling me to set it up before it even came. Easy enough to change in the app. Good luck with the brightness setting at set up. Small footprint!

MT,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2024","The Amazon Echo Show has completely transformed how I manage my day! This smart device does it all, it's my personal assistant, entertainment hub, and smart home controller all rolled into one sleek package.
Setting it up was a breeze. Within minutes, I was enjoying voice-controlled access to music, weather updates, and even recipes while cooking. The display is crisp and responsive, perfect for watching videos or checking my calendar at a glance.
I love how seamlessly it integrates with my other smart home devices. From adjusting lights to checking security cameras, the Echo Show makes controlling my home effortless. The voice recognition is impressively accurate, even in noisy environments.
One of my favorite features is the video calling. It’s like having a face-to-face conversation with loved ones, and the sound and picture quality are excellent. Plus, the skills and apps available through Alexa constantly expand its capabilities.
If you’re looking to add convenience and connectivity to your home, the Amazon Echo Show is a must-have. It’s intuitive, versatile, and has become an indispensable part of my daily life. Highly recommended for anyone ready to embrace smart home technology!",5.0 out of 5 stars

It's easy to use. The quality of the device is great. Alexa is sensitive to picking up other voices if it hears someone else even on my phone saying Alexa. Very useful when I want to know the weather or updated news and even to play music.

P L E A S E - - - READ MY EXPERIENCE UPDATE AFTER USING IT FOR 2 WKS. The disappointment started hours after plugging it in 2 Saturdays ago (Today is Dec 25th, 2023)
**UPDATE DECEMBER 25TH, 2023**
MAJOR disappointment.
It needs every subscription under the sun to enjoy 99% of it fully. Even ""Find my Phone"" is a charge! My ""Google Bot"" does not charge me for that.
It glitches a lot. In the 2 weeks it's been plugged in I've had to hard boot it 3 times.
AMAZON music sub or forget using it to play music you want. They support so many platforms... Not YouTube Red.
I bought the blink system, no pun intended, the cameras echo through the ECHO. 4 camera on sale too and so disappointed.
All games want you to pay for a service to use it fully.
No tier service plans... Just 25 bucks for this, 4.99 for that, 19.99 for this.. Like make a tier system or something.
It does not work friendly through the app or the ECHO itself. There is no way to have it on adaptive lighting and even wake it up and have the screen brighten a bit. Literally, no option for it. Like come on who can see that dark screen.. If you prompt it I should give off light.
It's not as friendly in its demeanor as ""The Google Bot"". No personality. No swearing. I asked it about a serious local news situation that the country is aware of for Vegas since the 6th of Dec, it told me ""Not sure what you're asking for"" my ""Google Bot"" gave me a 15 min break down of the first min of the horrible situation at my alma mater to the latest news. Sad.
The technology using it to do video calls, garbage. My tech abilities are expert level so no it's no my internet. My call with my mom and my husband both skipping, freezing. On their end and mine. Oh and forget adding all of your contacts.. That's a charge too. Otherwise you get 10 contacts it saves on itself only.
I'm so sad. I really was excited for this newer technology since I've had my ""Google Bot"" for six years.. It does more and knows more than this Echo.
The charges are the absolute worst for me. Find my phone? Really? Give me a break.
The speaker, not good over 50 to 60% ((60% is the highest you can go without it being tingy. I adjusted the mids, nothing changes... Even the little ask me the animal of the day if you want to keep going it does.. And shows you more animal sounds. But if you want MORE you have to pay for the service... For animal sounds..... Come on.
The smooth transition of screen to screen in where it flips through news..... Sadly lagging and skipping.
--IN CLOSING - - It's nothing of what I expected in speed. It's 6 feet from my modem.... It's not my connection...for the skipping screens. Lagging stories on the news when you ask it what's the story? Video calls... Useless. IT'S NOT even WORTH the sale price I got it for. Not even close.
The abilities it has to run your whole house, garage doors, emergency help, smoke, CO, thermostat list us longer than I've ever seen. If I can't even have me tell me what my local university updates are without it faking to even kno about it, who thinks I would roll the dice and pay all these subs and get more electronics to make the long list of things actually work.
1 star for technology for 2023
0 stars for personality, voice choice
0 stars for everything having a subscription montky cost.
0 stars for ease of use
0 stars for quality - freezing, skipping, lagging video play.
0 for sound.
0 for ease of app use with it
0 for BLINK app to use with Alexa
3 for looks, esthetic wise
2 for functions like making the screen brighter on adaptive lighting when touching it or voice prompting it
0 for cost of subs, extra gear.
1 for all it can do but at the price of each monthly cost to have them. Too afraid to buy the extras and add a subscription to it too.
4 stars for pre set up before even having it sent to me. Through email. Impressed, and that was the last time I was.
0 for more free options for even things like voices of Alexa, diff prompt names for Alexa, are all words I'd use every day but Ziggy do I went with that and still certain words I say pick it up and listen.
Overall average score for me (above stars) 2 stars all around.

Disappointed in Prime/Amazon/Amazon's Customer Service.
***UPDATE: December 31, 2023***
Glitches every day. I have to reboot it at least once a day. It gets stuck in broken half screen is black, loops. There is a glitch that happens every day after I do a routine in the afternoon and gets stuck doing this weird clock I don't normally see.
I'm calling Customer Service and getting a replacement. If that too is garbage, it's being returned and I want a refund.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Jeff Lines,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024","After several months of ownership, I thought I would post a review. I purchased this model particularly because it was to have support for Matter over Thread. Home automation is my the main thing I use this for with Apple products and Apple Home being my system of choice as the main control. I have an Echo Show 5 in the kitchen because that is the area where you are most likely to have your hands full and need to give a voice command. I also have a program that is basically a timer where the command is ""Run Distiller"" and it turns on the distiller and after three and a-half hours turns it off. So with that as the basis, I have a couple improvements that I have come across that are needed.
The first is a long time issue I have had with the both the 3rd generation and previous generation of Show 5 and that has to do with the total reliance on needing to be connected to the internet. This makes for a reliability issue for any program that has multiple steps and time passage between steps because ANY interruption of the internet causes that program to fail ... so then our distiller doesn't shut off until it is out of water and we have water all over the counter and crud on the bottom of the distiller that is not as easily cleaned out. It would be nice if when a program is initiated, that all steps are internalized in the Show and made local so programs ... once started ... never fail to complete. As a matter of fact, it would be nice if there wasn't such a total reliance on the internet. As it stands right now, if you have an internet outage, you have NO local capability with the Show and it simply turns into a rock.
We have also noticed that the voice recognition is not as good as it is with Siri ... and what is odd is it seems to have gotten worse with the newer version. Since our Show device is a kitchen appliance ... it gets used as a timer frequently. At least it used to be used for that. Now it doesn't seem to respond to the attention (i.e. Alexa) command from across the room the way it used to and so we have gotten to where we use Siri more for that ... but that means the iPhone needs to be sitting on the counter instead of a pocket.
The third item I guess you could say is bleeding edge for Matter. I have noticed the most recent version of Apple Home has a feature where you can select what the primary Matter Hub so I believe Apple has implemented the Matter Admin features. I don't see anything like that with the Show. In addition, I believe this feature, once properly implemented, will mean that once you set a Matter device, it will be available on all Matter platforms in your home. I believe the other issue is that Amazon is going to have to step away from the total dependence on the cloud because the ability to control a Thread based device with a Matter hub is supposed to all be local.
Anyway, these issues really do need resolution in my mind so that's why I'm giving it the rating I have for now. Some of this may be able to be resolved with firmware ... but the local capability might require some additional changes to the hardware as well so for now I'm not going to hold my breath.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Matt,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2023","We had a first generation Echo Show in our kitchen which died recently so I ordered this as a replacement, not realizing how small it is. It's about the size of a standard alarm clock, which is too small for our kitchen. Rather than returning it, though, I decided to keep it for the bedside table, which appears to be what it was made for. I then ordered an Echo Show 8 for the kitchen, which is a much better size for there.
Anyway, having this on the nightstand is nice, because not only does it function as a clock, but I can ask it about the weather, the news, etc. in the morning. The bluetooth speaker has very good sound for its size. Overall, it's a great purchase. Except...
It's got a couple of really annoying flaws that severely limit its usefulness. Ugh. Amazon, I really hope you're listening here. At least the first of these should be fixable with a simple software update. The second, I'm not as sure if it's a software problem or a hardware issue, but I hope that it will at least be updated by the next model. While I'm probably not going to return this one, I can't see myself buying another one of these (or recommending it to other people) until these issues get fixed.
So, first problem... Using it as a bluetooth speaker. I like to play music from Apple Music on my iPad, and I was hoping to use this for that. Yes you *can* link your Apple Music account directly into the Echo Show, but that's got a couple of flaws – first, you can't browse, you have to tell Alexa what to play, and second, if you've got your own music that you've uploaded to Apple Music because it's not in the main Apple Music library (or another app entirely), there is as far as I can tell no way to access it. So, using the Echo Show as a bluetooth speaker it is. Except...
Once you pair your iPad with Alexa, it will very loudly announce that it's connected. ""Now connected to Matt's iPad"" it says very loudly. If I had it connected previously and I start using my iPad after leaving it sit for a while (say, I was listening the night before and I pick up my iPad in the morning to glance at the news), even if I'm not playing audio, it will make the same announcement again (which, totally unexpected like that, gives me a good jump scare). Disconnect the iPad and it makes a loud notification sound (for a while it was saying ""Disconnected from Matt's iPad"" but I seem to have managed to at least turn that off... I'm not even sure how). It does the same if I connect and disconnect my phone.
I don't want this. It's super annoying. I've tried every way that I can find to turn these bluetooth announcements off, and I can't do it. I've searched the internet and found lots of other people complaining of the same issue, but Amazon hasn't fixed it. Some of those have suggested turning off notifications as the solution, but I've tried that (even going as far as power cycling my Echo Show to make it reboot), and I *still* get the bluetooth announcements. They just won't go away.
So, first thing this needs before I'll give it a good rating... Amazon, please do away with these bluetooth announcements, or at least make it possible for me to disable them. Honestly, I'd prefer not to have to completely disable notifications to do it (there's no fine grain control over notifications, it's either all on or all off, which is a problem itself), but if that's how it has to be whatever. Just get rid of these unnecessary and annoying bluetooth announcements.
Then, there's what is actually a much bigger problem, but may require a hardware update to fix... The auto-dimming.
So, in theory, I like and want the auto-dimming feature. I don't want this to be at full brightness all night while the room is dark. In the dark it goes very dim, but that makes it readable in the dark without being annoying or a distraction from sleep. That's good.
Based on how this performs, though, I have to assume that the light sensor that controls the auto-dimming is on the front and very directionally focused. It doesn't pick up on ambient light at all.
So if I turn on the bedside lamp, which happens to be located behind the Echo Show 5 on my table? It doesn't pick up on it, it still thinks the room is dark, and it keeps the display so dim that it's totally unreadable in the lamp light. I use my bedside lamp a lot when I'm in the bedroom, so that is a HUGE problem. Even if I have both the overhead light and the bedside lamp on and the screen is bright, the moment I turn the overhead light off (but leave the bedside lamp on), it goes so dark as to be unreadable.
But even when I'm using the overhead light... If I even happen to stand or sit so that I'm positioned between the overhead light and the Echo Show unit, it dims the display. Not nearly as dim as it goes in the dark room or with the bedside lamp, but still dim enough to make it significantly harder to read.
So basically, I can only read the screen easily with the room brightly lit or totally dark, with light directly pointed at the unit or no light at all. Anywhere in between and it becomes unreadable. Of course I could ""fix"" this problem by turning auto-dimming off entirely, but then it would be brightly lit all through the night. Which I don't want either. Right now the only setting for this is either on or off, no in-between, no adjusting the sensitivity, nothing.
So Amazon, I don't know if this means that you need more light sensors on the unit than you currently have (maybe one facing the back of the unit as well), or if it's just a software tweak to make it more (or less? I don't even know) sensitive, but SOMETHING needs to be done about this. A screen that I can't read isn't useful to me.
Oh, and finally, this is more minor but what is up with the white power cord on my black/""charcoal"" device? I didn't buy a white Echo Show because I didn't want a white Echo Show. The power cord should match the device. Way to cheap-out, Amazon.
Fix these problems and I'll feel much better about the Echo Show 5 and happily recommend it to others as a bedside device. With these issues, though, I'm sorry, but I can't recommend it.",2.0 out of 5 stars
T L Morison,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2024","In virtually all respects the Echo 5 (3gen) is a neat little device. Music sounds very good and the slideshow on the home screen fun to watch. It easily links with other devices and controls them seamlessly. The negative is that the camera doesn't work at all. I ordered the first Echo 5 on July 21. After setting it up, I quickly determined that the camera wasn't working. I spent 45 minutes chatting with a tech who finally gave up and arranged for an exchange. The exchange unit arrived a couple of days later. I set it up and again the camera didn't work. When I try to view the camera image on the Alexa app an alert appears on the Echo that someone is trying to view the camera via the app. On the app I get a notification that live view not available now, try again later. When I ask the Echo to show the camera on its screen, it says ""I don't know what's wrong."" I like the other features enough that I've decided to keep the device, as the camera not critical to me. However, it is annoying and if the camera is important to you, keep this in mind.",4.0 out of 5 stars
W. Moore,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024","I have had the echo 5 since the latest version was introduced in 2023. I bought it to replace an earlier version that was becoming more difficult to get to work properly.
This one has become very unhelpful. It usually takes 5 attempts to get it to respond, and then it often does something totally different from the request.
The automatic screen brightness adjust does not work correctly. It makes it too dim to see during the day and bright enough to light the room at night.
It used to play music that was requested. For example, I could say, ""Alexa, ply music by Bob Dylan"". And it would play music by Bob Dylan for an hour or more. It does not do that any more. Now it says, ""Playing music by Bob Dylan or similar artists."" And it starts playing random stuff not related to the request. By the way, my subscriptions have not changed.
Because of these problems, I now just want to use it as a smart clock - displaying time, and occasionally as an alarm clock or timer. Good luck with that!
It has started displaying ads. Of course these are ads for stuff I don't want nor do I want to see. I cannot get them to stop. I have done all of the turning off notifications and ads, but they don't stop. It is not helpful when I look to see what time it is and all I see is an ad for some watch - and when I ask it what time it is I am ignored.
Although it seems like a good idea, I do not recommend buying any of these devices. Maybe some day we can buy something that does what we thought we were buying.
I do not want to pay to watch commercials and ads.
UPDATE: Amazon called me about my review. Nice.
She listened, and explained there is a recent problem causing the AD and voice recognition problems. The current work-around is changing the language to English-Canadian. It worked.
I still don't know why the songs are random. I am a prime member, and the description of the Amazon Music plan says it should work the way it used to.
I have changed the rating from 2 to 3 stars because Amazon tech called me and the sponsored ads are gone for now.
It used to be a useful tool for me, but its still an expensive annoyance without the music working. And adding another $100+ charge is not going to happen here.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Mike J,"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2023","First off, I currently use only limited Echo functions. By far the primary is voice control lights/plus. Next is finding out the weather and occasionally asking simple questions and conversion of measurements, and finally to play music (I have Sonos system so there is little need for music from Echo).
The good-The device has a quality feel and looks good. The fabric covering looks good (not sure not it stands up long term but I have no problem with it on my 5th Generation echo dot). But as others have said who thought it was a good idea to put a white cord on a charcoal device?? The screen has good resolution and brightness. The volume is more than adequate. The device is good at picking up voice commands (but more on that later).
In addition to the way I currently use the Echo, my needs for this were pretty basic (I thought). First off a way to control lights/outlets by touch pad rather than voice, visual display of the weather, and reading recipes and occasional video in the kitchen or else as a bedroom clock.
My first problems customizing the device. There are way too many options that need to be turned off. From past experience with Amazon devices I was pretty sure that I may need to go through the option setup after an O/S update. During this process the device was very slow, it was non responsive twice for more than 2 minutes, and once locked up and I needed to unplug it (and lost some of the changes I was making). The slow response and non responsiveness continued in all use of the device but fortunately not as bad as it was during setup, but it did lock up twice while I was using it. I rather quickly saw that a 5.5 inch screen would make much of my wish list hard to meet on a really useful basis but I thought based on the sale price I could compromise.
As a way to control lights/plug there is no way to make that the default screen. While it should have only been a quick swipe to get to the control screen the problem with slow response and locking up it quickly became a bit of an issue. In addition, I found that if I had been using it to watch a video any swipe on the clock/Home Screen returned to the video and did not take me to the screen to select any use other than video. I had to go through the process of going back to Home Screen and then swiping down to get to the option selection screen. Also a problem was the 5.5 screen just did not allow the display of much of the lights/plugs without a slow scroll. It quickly became apparent that my main use was going really fulfill what I was hoping for.
For my purpose of asking weather, answering basic questions, it worked fine. It had no problem picking up my voice. Unfortunately the small screen size meant visual display of the weather was of no use unless you were close to the device. However it had the same problem I have with some my other Echo devices in that the wrong Echo device sometimes responds. This is more of an Amazon issue than device issue. I get around this by using a different wake word for each device. So it fulfilled this need, but so does every Echo device.
I played some music. It doesn't display much in the way of options (just most recently played) of music to play. It is really designed to use your voice to control. No display of playlist or anything. I tried to add an additional Echo to play music. It started the song at the beginning rather than at the same place as the song currently playing on the Echo Show. It also said that two of my other Echo devices (I have 4 others) were not compatible. I could still select them and they seemed to play fine so not sure what the compatibility issue was. I didn't pursue this from the other device or really try it much. While the sound isn't bad but it wasn't as good as my Echo dot 5th generation. It was tuned for too much bass, I could not change the equalizer to make the sound more than adequate. I was expecting an improvement over the Echo Dot. So while it seemed to meets my needs, I called it a fail because of the potential issues with playing of music on multiple devices and no improvement in sound quality.
At this point I realized that a 5.5 in screen just limited the device too much for most visual purposes. Recipes and videos were too small to watch unless it was really close to you. Using a larger tablet or even laptop became a better option.
Finally the clock. Using the adaptive lighting it was too dark to read in a dark room. There was the constant interruption of suggested skills that were brighter than anything else and quickly became very annoying. The one night I used it, when I looked at in the morning the screen was blank until I touched it to reactivate the device.
So, even on a good sale price it just didn't do what I wanted/expected and it was returned. For light/plug control I will use an old tablet and find a stand for it, for music and weather/questions I may get another Echo Dot (maybe the one with a clock built in). I can use a tablet to show a list of the music that I have available and not have to use my voice. For recipes and video in the kitchen I will continue to use a tablet or laptop. My hope for one device that fulfill multiple wants just didn't work and the Echo Show was returned.",2.0 out of 5 stars

The audio quality is amazing and can get super loud, I've had several people surprised of how loud it gets due to its small size! But the reason this isn't getting 5 stars is because streaming on this device can be slow and laggy even with good internet.

Cuong Nhu,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2024","I thought this would be as customizable as you can get. The time option presents with an overlay of itself. If you see a story just before it changes the screen, it doesn’t understand that you’d like to go back. You have to wait 5 minutes for it to cycle through all the predetermined information you didn’t ask for. Even then, that particular story that caught your interest may be on a cycle of stories all its own.
Setup is relatively easy as you have limited options considering it has a screen.
Otherwise it is of excellent quality. The camera cover seems cheap, but that’s a minor issue to me. Sound quality is good as are the images. It takes up minimal space. The screen is super sensitive.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Mel,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2023","This is the first Echo Show I've set up, but I'm pretty tech savvy. Here's the pros and cons so far.
Pros
- Looks like a bedside clock (if you set it up that way) and is not very noticeable. I like this.
- Sound seems good so far. This is why I bought this model when it was on sale. I heard the sound quality on older models wasn't as good. This one is pretty loud. I'm happy with that.
- Has a slider to cover the camera if you want privacy
- Has a button on top to turn off the microphone and Alexa 'Listening"" if you want (you'll see a red bar at the bottom of the screen if you do this.)
- I like the Drop In feature.
- I like that it also has a home monitoring feature (but it doesn't work right)
- This can also supposedly sense motion and trigger alexa skills for that too, but I haven't tried that yet. I dont' believe they are true motion sensors. I believe they detect motion using the camera. If the camera is covered, there'd be no motion sensing.
Cons
- It's small. But I knew that. The screen is about the same size as a smartphone turned on its side.
- If you're making a video call to this, and you are using a cell phone in portrait view, your image is going to be so tiny on this echo show's screen! It'll be vertical and in the center. It won't enlarge to fill the screen. Best way to call this device will be from a tablet or or something else in horizontal view. (With a camera that is centered and not off to the side, when it's horizontal.)
- ""Home Monitoring"" worked the first day, and I could not get it to work after that. I don't know why. It's frustrating and annoying. I did everything I could think of, short of calling customer support (which I'll try another day) I read that this is a common problem.
- There's a lag sometimes, especially with the app I'm using on my phone, to connect to this. That makes it hard to know sometimes if you need to press a button again. Also, any time you change a setting, you might get stuck/frozen for a while, while it updates with amazon's cloud. Sometimes I had to unplug it and plug it back in, to get it out of that loop.
- No battery. If this gets unplugged or power goes out, this won't work. You also can't move it around the room (because it's plugged in!) - Again, I knew this beforehand. FYI, I wanted to use a fire tablet in ""show mode"" to get around this problem, but the tablets are not loud enough. I needed a loud device for video calls. This echo show IS loud.
- I wanted to make a widget with an alexa skill to make a tappable shortcut for a phonecall. I could not find a way to do this. It might be possible, but I could not find instructions for this online, and customer support could not help me with this either.
- I did eneable ""Tap to Alexa"" for a while (then later disabled it). That might work ok for someone who has speech difficulty, and needs visual buttons. But if you're trying to add buttons to simplify this for a more debilitated person or someone who doesn't know a lot about tech, that won't help much. The text under the tiles is small, the icons for the tiles can only be customized with an image from the built in set - and they all look similar. There's no way to customize a tile enough to make it stand out, so someone knows ""THIS is the button you press to call me!"" You also cannot fully customize the tiles screen. Some tiles cannot be deleted or re-arranged. (others can.)
- This doesn't have night vision. I knew this already. If a room is dim or dark it's hard to see the other person and that room.
Mostly it's a little buggy. I'm hoping things will work better as I get more used to working with it.
The lag sometimes is frustrating.
Things not working that worked the day before, is frustrating.
Having SO MANY SETTINGS to customize is frustrating. Most related to extras I don't want to be shown. Ads, suggestions, ""Try this!"" etc. I want this to be a clock that can make video calls. That's all I want to do with this. It is difficult to find ALL the settings you need to find, to simplify it to that. It's great that it can do so many other things, but I want this to be more simplified, and that's not easy to do.
I may report back later (I may not ;) ) once I've used it more. I really like all the things about it that work. I'm a little frustrated by some of the bugginess.",3.0 out of 5 stars

capnhairdo,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024","Though I've been an Amazon customer for almost 30 years, I've resisted buying any Amazon devices (except a Kindle for my wife) until now. And after a single day of fighting with this stupid Amazon Echo Show and then returning it, I feel vindicated and won't be dabbling in the Amazon/Alexa ecosystem again.
I bought the Echo Show to pair with a Blink doorbell. I simply wanted to get an audible alert and video feed when someone pushed the doorbell in our upstairs bedroom, and the combination was recommended as a simple and economical way to do that. As a bonus, I figured the Echo Show could serve as a digital alarm clock and allow my wife to listen to her podcasts while she was upstairs.
But setting up the Blink with the Echo Show was anything but simple, even though they're both Amazon devices. First, I had to install the Blink app on my phone and create a new Blink account (why?), then *also* install the Alexa app on my phone. I don't want to install Alexa and don't need another voice assistant; I'm happy with my Google Assistant. Then I had to figure out how to teach Alexa a new ""skill"" to listen for the doorbell press, which took a lot of Googling to figure out. The result? Alexa simply says aloud that there's someone at the door, but does not automatically show the video. But Blink also alerts my phone, and it's actually simpler to tap on it to show the video than get Alexa to do it.
Then there was the matter of getting this to simply show a clock the rest of the time. Though this device seems designed to look just like a nightstand alarm clock (who would actually watch movies on this 5"" screen?), getting it to only show a clock proved almost impossible. Apparently you have to go into the ""Home Content"" and disable each and every one of the several dozen things it wants to show you by default, from recipes to sports scores to news stories to Amazon delivery updates to ads. (And then do it again when Amazon automatically adds new items to the list.) I did all of that and followed the instructions I found to only show a clock. The end result was it that it showed a clock superimposed over a clock, then would flash after several seconds, show an entirely different clock, flash again, show nothing, etc. Seriously? How do you screw up something so simple as a clock? And apparently I'm not the only one who has run into this buggy behavior.
I appreciate that many people like Alexa devices and all that they can do. But I'm steering clear. If I want to watch a movie, I'll do it on my TV or tablet. If I want to listen to music, I'll fire up the Sonos. For everything else, I vastly prefer my phone or desktop computer to this small, buggy, ad-ridden device that is too smart to simply show me the time.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Sam Spangenberg,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2023","I hate it when I have to adjust my vocabulary with each new electronic device. Apps that become Skills with device or program specific vague and inconsistent naming conventions is my latest bother. As is the dreadful services of Frontier's ISP, but that is another story.
The Echo Show is a convenient, tabletop Wi-Fi audio -video device that can preform some, but not all, of the functions of a larger 8"" or 10"" Echo device or a computer that you have dedicated to Alexa. Both the audio and video are very good to exceptional. The voice recognition is also pretty good, but Alexa seems generally committed to its own interpretation of what you think you want to hear or see. (I would be accused of genderism if I called Alexa ""her"".)
As a recovering news addict (retired lecturer) I find both the availability of programming (sorry, Skills) and the booting (sorry, opening) of whatever Alexa thinks I should have annoying. Hence the ""Cute"" label headline.
As I've only used the wee beastie for about a month I'm certain I'll learn to add a few Skills to Alexa's repertoire once I discover how to access my Skill options on a machine that doesn't offer (so far ?) access to Alexa's actual functions.
Fortunately Alexa does a fair job of finding the music I ask for, the audio is very good and Alexa a a dutiful shill for its masters, offers to sell me a broader selection of music for the low price of $16 a month for ever and ever or until prices can be raised. Pardon the cynicism if you will.
The afore mentioned issue of my Wi-Fi service certainly plays a significant role in the Echo's functioning. I would suggest a location within the room of your router or very near a mesh extender as use of a phone or two in the room with the Echo at a walled 30' distance from your router can quickly reduce communication speeds and and cause the frozen screen hiccups. Cleverly as you exit the Echo Skill Aleza will apologize for not being able to connect to the Skill you have just been listening to or watching.
I would suggest you spend more time learning about Alexa's options, buy one of the larger models which apparently have even more options or use that old Toshiba Thrive you kept in your desk drawer since the whenever....

Melissa S,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024","I had an accident and due to mobility issues got a couple of Echo’s hoping to make things a bit easier. Wow have I been disappointed. Basically, it is an expensive voice option for turning my lights on and off, but it doesn’t even do that consistently, adjusting the thermostat temperature, and setting timers/alarms. I have to check the volume as it randomly turns down to 50% and I can’t hear it. This thing is all about marketing products not truly being helpful or making people’s lives easier. Shame on you Amazon for making a marketing AI and trying to pass it off as something to make people’s lives easier. You can’t even turn off these marketing ads even when you shut them down in the app they continue. A few of my issues are noted below and yes I have tried to word things numerous different ways and always use the exact name of the light or camera.
• Alexa turn on light. 70% of the time this works. Often I hear it is not responding or can’t be found but when I check the app it’s connected.
• Alexa show my floodlight camera or doorbell. This works about 40% of the time but I often hear, I can’t do that right now.
• Alexa arm my camera. I can’t do that right now or she doesn’t understand.
• Alexa activate motion on camera. I can’t do that right now or she doesn’t understand.
• Alexa go to Hoopla Digital or Hoopla Audiobooks or Hoopla. I tried to download this skill several ways for audiobooks as it claims compatibility. But Alexa can’t seem to find it and instead wants to tell me a joke.
• Alexa go to my Amazon orders. She then reads me a list of what I have ordered. That is not what I asked. I then tried Alexa show me my orders, same result. I tried Alexa go to Amazon. Her reply, I can’t do that try later. I tried later and she still could not take me to Amazon but she can show me my “top deals” over and over even after asking her to stop showing them.
• Alexa I want to write a product review. She can’t do that right now.
• I ask when is the next chance of rain in the forecast. I get today’s forecast or the reply, I can’t do that or I don’t understand.
• Alexa turn off the AC or turn thermostat mode to off etc. I can’t do that or she doesn’t understand.
I could go on but won’t. I searched out how to use it thinking maybe I was doing something wrong. I see a lot of the same issues from others. I can’t recommend this product unless you want it to turn lights on and off, sometimes, to turn the temperature up and down, to flash marketing messages over and over, or for a timer/alarm (as long as it hasn’t randomly turn downed the volume so you can’t hear it).",1.0 out of 5 stars
Arthur,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2024","This review of the Echo Show, from a very discouraged Amazon prime member, should be viewed as a review of the level of (and access to) Amazon technical support for this device not of the Echo Show device itself.
I bought this Echo Show in order to see the video of my Lorex Doorbell camera . But I was unable to see the Lorex doorbell camera with the Echo Show after several frustrating days. The camera feed from the Lorex doorbell (which I also bought from Amazon -it was expensive and has a terrific image quality that I could see on the Lorex app) said it would work with Alexa - this is according to to the documentation that came with it and was one reason I bought that device. Also Lorex technical support people said the same thing to me when I spoke to them. However, when I ask the Echo Show to show me My Lorex doorbell, the response is: ""SORRY, CAMERAS DON'T WORK ON THIS DEVICE""
I spent several days trying to find the problem. . To access Echo/Alexa help, I used the chat function on the Alexa app.. I chatted for about 15 minutes with a representative from India, who then left the chat and I was transferred to another, and then to another, etc. Each time a new person came on the chat, they had to pause to read what previous persons had written. Each person had a different suggestion (factory restart the Echo Show. restart Alexa...),, but clearly none of them was technically astute and none of them could not elevate my issue to someone technical who knew what I should do. I followed their suggestions to update the Lorex App, reset the Echo Show to Factory Default, Un-link and re-link the Lorex App with the Alexa App, restarted the Lorex Doorbell camera, rename the Lorex Camera on both devices. But chatting with Amazon folks and following their suggestions did not resolve the issue. I was unable to access technical support staff at Amazon who could explain the problem and to resolve the issue.
I also posted the issue on the Amazon Echo /Alexa community board; the answers from Amazon personnel were not helpful- basically repeating what I heard from the chat personnel, and when I posted that, their response was to call Amazon, but when I tried this over several days, the webpage kept saying that the phone service was not available. I called Lorex Support and spoke with a technical support person and they said contact Amazon support - I am frustrated and discouraged and tired of going in a circle on this and I am going to send the Echo Show back.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Michael Potts,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2023","WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! This device came home to a richly endowed internet environment, a 240+ Mbps Starlink connected home, and refused to connect. As an internet professional, I'm quite sure the device *did* connect, as it 'knew' who I was, and was able to reregister itself when I pretended not to be me. Could it do that without being connected? Doubt it. This would be ZERO STARS if that was a possibility.
The cute little device -- I *really* want this thing to work! -- ran through the startup right up until it told me it needed to update and that could take 10 minutes, unplug and you die. The device is brand new, so why would it need to update? That in itself is just stupid merchandising (but par for the industry course.) The device pretended to download, but persisted in claiming that it was 0% uploaded. Eventually it complained about a 'slow connection' (Horsefeathers!) and suggested I try another network -- but didn't find anything usable in my rural neighborhood even when I accept the offer to 'choose another network' . . . whereupon it then falls into another endless loop -- 'Updating' for 20 minutes -- that only ends when I pull its plug.
From what little I see of this device's GUI, it's following the familiar (but too often dysfunctional) 'Apple Fanboy Strategy' of offering minimal access to real device operating parameters -- Dear Lord, do NOT ask a millennial to deal with anything as complicated as a parameter! -- making assumptions about its completeness (""for the rest of us"") and my stupidity; Goddess Nose I couldn't configure the device myself.
I called the Amazon device help line, and Nohran was unable to help. He suggested I 'factory reset' by holding down the mute and minus buttons on top of the device for 20 seconds; the volume bar showed me it was indeed reducing and muting, but there was no evidence of the device resetting even after 60 seconds. After several false tries, unpluggings, and re-tries of the exact same failed procedures (indistinguishable from insanity!) the best poor befuddled Nohran could do was offer to refund my money.
I wrote something judgmental about millennials above and note that for those of us who prefer to view cyberspace through something larger than a cell phone keyhole, in Alexa world, unless we have a mobile device too, we're SOL. (Millennials, look it up.) Of course you need an ""app"" to address your Alexa, and real computers still can't do apps. I knew I was in trouble when Amazon emailed me a QR code to use when installing my new device, 'cause for millennials QR codes are sexier'n a Playboy centerfold, don'tchaknow. Why not just a clickable URL? Here's one more nail in Alexa's coffin: the tablet I loaded up the app on when I first got my Echo Dot is no longer supported by the latest version of the Alexa app. Rather that supporting backward compatibility, the bubbahs in the Alexa engineering department simply removed the app from my device. A new version downloaded to a newer mobile device on October 17th needed to be updated on October 27th.
As you might infer, we're not Apple Fanboys, but it's increasingly looking to us like Alexa, so completely devoted to being yet another way to use Amazon to bankrupt local businesses (Jeff not having made enough money yet) is feature-bloating and engineer brain-farting its way out of usefulness in the smart home ecosystem.
We are (were?) devoted, bleeding edge early adopters of Alexa to operate our smart household, and thankfully our early version Echo Dot still works. Is this failure due to a feud betwee Bezos and Musk -- we're on Starlink, remember? Or simply sloppy engineering? Or a single DOA device? I'm deeply disappointed that I can't have the benefits that supposedly come with this 5th Gen device, but UNLESS AMAZON SEND ME A WORKING DEVICE (hint), I'll continue to be disappointed. Saying goodbye to Alexa will be like losing a family pet.",1.0 out of 5 stars
SabrinaVanover,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2024",I hate doing this but I’m so disappointed in this product it’s of course Echo Sho 5. I’m on my 2 nd my first Echo 5 would freeze up when setting it up on the first day. I got some one from the customer care service which were nice and I will say they tried there best but in conclusion of that she sent another one to replace it. So I finally got the Replace day b4 yesterday I think and been trying to use it and it done great which I appreciate that they already had pretty much got it set up and my info already in to it so the only thing I need to do was verify everything was correct so no I did and I let it up date as well. After that I started to learn how to use and even connected my surveillance cameras to it bc that is the reason why I went ahead and ordered it in the first place. But I wanted to play games and do all the things I can do problem is I get kicked off of in the middle of game play and again like the other one it freezes up and gets stuck and goes back to the home page. I’m so frustrated poor Alexa she is probably the one that gets all of the heat and cursed at. Sorry Alexa for my frustration and foul language. I just wish they could do better technology these days from what I hear and understand that this product should be top notch it shouldn’t b having issues like this and I think that as a prime customer well prime or not you should be able to enjoy the product that u get to splurge on for yourself instead of getting frustrated and not the best quality of a product.

Zaffod,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2024","This device is just the worst. The clock that most often appears on the screen is one I have never created or seen in any options. The one I pick shows up maybe 1% of the time. All of the contact that Alexa can push to the device screen for quick tips, etc, just come off as more ads for Amazon's internal solutions.
There is a beautiful option to just set the clock on all the time with your Amazon images cycling behind it. The only trouble here is there's no crossfade on the images so they snap one to the next. If this device is sitting in the corner of your eye it gets so annoying as it's constant hard screen changes steal your attention.
Youtube is ok, but only via the Silk browser. Not this device's fault but still that sucks. Glad it came with a physical privacy shutter on the camera, but the white cover makes the device look ugly or there's something odd stuck to it.
The speaker is amazing, but I am guessing it's the same in the Orb Alexa's.
Even if I had Ring, I could not see myself using this thing. We finally just stuck it in the corner in the kitchen and use it for a bluetooth speaker or common Alexa commands for the smart home stuff.
No apps, or access to an app store. You are stuck with what is there and what they allow you to do with it. The only customization you can do is put your imagines in Amazon photos and show them and pick different clock faces (if it will ever show that clock is a whole other thing).
I got this on a deep discount over the holidays, I actually bought two, one to give to my elderly mother. The first one came and I checked it out and the second one's shipping was delayed (Yay for paying for Prime), and after 2 days of using it, I cancelled the other order right away.
IF you want one of these, wait for holiday discounts or hope someone just hurls one into your yard from frustration as they drive past in their car. It's honestly laughable how much the standard price is for this.
I would return it but sometimes it shows the clock I like? Whoopie. Or it's nice to see the default blue background with nothing on it come up in its cycle through things or just the blank gray screen sometimes. Those are lovely to see when you walk past and think, ""isn't Amazon like a super rich company?"".
Save your money and by the Orb style Alexa speaker. Sound is comparable and the rest of the garbage that is this device is not included.
Update: 5 months of ownership and it's worse. Shows me baseball scores and news when nothing like that is selected and I hate baseball. It does randomly show the weather in a super small font.
Oh, and someone from Amazon customer service contacted me after initially leaving this review which is super creepy. My review is pretty clear, talking to someone randomly calling me isn't going to change how utterly bad this device is.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Jack Ruby Built The Pyramids,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2024","I have 3 Echo Shows (2 8"" and 1 5""). All 3 models have great displays and surprisingly good sound. However, the Echo 5 (3rd gen/2023) is very slow compared to the 8's.
The Echo 5 is quickly bogged down from just switching between menus or screens which leads to missed buttons or accessing screens you did not want to access due to the lagging. (MINUS 1 STAR)
Additionally, I ordered a black model in order to blend the device into the dark furniture in the particular room. However, Amazon sends a WHITE power suppler for all models regardless of color (what the h3ll is wrong with Amazon?) So, now your dark Echo Show blends in great until you want to actually use it and have to plug in the ridiculous white power cable that stands out like a sore thumb and defeats the purpose of getting a black unit. (MINUS 1 STAR)
Now, on to the ""feature"" that all Echo Shows share and is probably the biggest pet peave across all Echo Show owners.
When you connect a Bluetooth device (phone for example) to the Echo Show in order to play content from your phone you get the usual verbal ""Now connected to (your device name)"" message. Ok so far...
However, when you go to play your content you will (now) get another very annoying and unnecessary message of ""NOW PLAYING FROM (your device name)"". Ok, not a huge deal - I can live with this one time message... But wait! There's More!
This is NOT a one time message. Each and every time you begin to play something from your connected device REGARDLESS of already being connected and having ALREADY played content to the Echo Show you will get this very loud, pointless and annoying message EACH AND EVERY TIME YOU PLAY CONTENT. Even if you have literally just played content, stopped the content, switch to another song (example) and play that (SECONDS LATER) you will STILL get the very loud, very annoying and VERY pointless notification from Echo SHOW (SHOW ONLY) of ""NOW PLAYING FROM YOUR DEVICE!!!!""
(MINUS 2 MORE STARS.)
***NOW PLAYING FROM (your connected device)***
Not just once, not twice, but in perpetuity this message will play each and every time you stop and restart content. There is no way to disable this, there is now way to alter this there is no way to do anything to mitigate this pointless, useless and otherwise annoying ""feature"".
Like to use your Echo Show at night to relax with some content from your connected device? Sure, who doesnt! Well, this Echo Show will play it like any other Echo device except you will get JOLTED from your relaxation (and most likely the rest of your house will to) when you press play on your device and about 5 seconds in you get the VERY LOUD ""NOW PLAYING FROM YOUR DEVICE"" Each.

KYB,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2024","I recently upgraded to the lates Echo 5 because my original gen 1 device was constantly showing as “device unreachable.” I went through all of the processes I found via internet searches, culminating in a full reset and re-add to my account. That worked, but 24 hours later? Unreachable. Some have theorized ‘planned obsolescence.’ Could be, so with trade in and coupon I got a good deal on the latest model. Thus I purchased it. It remains online. Yay. But the original problem was, a routine I had designed (simple - turn out the lights and play brown noise at night), and which worked for at least a couple of years, was no longer working. Brown noise would just stop randomly at different times every night. I couldn’t access the gen 1 through the app, so I upgraded to gen 3. It has the same problem. What I have learned from this experience is the same thing I learned when I converted form Google Home (which lost the ability to even set an alarm by voice command at one point - leading to its replacement with Alexa), and that lesson is that these smart home devices are unreliable to perform consistent tasks because of constant, undocumented changes in their ecosphere. And if they are unreliable, they are essentially useless. Unless you want it to put something on the screen that is too small to see across the room without walking over, and when you walk over, it clears. Or unless you just want it to tell you a joke or play some audio IT wants to play. So for now, it’s nothing more than a fancy alarm clock that does NOT play brown noise. I’ll now find a closed network (I.e., internal only) replacement for these functions, and trade this in also. I think I’m done with these devices regardless of brand - they change too frequently, and do not document their changes, explain them, or offer viable alternatives (unless, of course, you want to pay every month for premium services and such).",1.0 out of 5 stars
David Good,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2024","I've been a fan of Amazon Echo devices with screens ever since they came out. I use them mostly as a replacement for an alarm clock (with the ability to listen to music). The Echo Spot was my favorite, until it started screen glitching (which is caused when they update the OS but ignore older models -- the updates don't play well with the older hardware or screen sizes). Regardless... it was working exactly as expected until the day came with advertisements started to appear on my Echo Show. I'm someone who has EVERYTHING turned OFF on my Home Screen except for the time, weather, and package notifications. So, when ads started to appear on my device I was a bit pissed. I paid money for a device that now essentially pollutes my space with advertisements. It doesn't matter if the ads are relevant or generic -- I'm not interested. The Echo Show is going to be disconnected and tossed in the trash -- but only after I spend a good amount of time with support demanding a refund on my purchase. While drop-in and music and everything else worked great on it, I'm not going to give it but ONE star because if I have to disconnect it and toss it in the trash just to get rid of the ads, it means the entire unit isn't working for me. What a sad state. I'm sure Amazon is doing it because the Echo devices have been a money loss for them since day 1... so I'm sure they're just trying to get back some of their losses. Shoot -- just charge more for the devices and make fewer models. I'd buy it for more control over my home screen and ZERO ads. Shoot -- on the Kindle devices (readers or Kindle Fires) you can pay a little more for an ad-free experience. Offer that with the Show and I'll be happier.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Ryan W Sheehan,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2024","TL:DR: This product is a popup ad you put in your house. Do not buy one.
In my home I have multiple Dots and Alexas. They are great for playing music, getting weather, and being alerted for updates on my packages. So when the Show went on sale a year ago, I picked it up. I wanted to use it to play videos, as a digital clock, or a photo frame. After setting it up I learned it is actually a device used to stream ads directly into my home, at all time. It refused to sit on the clock screen, instead opting to bombard me with a constant stream of advertisements.
You might be thinking ""Can't you just turn that stuff off?"", which is a totally reasonable to expect but no, no you cannot. You can go in and turn off ever notification on your Show when you get it, but Amazon is constantly adding new notifications ones that are defaulted to on. So you end up fighting with it constantly to turn off the new ads they default on every time they feel like updating, which is often.
After almost a year of ownership, and constantly fighting to get it to function without bombarding my kitchen with ads for the latest thing I don't need, I got fed up and just tossed it into the trash, which is where it belongs.
Do not buy one. And Jeff, if you are reading this, maybe price the thing higher if you can't make it profitable without selling ad space.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Rojma,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2024","When I first got the Echo Show 5, I primarily wanted it to be a ""smart"" alarm clock that I could see the date/time across the room and which I could also use as an Alexa device for smart home features. My primary purpose is to tell the time, date, and maybe the weather. I want it displaying this information 100% of the time, unless I specifically ask it for something else.
At first, it mostly did this and did what it's supposed to do. Occasionally the clock would disappear or get really small, but it was infrequent. However, over time, unrelated content or content I wasn't interested in started to appear on the device, including ads. I found that Amazon slowly added new features/options to the Home content screen, and it would automatically enable these features. This would force me to go into the settings and turn off these options so they would no longer display. Very annoying when I have 13 different Echo Show 5 devices across my house.
Well now they are showing ads, mainly related to purchases I have done in the past on Amazon, regardless if I have all home content turned off. There is no way that I have found to turn off the ads. Even worse, the devices now primarily show the ads instead of the clock. This device has essentially become an Amazon billboard across my house instead of the clock that I paid for. This is a device I paid for, not something I got for free by agreeing to ads!
The experience has become so horrible that I am actively looking to get off the Amazon/Alexa ecosystem and use something else for my alarm clock/smart home needs. Shame on you Amazon!",1.0 out of 5 stars
TAL,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023","I was excited to ""upgrade"" to the Echo Show 5 from my Dot when it went on sale. But, sadly, I have found this was less of an upgrade and more of a regret. My Echo Dot is actually in most cases far superior to this device.
I find the Show 5 to be slow, clunky and it has too many quirks to make it easy to use or worth it. First, it is slow to respond. Normally when I asked my Dot ""Alexa, what's the weather outside"" it would immediately answer- with the Show 5 I find that no matter the question, it takes a good beat before it says anything. At times I have thought it did not hear me so I start to ask again, only to have it start to answer the question in the middle of me asking again. I don't know why there seems to be a delay all the time. Second, the volume- For some random reason if I don't use Alexa for a couple of hours or overnight when I do use it again the volume has been turned up to a super loud level (yes, I have shut off adaptive volume and the million other features that people suggest) it just seems to think within a couple of hours I have lost my hearing and goes up. I am always having to adjust the volume before asking it anything for fear I will wake my entire household. Third, no matter how may toggles I shut off to not have it give me random updates on the screen about movies, music, news etc... and I try setting it to my own photos, it still shows me stuff I don't want to see. I keep going to settings and I have the toggles turned off for these ""recommendations"" but they still keep showing up. Fourth, whenever I ask it to ""read my notifications"" it never does- it just displays it on the screen so if I am in the middle of doing something I have to stop and go look at the screen rather than it just telling me like all of our other devices. Lastly, this device is just not user friendly. Trying to set it up to do what you want and to show you what you want is far too cumbersome. Even when you think you have figured it out most of the time it works for a little bit and then starts doing its own thing.
I am seriously considering just unplugging this and hooking up my Dot again because I find that the Dot worked far better. The Echo Show 5 is not worth the trouble.",1.0 out of 5 stars
JMac,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2024","On Prime Day I purchased an Echo Show 8, Show 5 and Kids Show 5. I already knew from reviews that I was going to get advertisements even if I turned off all the home content options. I figured I’d tolerate it because the pros out weigh the cons. They don’t. What finally did it for me was finding out there are advertisements in the stories. I asked Alexa to play a kids story for my toddler and myself at bedtime… The stories had name drops for big companies like Target and YouTube, product placement for Dyson vacuums. It’s disgusting. Today I went into Prime Video and selected “kids” and found several TV-MA and Rated R shows. It does less and functions worse than my iPad Pro. The OS can be slow, it’s not consistent (set it for 24 hr/military time, goes back and forth between 24 and 12 hr, widgets stop being accessible from Home Screen, constantly have to reset them just for them to go back to red x’s, etc). It only displays my security cameras for 10 minutes at a time when I bought them to have constant visual of the cameras. Sometimes it won’t connect to the cameras even though I just had the cameras pulled up a literally one second prior. To summarize, the Show series are basically advertising tablets. I didn’t pay to have advertisements in my home. We are just going to use old tablets for the camera system. The Echo Shows don’t really do anything special that an iPad doesn’t do better. These just have too many issues. Would have tolerated them if it weren’t for the ads. Truly disgusting and unreal.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Yes, they appear to work but they are SOO slow. I story will show up on the screen and when I ask, ""Alexa, what's the story,"" 8 seconds later, after the screen has changed, it gives me the story on the current display. If it shows one of my photos and I ask ""When was this photo taken"" another 5 or more seconds, after the phot has switched to one on Amazon's popular recipes or wants me to play some game or something, it comes back and tells me there is no photo. It is COMPLETELY WORTHLESS as an in-house intercom. My wife and I have reverted to just calling each other on our cell phones. And mine is very unresponsive. It is literally 3 feet from me and I'll ask it something and the Echo in my bedroom, across the hall, 20 feet away will respond.
From my and my wife's experience, buy a 2nd generation Echo Show or wait and hope they do better with the 4th generation when it comes out.
Follow-up: Have replaced the old units. Not satisfied at all. When I do in on my wife (same house, different levels) these units, which are the next generation and supposedly faster processors, actually take longer (up to 10 seconds) to make a full connection on video. There are still issues from time to time with chippy video or audio. Not at all impressed with the next generation Echos. Would be nice if they had RJ-45 Jack's so they could be wired directly into a network.
Wi-fi signal and bandwidth are not the problem. We have 2Gb Google with 6e wi-fi and router and/or access points within feet of both units.
I purchased a couple of these over Prime Days to replace two of the many Echoes we already own. My wife and I both WFH in very different locations in the house and use them to drop in and communicate with each other during the day. Our older ones would often freeze or have choppy sound and I am hoping the 3rd generation units would perform better.
This review is based on just unpackaging the units and not even powering them up yet. My first complaint is that I ordered black units and would have expected a black power cord, which is what came with my original units. Secondly, and even more frustrating, is that I've got several stands for my current Echo Show 5s that are not compatible with the 3rd generation units. Come on Amazon, why did you have to change the base? THAT REALLY SUCKS!!! Change the electronics for improvement but why make existing hardware incompatible.",1.0 out of 5 stars
John,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2023","Let's start by saying... I have the 1st Gen Echo Show 5 and I am familiar with the ads and the ability (or inability) to turn them off. I was able to limit the ads by turning everything off in the Home Content menu. Which works 99% of the time on the 1st Gen to nearly eliminate ads and display a large clock like a standard alarm clock but with day, date and current temperature. That is until they push more ad categories and you have to go back into the Home Content menu and scroll down to find the new content. Sigh.
The reason for purchasing the 3rd Gen was that my 1st Gen's display started ""gliching"". Seems to be a common problem. I tried unplugging, reseting, using a different power cable, and finally using the fractory reset. Still ""gliching"". So I purchased the 3rd gen as a replacement. I placed the 1st Gen in another room and crossed my fingers hoping that it would fix itself over time. Funny thing is that the 1st Gen did somehow fixed itself after I received the 3rd Gen in the mail. Oh well.
After I recieved my 3rd Gen, I set it up and all went well. I turned everything off in the Home Content menu, turned off Night Mode, and turned on Do Not disturb. But after the 1st day or so, it started not showing the time and only showing the blue wave screen that others have mentioned. It now refuses to display ANY clock face that I save - even though it says ""saving..."". It either goes staight to the blank blue wave screen with no clock or it goes to the ""Try This Next"" screen with a tiny clock in the upper left corner. Just like the pictures that others have uploaded. I figured maybe it just had to cycle through the try this screens at least once. NOPE. After 7 days it still just serves up the same 3 try this screens. And now it dims down the display even though I have Adaptive Brightness, Sunrise Effect and Auto Dim turned off. This device has a mind of it's own. I give up!
I started a return and will be purchasing another 1st Gen off of Ebay I guess. What a shame.
UPDATE: The new 1st Gen that I purchased off of E-bay works just fine - even with the latest software updates. After some digging on the developer's side of Amazon, it appears that the 1st and 2nd Gen Echo Show 5's use the same software. However the 3rd Gen uses different sofware that has not been updated with any fixes yet. Buyer beware. YMMV.",1.0 out of 5 stars
GBech,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2023","Update 2023Jun1 - Support called based on my review and we talked step by step thru the issues and verified all of the details and experiences. Since this was the first review with user experience issues, they seem to be taking it seriously. Based on my previous experience, I am sure they will address these coding issues in the near term. Have already returned my device but will continue to use all of my other Alexa based echo devices.
Setup was simple and convenient. Customizing was a bit time-consuming and the touch screen is over sensitive so have to keep flipping back to the config pages as all notifications and such are enabled by default and it takes 4-5 minutes to disable them all vis little sliders, add in that you need to turn off other suggestions and such like try things notices - Many of these things are not in the alexa mobile app so you are forced to do this thru the device. The challenge was they never actually go away and show up every 20 min or so. 'Try making chocolate chip cookies' 'try new applications' etc all thru the night so I ended up unplugging the device.
My usability experience
After turning off everything (except the 'try' things that while turned off remain on) the screen goes to the clock, then every 90 seconds goes blank, then back to clock like it is cycling to apps (but all are turned of). Since this device is in the bedroom, its really annoying at night as its not impacted by the 'do not disturbed' or sleep time settings. I used my original 5"" echo as a clock/alarm without issue, not the case with the new device, unusable in that function as the clock does not stay on the screen.
Speaking of the clock, when the cycling to the disabled apps takes place (Clock, blank screen, clock) the number for the clock dont always show up, just the background for the clock. The only way to get the numbers back is to cycle the power of the device (reboot doesn't always do it).
Seems like they rushed out a beta OS, and without the 3.5"" headphone jack to connect to my older soundbar, inferior product to even the 1st gen device (which unfortunately just dying on me, hence what I thought was convenient timing for the new release). I am sure that they will work out the issues, but for now, returning this buggy device and going to another google home device.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Wacipi,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2024","I have everything echo and this is by far the worst of the echo products. No matter what you do to the sound, the equalizer, voice changes, etc. you cannot make out what it says. It's muffled. I've taken the bass completely off I've taken the mid-range down and up I've taken treble up down, bass up, you name it. Female is worse than male. And it doesn't even have a thermometer! It's the only room I cannot take the temp of.
And let's not even talk about how finicky it is. It's DEAF! Every night I have to tell it three times to turn off the lights and two of those times is just to get it to respond. And I'm not 12 in away from it. I have to yell its name. Very frustrating. Not what I was hoping for.
If I had a heart attack in the night using echo show with Amazon assistant it is probably not going to get me an ambulance. One of the reasons I purchased this. One heart attack was enough.
It's too late to return it and get my money back. Truth is the whole system can be hinky. One pop one show two dots in a very very small home. With eero internet, fiber. Do you think I can get these things to hook up when I need them to? No. They become disconnected from each other, the TV, the internet. So frustrating. And echo Pop is running a close second to this.

T. W. Moore,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2024","I bought two Echo Show units to monitor theBlink security system. I guess they do that okay. I do not want to place orders with Amazon using this device and I do not want the device monitoring me visually or audibly. There is a shutter to cover the camera so I am pretty sure it is not taking pictures of me or my family. I also put the device in mute mode permanently. The problem with both devices (I own two of them) is that, first, every now and again the speakers blurt out programming day or night even though the mute button is red. Not good in the middle of the night.
Second, it automatically subscribed me to something that I think is called ""NBA Grandstand"" that I do not want and, for the most part have no interest in NBA scores. This is the content that then was being spewed forth despite the mute button being depressed. I tried to remove the ""NBA"" product but found that Amazon provides no way to purge this media product from the Echo Show mostly, I suppose, because it is free. If it was a paid subscription, I could cancel payment. But it is free and unwanted by me but wanted on both Echo Show units in my home. So I did a factory reset.
Then I tried to put the devices back in service but to do so I either need a QR code that Amazon sent months ago or I need to manually set up the device. I found the emails with the QR code message but there was no QR code. So I tried to manually reactive the devices. But to manually activate I need to reset my Amazon password. I do not want to reset the password on several devices in the hope that all will work in the end. To the dump and another wasteful Amazon product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
J. Maxwell,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2024","I purchased the echo show 5 to be my bedside clock. I’ve always had an echo dot that I’ve loved on my bedside, so the idea of merging my dot with my alarm clock seemed like a wonderful idea when I made the purchase. Boy was I wrong.
I was able to set up the clock the way I wanted on the first day I had it, and I thought it was perfect, but that’s when the problems started.
First off, this thing is a little advertisement tool for Amazon more than anything else. I went through every setting and turned off literally every ad or home view suggestion other than the clock, and guess what, he still showed ads. I was shocked after spending so much time turning all of those features off, they still came through.
Then, when I went to sleep that night, the real issues started. I use my bedroom echo as a speaker to play sleep-tunes as a source of white noise to help me sleep. Well this little speaker with a screen completely botched this task, because even with the display set to “night mode”, every time the song changed, it would light the screen up super bright for about 1 second. It woke me up 10+ times over a 5 day span before I started just having to cover the screen up at night with a blanket so that I could still use the speaker to play music and not be woken up.
Even with these issues, I really liked the clear display on the clock, and kept it as JUST a clock for a few more weeks. Then, after about 4 weeks of use, it switched to its own clock setting(the blue face) and wouldn’t switch back to the one I set no matter what I tried. I unplugged it, reset it, and it still would only display the same face that I did not set. As you could imagine, as this defeated its last purpose, I was fed up and very happy to see I was still in the holiday return window. I sent it back, set my echo dot back up, and honestly haven’t been happier having gotten rid of that awful device.

The screen brightness is constantly fluctuating so you can’t even see it most of the time cause it’s to dark. It will not connect to ANY wi fi network. Will not respond to many of my commands. Either voice or by trying to select something on the screen. Let me add that I did read something about Ravi g 12 or 18 months to return it then when I tried, it simply said I could not.

I will come into my room and it's pitch black, and the device will be on low brightness, but absolutely will not go into night mode. The brightness issue was never fixed. They've gone exactly opposite of how it should be. So, I thought... I'll just reset it to factory defaults. That's where I get even more angry. In order to set up this pile of junk you have to log in using your username and password for Amazon. Well, my passwords are randomly generated, and typically 25 characters or more. There is absolutely no way to configure this device, after a reset, with the Alexa app. There should be a QR code, or a connection via bluetooth or sidewalk, or a special code you type in a web browser to activate, or something, but no. The only way is to physically log into your device. I had to type my password like 7 times, which resulted in a setup process that took over a half hour. This is an incredible disappointment. Meanwhile, my Gen 1 Echo show 5 is still working like a champ. Goes into night mode when it should. Always has the correct brightness. Has never needed a reset. Always shows the right info when it's supposed to. This Gen 3 does not. I intend to ask for a replacement or outright return, because this thing is absolute garbage. It is bright af in a dark room even on low brightness. 2am I woke up and noticed this issue and spent several minutes trying to get it to work right, but eventually unplugged it. WASTE OF TIME. Junk product. Engineers should be ashamed. Or... my device is physically defective.

Original review
I bought this to replace an older show 5 with a glitchy screen. This one is nice, but who’s the guy who thought it’s be a great idea to ship a white power cord with a black device? So stupid.
After a week of use, I'm seriously disappointed with this device. Compared by my gen 1 show 5, this thing requires a SIGNIFICANT amount of light in order to brighten up from its dark mode. When dark, you absolutely cannot read the screen at an angle, only straight on, because the brightness is not high enough. The gen1 handled this perfectly, but this thing is nearly off. Then when the sun comes up and the room has plenty of light, it absolutely will not exit dark mode. Even after I open a couple shades in the room, it just sits there like it's still dark. A simple software fix.
Amazon reached out, thanks to this review, and took the feedback seriously. That's impressive, and much appreciated.",1.0 out of 5 stars

I decided to get an upgrade (3rd gen) and it is VERY glitchy - So many issues with it. Not happy at all. (Updated********) Contacted Amazon customer service three times, they are of absolutely no help and have not answered my questions. Therefore, BUYERS BEWARE - here are the issues I am having daily: Customer Service told me to factory reset the device - that didn't solve anything.
If I use a voice command to increase or decrease volume (while a movie is playing) it will decrease the volume BUT will cause the ""clock screen"" to come on the device and stop the movie playing. I have to physically ""touch"" the screen panel for the clock face to go away and the movie to resume playing. Sometimes it will resume, others the movie will disappear and i have to find it all over again.
No matter how many times I tell this device I don't want to see advertisements on my home screen - they always pop up. Again and again, even after I tell it I do not want it.

Kari,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2024","Without a warning, my Echo Show changed from an alarm clock to a billboard for advertising.  
This was my primary alarm clock.  I took a great deal of time to set the display for a large clock face so I would not need my glasses to see it.  There were other useful functions that made it worth the cost.  It was great for a year...then an icon appeared on the display ('widgets').  When I look for the time what I see are ads; I have to wait several minutes until it cycles through to briefly show the time.  My clock display was replaced with bright ads that wake me up!  On two occasions, it started speaking and blasting noise for the ad. It woke me up, freaked me out and I nearly smashed it into a wall.
I have gone through all the settings for the display until only the alarm function remained. I now have it barely functioning in privacy mode so it is useful only as a clock with no other functionality.  
It is totally annoying that Amazon would replace the useful device I purchased with a marketing billboard without any warning.

MrP229,"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2024","I have 2 of Echo Show 5's. 1 for my office and one for my bedroom nightstand, and they both see to somehow change their settings on their own over time, and things that once worked no longer do. The one on my nightstand has decided to no longer go into night mode when the lights are off and just stays illuminated. I have tried multiple things that amazon has suggested like unplugging it, doing a factory reset, closing thew camera cover and reopening it, all to no avail. Another issue is that when i got them, i had them set to show my pictures as the background along with the weather and other things like the news, but after about 3 months, they both decided to only show my pictures when you are out of the line of sight of the camera, and at the first bit of motion, the pictures go away and it only shows things like news and weather. No matter how many times i go into the settings to make sure everything that I spent time selected is still actual set, they still seem to only show whatever they feel like showing. Luckily, I got these back when Amazon had them on special for like $35 each, and now I am thinking about just turning these POS into range targets because they don't seem to be very good for doing what I got them for. The few times I contacted Amazon about the issues, they just tell me to try the same BS that I have already after done after searching online on how to solve these issues.

Dave O,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2024","Let me start by saying I had the Gen 1 Show 5, and I fought with that thing from 3 months in. When Gen 3 came out, I decided to try it, hoping the bugs were worked out of it. My Gen 1 (replaced once because the initial one broke) wouldn't even work as a trustworthy alarm clock beside my bed. There were so many mornings I woke up late because the alarm never went off or would go off, but no sound would come out. I finally had to get an old-fashioned cheap alarm clock. Once the new Gen 3 arrived, I had my fingers crossed but also had my doubts. Again, after 3-4 months, it started glitching out. Nothing worked properly. I kept trying to update the software/Firmware but to no avail. It keeps stating that it's the latest, clearly stating it's the shipping software version. It's connected to WiFi, so that is not the issue. I now sleep with one eye open because I again do not trust the alarm clock to work correctly, and it doesn't. Some nights, I have to throw a towel over the screen because even with do not disturb on, the screen decides to be at full brightness at 2 in the morning, and I can't switch it to night mode. It is beyond infuriating. I have the Show 15, which is okay but also a buggy piece of garbage. The only one that works is the 8"" that I have in my living room. There are no issues with that one at all. When you try to get help from Amazon, they treat you like you stole it from them and are now asking for it to work correctly. It's ridiculous. I had to threaten to cancel my Prime subscription and yell at them to get the Gen 1 replaced when it went into a boot loop because I was outside the warranty. If I could give zero stars, I would.

Bob1262,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2023","Most of my issues are due to Alexa software and integration. You have to have very specific requests or you will be very very frustrated. Not simple ai to just talk to naturally. Getting the echo to play music is off any app or phone service like Apple Music horrible, as you require a bunch of very specific requests to get what you want. For example, if you do not specify to Alexa to play off Apple Music, she will randomly choose amazon music for you, even if you have preferences set to Apple Music in the app. If you plan on using multiple speakers from Amazon together, forget it. You have to make a group with a name with all of the speakers together and specify every time if you want it to work. Your request ends up being something like this,” Hey Alexa, play November Rain by Guns n Roses on Apple Music on the speakers group”. Sure, it’s long but then at least it works right? Wrong. Sometimes before you are able to even finish your sentence, Alexa will cut you off and process the first part of the request. And it is not like I am talking slow by any means. Now you have to say the same thing another few times and hope it listens to you before cutting you off in order to play off multiple speakers. It will bring up random books on audible and tell you to subscribe instead of the extremely popular song alternative if you do not specify the artist. Why would I be asking to listen to a random book that has a hundred sales rather than the song with billions of streams? You would think the technology is smarter than that. Using the echo by itself without alexa is even worse. It will show a totally different song playing than what is actually on and you cannot pause or play on the device itself, as it glitches horribly. Most of the menus begin to glitch if you press more than 2 buttons in a 10 second time frame, and it is more slow and has more delay than my 20$ android tablet from 10 years ago and that is really saying something as far as the technology goes. It is so frustrating to use that it ends up being a 24/7 clock, rather than anything useful.

About 50% of the time, it is unresponsive and all I do is play Pandora and show my front door (Ring doorbell camera). Things I tell it to do: stop playing Pandora--it hangs and has a yellow bar indicating it's hanging, and gives me a message it's having a problem; turn volume up--doesn't turn volume up and seems to be malfunctioning...then I manually turn the volume up and get nothing...then I tell it to play Pandora bc it seems to be frozen on a song and it skips to the next song but doesn't play, I repeat this process 3 more times and finally I just wait until it stops on its own and then after a few minutes, I start from the home screen and hope it will be responsive this time. The front door issue is basically it freezes when I tell it to stop. I've had to unplug it to get it to stop playing Pandora or showing the front door.
I also don't like that I can't seem to figure out how to stop its suggestions. I've changed a bunch of settings and it's reduced some of the unwanted things it shows me but it's still presenting info I don't care to see.
Finally, the touch screen is not very responsive. It definitely does not respond like a smart phone. I just gave up engaging with it because it's too cumbersome to get to what I want.
Cosmetically, I, too, do not appreciate a black model having a white cord. Additionally, I don't like the ""fabric"" type surface on the non-screen area, it's a dust collector and difficult to clean.
Personal preference, I would appreciate it if I could set the ""show front door"" to not turn off until I tell it to. It turns off after about 10 minutes.
I also wish that I could control the volume better. I like to keep it at its lowest setting while I work at my computer but that's even a little too loud/distracting. I wish there was a knob I could turn or I could tell Alexa to lower it without it being turned to no sound.

PCNiles,"Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2023","I have eight Echo Devices throughout my home. I have the original Beta version tower Echo which is still working great. Back in 2019, I purchased two Echo Shows. One is still working well. The other I traded in for this third generation Show thinking it would be an improvement even though the first generation device was still working fine.
It was on sale — great price. Big mistake. It was wonky from the beginning, refusing settings, showing the blue wave screen instead of my chosen wall paper, not audibly stating notifications, and other problems. I thought it was a lemon, a defective device. I returned it to Amazon within the time period allowed. Repurchased another one. At first I thought this replacement was working well but within a few days I noticed a significant lag in response time. Thereafter, every day there seemed to be something new that was “off” about it although nothing so great that I considered returning it. I did regret trading-in my first generation one though.
Now this replacement third gen is wonky just like the first one. It will stop working completely—going into a black screen then a split black/white screen (see video). The first one I purchased did this, too. If I reset it (unplug it) it will work okay for a few hours to maybe a day, and then fail again. Just like the first one. I don’t want to have to keep resetting the device.
Frankly, I never noticed any improvement in the video quality between the first and the third generation Show. I also didn’t like that the charcoal one comes with a white cord and plug. That wasn’t a deal killer though. It’s poor performance is.
I am very concerned about quality control with these Echo devices now. I don’t understand why two of these third generation Shows have both had significant problems.

-Crashes continually, even when updated
Echo Dot:
-Can’t perform simple tasks such as set a timer; if you try to say “Alexa, set timer for 10 minutes” she says “good evening” and doesn’t set one. If you do manage to set a timer she will randomly cancel or if you set a second timer she will cancel the first one.
-Can’t play Spotify, if you ask half of the time she’ll say “playing Spotify” then nothing happens.
-Can’t do things like discern kitchen from living room devices despite being set up on the Alexa app with those labels.
-Can’t report or troubleshoot errors, just spins and then stops.
-Doesn’t sync properly with other Amazon devices
Echo Show:
-Can’t perform simple tasks, like the echo dot, such as setting even one timer let alone multiple.
-Can’t discern which device is which despite calling them what they’re assigned to/named on the Alexa app.
-Even at night keeps brightness exactly the same, light sensor doesn’t work.
-Makes an audible notification ding randomly even when packages aren’t received.",1.0 out of 5 stars
D. A. Bell,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2024","This product is easily the worst Echo or Alexa product I've ever owned. It fails at its most basic responsibility: listen for voice commands and execute, <some action>.
Starting with the speed and responsiveness, it is slow. I turn on the ""beep"" sound that lets me know the device activates and is awaiting commands. This time can be so long the device actually deactivates its listening mode before it beeps and accepts a command.
Something simple like ""Alexa, turn on master lamp"" to turn on the bedroom lamp often has to be given 3 or 4 times.
I tried adding it to a set of speakers and this very rarely works paired to the Echo Plus I have in the same room. I thought all of this might be because I have multiple devices within ""hearing"" range all on the same voice command, so I changed the wake word and that still didn't help.
Also, since I am using it as a bedside clock + alarm the lack of listening is even more frustrating because it spends so much time cycling between ads and news blurbs and everything else a simple ""Alexa, Home"" command to get back to the clock takes multiple attempts, to the point where I sometimes have to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to finally respond at all.
This is a terrible device, my first ""Show"" device since the Gen 1 (which still works like a champ placed in the kitchen). I think I'll have to stick with the pucks and balls from now on and call it a day with any of these Alexa/Echo devices with screens. It doesn't matter how good the screen is if you can't get it to show you what you want, when you want.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Phil K,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2024","Doesn't do anything particularly well. Difficult to setup out of the box. You'll spend a lot of time trying to just get through the ads and trying to get through the data collection agreements. If you ask it to play songs, it'll mostly instead just ask you to pay more for an extra Amazon Music subscription. If you ask it to play videos, it'll mostly instead just ask you to pay more for an extra Amazon Video subscription. If you ask it to make a video call to grandma and grandpa, it'll get confused on whether to call a phone or call their Alexa devices. The home screen is very annoying and generally shows you things that you don't want to see and is difficult to customize. The voice recognition is poor and unresponsive. It inexplicably uses a barrel plug instead of USB-C. It's much bulkier and has the long barrel plug sticking out the back, taking up a ton of space compared to pretty much any cheap tablet which will do almost everything better than this device. There are no installable apps. It connects with Wyze cameras but when I ask it to show me the front porch camera it says OK and then doesn't actually bring up the camera.
On the positive side, occasionally it actually does make a video call or play the song or video that you want, the screen looks fairly nice, and the speakers sound good for the size. This device has had something like ten iterations over seven years and it operates like more like a device in beta that barely functions. A miserable showing compared to other Amazon devices that generally function fairly well for their price like Fire TV devices and their tablets. For most use cases I would just buy pretty much any tablet at a similar price point instead.",1.0 out of 5 stars

The Reviewer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2023","Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen, 2023 release)
-update 11/19/23 lowered to one star.
I have had this device for a while and I think it's time to discontinue alexa. OR I think Amazon may be.
lately, when I request alexa to read me my notifications it states ""you have one notification."" stops there.
I have read online that this issue has occured in 2018 and 2019.
another issue is the -home content- seems to be adding/activating random selections all by itself. which causes me to have to go in and turn off those ""suggestions/options"" but this has been going on for a while.
The 3 echo flex devices seem to be working fine. I do have other echo devices as well. they have random issues as well.
I think I will be switching to another brand soon since amazon has not improved the echo in the past year.
________________________________________________________________________________
I've only had this glitchy device for a couple days and it is irritating.
1. initially turned on, played music, it sounded like music coming from a tunnel while someone cupped your ears intermittently.
SOLUTION found on web, factory reset AFTER you set it up. Now the music sounds, better and as normal as a little device can sound.
2. PERSONAL PHOTOS CLOCK will not let you choose the clock, the only CLOCK option you get is upper left corner w/weather. that is it, no matter what clock style you choose. but even to get the photos to work, I had to factory reset it a couple more times, since troubleshooting this thing is like a crying baby on steroids.
SOLUTION no solution, seems as though people from the second gen have had this problem since latter 2022, so we are all thinking amazon does not care about this GLITCH and moving one.
Since I got this cheap little sucker for 40 bucks, not worried about pictures and clock too much, but I feel bad for those who paid actual price. Shame on amazon, isn't your products supposed to be good quality even those its 2 years technology ago? My echo spot, I had worked perfectly, and I traded it in for this glitchy item.

jnnyd,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2024","I don't know why I fell for this again - had an Echo spot that was a piece of junk, but got sucked into a Prime Day sale for the Echo Show and decided to give it a try. What a waste. Only purchase this if you plan to put it in any other room than a bedroom. I got this to play music in my bedroom, use as an alarm clock and for general weather updates and things as I started out my morning. First off, the screen refuses to stay in Night Mode. If you like bright lights while sleeping AND the constant rotation of content (which you can't seem to disable) then this is for you. There is supposedly 2 features that should solve for this - an auto dim feature and Night Mode. Both of these should automatically dim the screen to mostly black except for the time display which is a dark orange font at whatever time you decide is bedtime for you. However, that feature doesn't work most of the time, so your screen either just never goes into Night mode when it should or it starts out that way and at some point in the middle of the night switches off. As a bonus if you tell Alexa to turn off display, she does and the whole screen goes black (no time shows), but then you can't get the screen to wake up with a command. You have to unplug it and plug it back in. Honestly, these are very basic features that Amazon should be getting right. It's past the return window or I would have sent it back.",1.0 out of 5 stars
L. Johnson,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2024","I have three of these. The problem one is the latest bought ~ to replace a defunct Echo Dot.
① Clock face is shown left is as set in settings, and the right is shown as it transforms into after a few days. It is in the bedroom and in the low light the clockface is unreadable ~ useless as a clock.
② The 'new & improved' now no longer has a USB plug for power but a permanent cord leading to a dedicated plugin power supply. The way to fix ① is to power cycle the Echo Show, which is now plugged in behind the bed's headboard ~ incredibly difficult.
③ To avoid the essentially useless Amazon promotional messages. requires setting everything in 'Settings>Home &Clock>Home Content' to off ~ regularly since Amazon will change or add one to 'on'
④ Amazon has added music promos to the screen without a means to stifle them, these are promos from 'Amazon Music' or 'Spotify'. Both useless and annoying since all three are in locations with high-quality Spotify playback systems, not the picayine speakers built in. Additionally, the suggestions are inane ~ in no way reflecting my musical tastes.
⑤ This Echo Show occasionally reports 'There is more than one thing named ""Sam"", instead of turning on/off or changing brightness of the bedside lamps which I named ""Sam"" years ago. This is potentially dangerous because there is no alternative way of activating ""Sam"" mechanically.",1.0 out of 5 stars
OutdoorDesigner,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2024","UPDATE:
Amazon called after this review which hasn't been published as of this writing and I like it even less. I would say seriously dislike. After all the trouble to disable ads and skills, they pop right back up. She doesn't understand the command to get rid of them either.
I keep getting suggestions for movies and sports with a thumbs down to show I'm not interested and the screen just freezes.
I want to know who wrote all the five star reviews because I have three of these and didn't even take the third one out of the box.
I feel like the rep from Amazon just wasted my time. He got an earful and oddly, things got worse when I hung up.
Save yourself frustration and time for something that only benefits them.
Did anyone even run this thing by consumers before launching? Because I like Amazon less than ever before and I didn't think that was possible.
ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I wanted to love this. It sounds good for playing music but even that took several attempts.
Rarely shows my screen saver pictures and when it does a few are always very pixelated beyond trying to figure out what they are.
I bought three of these to replace three old ones. The only thing better is the sound.
Once again disabling all the ads and features takes forever and those panels are replaced with big grey blank screens.

CharlieATL,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2023","I'm downgrading from 2 stars to 1 star. For reasons unknown, my previously saved clock face (read Previous Review below) disappeared and now all I have is Amazon's version of the Blue Screen of Death.
Tried changing the clock face and saving it, but still get the BSOD. I do have Do Not Disturb on in a feeble effort to bypass Amazon's poor programming.
Subsequent to my initial review below posted back in October, I received a call from Amazon probing for further insights and I was assured that my experience and comments would at least be forwarded to someone who might consider my input. Apparently this did not occur.
The only thing that changed was that I cancelled my Prime membership due to this and other issues with Prime customer service - could that have possibly triggered this device behavior? Anybody have any insight?
PREVIOUS REVIEW
I needed a bedside clock. A very simple thing that will display the time and perhaps the outdoor temperature. I don't want a flashing background, rotating random photos or Amazon's attempt at advertising/marketing.
After two frustrating support conversations, I finally figured out how to select the least obtrusive clock face, adjust the brightness and most importantly, turn on Do Not Disturb to prevent random screen changes. So far it sort of works, as long as I don't invoke Alexa for anything - that triggers 2 or 3 screen changes before reverting back to the time of day.
Even with that, for some reason Amazon's programmers think it's OK to provide the temperature in a font size that can barely be seen from more than 2 feet away and cannot be read by anyone over 25 at all more than 3 feet away.
Make this better by allowing users to select from more usable screens without bells and whistles. The built in Alexa functionality provides plenty of features like setting an alarm or delivering a verbal reminder and people now know how to use that functionality (I have about 9 Echo devices throughout the house).",1.0 out of 5 stars
Abigail,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2024","Initial review of the product was that it was amazing. Loved the clock/video features. Was going to use it to view my toddlers nanny cam. But over the 6 months I had it, it just slowly got worse and worse until it just stopped responding one day. The nanny cam app (Nanit) never worked (the iPhone app works great, but not the Alexa extension). Would constantly say that it couldn’t find the device or that it stopped transmitting despite that I could pull it up on my phone in a few seconds. Another sleep sounds application came baked into the device with no way to see or remove it from my account. This would default every single night when trying to use my other sleep sounds extension, forcing an extremely loud starting noise for 15 seconds before changing to the one I use. The Alexa voice commands also stopped working effectively making the device an expensive bedside clock. Every once in a while Alexa would respond that she didn’t understand (other echos devices were fine). A simple hard reset would fix it. But this issue happened more and more to the point that it was once every day. The one day Alexa just didn’t understand anything. Nothing got through, and no amount of resets helped. Just broken. TLDR: Terrible device, terrible voice assistant integration. Several extensions just don’t work at all and others are forced on the users account without a way to remove them.",1.0 out of 5 stars
swb6345,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2024","I use to have the older echo show 5 and traded it and decided to try this newer model. Being it was stated the mic/s are better. Well not really. If you are looking for an echo show, the 8 or 10 inch is better. The 5 is a pain in the butt. It will pick up its name with no problem but can't seem to hear you say a command. If I was to rate my voice from 1 to 10, it will get its name around a 3 and you have to voice the command around 8 or 9. And you have a 50/50 chance it will still do it or hear you. If you have it on your desk next to you and use it for simple things it will work great but don't expect anything from a distance. The sad part is, I have the echo 8 and I can be 20/25ft away and say its name and command at a voice level of say 4 and it has no problem hearing me. But this echo 5 you pretty much have to scream at it to get it to do anything. So I do not see how they can get off on saying improved mics/s. Right now like 3ft away and I had to say a command 3 times before it got it at all. So over all waist of money. Get the show 8 or 10.

Mandy,"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2023","The sound is good to my ears and the clock is pretty. Other than that, I hate this thing. The interface is sloooow and clunky with so many menus that take forever to load. I had better palm pilots in the early 00’s. I got it as a package deal with a Ring doorbell for only $10 more on Prime Day and I think that’s about what it’s worth, as it’s about the quality of a child’s toy. I thought it’d be nice to be able to see the doorbell camera, but that soon stopped working at all. I’ll say “Alexa show me the front door” and it’ll take 5 seconds to start loading it then just sit loading it until it times out. It’s faster to use the Ring app on my iPad or iPhone. It randomly switches from clock to video news stories, then won’t switch back when I say “Alexa go home” about half the time. (As I was typing this review, it switched to a video new story and I said go home, which it did, and 10 seconds later it showed me another video news story. I said “go home” again and it showed “try Alexa, call mom” for 10-20 seconds before it went home.) It gets frozen on menus and the display goes wonky all the time. It gives me random alerts, even though I changed the settings to not show me alerts except for package deliveries. It does have a decent camera and I like that I can view it from the Alexa app on my iPhone when I’m away from home, however it’s angled toward the ceiling. I have it on my end table that is the same height as my couch and can’t even see the couch right in front of it.

Mine was awesome until a recent update was pushed out, and now the display is super bright all night long instead of having the option of enabling night mode to dim the display at night. Worse yet, it rotates between display applets every few seconds, so it is constantly changing. I actually have to lay it face-down at night to get to sleep. I experienced the same issue with support that many others on the on the forums have - something between denying the issue, walking you through endless useless gyrations, or simply saying it’s a known issue and is their top priority. But, it’s been over a month and still no solution. I’ll be swapping mine with the echo dot in my family room until the issue is resolved, and will update this review when that happens - hopefully soon. Giving this a low rating in hopes of getting Amazon’s attention, but honestly it’s been a great little device otherwise.

Update 2/18/24: Support reached out to me with the following useless response: “I want to thank you for taking the time to provide feedback about the Echo Show 5. Try using ‘Alexa, screen off’"".
So their answer is to make it so you can’t use it all night long as a clock, since your choices are blinding bright flashing all night long or completely off, no dimmed display that shows the time. Additionally, every time I went to take a drink from my glass of water next to it on the nightstand, it wakes up again. Then, I have to wake up my wife by barking out the “Alexa display off” command.

Hailan Zhou,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2024","The screen has one primary use - as a clock. To be useful as such, the time should always be shown, as large as possible, filling the whole screen, so that it is visible from a distance.
Unfortunately, Amazon has decided to kill this functionality by injecting completely worthless ads and other content - worthless not just because it is irrelevant (maybe), but also because NONE OF IT IS INTELLIGIBLE FROM A DISTANCE. Sure, the time is still on there, in tiny font in the top corner.
Sure, you can disable some of this in the settings, but you cannot turn it off entirely.

First, it's basically a machine for throwing ads at you. You can get it turn ads off, but it's a hassle going through several menus and downloading a seperate app.
But worst, it needlessly YELLS announcements at you. Even if it's on ""Do Not Disturb""-modr, even if the three volume is all the way down. I have tried everything to get it to shut up, and it won't. Especially when it connects to a Bluetooth device, like my phone. For example, we have a newborn baby, and we had just gotten her down for a nap after being up all night long. I went downstairs to run a load of laundry and when I walked back upstairs, the Echo loudly announced my phone had reconnected to the Bluetooth. Waking up our two-week old daughter.

I haven't counted because I don't want the pain of cycling through all of the screens again but it's between 30-40 different settings that have to be turned off. It's ridiculous and terribly frustrating. When I think of the Show, I'm imagining an Echo device that has a display added. That would have been perfect.

blee,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2023","Buying the Echo Show made me appreciate my Apple products more. I bought the Echo Show to integrate with my Ring Door bell. I wanted to be able to see who was at my door, instead of having to pickup my phone and tap on a notificaiton in theory the Echo Show can do this but there are same big gotchas.
The biggest gotcha is that there is a considerable delay between the time you get the notification and see the video so if for example some one walks past your door you'll get the notification but by the time you actually see the video the person is gone so you don't see anything. You might ask why this is important? because a lot of the time delivery people don't ring the door bell or even knock before they leave the door tag so the point was to notify them that someones home before the leave the door talk and walk off.
You can't watch replays on your Echo Show there's no app or Ring so if you want to see who you missed that day there's no way to do that. You can't even ask Alexa to show your Ring doorbell history. You can't configure the volume of announcements separately from the volume for watching video or listening to music. So you're watching the news and someone comes to your door Alex is shouting ""RING HAS DETECTED A PERSON AT YOUR DOOR"". Also if you happen to see interesting news on your Echo Show screen it takes minutes after you've tapped on the play button to start playing sometimes it doesn't event play at all and the Echo will just go back to the wall paper like nothing happened.

Yet when as the identical question to my Echo device on my night stand it can answer the question making me believe that all devices are somehow connected to the cloud in a different way. Devices like this from that other company can answer far more complicated questions. It's amazing after all this time that Amazon seems to have spent more time placing ads on the screen then getting it improved. They also added this finger on the screen which blocks the clock or time and you can't get rid of the stupid thing. My prior unit used to obey when I told it to shut off its screen as I would get tired of seeing all these ads. It also would pop up the full screen clock when I commanded it to, ""show the Clock"".

Blue_h2o,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2023","Update: Every day I live with this thing I hate it even more. I spent a hour in a chat with someone trying to figure out how to make it stop showing ad after ad... the guy was offshore (I have no problem with that) but he's not even using the same terminology for the Echo that the documentation for the Echo uses. Needless to say... it's still showing ads.
Today, in the eastern timezone... this stupid piece of crap thinks it's 4 hours later than it actually is. The actual time is 4:08 and the Echo Show say's it's 8:08. I say ""Alexa... why are you showing the wrong time... she responds with ""I found this on the web"".
Original review: This was my first Echo with a screen. It will be my last. It is nothing but a screen that plays ads for Amazon products, videos, etc. I have gone into settings many times and switched off every single suggestion, outside content, etc. It still shows ads. If I had kept the box I would have already sent it back. The most disappointing device I’ve bought in a long time. For reference, I have a Google Home with a display and it has never shown a single ad.
FINAL UPDATE: After fighting with this stupid piece of crap for over a year, I have given up. It appears that it is now impossible to toggle ""paid suggestions"" off, so rather than seeing a clock or some media of my choosing, I see more ads. Yep that's right... I paid money for this thing and all it is capable of doing is spewing content that Amazon chooses to me. I. Am. Done. I just deregistered it and it's going in the garbage.

When I got it, it took all of about 2 or 3 hours before I gave up and went back to Google. First of all, this thing is tiny. Second of all, it's packed with ads. My main reason for wanting a display (as opposed to the pure speaker version) was to use this as a digital picture frame, but 90% of the time it shows ads instead of your pictures. Also, getting the pictures on the display is unnecessarily obnoxious. The cheapest Google Nest Hub is about the same price on sale, much larger, with a better display, it shows 0 ads, is much easier to get the pictures on, and there's no limit to the number of pictures. The only thing it lacks is a camera. Third of all, Alexa still stinks. Google stinks too, but in different and generally less frustrating ways.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Cameron Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2023","I have used Echo Show as my bedside clock since the first one came out. The first iteration the clock was too small so when the Echo Show 5 came out and I saw the clock would be the size of the screen, I bought it. I used it for 4 years. This last year, Amazon changed something and it started constantly changing screens even though I had everything on it set up to just show the clock default. Then a few months ago the screen started glitching and after a lot of research trying to fix it, It still does the same. So when I saw the Echo Show 5 3rd generation was on sale for Cyber Monday, I decided to just buy a new one.
I've had the Echo Show 5 3rd Gen for 2 days. I will be returning it. No matter what I do, it will only display the clock for about one minute before it switches to a blank background screen. It also flickers about every 10-20 seconds. I have spent hours looking up articles or Youtube videos for how to fix this. I have turned off everything in the show content settings, I have set it up to always have night mode on, I have turned on Do Not Disturb, I have turned off adaptive brightness. No matter what I do, it's still the same thing.

Plus the device is possessed to grab temperatures from a different region than Florida. It also shows Drop In notifications that aren't there! After doing some research online (do a search for Echo Show and Transitional Joy clock face), I found loads of unresolved complaints about these issues going back to the middle of 2023, with no solution from Amazon. Some users were on their 13th unit at this point!! Ridiculous! Not to mention, every time you call Amazon to talk to someone, they seem to misplace your customer service ticket and have to re-create the wheel. I'm guessing they only get paid when a ticket is closed, so having one left open means no joy for customer service. So much for getting any resolution on something when they have to send you a new device for further testing, or if it takes them more than a day to look into an issue.

TSD,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2023","Compared to the numerous Alexa devices I have the sensitivity and voice recognition capability of the Show totally stinks. I tried to return it and an Amazon employee essentially refused to replace it with another, instead just having me completely reboot the system. This improved things a bit but over time the recognition capability has returned to almost non-existent. Now the return period is over and although their system tells me replacement is ""possible"" until June 2024 there are no links or mechanisms identified to start this process. Don't go through my hassles and just buy something else besided the Show.
10-20-23 update: Following the previous review an Amazon employee called me. I mentioned the reboot had been done previously and they elected to send me a new replacement Show. The new unit received is much better than the first unit, so I suspect my first one was a quality control escape. I'm re-rating this a 3 since my first one got worse with time, and I don't know that this one won't.
11-16-23 update: The 2nd Show was more sensitive than the 1st, but both of them developed deafness over time. After less than a month the 2nd one acted like the 1st, and wouldn't recognize its name (""Echo"", in our case) even when in a quiet room with no background noise and standing just 2 feet in front of it. This is regardless of how loudly we say its name. I'm taking the rating back down to 1 star. Don't buy a Show.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon contacted me after I posted my review and after trying to work out what its issue with its hearing was, they sent me a new one. Set up went flawlessly, its hearing problem is better but not nearly as good as other older Echo devices in our home. I have an Echo studio in our bedroom and an Echo Spot in my office. The Studio has the wake word ""AMAZON"", and the SPOT has the wake word ""ALEXA"" Using a normal speaking tone both of these devices can hear their wake word from the kitchen which is on the other side of house. Even though the new unit is better, it still has trouble hearing and can't always hear its wake word from the kitchen which is about 10 feet away.

Ion S.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2023","I bought this for my daughter as a more advanced clock with an alarm that she could occasionally use to consume media (like music) or to get some questions answered. The primary function, though, was the clock and the alarms. Well, I'm sad to say this, but nothing worked as it should have!
Here are some specific grievances:
- I set-up an alarm, and next morning it went off as expected, but then when my daughter clicked to stop the alarm (not snooze) it started talking and asking questions, and engaging with her. Who thought that's a good thing to do at 6:45am in the morning?
- I found a setting (in my Alexa app on the phone, not on the Echo Show device itself) that controls this. I deactivated it (again, why was it on by default?!?). Even after I deactivated it and it showed deactivated, it still did the damn thing! (I'm glad I tested ahead of time and didn't wait until the next morning).
- I deactivated the automated brightness dimming while I was playing around with the settings, but then ""Do not disturb"" kicked in at 9pm (as was scheduled) and I could change the brightness back to dimmed (it's not an option on the Alexa app on my phone, and I could do anything on the device itself).

Instead I'm inundated with content that I can't control or disable. After extensive research I discovered that this is a common annoyance. Some users were able to solve the problem by changing the language, by changing to clock to be on constant night time mode or by other means. Like many others I was unable to defeat this annoyance which is deliberately built in to the device. It's a deal breaker and ruined what might otherwise be a useful tool. And a waste of time trying to solve the problem and returning the item. It's too bad because I stream music and the device's sound system is very good.

Marissa S,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2023","I have been a long time Echo user, ever since the original beta version. Unfortunately this has me fallen into the sunken cost fallacy trap that I am stuck with the Amazon device versus switching to Google or Apple.
And, sadly, I have missed my return window.
- THE SCREEN CONSTANTLY SHOWS ADS. Yes, you can customize and turn off what you don't want displayed, but there are seemingly 30+ options you need to turn off one-by-one, and they sneakily add new ones weekly that you have to go back in and turn off
- The screen responsiveness is slow and laggy. I would expect a brand new device to flow smoothly between screens with little lag, but this is nowhere near the case. Even right now as I type this and it's in standy mode it's just showing me a grey screen as part of the slideshow.
- Little customization. I wanted this thinking I could make it a home hub where it displays my smarthome light switches in an easy-to-use touch interface, but you can't. Shame on me for not doing any research to see if this was possible
- The microphone array is poor. My Sonos Beam with Alexa built-in located in another room constantly picks up my voice instead of this thing.
- The device itself looks nice
- It shows me the correct time
- There's a physical shutter to close the camera that I will literally never use",1.0 out of 5 stars
Evans,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2023","Overall, this is a massive disappointment... I bought this for one purpose. That was to stream a specific news web site in the morning. (wsmv.com/livestream) I waited for Prime Day and did get it at a good price point. But, I've tried every ""trick"" I've found on the Internet, spoke repeatedly with AMAZON tech support, updated firmware, tried all sorts of web suggested workarounds, and replaced the unit. Every time I think I may have found a workable solution, the unit fails the next day. The unit is sluggish and somewhat hard to control during scrolling. What I mean by that, is the unit's ""sluggish scroll"" and propensity to just insist on returning to the home while manipulating the screen. Our 10.1"" Echo Show doesn't exhibit any of these anomalies. Just my opinion, but this unit needs more work. I don't recommend this unit at this time. It's not awful in my opinion. It does some, probably most things well. It streams Prime movies actually very well. It has decent sound. Voice commands work pretty well, although for me, it somewhat frequently misses the first ""ALEXA"" wake up call. The analog clock display is attractive if you have a need for a clock? I love the size and the number of things that it does do well. I just feel all features should work correctly/properly and smoothly.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Mistress of Romance,"Reviewed in the United States on February 29, 2024","I’ve gotten two different versions/models of this echo, and both versions I’ve had problems with. The echo doesn’t respond to you at times, doesn’t do the command but confirms that it did it, it doesn’t respond from the correct room and it doesn’t even keep the time correctly just to make a few issues. Depending on what display is showing determines if the clock is correct. In screen saver mode the clock is off by 6 hours, but if I’m actively using it, then it will show the correct time.
I have an earlier models of the echo puck and the echo clock and I have zero issues with them, and I give them five star reviews. The echo puck that I have is a first or second GEN and the only negative that I have to say about it is that the sound isn’t as loud as the newer echoes like the clock.

No Hulu. No Netflix. No Showtime. No TV apps. No HBO. No Disney+. No way to add or download more apps.
It's basically a screen that only plays Prime Video and Youtube. Tik-tok, if you even consider that a video app. Otherwise, this is useless. Couldn't use it to open Amazon to shop. Couldn't open their main site or Amazon Fresh, which you'd think they'd at least have that work since it makes them MORE money. But no, you can only ask Alexa to add specific items to your cart, no browsing.
I even said ""Alexa, open app store"" and she says ""I can't open app store right now"". Could only open Audible and it's set to AUTO-PLAY, it would not let me see or choose from my collection of books, it just kept repeating the same book over and over.
Save your $ and buy a Fire HD tablet, which can be around the same price and runs EVERYTHING and is worlds better. This is a janky, broken mess, and for some reason, the brand new 2023 model is scaled back to allow MINIMAL usage, with LESS apps and accessibility.

J.R.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2024","Purchased an Echo Show 5 on Prime Day deals. It arrived intact and quickly. Set up was a breeze. That's where the good stuff ends.
The first thing we did was play music, we were having dinner at the time and I was telling my wife about a song I heard. Played it it most of the way through before the song just quit. No outside influence, no Amazon shipment arrival, just quit.
Second thing we did was test the video call feature. I was on my way home from work, called the device, once connected it wouldn't show my video on the device. Essentially made it a voice chat only. Once the call was complete the device stayed frozen on what I would call the ""hang up screen""
The next afternoon I told my children that Apples were natures toothbrush. They asked why, so I asked Alexa. She began to answer, got about 7 words in, and crashed hard. Black screen. No response to voice or touch, no button inputs worked. It was stuck that way for 12 or so minutes.
Upon contacting customer support I was given instruction to update. It already had the most up to date software. I was then instructed to Factory Reset but ""retain all smart devices"". After conducting the reset, we asked the same question, same result. Support then requested I reset full and disconnect smart devices. Total reset, redo setup, ask the same question, same exact result.
To support teams credit they were empathetic and swift to send me return details and overnighted a new Echo show. That arrived today. Set it up. All the same story as with the other device.
I don't know if the 5 is less powerful than the 8, 10, or 15 and thus unable to perform standard tasks it advertises, but I went with a return and refund. I may try a different ""stronger"" device later, I may not.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I set it up a few hours ago and this is one of the best speakers i own. its so clear and has a rich sound! Love the color and I am so excited to use all of its features. I know I will be using this literally every day. especially since i am about to start working from home I can see this being a big part of my daily life.
I love the screen and really glad I didn’t only buy the echo dot. I am using this in my room and have hooked up all my lamps and lighting to the smart plugs which were also an awesome impulse buy. I stay up late often and usually have to force myself out of bed to shut all the lights and then I am wide awake lol
I did alot of research before pressing buy though and I am very glad I chose Alexa. bot regretting which one I got and i was very torn between this alexa and gen 8.
The sound? clear and rich. Very loud all the way turned up. can gear it from across the house
How fast does it respond and can it hear me? very quickly! I saw some comments saying it has issues with hearing you and just doesn’t respond at all. not an issue at least yet! its brand new though.
How is the touch screen? great and i love that it has presets for when its not being used. I have it set on art wallpaper and i love seeing that, the touch screen works perfectly
The size? not too big! the screen is smaller than my iphone 14 mini and its still very clear and can read it from multiple feet away.
love it! what really sold me was when i watch frasier and he has a date over and sets the mood with candles, lighting and his classical music and it takes him a few minutes and sometimes it causes an awkward scene and he has to run across the room and turn on the light and then turn off the music with a remote followed my anger or awkward rambling… i thought to myself i want to set a scene but way more easily and less awkwardly 😂 frasier fan approved
UPDATE A MONTH IN—
lost 3 stars, very glitchy and laggy now. Sometimes the volume button or voice command doesn’t work and it will be stuck blasting and you will end up shouting “alexa! alexa!” to no avail and will be ignored so you will have to unplug it and force it to restart. Sometimes it takes a while for the tablet part to actually work (laggy), often times you will ask it to play a song and it will play something entirely different.
I guess this part is more of an amazon music complaint but the songs that play after you put in a certain song, like suggested songs I guess? are awful and almost never at all even in the same genre to the song you put on.
I like a lot of the features still and that it acts like my alarm, can watch or listen to the news and all the other things etc but it definitely has some bugs and problems that really tank the value and purpose of the device.",2.0 out of 5 stars
JJ Runner,"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2024","Unless you want ads or commercials scrolling across the screen as you’re waking up/going to bed or watching TV, you might want to reconsider. This is my second Echo Show. Originally loved it so much I upgraded to version 3 last year. It sits in my TV stand to replace the clock on my cable box after I cut the cord. Admittedly, an expensive “clock,” but it was worth it because it automatically sets the time and adjusts for Daylight Savings — plus I use the Alexa feature to turn on the TV and for other voice controls. It worked perfectly until the excessive ads. I managed to turn them off after navigating the obscure settings. Worked perfectly for a while, but somehow the intrusively distracting ads keep cropping up. Followed the instructions on the Amazon website and Reddit discussions to turn off the feature but to no avail. I finally just broke down and bought a Lenovo smart clock. Will be “gifting” my Echo, but honestly I’m thinking about chucking it. Don’t want to subject anyone else to the excessive harassment of “Buy this” or “You might like this.” Amazon: you already have quite a successful business model. You don’t have to stalk your customers with needless ads just because it’s another available screen.

Luther,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024","I mainly purchased an Echo Show because I have several Ring doorbells that are supposed to work flawlessly with the Echo system. Unfortunately, the integration between the Ring System and the Echo Show 5 has been really glitchy. The glitchyness isn't limited to Ring integration either- it seems like the software that runs the Echo Show, along with the quality overall, seems a bit lacking compared with other Echo products that I have owned in the past.
The original Echo Show 5 that I purchased failed after just two months. The screen went blank and the system would no longer respond to touch or anything else. Amazon did cover that defect under warranty and sent me a new unit. I've been using the new one for about three months now, and again, the replacement is glitchy and problematic in terms of Ring integration. Often the screen will freeze when someone arrives at my door- and although the audio continues to work- the screen will remain frozen until I unplug the power cord and force a reboot. This happens probably 1-2 times each week.
Unfortunately, the whole point of me purchasing an Echo show was so that I we could see who was at the door from within the house- and it just doesn't work really well.",2.0 out of 5 stars

The Echo show 5 is probably the worst Amazon product I’ve used. The screen is a cool feature, allowing you to watch videos and video chat with Alexa app users or other Echos. The microphone however is terrible. The only way that it picks up my voice is if I’m standing right in front of it practically yelling. Most of the time it doesn’t even interpret my questions correctly. Although I had my Echo show 5 set to local time, it would constantly display the wrong time, either an hour ahead or hour behind. The audio is sub par, definitely not what I’d expect for the price. My Echo Show 5 would have a hard time interacting with other smart devices in my home including my Echo Dot.

All in all, a disappointment, and while I WOULD buy another regular Echo device (if my house wasn’t so small that one device hears us from every room) I would never consider one of these again, unless a later generation says “massive interface redesign and improved voice command response for viewing.” It is basically an expensive Bluetooth clock-radio for me, and I didn’t need one of those.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Tim W,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2023","I currently own many Amazon Echos of various models and generations. I’m generally happy with them. Having no Echo Shows though, I purchased the Echo Show 5 because the price had dropped, and it looked like a good opportunity to try it and see if I’d be willing to spend more on a larger model.
In the Master Bedroom, I have and Echo Dot on each side of the bed. One of them is a 3rd generation with clock. Both are set up as ‘Home Theater’ speakers for the Fire TV Stick on the TV at the foot of the bed, as an improved audio configuration for the room.
My intention was to replace one of them with the Echo Show 5, as a larger, better alarm clock, with better sound and additional functionality. Right away, I noticed several shortcomings:
1. The interface is very clunky, laggy, and slow. It seems like the processor is simply underpowered for the application. It’s very difficult to scroll and use because of this.
2. As an Alexa device, its ‘hearing’ is inferior. The Echo Dot on the other side of the bed easily responds to commands even though it’s much further away. I suspect the Echo Show 5 has an inferior microphone array compared to the Dots.
3. It’s difficult to make it display just the clock, without additional screens scrolling through the many Amazon suggestions and various other things that I simply don’t want to see. I had to turn off literally everything from the list, and it still frequently scrolls from the clock I’ve selected, back to itself, again and again.
4. As a clock, one can select from a variety of pre-defined backgrounds with Analog/Digital clock faces. But they all kinda suck, and there’s no way to design your own. As an Alarm, it’s nice that it has a ‘thump to snooze’ feature, but there’s no way to choose a snooze duration other than the default 9 minutes, or how many times.
5. As an Alexa interface to control my home automation components, it behaves illogically. If I ask her to turn a lamp on or off, she responds appropriately, and then displays the On/Off button that I just controlled with my voice – not really necessary. But if I ask her to show me the thermostat so I can see what the current settings are, or to make any changes, she doesn’t know what I’m talking about. I have to manually select the thermostat through many pokes of the touchscreen.
6. Finally, and most disappointing for me, it’s not compatible with the Fire TV Stick as a Home Theater speaker. So, despite having better audio, it doesn’t have the same functionality as the Echo Dot that it replaced.
Overall, it lacks some of the functionality of its simpler brothers and adds additional functionality that’s fairly worthless. And what it does do, it does very poorly. In concept, it has great potential but it’s a poor implementation.
In summary, money was wasted. I can safely say that I won’t be purchasing any more Echo Shows.",2.0 out of 5 stars

And I get it, those mega yachts, cowboy hats, and space rockets aren't going to pay for themselves.
It’s about as reliable as any other Alexa - works about 70% ish of the time, doesn’t respond to obvious requests, randomly responds to requests you never made, says 'bye the way, you should buy this' every time you ask it a question.
More specifically, the screen is glitchy and not always responsive (except with ads, those are quite clear), think early Kindles that you could connect to WiFi kind of clunky interface. It takes, on average three requests to get a correct response. On the upside, the speaker is decent, now if it only would respond to volume requests. Usually, after three attempts to adjust the volume by asking nicely, I end up walking over to the thing and pushing the + or - button myself which which makes jarring volume adjustments. I generally give up attempting to adjust the volume and put up with whatever how loud Alexa feels like being. Much like living with a toddler, or parrot, so I've got experience with this sort of thing.
Jokes on you Amazon, I got it for my parrot so she has a little screen to watch and she doesn’t know what commercials are. I wouldn’t get it or put it anywhere that faces people because of the screen and camera, but if you’ve got a parrot to buy for, don't mind an awkward screen interface that you can't adjust from the app on the phone, random volume changes that resist adjustment, or say you just are nostalgic for life with a toddler, this could be ideal for you.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Angela R.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2024","This Echo is awful in almost every single category. I've had trouble with it since day 1, and I own two other Echos (a Show 5, and an old tall grey Echo that I love for sound quality). This one is in another room and down the hall from my tall Echo, and the Show 5 is downstairs in the kitchen - a long way away from this device, and yet BOTH of the other devices answer for this Echo every single time I ask a question, and I'll be standing literally within inches of this device. Sometimes I even whisper, and the other Echos answer or start mumbling, especially when I tell this device to STOP an alarm or sleep sounds, etc. I've tried running downstairs and telling the Show 5 that she's ""responding on the wrong device"" (which I found as the only answer on the internet), but that doesn't help. Also, I really want this Echo to be an alarm clock at night that will show the time very dim (another very hard thing to accomplish with this device!) and to play sleep sounds. You cannot have both - if she's playing sleep sounds, she will display a theme from that platform, so there goes my clock time. And it's bright - I have to turn it around so I can't see the glow. In the morning when I tell it to Stop sleep sounds, the other Echos answer and she keeps playing them. It's frustrating and ridiculous how many issues I've had with this cheap device. Do not buy this one, unless you've never had one before and you don't need her to answer a single question (she constantly just makes that shut-down sound) and you don't care that the display is obnoxiously bright and yet dumb at the same time.",2.0 out of 5 stars

It stops reading notifications in mid sentence and I get a lot of, ""Hmm, I don't know that one,"" or ""I am having trouble understanding you,"" when I ask a simple question. So I am not impressed. I also cannot ask it simple math questions because it will interrupt me in mid question with, ""I don't understand that one,"" or some such thing.

It easily takes 2-3 seconds to respond once I use the ""wake word"" and then only understand half of the simple commands I'm asking it to make (Such as raise and lower volume or stop timer, etc.). The touch screen is also slow to respond to any touch movements and you can see it trying to work extra hard just to swipe the screen down so you can see the menu/setting options, etc.
Also just wanted to add that I also have the Echo Show 8, which works flawlessly without any delay.

What is annoying is the fact that the screen is constantly changing and that is extremely distracting. I hate that part of this device. Additionally, I hate that ads are a forced part of the content that is continuously displayed. I would gladly pay more for the product to have the ability to eliminate these ads. There is a feature that allows you to turn off the screen, but a bug in that feature requires you to unplug the device and reboot it so that you can see the screen again.

Clayton,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2023","If i had paid full price for this, it would have been 1 star. I bought this so I could have a clock at night. I recently had an echo dot with the screen. Worked amazing. I had all the home content turned off. No complaints other than the screen was small and I wanted to be able to see the art better.
This device is supposed to be newer, and better, but it’s not.
The home content will not stay turned off. Constantly you have to go back into the settings and turn everything they secretly turned back on, off. This wouldn’t be a problem if there weren’t probably 30 different forms of advertising all separated into different “options.” No, I do not want to see Alexa AI, or be jump-scared by the news and see the most unflattering picture of someone I don’t know by my bedside.
To top that anger off, the UI is so so laggy and constantly freezes. The old echo dot did not and it was probably 6-7 years old. Added to this lag is the adaptive brightness. It isn’t a smooth transition, it’s choppy and I really thought my show was broken. Nope, just how it is.
The customization is still unchanged. There are different night time clocks which some are not my style, but I can’t do anything because they’re tied to the daytime clock you have. The art night clock is small and red, while other nighttime clocks are full screen and blue. It’s so weird you can’t choose this.
I’ve noticed frequently when the device switches between art, it crashes and defaults to the default home wallpaper. It soon fixes itself but seriously? A “new” device can’t cycle through static images? In 2023. It just blows my mind.
Only ones I can give it is the speaker sounds clear. I like that there’s a physical camera off switch.
It's still an alexa device. She doesn’t do half the things you ask, you have to word it perfectly to match the amazon command script, and she frequently misinterprets what you say. Siri for example, can understand perfectly what I say.",2.0 out of 5 stars
RustyMonkey,"Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2023","So I have been eye balling this for a long time, got a great lighting deal and pulled the trigger. I purpose bought this for a kitchen speaker, to add shopping list items, listen to music while cooking, maybe use the screen to play some youtube while eating breakfast etc.
It does make adding items to the shopping list easy. The music is though is meh... its not very loud and if you raise it up it begins to distort quickly. I have a large kitchen so if you have a small space it may work better for you, if that was the only problem. The sound is flat, nearly soulless. I have several older echo devices and the sound although not amazing, is generally good enough, but this one just isnt. Im no audiophile so Im not the person to pinpoint the problems, but I think its obvious its missing something.
The screen is a whole other problem. Its small; I knew it buying it; but my thought was I use my phone all the time, it will be the same. I was wrong. The screen is slow to respond, generally gets locked up at times and has to be reset. The benefit of a phone I never considered is when you are trying to look at something detailed you pick it up and bring it closer, this does not work well for that purpose. The image seems fuzzy? Worse quality than a phone and it is noticeable. Watching youtube on it is a big fail, it will eventually play but it is a browser output making all controls tiny and with a lagging screen you will have miss clicks and frustration immediately. Use an Ipad or laptop and you will be much happier.
Look I really enjoy amazon products but this one is a dud and the features just arent there. If you need a wireless speaker and alexa just get the echo speaker and you will be much happier. Maybe the next one will be more responsive and usable.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Thomas Phelps,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2024","When it decides to work properly, it's great. But the Alexa software is so full of bugs that the device only works about 80% of the time. The other 20% of the time it just does something random or refuses to work at all. I also have the Echo Show 8 and I have them grouped together. Honestly, most of the problems occur when I try to get something to work on the group. If I try to give commands to just one device then I'd say it works 90% of the time. But if I want something to play on the Everywhere group then it only works maybe 70% of the time. Imagine if your car only started 9 times out of 10, but 1 out of every 10 tries, the car just does something random and it won't actually take you anywhere. Imagine how outraged you'd be - you'd call that car a total piece of junk. Well, that's exactly what Alexa is.

J. Schulze-clewing,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2023","I have a 3rd gen Echo Show 5 and another 2nd gen. They work ok. When they are working, that is. The hardware is good, the software ... isn't. Echo devices are especially helpful if you have a disabled person in the house where operating a regular phone just isn't feasible. So it deserves some stars.
Then the software on the 2nd gen became faulty where you can no longer change the WiFi network or any of the privacy settings. Maybe it happened because of a forced update? Who knows. This after only 16 months , just a few months past warrranty. There appears to be no (!) way of updating the software if it has become faulty because such updates can only be initiated from inside the now faulty and hanging existing software. In other words the device is now bricked. So now I'll have to throw away perfectly good hardware just because Amazon blew the software reinstall process. Amazon tech support had no other solution and management was not willing to offer a courtesy replacement, just a 20% discount from full price. Long story short, in my opinion the Echo Show 5 is not worth the $90 list price. I would not buy it again.
Other: The Alexa app on my Android phone is by far the slowest software I have ever seen. It also takes way too long to start a drop-in from there.
I believe Amazon needs to brush up on tech expertise in the development of such products and definitely use external consultants for a fresh look and ideas. This includes strategic issues such as a lack of updateability. They would catch such bloopers, this is what design reviews are for. What we did in med tech was to include experienced customers who we paid for attending such meetings. Very valuable input came from those.
Let me offer a bit of free consulting advice: Set up the Amazon server side so software updates can be pushed to a device upon command from an Amazon customer service agent. ""Hold mute, press + three times and hang tight for two minutes"" or whatever. That's how we do it in the oil/gas/ag fields.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Guy Buying Stuff,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2024","Final update: it's slower and has quirks that no other device has. It's operating like the original review. I rebooted a couple days ago and it works better for a little bit and then returns to how I reviewed it the first time. I thought tech support seemed helpful, they were nice, but ultimately I wish my first generation didn't break. It was a much more solid device.
Update: It is a little faster after following tech support's recommendation of resetting the wake word. It is still slightly slower than other devices.
Update: tech support reached out and recommended changing the wake word and changing it back to see if that resolves the issue. I'll give it a few days and update.
It's not very responsive and I can usually get most if not all of a request out before it even starts listening. This is an issue with multiple echos in the home because a random one from across the house will sometimes answer and I can't hear it very well or it's just quicker to turn on a light myself instead of using the echo.
This was a replacement for a 1st generation which went out because the screen started to go so I kind of feel like I'm stuck with a sub par product. I was hoping a software update would fix the delays but I haven't seen one yet and it's been a while.
Not the best version of this product in my opinion.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Austin Massey,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2024","This thing seems to think I wanted to interrupt the photo stream that I have going as a background all the time. I can't seem to get rid of suggestions even though I've turned everything off.
As far as I can tell, the only thing it should be doing is showing me photos, the weather, and the time. But instead it feels like most of the time I look at it there's some silly suggestion about a thing I should be doing even though I've turned suggestions and all of the other things that might be considered interruptions off.
I don't want to run the photo app I want it to just happen in the background like I've got it set up. I don't want it to suggest things I want it to listen when I talk and actually be able to stream music without glitching out half the time.
The music thing's another bad aspect that's gotten worse. I had to unpair my last one from my speaker group because it would regularly make a loud static noise instead of playing music. That was one of my large hopes and upgrading that this one would actually work with the speaker group It's Wi-Fi coverage is just the same as all the rest It's on the same network everything should work but most of the time it glitches out while I'm listening to music which is super distracting.

The device is very under powered making the inputs very laggy. Every time you touch it you have to wait for it to respond and you're never quite sure if it registered your input if you're trying to do things quickly like pause or rewind a video then you end up pushing things that you didn't mean to cause it didn't respond quick enough. If you pause the video for too long then the screen will time out and when you touch the screen your video does not come back automatically which makes things hard when you're trying to do time sensitive cooking. It seems like it would be fine if it had a faster processor or no screen but this combination is unusable.
I also set it up so that I could view its camera from my phone so I could watch the dog while I'm not home but then something changed and I was never able to get that to work again after the first time that I used it.

mickey10,"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2024","If you want a device to play music...it's OK, not great sound, but ok in a cheap radii kind of way. If you want a device that will offer reliable control of smart home devices, it is horrible. Get a Google home. It losses connectivity randomly, but not with all devices. For example today it lost connectivity with two out of 5 lights in my living room. But then discovered one of them randomly. Only to fail on finding a different one. Then magically it can find them...until whoops it can't. Then, finds them, maybe for several days, then nope. No other parameters have changed in the house, just Alexa, being random. No specific time of day, simply random. So, basically the technology is very unstable and unreliable. I have a Google Home in another house I own, it functions flawlessly (better sound, also). So, if you want a cheap radio device and you can grab an Echo device on sale...this might be okay. If you want a Smart Home controller go with the Google device.

Bleeding Heart,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2023","I opened this last night and I must say, I'm truly disappointed. This device is a glorified speaker at this point, and I was better off keeping my old one. You can't load any apps on it. I had everything and every streaming service on my first one, but I also liked to play music through it while I cooked. The speakers were loud, but not rich. This one has great speakers, but you can't load or play apps even if you sign in through the internet. Tubi is loaded already, but guess what? It just spins and you can't play it. So that means you can only play prime video. I signed into my Netflix account online, and it still doesn't play. The old one had the app and I could tell it to load it up with no problem. I signed into hulu and after a hiccup, it played for about 5 minutes and it stopped and went back to the Screensaver. Please keep in mind I'm trying to play these apps right now as i type this review. So this is a waste of an upgrade. I would NOT recommend.
Updated to say I'm trying to watch a movie on it at my desk(Freevee). One minute into the show and already it has timed out to show an ad TWICE! Which means it completely pauses the show and goes silent. Like imagine your Screensaver on your computer timing out every 30 seconds. This is ridiculous.
Evening update: I turned on the Amazon music podcasts, and it's playing them fine without a hiccup so far.
So Amazon is charging for devices and a monthly service, but has taken away the option for using outside apps, all while running ads on your device. Plus I read that starting next year they're going to start running ads through prime video. Smh...",2.0 out of 5 stars
Rock,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2023","This is my 1st ever Echo Show that I purchased. I was intrigued at the possibilities of having an enhanced version of the Echo Dot with a screen. I was able to snatch one up as it was bundled with a Phillips Hue bulb. I thought that I was going to replace the Dot altogether, but that was not the case. While it has a nice screen to look at, the touch screen is slow and inaccurate. The same thing can be said about the volume rocker. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. You are therefore forced to unplug the device to reset it. I think Amazon should've opted for a better processor to bypass these shortcomings. The device sounds louder than the Dot. There's a button that blocks sound and video recordings as well. However, Alexa is a hit or miss here. Sometimes she'll understand your commands but most of the time she won't which is very frustrating. I am tech savvy and while I have updated the device to its most recent version, it still lags. On top of everything, you are bombarded with more ads visually and sonically. You have access to YouTube via the Silk browser but you can't download apps to the Show which is a shame. You can also watch Prime videos without ads but be warned that come next year, you will have to watch those videos with ads unless you pony up a premium fee to disable them. You can do so many more things with the Show but with its shortcomings, I have lost faith and interest with it. To be honest, the cons on the Show outweigh the pros. The Dot while older, does not display these issues. If I were to choose between the two, I would go for the Dot. The Show is too glitchy for my taste.

Upon initial setup I noticed both showed glitchy and erratic behavior on the screen. It sometimes fades on and off with the clock changing positions up to the corner and I’m assuming this is to protect from screen burn in. Sometimes it fades nicely and other times it jumps abruptly (see video). It also often leaves the time in the corner overlapping the date after it switches (see video and pic).
When I first got them I assumed software updates would fix this obvious glitch, but it still does it after multiple updates.
I feel like this thing is designed more to advertise Amazon items, not to be a user friendly product. I have every option turned off so I only see the time, date, and current temperature, yet it’s constantly cycling to these screens like it doesn’t know what to do.

We already have 2 Alexa devices, so I purchased this to stay in the same ecosystem. However, trying to play music locally on this device in my office, while my wife is also playing Spotify on an Echo in her office is a constant frustration. Sometimes I will take over her Echo with my music, sometimes she will take over mine. Sometimes the same music plays on both. Digging into this issue involves setting up and mapping Alexa/Amazon profiles for everyone in the family which is a confusing experience, and still didn't resolve the issue. The Alexa app on iOS is one of the most confusing apps I have ever used where it is difficult to discern how to play what music on what device (or do anything else).
On top of that, I want it to display photos all day, every day. Apparently this is not possible as it will do a photo slideshow for a while, and eventually revert back to showing news headlines that are not relevant to me. Also, every time anything happens related to Bluetooth or similar, the device cranks the volume to 11 to loudly announce whatever happened (""John Doe's phone has been disconnected"").

Girl Loving Life,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2023","Not sure if Amazon will ""allow"" this review (or filter it out), but I'll try:
I bought some Echo Show devices on sale thinking they would be an enhancement to non-visual echo devices. However, I'm realizing it's a plot for Amazon to get advertising billboards in to your very home.
After setup, they display endless ads. After looking up online, I found users can drill in to the settings to turn off various categories of content in the ""home-screen content"" menu. This reduced the ads to a minimum (save the ""try this"" ads). This was OK, so I kept them.
In recent weeks, Amazon has started a dark-pattern ""war"" on such behavior: They keep adding more and more categories of ""home screen content"" to background updates, and of course they're all enabled. It seems like every week, I see new ads on the screens, and must take the time on each Echo Show product to drill through the menus to to the ""home screen content"" to disable the constant stream of newly added categories to return my Show to showing only what *I* want.
The list of categories on the ""home screen content"" is becoming ridiculously long--somewhere around 30 and constantly increasing. It's very tedious to scroll though this especially on their slow/weak hardware.
So essentially, the Echo Show is actually Amazon's attempt to install advertising billboards in your home, and they're becoming more aggressive in forcing this on those who paid for this product requiring constant time/effort to remove the ads for those ""techie"" enough to know how to do this.
This is likely not what ANYONE signed up for when choosing to purchase these. They may be ""cheap"" and subsidized by Amazon ads, but Amazon should be more upfront about what people will actually see when installing these in their homes. They've already branded their Kindle devices so users can choose ads or no ads, but are trying to be sneaky with their Echo Show devices.
If this goes on for much longer, I'm going to remove these Amazon billboards from my home forever.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Thomas F Gross,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2023","I still stand by my earlier review, but here some additional issues I've found with this item. First, the touch screen is often unresponsive, primarily because it lags. I noticed it initially, but it's really bad. The voice search is also not very accurate, and one big problem, the device will not respond when I'm standing in front of it, but another device in a different part of the house can faintly be heard answering me.... Another one of my big issues is that it nags you by suggesting uses. I've turned off all notifications except weather, but it still wants to nag me over new features (no, I don't want to listen to Travis Kelce's podcast...). The previous models also had issues, but honestly, I was hoping for better this time.
Original Review:
The sale price was too good to pass up. I own the original model, so I thought an upgrade would work better. It doesn't. The screen navigation is terrible. The default settings inundate you with useless suggestions, ads, and nagging commentary. The touch screen has a lag that can make it unusable at times. The sound is fine, except whatever the playback sound level, Alexa wants to shout at you. Then, just for variety, it decides to forget your Wi-Fi password. And when you enter it, it decides you need to prove you really are the person you say you are...so enter your Amazon password.
Still waiting for this to be a labor-saving, stress-reducing IOT.",2.0 out of 5 stars
A Hazy Nebula,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2023","Let's get straight to the pros and cons.
Pros: Good speaker quality, compatible with Blink cameras around my house, drop in feature works great, you can customize the home screen so it doesn't just give you ad after ad, fairly smooth video playback for Prime Video.
CONS: doesn't support streaming services (Hulu, Paramount, Netflix, Crunchyroll, not even YouTube, etc etc), it works with Blink cameras, but the loading is pretty darn slow, the video QUALITY is on par with a smartphone from 2012, at times the video playback hiccups and then won't load at all (then you have to restart the app), the HOME SCREEN is irritable to say the least, yes you can customize what shows and what doesn't, good luck deactivating 40 different useless things that Amazon does to self-promote on their own devices, you can access YouTube from the Echo Show's browser and it works okay.... Until you watch a couple of videos in, it then crashes WITHOUT FAIL.
OVERALL more bad than good, works like an old smartphone without a SIM card. I would suggest something else, but being as cheap as it is, you have to consider outweighing the good vs the bad. Anyone who gives this 5 stars has probably never used a smart tablet in their life and this is possibly one of the most mid-tier entertainment consoles out there. (Oh yeah, and you're supposed to say, ""Alexa screen off,"" and the screen goes black then flashes wildly and stays on..... Forever.)",2.0 out of 5 stars

The Golden Bear,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2023","I have had nothing but difficulty with this product.
It’s quite small, so it sits conveniently on my windowsill, but it doesn’t seem to pick up on my voice commands.
I’ll ask it to “show me the story” and the response is usually “ tell me what kind of story you want to hear.” When I respond naming the story that I wanted to hear, Alexa generally responds with”I don’t know that one.” I am then asked what kind of story I want to hear in a particular category.
I asked for CNN news and was told there was no such category despite having seen a CNN story the day before.
I could go on, but I think the general idea is that this model doesn’t perform satisfactorily.
I like the small size as it doesn’t stand out in my kitchen, but I find that this product is just a big pain in the a$$.
I received a call from Amazon after posting this review. The representative seemed to want to help, but the issues are unabated. In fact, the sound has began to disappear when I am watching a video. The first story may have sound, but the second story has no sound. When I ask Alexa what happened to the sound, the response is usually ""sorry, I don't know that one.""

J. Hannah,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2023","The software for the alarm is buggy. The screen that shows the SNOOZE and STOP buttons doesn’t show up half the time. Tapping the top of the clock will snooze it but doesn’t cancel the alarm. This morning while the alarm was sounding I tried to cancel it but couldn't. The alarm had been sounding for nearly a minute but the screen that shows the STOP button wasn't visible, only the clock. I tapped the clock and the alarm went into Snooze mode. I knew that it went into Snooze and I had no way of cancelling the alarm so I thought I'd unplug the clock and reset. Then I went to take a shower and the freaking clock went off again waking my partner while I was racing to the clock soaking wet with a towel dragging behind me. This has happened more than once. A power off reset only solves the issue for a short time before it does it again. I can’t rely on this thing. Oh, it also needs a way to SKIP an upcoming alarm in case you wake up early want to get on with your day. No way to do that that I know of. Frustrating to say the least.
Edit: I just learned that I can skip an alarm using a voice command but if you're trying to be quiet as a mouse and not wake your partner talking to your alarm clock is not ideal. I just want a skip alarm button on screen when I tap the alarm. Come on Amazon, this is supposed to be a bedside alarm clock. Update the darn software to make it work properly.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Brian Batch,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2024","This is my third Echo Show, having bought--and still owning--the older two models. This third edition has the BUGGIEST software of all the Echo devices, Shows or otherwise. Voice is not recognized for nearly five seconds after the ""Alexa"" command. I often have to repeat (or even reconfigure) Routines that work perfectly on my other Echo devices. If I ask about a specific movie, a list of local theater times is always returned. I cannot control podcasts or music without repeating simple commands (Alexa, stop; Alexa, pause) multiple times, and if I do pause music, and wish to restart the song more than 10 seconds later, the Echo has zero idea what I was listening to, and often returns with ""Sure. What would you like to hear?"" And if I hear, ""Hmm, I'm not sure about that,"" one more time, I'm chucking this device off my balcony.
Besides that, the speakers are great and the screen is bright. But what else can I say? The software is utterly terrible, and, yes, it's running the latest and greatest. So disappointed.

MG,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2023","Got this as a Prime Day deal. They boasted that it was supposed to be super fast as compared to older models, so I decided to get it. I wanted to upgrade the Echo Dot we have in the bedroom because I thought it would be cool to have an Echo with a screen to use as an alarm clock. We have smart lights in the bedroom/several other smart home things that we control using the Echo upstairs. I thought maybe there was a glitch that would improve when we first installed this thing, but it hasn’t gone away.
It’s slow to react, sometimes not hearing you at all. The screen freezes constantly. Sometimes you ask her what do something and she does the most random thing in the world instead of what you asked. It feels like I have to be right next to it for it to hear me, or sometimes I have to shout (causing other Echo devices in the home to hear me instead and turn on lights in other rooms 🤦🏼‍♀️). I’ve tried restarting it multiple times and it doesn’t improve anything. I think it’s hilarious that they claim it’s super fast/faster than other models. We have an older Echo show downstairs and it’s incredibly fast compared to this thing, and never freezes or does weird crap. I wish we would have just bought another older model. I feel bad for poor Alexa, because I spend a lot of time yelling at her because of this thing 😂 if you want my advice, stick with the older models.

Back in 2019 we purchased the 2nd Gen Echo Show and have really liked it in our kitchen. Great for recipes, weather, music, and making video calls. Nice big screen and speaker. Now it's 4 years later and thought it was time for an upgrade. It was Amazon Prime Days a couple days back and so we decided to go from Gen 2 to Gen 5.

It's far too small to replace our Gen 2 Echo Show in our kitchen. No chance you can read recipes on this thing, easily see the weather or read anything at all.

We did not see anything on the product description page or the packaging that said an Amazon account was required. On that point alone, the device was difficult and cumbersome to set up. We also did not expect that the on-screen advertising would be presented in such an obnoxious manner.
On the positive side, the touch screen seems to be really nice and clear, and the sound quality is great. There are only four buttons - power, volume up, volume down, and a slider toggle to turn the camera on and off. The weight is nice. It's easy to plug it in or unplug it, if it needs to be moved. So it would be ideal for our elderly relative.
And one more positive thing - the unboxing was nice - it was easy to remove and unwrap. Other than the device, there was a multi-language instruction manual, another ""important information"" brochure, and the power cord.

Brian,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2023","So I got an Echo Show 5 thinking I would use it by my nightstand. Out of the box, the size is perfect. But Amazon got all the fine details wrong.
First -- I am trying to replace my Alarm Clock and Echo Dot with this device. To meet that goal, it needs to play my sleeping sounds (I use Brown Noise), and it also needs to keep the clock turned on. It also needs to dim itself appropriately at night.
Alas, Echo 5 cannot accomplish any of these goals. The clock is constantly replaced with other cards. And while you can turn off most of the other stuff, it never quite gets to the point of staying on the clock.
Even worse, when you tell it to play ""Brown Noise"", it shows a video card placeholder and thinks you are watching a video instead of listening to background noise. Consequently, the clock NEVER shows unless you ask for it, and only then it shows for a small period of time before reverting back to the Now Playing screen.
The screen itself is too bright in the dark, even on the lowest setting. Google Nest Hub Max does a much better job of handling screen brightness in the dark. This device doesn't cut it. Disappointed and tossed it in closet. Maybe someday I'll find a use for it, but it sure won't be on the nightstand.",2.0 out of 5 stars

This one is just incredibly stupid, you’ll ask a question and she will answer you with something completely different. This one does not hear you as good as the other one, it’s also super buggy. My photo slide show does not work so I disabled it completely, when I play music on this one from Spotify in my phone, the Alexa frequently pauses the song to update the screen to the current song. Basically cutting in and out during the song. The dot Alexa has 0 problems, this one is just bad. Don’t waste your money thinking this is an upgrade.

Tim McGoff,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2023","I’ve probably purchased over 20 echo devices over the years in all different shapes and sizes and generally speaking have enjoyed their utility to price ratio understanding potential privacy issues and certainly not considered a high end product.
Almost in perfect harmony, 3 identical Echo Show 5s I have scattered in the house (1st or second gen) started screen glitching as shown in my video. Being a LARGE consumer on Amazon and also loving their easy return policy the few times I have had to utilize it over the years, I thought I would return these items since they seemed to glitch all at the same time. The process for returning products is to start by going to your Orders list, find the order and request return. However these products were either ordered too long ago or too far down the plethora of items I order to be listed.
Could Amazon purposely glitch out older gen product to force you to upgrade for continued revenue? I’ll be researching the lawsuit catalog for confirmation of the lightbulb that went off in my head last night and start looking for other smart home devices.

They added another skill that wasn't there that I had to go in and deselect. Had I had known this I wouldn't have wasted my money. I have plenty of Google homes and they do not do this.

HouseA,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2024","So I bought this with the intention of incorporating a blink camera system for video monitoring of my house and I was pretty disappointed. I'll list the issues I had, hope it helps y'all.
Latency, latency in everything not just from the video cameras. If you're using Blink cameras and incorporating it with the Echo Show you have to accept some latency or laggy video/audio. From the blink camera to my phone app I was seeing about 2-3 seconds of latency. By the time it reached the Echo show I was nearly 6 seconds behind anything which, for the purposes we were using the cameras, just wasn't going to work. I'm aware it WIFI connectivity can be a factor but these devices were within ten feet of the router and my internet speeds are pretty darn good. I think it's more so just the video being piped through so many servers and applications.
The echo show itself was very slow reacting to anything on the touch screen, sliding down to bring the drop menu was slow, I found myself accidently double taping things or pressing the wrong thing because it was so slow.
Setup. The setup was simple albeit too simple, if you have very little experience with this kind of technology and end up running into an issue during setup like I did then you're going to get frustrated. My issue during setup was the Echo Show showed connected to my WIFI, the Alexa app could see the Show connected, but if I tried to do anything the Echo simply said not connected. In the end I had to do a couple factory resets to get it working.
Some other things that added to my disappointment:
- Couldnt view multiple cameras. having the show bring up 1 camera took a while, also dependent on the camera sources and where it's coming from.
- Getting a photo from amazon photos to display consistently seemed unnecessarily more difficult than it should.
- Customization was a bit of a pain, it wouldn't save some of the settings I picked.
- Smaller than I realized, granted not amazon's fault, just making sure everyone here checks that size because it's tiny.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Alarms are good useful but i wish you can set the media volume separate from the alexa voice volume because maybe the song is too quiet so I put up the volume but the alexa very loud speaking. No ads after you turn off the home content settings (leave on weather and forecast as desired or sports) finally which is 100+++ for me . I am only returning it due to the weird software. This new vega os on the show is low animation refresh rate and the animations and swiping don’t feel fluid.

Catrluv,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2024","I find this device to be very useful. I bought it for my mother who is in a nursing home. She has dementia and is mostly nonverbal now. I think it would be great if amazon added additional features that may be beneficial to caregivers of the elderly. Almost like a senior mode instead of kids mode :)
For instance, this device is not in my home yet uses my amazon account. I have it set up in kids mode so features can't be changed by staff nor can my amazon account itself be accessed to order things. I wish there was another way to ensure the account can't be accessed on the device. I would also love if the device could be used as a digital picture frame. The ads and things that display are of no use to someone like my mother but seeing photos of relatives would make her happy. Additionally, I seem to have issues asking the device to play audio books that are in my account but aren't 'kids' books. There are ways around this by using the Alexa app, but it isn't convenient. I also created a curated playlist for my mother of all her favorite music, but playlists will not work on the device when requested which is strange. She doesn't have much use for other features at this point in her life. I do adore having the ability to drop in on her in the mornings to tell her I love her and to check on how she is doing. I wish I had gotten her one of these devices once covid happened. I would have been an amazing way to be in contact on the daily without relying on nursing home staff to help her use her phone. Her cognition and verbal skills were much better at that time, and I think she would have appreciated being able to see me every day to starve off loneliness especially during a time when I wasn't allowed to visit her every day.

Craig,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024","I mostly like it, but I could love it if they would fix a few things. One problem that would require a physical redesign is that none of the echo shows I own (5, 8, hub) have a wake button. All of the echo dots I own have a wake button. It's very convenient. Not having this button means you always have to use the wake word before your request. That's a problem if you have numerous echos with the same wake word. I use ""amazon"" to wake on this device. If you happen to ask for notifications, when it hears itself say amazon, it pauses and waits for a non-request. It doesn't even know that it's the one talking. 🤔
You can't mute the microphone and have the display off at the same time even though the must button glows red. About half the time you start photo frame it starts on a blank image. If you ask it to turn the screen off during photo frame it will turn it off until the next image is due, then it's back on. You have to go to the home screen first.
Sometimes it won't turn the screen off when you ask. Sometimes it won't come back on when you start a request or touch the screen. In six months I've owned this I've had to reboot it at least 20 times.",3.0 out of 5 stars

The clock rarely shows the actual clock.
Even at the lowest brightness setting and night mode on, it is bright! I had to add 3 layers of window tint to not light up my whole bedroom.
It crashes a LOT. I have to unplug it at least once a week or it will just sit there with a blank screen that flashes every 10 seconds.
It is distracting out of the corner of your eye with it constantly fading, switching to Barbie adverts…
So I bought an Amazon Spot (yes, that’s right the discontinued round one) on eBay for 30 bucks and it is far far superior as a nightstand clock in every way. The show went to the kitchen where it is a better place for it.
7/4/24: I have it in the kitchen. Never when I look at it does it tell me the time. Right now it’s stuck with the time in the corner and blinking the time on full screen. Guess I have to power cycle it. Tempted to use a smart plug so I can “unplug” it instead of reaching for the plug every time.

Shawn Forquer,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2023","I really like the idea of having AI in my home. But I really think they had a better idea than the actual outcome of this venture. Alexa is so buggy it's not funny. She constantly is making mistakes and you'll hear "" I'm sorry but I can't do that."" more often than not. You have to be very detailed in your instructions. Kinda like telling a small child how to do something. You'll be repeating yourself more than necessary. But if you like music and videos she'll not let you down. She is very good at finding songs and videos in a snap. But if you have a light and you set it to living room and you tell her to reduce the lighting by say 30% in the living room, she gets confused if you tell her to reduce lighting in living room. You just have to say Alexa reduce lighting by 30%. I can see this being a problem if you have more than one smart bulbs in action. Idk maybe I'm just a rookie trying to get used to this... But if I'm having this many problems being a rookie. Then maybe they need to do something with the user interface. Maybe I just expect to much from Alexa. The routines are amazing but they are carved in stone. If you set it up to wake you up at three a.m. then she'll do just that... The same volume the same interactions day after day... Yeah it gets kinda old. Unless you go in and physically change the settings. I am just saying that they could've throwed a little variation in there maybe. For being an AI she's kinda boring. I'll repost an update after I figure out how to properly use her. Hopefully it's a learning thing and Alexa and I will grow together and she'll turn out to be the best investment I've ever made. There are so many more features that she's set up to handle. But I'm not rich so it'll take a lil while to aquire all the extras she equipped to manage. Good luck and I hope that everyone got something from this review. P.S. you'll have to figure out another name to call her when you want to talk about her.

I saw this Echo Show on sale and made the purchase, excited to get a device with a screen and video capability. After receiving this and setting it up, I left most of the standard display options the way it came. The screen flashes frequent suggestions and ALL I want is a clock - constant clock. After changing the display settings to have the background I wanted (wood) and the clock face (large digital) it looked nice. Soon after, the settings I made just went away, and this thing was showing a blue screen with digital clock, not what I selected. I tried to go in and change it to what I want, but it never took and insisted to still be a blue screen.
I reset the device and unplugged it for an hour. I plugged it in and started over. This time I went into the display settings and turned off ALL the suggestion topics so nothing gets displayed besides the clock. Then I chose the wood background and the large digital clock. This has worked, HOWEVER the stupid thing will randomly display the wrong time being off by 6 hours. I have it located on the fireplace under my TV and we will see the time change from correct time, to 6 hours off, then back to correct time.
I do not like paying for the device and getting glitches where it changes display settings and can not keep correct time. This is 2024, how hard is it to make a clock??? With all the technology in this device, it can not keep correct time constantly. Help would be appreciated, or send me another device and I will return this Glitchy one that I don't want.

Gabriel G-konig,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2023","I wanted this device for two simple tasks: an alarm clock and control a lightbulb in my bedside. I wanted a device that showed the time in big letters all the time, dimmed the screen enough at night to be able to read it but not illuminate the room, be able to turn off the lights before going to sleep without having to move and turning the light early on weekdays to wake me up. Sounds simple right?
First you have to get rid of all the rotating information that is displayed on the screen. IF you don't do that, you never get to see the home screen, only ads and suggestions.I just wanted the clock all the time.
But every time I ask the device to turn the bulb off, instead of going back to the home screen with the clock I want to be able to see at night, it shows the brightness settings for the bulb and keeps the screen there. I have to tell it to go back to home screen.
The screen gets dim by itself at night but it does not go back to full brightness during the day. Every time I manually adjust the brightness (which has to be done every morning), I lose my custom face clock and it goes back to showing me a tiny clock in the corner and the weather. I am terrified of asking this device to show me anything because the home screen settings, the clock I want, is changed every time I interact with it and I have to set it back again.",3.0 out of 5 stars

When it does work it’s very helpful. You can view cameras, view currently playing media, control smart devices with a couple taps, or see timers and weather forecasts. There are many other advantages of having a screen on your Alexa device that this Echo Show 5 offers at a budget friendly price and compact design for smaller tables or areas. However. This device has been super glitchy since setting it up. Most common issue is that volume buttons do not respond. There have been a plethora of other issues, some of which include a blank blue screen appearing instead of the Home Screen, displaying wrong media or showing no media playing when I am indeed playing media through the device, or video not loading when trying to view the onboard camera on the Alexa App. Additionally the interface can feel a bit laggy and slow. The native YouTube app is not very useful due to frequent buffering.

It SHOULD be awesome. It's not. It's a clock home screen overlayed on a another clock home screen that then glitches to reset itself. It USED to keep our timers visible. Now it glitches itself back to the double screen look.
Maybe it's because I disabled all the extras? Is this my penalty for not allowing Alexa to advertise consistently? Hard and soft resets did nothing. And multiple devices do the same thing.
Either way, until there's some effort (money) put into the software development (unlikely since Alexa keeps losing Amazon's money) it's probably going to be more of a disappointing than fulfilling experience.",3.0 out of 5 stars
VTRod,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2023","UPDATE: Waiting for 24 hours, indeed and surprisingly did resolve the issue. I’ll change my rating to three stars. Primarily bc the unit is defaulted to display as sorts of streaming materials. Each take 10-15 seconds to evidently disappear/clear or move on. Setting what you do and do want to change as defaults, including the screen presentation, I found unintuitive. The basic vocal activation function is fine. Sound is great. As a simple display and answering your questions you’ll find it just fine. For the $49 price(promotion) it was a n excellent value to get to the latest generation. I’d recommend it.
This device, will not connect to wi-fi because of a known software issue. AMZ tech support said that many have this issue. The advice I received was to unplug it and wait 24hrs and the problem will be assuredly fixed. Honestly, I doubt that a magic 24 hour wait period will do anything.....this problem has been around for weeks if not months, so I don't see it being resolved in the 24 hours from my call. How can the AMZ ""fix"" be pushed to devices that can not or will not connect - Alex app shows it as ""off-line"", despite, what I believe is a good solid wi-fi connection (though, it doesn't show -- sorry for the pun).

It's hit or miss, if I enunciate clearly it will get what I am asking for. But I have 5 other Echos and none have this issue. I have had Echos since the first one came out and this one is the worst at understanding things. The other thing I don't like, and I admittedly have not plumbed the depths, but out of the box my Google Hub Mini puts up useful information on the screen. Often this show shows nothing, or maybe the clock, or suggestions for what it can do. I wish there was more apparently control over what appears on the screen when you are not talking to it.
In the good side of things, the music fidelity is pretty decent. It replaced an Echo Dot (the plain cylinder style) that sounded good and this Echo Show 5 does have a really decent sound for a small-ish box. So props for that.

Well enter the Show. I waited a while to get one because I didn’t need another device, but then it was so cheap I figured - why not? Now I know. While I do love Alexa (on a good day if we’re honest), I really don’t think Amazon has done a seemingly swell job with the display market. It is EXTREMELY SLOW AND UNRESPONSIVE 95% OF THE TIME. If this fact does not disturb you, cause you any unrest or intense anxiety - by all means…make this purchase. If you have time to let it breathe and think through every screen click, button press and voice command - buy it!

They have left a lot to be desired. They kind of just do whatever they want. It’s hard to set up, for instance picking what you want to show on your Home Screen, and then once you pick your settings, the Echo just randomly changes them. My Home Screen will randomly change pictures and clocks every so often; Echo adds stuff to my Home Screen randomly and I’ll try to hide it, but it continues to stay on my screen; I had one echo on a speaker group, but it wasn’t working—my phone said it needed an update, but it makes you update on the physical Echo (not from the Alexa App). I tried on the Echo, said it was put to date….so I had to factory reset the Echo Show to fix the problem.

In addition, if she's in Recipe Keeper, she can't do anything else. It won't perform any other actions other than the app - even a timer, which is not convenient when cooking. You have to exit the app, then start a timer, when go back into Recipe Keeper ... and ask it to find your recipe again.

When left on over night the unit sometimes will freeze and you have to unplug and restart, that fixes that problem till the next night. When programming to show a clock, its difficult to get the one you want to save properly, sometimes it will and sometimes it reverts to an unknown display, very confusing. It will also occasionally hang up on a certain screen in clock mode, swiping left will clear it. I find the sound very good, picture quality is good, not excellent, but acceptable.

The screen size may be the size of (or a little smaller than) an iPhone plus turned sideways. From a little distance, it can be a real squinter in regards to reading any text.

Shay,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2023","The absolute gall Amazon had to release an Echo Show with LESS features than its predecessor is absolutely crazy to me. And they charge the price they do? I wish I hadn’t wasted my money. The ONLY things this comes with is Prime Video, Tubi (who uses that?) and YouTube in browser. It’s slow to respond to touches and has quite a bit more delay than I expected. But I shouldn’t be surprised for its price point so I let that part slide. Echo show 2021 had Netflix, Hulu, and Prime? And this version only has ONE? I feel so ripped off. Especially when they advertised only Netflix was not available. That left me assuming it would be fine and they had more streaming serves to make up for that.
The “A” in Amazon stands for AUDACITY. Hope they can fix this with an update otherwise I don’t see myself keeping it. What a let down for all the hype. Just an expensive photo album and clock now. I do use it for podcasts though so maybe I’ll get SOME use of something that tech people were hyping this up about. Lesson learned: Amazon has something great then ruins it. First lesson should have been learned when they quit the original line of Kindle Fire’s and then switched to the cheap, clunky, and slow budget Fire tables.

It is the same sometimes when saying ""Alexa"". Takes this one a few seconds more than the dot to realize that a request has been made. There is also no button to manually start a request like there is on the dot. I also am not a fan of the slide down menu option, mostly because of the screen responsiveness issue. I also hate that I bought a black echo and it came with a white cord. This version doesn't have the 3.5mm headphone jack like the dot which I used quite a bit.

However, this one often times in the middle of a response to a question will stop suddenly and other times I may make a query it will light up and then stop without responding, I’m thinking about sending it back as I’m pretty sure it’s just a quality control issue because none of my other echoes behaves this way",3.0 out of 5 stars
Jen Lynn,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2023","Honestly the use and setup as far as reaching it's functions is just not great. Quickly accessing things can not happen on this thing. It is really built for voice activation. In my house we work all different hours and voice isn't always the best option for us as well as all the other Alexa tech in the house trying to react to your voice at the same time.
The most aggravating part of it all was the camera option. So after hours of going over the settings and over them and over them again I wanted to throw this thing. The ring app has a place where you can setup being able to see this camera in it on your phone as well. It goes through setup then doesn't work. It has trouble shooting so you do all that. More settings... In the end I finally do some research online and find a feed on Reddit. It can't actually do it. So it has this whole process and when you get to the discovering part it can't find it. Amazon replies saying this isn't an actual function. Whaaa? Hours I spent messing with this thing. Wow and weird. So why does it have this setup for a show camera? I saw people thought they had to pay for the security package on ring to get the function, which was not the case. It's so misleading.
In the end I find this thing only slightly useful and think it's pretty over priced for the little it can actually do.",3.0 out of 5 stars
stacie,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2023","I absolutely love this! I’m so happy I bought it.. it’s very useful and amazing. Alexa adds stuff to my shopping list, tells me jokes, listens perfectly. I love that you can put custom photos. It was super easy to set up. You can set it up on your phone and it immediately connects and logs in.. the speakers are absolutely fantastic. Super loud super clear I think it’s honestly better than a regular speaker. It’s so super worth it in my opinion. It’s smaller than I expected but I still love it.. I personally think the camera was a perfect option. Now I can watch everything that goes on in my house just by opening the camera and using the app I think this is 100% worth the money.
EDIT: now that I have owned it for a couple weeks.. I’m not a big fan of it tbh.. it doesn’t listen correctly. I’d ask Alexa to do something like home after using an app and it doesn’t respond it turns Alexa off and stays on the same screen.. I mean it’s a great product for music, lists, and alarms but I’d just recommend sticking to your phone alarms and reminders lists and just buying a cheap speaker. It doesn’t get the weather correctly. Sometimes it’ll be down pouring and Alexa will say it’s sunny.. the one thing I do enjoy is that it has a camera and when i go away I can watch my animals on the camera.. other than that I don’t think it’s worth the money.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Since I could only put one video, I took a snapshot of one of my older echo’s transitioning to the camera view so that you could see it’s the same software yet it works fine on the older Gen Echo!. The reason I like that camera view is because unlike Ring (which does work), Wansview can stay onscreen for many hours!

Dean Buzzell,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2023","I purchased the original Echo Show 5, and like it a LOT as a bedroom clock. Until, that is, the screen started ""glitching"" after an Amazon software update. Of course, by the time Amazon managed to wreck the Echo Show 5 Gen 1 it was WAY out of warranty, so I literally had no way to get Amazon to fix their mistakes. To their credit, Amazon was offering pretty reasonable rebates for trade-ins, and I took advantage of the $20 rebate for the Echo Show 5 and the $30 rebate for the Echo Dot (with video screen) to mostly pay for the new Echo Show 5 3rd Gen. This newer offering for the Echo Show 5 has a smaller footprint with a much better sound, and (so far) no screen glitching. Sadly, though, the stand (which I paid extra for) for the Gen 1 Echo Show 5 doesn't fit the Echo Show 5 3rd Gen, so I'll be forced to pay extra for that. Shame on you, Amazon! While I totally get that hardware/software improvements are inevitable, you need to do a better job of compensating those who went all-in to purchase the add-ins for your devices that are now simply junk.
So….yeah - the Echo Show 5 Gen 3 works superbly. Just as the Echo Show 5 Gen 1 did, until Amazon wrecked it beyond redemption with their updates that no one knows are coming, and no one can refuse. Be assured your purchase of the Echo Show 5 Gen 3 will work up to and beyond your expectations, until Amazon decides they want you to purchase their NEXT device version, and they trash this device to incent you to buy the next version.
I’ve been a software developer most of my professional life. I well know the pain of the user base when they learn that software updates are going to leave them behind, and their often justified outrage that their significant monetary outlays (and c’mon - when it’s YOUR money it’s a significant outlay, right?) have just gone into the dumpster. As a professional developer with a large customer base, I made it my JOB to know my customers, and inform and prepare my customers what was coming down the pike that would impact them, and EARNESTLY work with them to ease a substantial hardware update. I’m not kidding nor am I “making this up” - when you’re upfront with the customer, and tell them truthfully that industry changes are forcing you down a path that might leave them behind, and you offer viable options for the customer to make their OWN decisions, then you have done a real service to the customer.
Amazon doesn’t follow this model. They literally don’t care a whit for how these changes impact their customer base. To Amazon, apparently, it’s as easy as “you either pay money to upgrade to our latest device or not. We literally don’t care what negative impact our latest choices have on you, little Amazon Echo subscriber. Either pay up to be on board, or be left behind with the dregs.”
Yah. Amazon IS the consummate “Eff You, paltry customer” when it comes to their Echo devices. This is a FAR cry from when Amazon was nothing more than a book seller. Now they feel confident in screwing hundreds of thousands of customers with their short-sighted hardware failures, and forcing their customers to foot the bill for their shortsighted business failures.

Only a couple weeks after giving it to my daughter for Christmas, it stopped working all together. The screen wouldn’t turn on, it would answer to its name, and wouldn’t hook to the network to allow the app to help. I tried all the troubleshooting tips given by Amazon and nothing worked. I wasn’t given an option to return or exchange it in my Amazon account so I used the customer service chat feature. I was refunded the money but not given the option to just exchange it. I bought it during the Black Friday sale. I don’t just want my money back, I want my daughter to get the present I gave her in working form without having to pay double for it!
I hope everyone else had better luck with this product or that Amazon improves its exchange policies.
UPDATE: I spoke with a very helpful customer service rep and she facilitated an exchange quickly and easily. She also said the key is when the app pushes using the chat feature, to keep scrolling down to a smaller option to request a phone call instead.

I'ts still a bit slow going from screen to screen when something is selected, scrolling lags - but now at least when I select something it persists and the settings actually CHANGE to what I indicate I want them to be. I had been regretting the purchase and was resigned to just living with it for what basics it could do well enough since life at the time of purchase didn't give me opportunity to return it within the window.

Lola's Pad,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2024","Really enjoying Echo Show. Just got the small screen to try out the device, so I knew going into it that the screen would be small, but it's actually perfect to tuck into a corner so it's not a large presence. I can throw on a show when all of the other devices are in use. The sound quality is good and can fill the room, so we've been also using it to play music as well. This is where Alexa comes in. Love being able to talk to Alexa while cooking or working and not having to put down what I'm doing to play something else, turn down the volume or pause. Great feature.
What do I not like? Wish it had a battery similar to the Echo Pop so I could move it around without having to wait for it to power back on. But guessing that would add to size and price, so I can live with it as it is. Small detail, but really don't like that they provided a white cable on a black device. I purposefully buy device colors to match the room. The counter it's sitting on is black. The surrounding appliances are black (with black cables). This white cable sticks out horribly. Guess they wanted to save money manufacturing 1 cable putting it onto the customer to have to buy a cable cover.

Frequent Shopper,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2023","Pros, great picture. Can shut off the camera which is nice, has parental controls I haven’t used, kids are older. Amazon has improved the linking between Apple Music which is nice. iRobot feature was useless. (iRobots also super sick but I cannot update my review on that. Smart gimmick, people can review for the couple months the thing works correctly then they change the app & start screwing it up & you can’t update.)
Cons for the Show 8 are to turn off the screen by saying “turn off screen” you cannot then mute it which is a disturbing privacy issue for me.
Most of the cons are because of the ring doorbell. The only way to stop getting audio alerts is to turn down the volume or turn off alerts from the ring app. But then you get no visual alerts. Also when the audio alert comes through it completely turns off the music so you have to tell it to “continue playing music”. When the ring doorbell is motion activated it gives you a few seconds to look to see who is there before it turns off.
Sometimes it will continue to play the music but you will completely lose the screen so you cannot skip a song. You can set the Home Screen but it doesn’t stay on what you set it at as a default of goes back to the preset screen.
Picture feature is nice but seems you need a subscription to Amazon photos & I don’t use Amazon photos.

Enough Already,"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2023","So I've had this since July. It's quite useful, but if you were expecting this touchscreen device experience to match the consistency or reliability of, say, your iOS or Android smartphone, think again. The software that runs these things likes to do random inexplicable stuff you didn't ask for, like the photo slideshow mine just started doing despite nobody asking it for anything and no routines running that would cause this. At other times, it show the ugly clock with the big blue numbers (really, can't we have something less cheesy and '80s-esque, Amazon?) instead of switching to the much more pleasant red / night mode version which you might have configured for yourself.
Also I need to unplug and plug it back in every few weeks because it starts doing random things like displaying a white screen. It is just unreliable and inconsistent. You don't notice this kind of goofiness with the audio-only Echo devices so this is really a let-down, that their software is so un-polished for the Show devices—or at least for this one.
The hardware seems pretty good, however. But they really need to get their software to be more consistent and the UI to be iess cheaply designed and use better typefaces. But you might still find it useful. The small size means you can cram it into a small corner somewhere.
But prepare for weirdness with the software and having to baby this thing along in ways you aren't used to with other devices.
UPDATE June 9, 2024: This has engaged in much less unreliable weirdness the last few months, but I haven't paid attention to any updates it received. So it's less janky now. Still needs more UI polish to keep up with what people are used to on their phones, but otherwise—I don't hate it now. So that's progress.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Overall, I’m happy I got it. The camera feature is nice but very poor guality. The sound is pretty good for what it is. Connecting devices was pretty straightforward and worked just fine.

Space Ghost....,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2023","The short answer is this is a very good device, and I would recommend it. So why 4 stars? Well, I am basing this on the 1st GEN of the Show 5 and just Alexia issues in general. I will list the cons first and then get to the positive. The 1st GEN and 2nd GEN are basically the same almost no difference from what I understand.
- My overall biggest issue and this is all Alexia devices, she just does not listen. Basically she is temperamental! She thinks you say something other than what you said or just makes suggestions for no reason. When you ask her to stop it is not fast at all. AMAZON FIX THIS!!!!!!! This is sort of like a partner or friend that is upset and will not stop talking. Yes, you know what I am talking about….lol
- The software OR firmware needs to be updated or improved. Amazon absolutely needs to have a enable or disable all for all the screen options. For example, most people turn off nearly all the options in the Home and Clock area; there are a ton, and you need to do one-by-one.
- When making changes, there is a delay. Took nearly 3 or 4 min for the clock interface to change. Should be immediate and then if I don't like to allow me to go back. Instead, I make a change and I thought was broken because nothing happens; tried 5 times After a few min it finally switched.
- Improved, however, there is still a big delay the touch screen.
- Amazon really needs give you the options to have her stop telling asking you if you want to buy amazon music if you ask to listen to a particular artist. It will play it but first tells asks if you want to buy music for X $ a month.
THE POSITIVES:
+ The Sound is greatly improved except for her voice itself. If listening to music, you 100% do get better sound from the previous version. Main reason I got it.
+ The screen size is the same, but the body is a smaller footprint.
+ It is no longer rectangular, but more of a curved design so just looks nicer.
+ As I mentioned earlier, the touch screen is better but still not great. However, it is a little faster and not worse so I guess a win.
Overall it boils down to this….. if you have a 1st or 2nd gen and you are happy with the audio then skip it not necessary. However, if you want better sound for music then I say it’s worth it. If you do not have any Show device the 5 is a nice choice especially if using on a nightstand.",4.0 out of 5 stars
LinckG,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023","In the pics, 1st Gen is on the left, with a black cord, and 3rd Gen is on the right with a white cord. I was not planning to replacement the device as they are rather expensive. However, it went on sale and I got a trade in that brought the final price down to 20 bucks. The reason I went with that deal is this particular Gen 1 was not as responsive to voice as I expect it to be. I had to repeat myself often, particularly when there is ambient noise. I don't know if it's the Gen 1 in general, or just this unit. Never the less, there it is. The Gen 3 is MUCH better at responding. I can even turn on my 3d printer exhaust fan, face 90°, and the new Echo will respond immediately. It fixed my one and only problem with the Gen 1 I had. The units are close in dimensions. I did have to shove the old unit into the new unit's box to send it back. Width was almost the same, but height made it harder to close the box. By itself on my desk, I don't notice a difference. The screen is very slightly larger than the old unit. The new unit does not have an audio jack, or microUSB port on the back, only power. Setting up the Gen 3, it told me I can use the camera to automatically execute routines when a person is in view which I was not aware of as being an option on the Gen 1. Sound is better on Gen 3. I adjusted the equalizer a bit, and it is acceptable. It was not great out of the box, but when turned up the bass a bit and bumped the treble down it improved. The buttons are further back on the Gen 3, but easy to feel which one you are on by their raised design. The one button neither has that I would have liked is the button on the Dot that activates the unit without saying the wake work. The thing is arms length away. I don't need to always say the wake word.
Is it worth the upgrade? That depends on if your Gen 1 has the same responsiveness issues mine had, or another issue. Otherwise, not really. The Gen 1 worked fine for the years that I had it other than having to repeat myself sometimes. If it had been more responsive, I would not have bothered to replace it.",4.0 out of 5 stars

We have watched local network news TV broadcasts and could watch movies just by telling it what to play if you want to on the tiny screen. I'm pretty sure we have barely started investigating what it can do. It's nice that with the camera in it I can see who or what is going on in the kitchen from my phone Alexa. My only problem seems to be that there is a little voice recognition issue where if I don't ask for the radio station clearly enough it will get confused and play a similar call letter but different station, and sometimes it takes a few tries before it shows the clock.

We also have our Ring doorbell connect though this device and it gives us a verbal warning when the ring is activated. The speaker in this is nice and sound good playing music through it.,4.0 out of 5 stars

CTA,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2024","This is the worst implementation of an alarm clock I've ever seen. It's impossible to cancel a snooze without talking to the device. It's 5 AM, I don't want to talk to a clock and wake my wife up. In my previous Echo Show 5 I could touch the snooze time in the upper right and cancel it before it went off again. That functionality is no longer there in the Gen 3. I have to tell Alexa to cancel the alarm, which requires me to answer another stupid question about canceling ALL of the future alarms too. Asking her to cancel the snooze doesn't work. If you are buying this as an alarm clock and want to use the snooze function, I'd buy something else.
EDIT from 1 to 4 stars. 1/18/2024 After fighting this thing since Christmas, they finally put out an update that brought the cancel button back on the screen so you don't have to talk to cancel a snoozed alarm. Yay! I'm happy with it now, al though it does still run a bit slow. I wish they put faster CPUs in these Echo Shows.",4.0 out of 5 stars

JackL,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2024","EDIT: originally gave 2 star because my show would not go into night mode unless I unplugged and plugged it back in every night.

Maybe those will be fixed with future updates.
I bought this 3rd gen model to replace the gen 1 version I've had for years. I use this as a bedside clock and the gen 1 version worked great. The 3rd gen version does not go into night mode unless I hard reboot it every night (sometimes that doesn’t even work). The 3rd gen mics seem to be better but the gen 1 version was better in everything else including software speed and even sound.

Josh,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2024","So far I am liking it, great sound, good screen reaponse, upgraded from a echo dot 4, this caught my eye because it was on deal with a Ring Door Camera, screen could be bigger but I guess thats what the number is after Echo Show (*) .. Prime video shows great on it, since I really havent mess with it I would like to see if you can add the YouTube App..
Cons… Amazon maybe this is a feature you can add or a Upgrade, it would be nice if the screen itself could automatically shutoff other than just Dimming down after a few minutes, sometimes I come back in the room and the screen is on and stays on til you tell Alexa to turn it off.. another is when your going through the settings it would somehow automatically take you back to the home screen for no reason when you’re changing settings then you have to locate where you left off or should I say where Alexa forced you to go back.. these I found annoying and only left 4 stars.. also Im not too sure if or how you can add Apps especially to watch something like Disney or Youtube and not through the browser..",4.0 out of 5 stars
PoRaven,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2023",After a lot of time on the phone with various Amazon employees I am happy to say that I am now able to do everything I had hoped for when I bought the device. If you read my previous review you know that I was very frustrated with how difficult it was to get basic things to work. I believe that it was mostly my fault but I wasn't getting a whole lot of help from the instructions until I literally stumbled into the right set of instructions hidden behind arrows to the side of a clue phrase. I must have entered my username and password 40 or 50 times along with frequently having to get a text or email with a third step authentication. Only time will tell if the effort pit into this device will be worth it. It is an ingenious device and a lot of what you will need to get it the way you want it is there; it just takes a few tries and a lot of patience to find the right help.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Alex,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024","I already have an Echo Dot 4th gen and I wanted to purchase the Echo show since it was on offer on Black Friday and to have an upgrade from my Wake up clock/Radio. For that specific function works perfectly, the volume is good to wake up with being startled, the routines can provide useful information and the screen is very good.
I have issues with the voice recognition, If I do not see it directly and project my voice to the screen is not being registered. I have it running over a month and the situation is not improving. I have contacted costumer service and the solutions are not working and the issue persist.
Also some skills work better in the Echo dot than the Echo show. They load faster and in the Show they are stuck on a loop or not loading and in the Dot they start and play without a hitch.

Meg,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2024","Edit: after leaving this review my echo updated and there’s a little clock at the top of the sleep sounds screen!!
I regret buying this. If you try to use it as a sound machine and clock, it is impossible to make it stay on the clock face. I try to tell it to go back to the clock screen and it will for a few minutes, but then it goes back to the “sleep sounds” screen. So if you wake up in the middle of the night and want to check the time, you have to manually put it back to the clock screen (which usually wakes me up more and makes it harder to fall back to sleep). Would not recommend if using for these features.",4.0 out of 5 stars
TheActualPT,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2023","First, let me say the sound quality on this device is excellent. I used to have an Echo Spot and I traded that one in for this one. When I first got the Spot, I thought that sounded rich, but this Show 5 is noticeably better than the Spot! It has great bass and sounds very good in basically every aspect.
My only complaint is that this is LOUD. I have it next to my bed and volume 2 is essentially the same volume as an in-person conversation. Volume 1 is the same thing as muting it. I truly, truly wish there were a wider spectrum so you could get an actual low volume. I often used to play my Spot on volume 3 and sometimes a 2, set a timer, and fall asleep to that. The volume 2 (the lowest I can go) on the Show 5 is equivalent to about a 4 on my old Spot. It sounds minor, but it makes a huge difference.",4.0 out of 5 stars

You can schedule routines like on Tuesday nights a reminder to take out the garbage, or to give your pet, an insulin shot, etc. I really have enjoyed the pictures and various information that you can learn from Alexa. I really like the fact that I can drop in on him we can see each other and even talk to each other through the Alexa. I was a bit skeptical about the quality of the mini blink, but it also exceeded my expectations especially with it being so reasonably priced.

K.L.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2023","I purchased this echo show 5 in July, and did not open it until two days ago. I previously owned the first generation echo show and had minor issues, but nothing like the problems I am having now with this device. I use this device as my bedroom alarm clock however, when I tried setting the clock to fully display, including the weather and date, as well as a different background, outside of the factory default, the system displays the time at the left-hand corner with the factory default background. The device also flickers on and off and when I turn the lights off, the the system goes dark and I can’t see the time. I have unplugged it several times as well as did a factory reset multiple times with no improvements. Because I am outside of my 30 day return window, I will have to get my credit card company to assist with this faulty device.

Jacob,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2023","The addition of 2x the bass and clearer sound is a significant improvement over previous models. The audio quality is noticeably better, making it a more enjoyable device for listening to music, watching videos, or even using it as a speaker for calls. The Charcoal color variant also adds a sleek and modern touch to its design.
However, where I encountered some disappointment is in the touch screen interaction. In today's tech landscape, touch screens are expected to deliver smooth and flawless high-quality interactions, much like our smartphones. Unfortunately, the Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) falls short in this aspect. When interacting with the screen, I found it to be somewhat laggy and less responsive than I had hoped for.
This laggy performance has forced me to primarily use the device as a voice-only interaction tool, rather than utilizing its touch navigation capabilities. This limitation is somewhat frustrating, especially when the device is sitting on my desk, seemingly ready for convenient touch interactions.
Despite this setback, the Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) is still a great product with a lot of potential. The improvements in audio quality are appreciated, and it remains a valuable addition to my smart home setup. However, I hope that future updates can address the touch screen responsiveness issues, making it a more versatile and user-friendly smart display.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Cool Breeze,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2023","This is truly an amazing product! I actually give it 4.5 Stars however, it just seems slow and unresponsive at times. It seems like it needs more memory to make it faster and responsive. Otherwise it's cool to have. I love the camera features and you can use similar devices to talk to your family and friends and viewing them just like in The Jetsons! It also acts like a security camera and you can use this to talk and check up on your pups or cats or other pets at home. You can also use this to check on the elderly from your workplace. You can even talk to them and see their actions. The best part is that this will tell you when you are being watched and you also have a privacy switch to turn the camera completely off! The sound is very nice and bassy unlike my echo dots that I have at home. I just wish that it had more memory so that it could be more responsive and I could give this five stars. Perhaps the next generation will make that happen! Still a great deal especially on Black Friday or the Amazon sales that they have in July. Get this and stay in touch.

Fairbairn's,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2023","Purchased this to replace a bedside Wi-Fi clock radio with weather display. I was able to set up the home screen and screensaver to show the information I wanted. The amount of advertising they force on you by default is a bit annoying, but can be turned down in settings. The display quality is adequate for most things you would need a small format device like this for. It does occasional false activate when nobody has actually said ALEXA. It is kind of neat to be able to make an ALEXA call to my relatives while sitting in bed. Also enjoy using Kindle Assistive Reader to have it read aloud whatever kindle book I am currently reading. So far it has performed about as expected. I DID have to disable the auto-dimming, as it would either stay dim when the lights were on and be unviewable, or it would dim so much in low light as to be unviewable. I would think a company like Amazon could have at least gotten that part right, as my 8 year old alarm clock did this just fine.

The agent who contacted me (Stephanie) after leaving my review was very professional and helpful. I wish I could have just spoken to her in the first place.

The first one worked great for about 2 months. One day it just started rebooting non-stop. Amazon promptly replaced it under warranty, but the new one does not work out of the box. This one just infinitely says ""Device is updating"", but remains at 0%. I spent nearly an hour on the phone with Amazon support.

MichaelS,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2023","Update: 6/11/23 Amazon has changed the nighttime clock to a nice Red against a black background. Yay!!
I have the new 2023 Echo Show 5. I set it up to use Night Mode. But I don’t recall being able to pick a clock face for that. It’s sort of goofy looking and don’t know if this just what the Echo only uses or there are other choices. I’ve attached two pics. The Normal one I did choose with the wood grain background and the nighttime one. Also it’s clear to me how that one started and what let it end and go back to the normal one.
I found the sound to be good. Maybe not as good as the Gen4 Dot w/Clock. But very close. Increasing the midrange and the treble, about 20% on the on-screen equalizer, would probably be helpful. Bass is the same as Gen4 Dot. I also have the Gen5 Dot, but it's in another room, so I didn't take the time to compare the sound with that. Most likely, the new Show5 would be close as well, with some upward tweaks on the sound settings. I really didn't buy these for great sound machines.
Lastly, returning to that Clock concern, The screen also dims down automatically. but because the numbers are blue, can't see it very well. It's almost like they made the most important parts of the number more solid colored, versus transparent, so it would not have to be as bright. I do wish it was white (like the Dot w/Clock I replace this with. Or green. I tried turning off the night mode, but the brightness has to be controlled directly on the screen of the Show. There are no Routine commands to change the brightness that I could find.
All in all, I like it because of the information, that I can see on the screen during the day. I turned off all of the annoying rotational info, except weather alerts and the weather. I plan on keeping it.",4.0 out of 5 stars

C fox Wallace,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2023","My dwelling is a mobile home. I've found when I'm in the back room I can't hear anything from the other side. I've missed more than a few people who told me they stopped and knocked. Though my German Shepherd Dog has very good senses she hasn't the experience to tell what's important. I was going to get a door bell, but I jumped into modern tech. Purchased a Security camera for the front. And I'm amazed at what the tiny camera can do.
It's only 2""x 2""x 2"" cube and came with everything to mount.
Besides 1080 p day vision it has IR Night vision in color. Above the lens is a fairly bright led spot light, and it also has a mic and speaker for two way communication. Oh, and it also has a siren.
Cost was originally 40.00 for the Wyze Camera OG, marked down to 19.00 and I got a gift card for Amazon for 10. After tax it cost 10 dollars. But wait it gets better... The manufacturer has a functional service web site, for 19 bucks you get their full service with an AI which identifies packages, people, or pets. It's linked also to Alexa so if I'm out back she announces the 'event' and who is at the door. If I'm not home a push notification is sent to me , and I can view live stream or review the recording of who is at my place. Yea, another reason for the communication mic is that it not only looks but also listens. Sound or Visual will trigger the camera to record, and it's all kept in the Wyze cloud which doesn't cap your data. So if I'm feeling lazy I can call out to Alexa and tell her to show me the front porch and she can put it on my Echo show which will be here tomorrow. You don't have to have all this, because the camera also takes a memory card if you want.
I bought an Amazon Echo dot 1st gen about 3 years ago. It's still running. She tells jokes, News, Weather, and any song I could possibly want to hear. The Echo show has a screen good color rich sound with deep base, about the size of a cell phone. It can also set alarms for you. Just shout out to Alexa . And consider I'm only using the low end stuff. They have appliances, HVAC, and all your lighting can be managed as well The show I got for 39. That brings this whole affair to 69.00 and add in the Wyze service for 19 a year. So for 88.00 I got a security system , severe weather watch, A stereo with Thousands of songs, podcast and audible book player, and if you get bored Alexa likes to play games too.
You can't put a price on peace of mind, but I got a deal.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Rehtak,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2024","I got this as a way to replace my alarm clock and light switch, and for very little else. You’d think that would be simple enough. I want to see the time displayed all the time, but 70% of the time the screen shows something else. The Home Screen often errors, showing double screens, or trying to show other pages even though I’ve turned all of them off. When you ask Alexa to stop showing things or why something isn’t working she just prompts you to open the app or change the settings, which is deeply unhelpful. Not to mention I have everything configured as much as it can be. Probably one of the stupidest things I’ve purchased. Would not recommend.",1.0 out of 5 stars

🤓,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2024","Even though the Echo Show has settings to stop ads, you still get ads if you turn the ad option off, you get a message that says you will still get ads. They just won’t be tailored to your interests.
The one thing most of us get the Show for is as an alarm clock to display in the bedroom. The problem is that it is displaying ads MOST OF THE TIME. So, you rarely see the time. This makes using this device a real frustration. If I knew this when I first purchased, I never would have gotten one of these intrusive things.
