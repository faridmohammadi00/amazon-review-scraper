JP,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2019","I was once a newbie with Caseta - but no longer, so I hope this helps you. This kit is the first purchase you need for Lutron’s system. Once you have the hub, no more kits are needed for future switch purchases. One hub can manage up to 75 switches (and I think the Hub is included in that count).

Some buyers complain about having to wire in Lutron's hub to your network with an ethernet cable. But you can't beat the speed and reliability of a wired network connection. Given that Lutron’s product works reliably and is 100% responsive all the time, this is a non-issue for me.
Since I put in the first few Casetas, we truly love them and have started to replace switches all over the home. Which brings up another issue... if I had chosen a WiFi connected switches (and I did briefly for use in limited locations, more on that later) I could potentially be adding a much larger number of connected devices onto my network. If your WiFi isn't all that great to begin with - think entry level routers - this could potentially impact network performance and your connectivity with your switches. For me, that's just a no go. I really want my WiFi to work well for the things that need to be on it.
The PROs of the Lutron Switches:
Setting the switches up is straightforward and fast. The setup process works like expected each and every time. I cannot say the same about other non-Lutron WiFi products.
Having problems setting them up or is a switch not acting right? Lutron’s support is the bees knees. They have helped me several times and each time they are great.
The switches are incredibly responsive both in person and via the app. There are no delays in turning things off and on. The ceiling fan switch is especially a godsend for our old ceiling fan - no more standing on the bed to pull strings or getting up out of bed to adjust things.
Lutron and Ring also teamed up and added some camera integrations where movement and/or doorbell pushes can activate lights. It works quite well, but the feature was a little buried in the Lutron app. Big bonus - the integration will also turn off lights after 15 minutes.
About the app (and this is a biggie)
Purchasing good hardware is one thing, having an app that you only get to experience after you purchase the hardware is downright crazy. But that's the world that smart switches seem to live in, so here's the scoop on Lutron - and the apps for a couple other systems I tried.
Lutron's app is well designed and intuitive. You can quickly add new devices, program in schedules and scenes. The app also interfaces with my Lennox thermostat to display the current temp in the home (with the help of Apple's Home (home kit) app that's running on a dedicated iPad that never leaves the home). The Ring cam integration is good too.
Having tried WeMo and Leviton's WiFi connected switches, my take on those apps is that they are incredibly clunky. This seems like a misstep, especially when you are going to spend most of your time interfacing with the app than the switch.
Since I also use Apple's Home app with my family, every time a switch gets added into the Lutron hub, it seamlessly shows up in Apple Home. This is of course magically great. Since I didn't want to add another app into the mix for my wife and family, it's nice that there have been zero issues with cross platform integration, everything works seamlessly.
The Lutron App also has a geofence capability that will turn on/off lights when you arrive and depart from the home. Haven't used that yet, but it's cool. Another side benefit, Lutron's app has an Apple watch app that you can control lights and fans with.
The CONS:
Edited - The Caseta hub for whatever reason didn’t have auto off timers built in. That said, the addition of their motion sensor product effectively solves this issue.
If you have Ring cams, you can turn on the Caseta integration, and a motion or doorbell can turn on lights and after 15 minutes, turn them off again. This works beautifully.
Other thoughts:
Edited - I used IFTTT (If This Then This) before Ring and Lutron added their cam integration as a trigger to turn on/off lights. IFTTT works, but there was always a bit of a delay to turn on lights if you use it. Plus if you’re internet went down, it didn’t work.
Before the Ring integration, I used a couple WeMo switches for my outdoor lighting as they had auto-off timers. But their setup and app was super clunky. Happy to be rid of them.
As software support is now kinda important for app driven switches, making sure you get a switch from a company that's going to be around a while is more important than it used to be. It would be bad if your OS on your phone, requires your apps to get an update and your smart switch maker is MIA.
Side note - For the two years I had WeMo switches, changes in Wifi forced me to individually reconnect all switches to it, and it was a horrible process to get them re-paired with WiFi. Lutron has never had this issue, being wired into the network.
One switch I purchased from Amazon warehouse (open box) had issues with setup and Lutron’s support was fantastic. They sent a replacement switch so quickly and were really nice about it.
Bottom line - stick with Lutron, it works really well.",5.0 out of 5 stars
L. McNerney,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2017","I use a few of these around the house, and I plan to expand the use of them. These work great for a smart home setup, and I use the Amazon Echo to control the lights. However, these are not perfect....they are just closer to perfect than any other option I have seen. So I will make a Pro's and Con's list, and then explain a bit of why I prefer them over other brands.
Pro's:
Easy install
Replaces existing switches
Works with Amazon Echo
Clean flat appearance (adjustable)
Optional remote (I do not use)
Works with nearly all light fixture styles
You only need a single IP address
Con's:
You need a dimmable light
Does not dim LED the same way it does other lights
Expensive
Requires use of Lutron App
Now, lets start with the install. This is simple, just shut off the power, remove the old switch, and connect this one to the existing ground, positive, and negative (and the pos & neg are not in any specific order!). They even include the screws and plastic wire caps, so it is twist on and screw it in. No tape (although you SHOULD use it!). So since you are replacing the existing light switch you do not need to do anything else, no wire runs and no electrical box install.
So now we move to working with Alexa, or the Amazon Echo device. I don't call mine Alexa, because my daughters name is Alexis. So everytime we talk to her the other her responds....whichever her we were talking to. I use Amazon. But it is nice, just say ""amazon turn off the bedroom light"" and get a quick ""ok"" and boom, darkness. It makes us lazy. Or rather, it stops the ""It's your turn to get the light"" arguments with my wife, and makes it easier to take care of the baby at 2 am without getting out of bed. But here is the catch, Amazon can only pull the information from the Lutron App. You CANNOT use ONLY Amazon Echo to set it up! You cannot even rename the device. So you are forced to use the Lutron app to set up all the home devices, and name them properly so they are usable with Amazon Echo. Once your entire setup is done you are free to uninstall the app. Although to be fair the Lutron app is pretty good in itself. But this leads to another concern here, if you use the device as part of a smart home you absolutely MUST purchase the Lutron hub....in this case I used Casetta, but since I do not use the PICO remotes I am unlikely to cross the 50 device limit. This is another $150 ish, but it is worth it.
Why would a $150 hub for controlling light switches be worth it? Well, if you are like me and are setting up a real smart home, you probably have a lot of other tech stuff in the house. A smart thermostat for example, or maybe even a server or two, a cloud device, and a firewall. For those of us tech geeks who have all of this, but do not want to pay for t-he expensive licenses, we use a free version of whatever we are using. In some cases for the firewalls you are limited on your number of devices. So, if I was going to connect 50 light switches in my house I would use up all of my devices....just to create a smart home. This is not worth it. However, Lutron made it easier, that little hub takes an IP address and that is it. All other switches connect to the hub, not using an IP address that would be counted as a device on the firewall. You have no idea how hard I looked for this particular feature! With all my kids tablets, the computers, phones, servers and cloud....not to mention the other smart home devices....I am already near my limit. This keeps me under it.
That covers almost all of the real issues. But the not so real issue that people forget about is that not all lights are made equal, ESPECIALLY with the older filament style bulbs being illegal to produce now. A dimmer on these bulbs worked every time, without any changes needed. But this is not the case anymore, the new light bulbs are required to be dimmable. If they are not you get little flashes in your light bulb while it is off....all....night.....long.Get a dimmable one and this problem goes away, however the LED lights do not dim well. You get off, 75%, 100%. Nothing lower then that....so dimming is not really possible here. However, I got the dimmer because it is cheaper than the regular switch, and who knows....I might find a good bulb that dims properly.",5.0 out of 5 stars
jpn311,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2023","In 2020 I lived in an older house with no neutral wires. I wanted to upgraded the lights in the living room and kitchen to smart lights, but most of the available options were expensive smart bulbs or systems that only work with neutral wires. Like everything else I purchase, I do TONS of research first. I eventually found this system and it matched my needs exactly. I purchased this kit plus a single additional dimmer to use in a 3-way switch setup. It was very easy to install, even for the 3-way switch. The included plate covers hide the screw holes giving it a more modern and clean look. It even comes with a remote. After installing the hub and switches I downloaded and installed the free mobile app. With the app you have complete control of every switch individually, thanks to the tiny hub that ties them all together using its own wireless network. The hub plugs into your wireless router so you can control your switches from anywhere over the internet. You can also create scenes and schedules to control them separately or together in groups for different scenarios. For example, sometimes I wanted to turn off the kitchen and living rooms at the same time with a single action, or turn on/off the kitchen without affecting the living room. That same year we were gifted a Google home mini. After getting that setup I was able to easily integrate the Lutron system with it. I could now says ""Hey Google, turn off all lights"", or ""set living room lights to 30 percent"". It really was a game changer not having to jump up and run across the room just to adjust the lighting. It may sound like the next step in laziness, but I saw it as the next step in productivity, as I work from home and having to stop working for a simply task was a distraction I was happy to no longer be burdened with. Other times you just want to raise the lights to find something or to clean up a spill quickly or turn the lights off for a quick nap without having to move at all.
We moved into a newer home in early 2022. After my previous experience with the Lutron products I installed the existing system in the new home and expanded it, making nearly all of the switches smart Lutron switches. I even have smart outlets outside over 100 feet away from the hub to turn on and off exterior lighting as the sun rises and sets. Adding new switches and outlets is a breeze. You just install them, select them in the mobile app and push a button to pair them to the hub.
I have seen a lot of newcomers to the smart switch arena in the past three years, but most still have the same limitations as in the past, such the the neutral wire requirement. Even my newer home has some switches that lack neutral wires, so Lutron is still the best option. Lutron does of course also offer many switches that do work with neutral wires, such as where you only want on/off switching without the need to dim. For those switches you do wish to use as a dimmer, make sure the bulbs you use are compatible. Incandescent as dimmable. Most newer LED bulbs are NOT dimmable, so be sure to read the box to make sure they will work with your switch.
This has been a solid and outstanding system with zero issues that I have used to run my homes for the past three years. Anyone with light switches will love this system as much as I have.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Tammy B.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2024","I have a wife with MS, and the only way to make our bathroom easier to use was to relocate the door. After relocating the bathroom door, I found that the existing light switch was no longer usable. To solve this issue, I installed the Lutron Caseta Smart Lighting Kit w/ Hub and Original Dimmer Switch.
This new switch worked perfectly. I didn’t have to cut into the wall, which has shiplap, preserving the aesthetic of our bathroom. The new switch is conveniently located right when you walk into the bathroom, and no additional wiring was needed. It was a perfect solution that required a minimal amount of work and cost.
The smart features allow for easy control, adding to the convenience and accessibility for my wife. Overall, the Lutron Caseta Smart Lighting Kit provided a seamless and efficient solution, enhancing the functionality of our bathroom with minimal effort. Highly recommended for anyone needing a simple and effective lighting solution.",5.0 out of 5 stars
AmznFamily12,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2019","We were renovating our home office in our attic and as part of it had to update our electrical. I researched tons of smart home products, and decided against anything that required special bulbs (Hue) and anything that wasn't Homekit compatible. Why Homekit? Because the data isn't stored on the cloud, isn't sold, and must be encrypted per Apple standards. Using the Homekit app on our phone is a nice perk, but 99% of the time we use the Lutron app.
The switches once installed and linked to the hub are incredibly easy to use as just normal dimmers with decent sized buttons so even grandma is happy. Setting preset dim levels is easy too, so most of the time it's a single touch on, single touch off - already better than 99% of non-smart dimmer switches out there. Pricey - yes - but you get what you pay for. We bought this starter set to get the hub, and then separate switches. My electrician used standard GFI wall plates, and the Lutrons require about the same installation space as a traditional dimmer switch - not overly deep, no special install.
The hub is easy - we have it downstairs with our router and it feeds all of the switches in the house plus anything else we want (I'm considering the compatible shades for some of the rooms with a lot of sunlight). It's quite small - a single Ethernet cable to the back of our router, and a small plug into the outlet. I have a dumb email account I never use as our Lutron account - just as I do for our TV and 99% of other smart products (there are even sites that give you a 10 minute email account that is purged afterward - for free).
The glitch - some of the ""open box"" orders I placed to Amazon were incomplete. Some had defective switches with corroded wires. Because this was part of a renovation, I didn't find these problems until after the 30 day return window, so I had to call Lutron's support, and they arranged replacements under the 5 year warranty. Also some switches worked, but despite system resets and Lutron's excellent technical support (call as a ""pro""), they could not connect to the hub despite sitting next to other working switches.
The app is very good. Setup via the app is easy. There's one kill switch at the top of the app screen that will turn off all Lutron-connected devices in that room at once - very handy when my kids leave lights on. Once the switch is connected to the app, it's automatically in Homekit. If you are using low-voltage lights (many spot lights are ELV), Lutron makes a special ELV dimmer that you have to use if the lights are in total < 10w. We don't use the remote since it is connected to only one switch and we have many - but I'm adding Lutron Casetas to other rooms that need a three-pole (two light switch) connection - so you use a standard Caseta and the Pico remote with a wall mount (comes with) and a magnetic cover (extra). Super-easy.
I waited 4 months to post this review to see how the system would respond to wifi outages, power outages, lightning storms, etc. and it's been fine. When wifi is out, the switches work as normal dimmers. When it comes back on, nothing needs to be reset (which is more than I can say for other systems I've tried like Wemo).
Lutron Casetas are expensive, reliable, relatively easy (watch the open boxes and ELV fixtures), and the LIVE tech support is very helpful. Each switch contains info and diagrams for installation and connecting to the hub. I wish they carried more Pro products because these are excellent.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Tuan,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2024","I bought more of Lutron product . My home have 50% Lutron and 50% Leviton. But I now ditch Leviton. Why? Simple.

Since after the lightning strike, all other electronic continue to died one after another. With in a month, all my led light died ( what the hell? I think led light is durable), my router died my TV died even long after the event. Even it survived the lightning strike, it could not hold for long. But the Lutron product continue to work. I'll give Lutron my praise. The only thing that died is the Lutron bridge hub. If that not died Lutron would get 5 stars. it's also expensive. That's why 4 stars.",4.0 out of 5 stars
BKextra,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2019","Review: Lutron Caseta Switches
I have tried several other smart lighting systems, including smart light bulbs (Philips Hue, Lifx) as well as smart switches (WeMo, TP-Link, etc.), but the Lutron Caseta system is the best system because of its versatility and integration with Alexa, Google, Apple, etc.
Below are my reasons for being a big fan of the Lutron Caseta System:
BIG SAVINGS by Using Smart Switches Instead of Smart Bulbs
I prefer installing smart switches over using smart light bulbs like Philips Hue because of the cost over time. While the Hue bulb is fantastic, it is also extremely costly when you have to pay for every single light bulb. With a smart switch system like Lutron, you only pay for the switch that controls all the light bulbs. I have 10 overhead lights in my kitchen alone. That would cost me almost $500 if I installed Philips Hue or Lifx Bulbs. By using the Lutron Caseta Switch, I was able to ""Smart-ify"" my kitchen lights for only 10% of the cost of what it would have been had I used Philips Hue Smart Bulbs!
EASY INSTALLATION
I am not handy in any way, but I was easily able to follow the instructions through the Lutron Caseta app to install the switches. I have installed more than a dozen switches (without getting zapped once!)
NO NEUTRAL WIRE REQUIRED - bigger benefit than most consider
We had an electrician come to fix some wiring issues in our house. When he saw our Lutron system, he commented how most electricians prefer this smart lighting system to most because older homes often don't have neutral wires and since the Lutron Caseta doesn't require neutral wires to operate, the system is easiest to install without any hassles in adding neutral wiring.
INTEGRATION and EASE OF USE
Our home uses Alexa as its primary system to integrate all of our smart home equipment and appliances. Lutron switches integrate seamlessly with Alexa and it's really easy to set up. Additionally, we have a lot of guests stay with us (non-tech savvy grandparents) and it's easy to use for them without knowing how to use Alexa because the switches work traditionally too. Not all smart switches can be used as traditional switches too so it helps that Lutron switches can be used traditionally too.",5.0 out of 5 stars
J Edwards,"Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2019","Lutron hit this one out of the park!
Caseta Wireless Dimmer makes it easy to control the lights in my home theater using either my Android Phone or my Logitech Harmony Elite Remote device.
The instructions for connecting to your phone are well written, clear and concise and quick to implement.
This kit works great for either single-pole (one switch) or 3-pole (2 switches) installations. If you are comfortable working with120-volt wiring, i.e. replacing single pole or 3-pole switches, then this Dimmer Kit is a simple and easy DIY project. Lutron instructions made it easy to sort out the traveler and hot wires.
If you are NOT comfortable working with 120-volt electrical wiring, then consider hiring someone to install the system.
As to the quality, IMO, Lutron 's reputation is very good. The product is top-of-the-line yet very reasonably priced.. the lighting indicators are crisp and clear, but not intrusive!
The process for connecting the Caseta Wireless dimmers to your Harmony Elite Remote is a little more involved. Start by downloading the relevant documentation from both Logitech/Harmony and Lutron/Caseta Wireless. The information is easy to follow once you gather all the information.
Several notes:
1) You must install the MyLutron Caseta hub/bridge, set up and sync your dimmers first.
2) You must install the Harmony Hub set up and sync your Devices and your Activities.
3) You must download both the MyLutron app and the Logitech MyHarmony app to your phone, create accounts for both.
4) Log-in to My Harmony hub from your phone first to add the Lutron Caseta as a home automation device. It will require you to connect to Lutron with your relevant log-in info.
5) MyLutron - Log into the hub/bridge and select the appropriate Logitech Harmony device integration.
6) Harmony Hub - I preferred to log in to my harmony hub from my laptop computer with my sync cable connected to my Harmony Elite. Set the Caseta dimmers as devices in your Harmony Hub. Then set up the Activities to include the relevant Caseta lighting components.
7) Change the device configuration to assign the Harmony Elite Remote buttons to the relevant lighting configuration. Once the Harmony remote buttons are assigned, sync the Harmony hub with your Harmony remote.
Final Note: There is a 2 to 3-second delay from the remote to the relevant lighting activity.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Carlos,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2021","I’ve had Lutron ‘electronic’ dimmers since they came out about 20 years ago.
Throughout they’ve kept up with new tech like CFL’s & LED’s & allowed programming switch using the 2 key built-in buttons.
ORIGINAL UNITS: were VERY elegant, aesthetic & simple - only 3 BUTTONS + parallel LED indicators - VERY easy & intuitive to operate: a single long & narrow ‘rocker’ button on the side that you pressed up to increase intensity and down to decrease.
Once you had set your desired intensity level, all you needed was to TAP ONCE the main large rectangular button (taking 90% of the switch) to turn lights on to that LAST desired level, AND TAP ONCE MORE to fully turn off.
At bottom of switch was a very small discrete ’pull kill switch’ to prevent electricity from flowing at all to the light /source.
SWITCH was SIMPLE, ELEGANT, INTUITIVE & super functional.
These units also had a feature that if u ‘long pressed’ them for a few seconds when ‘on’ (vs tapping on/off), they would give you 30 secs before they’d turn off for you to exit the room & not trip over items in the dark.
Moreover, once they reached the 30 seconds, they wouldn’t just turn off out right, but would slowly dim 10% at a time so you’d know it was turning off and either exit the room or go back for more time.
MAIN ISSUE with ‘SMART’ UNITS: switches themselves are fairly ‘DUMB’ in comparison to original ones. Besides ability to be controlled remotely, they have absolutely no other logic in them.
They now have FOUR BUTTONS (plus kill switch) which are COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY and layed out in the same space where there was only 1 tap button before - so they are almost impossible to nail and press the desired button in the dark.
WORST OF ALL, DIMMER is not just PLAIN DUMB, but ALSO FORGETFUL - whatever DIMMER SETTING you set it to, it WILL FORGET the moment you turn it off.
Who was the genius that ’REIMAGINED’ an elegant intuitive easy to use dimmer into this nightmare? He/she should be FIRED IMMEDIATELY.
I’m guessing he/she thought you’d walk around the house with your phone in hand and whip out the app, and flip through menus and screens until you found the right switch to turn it on off?
Even then, you’d still have to remember what dimmer setting you like for EVERY LIGHT IN THE HOUSE so you can TAP IT ONE-TAP-AT-A-TIME (75 taps for 75% - or slide close to it and then fine tune tap to reach specific value) - again, shot in the head wouldn’t be sufficient of a penalty LOL.
TO DEAL with this EGREGIOUS LACK IN JUDGEMENT, you need to BUY ONE PICO REMOTE (@$12-20 each) FOR EACH DIMMER as the PICO BRINGS a FIFTH ROUND BUTTON (literally LAYED OUT on ‘TOP’ of the other 4) that you CAN PROGRAM for a specific dimmer setting.
WHY?????????????? was this even necessary?
In the end that IS how I’VE HAD TO DEAL with this EGREGIOUS LACK IN DESIGN (a very expensive fix).
Also, ONLY BECAUSE I’m someone who enjoys having ALL THE LIGHTS ON at the same time throughout the house, I created SCENES in the app that just TURN ON ALL THESE LIGHTS in the house (or a room) AT ONCE using all the desired dimmer settings - you can also program the PICO REMOTE to store ONE SCENE settings in this ROUND BUTTON. However, note that remotes don’t link to the scene directly - alternatively, once you activate a scene via APP, then you tell the PICO to store all the dimmer settings for the lights you’ve ASSIGNED TO IT.
However, note that if you update that scene in the app, you ALSO need to REPROGRAM EACH SEPARATE PICO for that scene (i.e. say you & your spouse each have a PICO on their nightstand to turn off the house lights and you add/remove a light/lamp to the scene, etc).
UNFORTUNATELY, if you are one of those persons who turn lights on/off as they enter/exit each room, LUTRON IS NOT FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!
Especially since they are SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE than pretty much all other similar systems out there.
The only plus to this system is that it IS RELIABLE in turning lights on/off quickly and that it doesn’t bog down your Wifi router by having 30-50 switches and items hooked up to it when you do full house.
Lastly: note that if you want to add these to CEILING FANS, it can be PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE as you need 1 FAN-SPECIFIC DIMMER + 1 LIGHT DIMMER (~$130 for these) These geniuses haven’t figured out what every other $30 fan remote add-on unit out there did since late 80’s, which is ONE WALL SWITCH + ONE CEILING FAN CANOPY REMOTE UNIT.
CONSEQUENTLY: you’ll need a 2-SPACE WALL ELECTRICAL BOX to put BOTH DIMMERS and a 4-WIRE CABLE going to EACH FAN (if you don’t have this, adding it with electrician can cost I’m guessing $150-$300 depending where you live).
But it doesn’t stop here. Since you’d want to control the fan using a PICO REMOTE (else find phone, open app, find that fan, adjust each setting), you need to add another $30-$60 for that bc FAN PICOS cost way more & are harder to find (unless online).
So, you are looking at a total cost $310-$500 PER FAN to use the CASETA system; and that’s if you don’t add additional items like the PICO REMOTE PEDESTALS bc these are TINY REMOTES & easy to lose inside drawers, linens or furniture.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Eric,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2023","I can't believe it's been almost 5 years since I installed this system in my home. I started with simple WiFi controllers from other brands for lamps in my living room and bedroom... I loved the convenience but often there were issues. I finally bit the bullet and tried caseta and I was pleasantly surprised by the reliability and quality. More impressive was I didn't have to use my voice or an app, but could also use a light switch to control my devices. Weeks later I was replacing every switch in my house and discovering so many possibilities. One switch to control every zone in my kitchen, installing more convenient switches to control lights outside or in different parts of the house. Dimmers and switches to control LED lights inside a hutch or under my cabinets. I haven't stopped installing these things since then. Over the years with countless power outages, construction/ remodeling in different rooms and not one hiccup. Literally not one. These things just work! I can't say that enough. I had light switches disconnected for 2 months during my kitchen remodel. I reconnected them and they just worked. No reinstalling them in the software. They instantly worked just like they did before. Other switches and bulbs all it took was getting unplugged or a blink from the power company and there went a half hour of my day to get them working again. These are the most versatile and dependable smart devices I have ever bought.
Finally... 5 years later.... I have not replaced a single battery in the pico switches. Not one. Do not hesitate. This setup is worth every single penny. It costs more for a reason. No headaches and it does what it advertises.
Oh one last thing... When the Internet goes down the switches and the app still work PERFECTLY. That's right. It can be controlled locally with no Internet. I can't say enough about these. Buy them now. You will be kicking yourself for not doing it sooner.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Reggie,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2021","I did a lot of research when deciding on a smart dimmer switch option. I ended up choosing lutron because it uses the bridge and won't clog up our Wi-Fi. We don't have any kind of general smart bridge to use the z-wave or zigsbee other types of smart options. The bridge is tiny and unobtrusive, but does need to connect to an ethernet port. The dimmers work perfectly, and connect to Alexa seamlessly, which was the most important part to me. We have it set up so our lights come on automatically based on certain conditions and can all be turned off with 1 command, so we rarely use the actual switches. They work perfectly for our needs.
A few caveats/responses to other reviews that initially made me hesitant:
Buzzing - when dimmed, we could hear a very faint buzzing from the lights in our kitchen when we had a few panels of our drop ceiling down. Once the drop ceiling was replaced this was no longer noticeable. If you have literally any other noise in your house, like a refrigerator, the buzzing pretty much can't be heard.
No 'last setting' button - this is 100% the biggest downside to these. The actual hardwired switches only have on/off and increase /decrease buttons. If you walk into a dark room and want to turn the lights on your options are 1) turn them on 100% or 2)slowly increase them from 0 to whatever you want by repeatedly tapping the dim up button. The remotes this set comes with do have a button in the middle that will turn the lights up to whatever you last had them set at, so I have no idea why they didn't include that on the actual switch. We created a 2-way with a switch and remote bracket and mostly use the remote 'switch' when needed, which is rare. We specifically bought these to use with phones and Alexa so this is a minor issue for us that we were willing to overlook. However, if you plan on mostly using the switch it's probably worth considering getting the more expensive switch version that comes with the button in the middle. For us, the extra money wasn't worth it. Alternatively, if you plan on mostly using the wall switch it may not be worth getting smart switches at all, to be honest.
Installation - we had these installed by professionals as part of a larger electrical overhaul so I can't speak to the ease of installation. I did not have any issues connecting them to my phone once I set up the bridge though.
Overall, if you want a smart switch because you plan on mostly using your phone, timers, or a virtual assistant to control your lights these are perfect. Especially if you plan on installing a number of them, since they come with the bridge to use instead of Wi-Fi. If you plan on mostly using the wall switch itself, or if you only plan to install 1 or 2 smart devices in your house, the design and cost of these might not be worth it - smart bulbs or another product are probably better options in that scenerio.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Leslie Dicken,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2017","I've tried 2 other brands of home automation dimmers. Neither of them worked for my situation. One was the X10 switches. Those never worked at all. Then I tried Leviton's solution but that required a neutral wire and I don't have one everywhere. This is a very easy installation. We have multiple 3 and 4 way switches. Instead of having to worry about having a neutral wire, this solution simply ties off the other light switches and replaces it with a remote. It is so simple.
I was concerned about the distance limitation from the hub to the light switches. We have a 3,500 sqft . I have had no issues at all with the distance. I've called their technical support a couple of times to get help with the wiring and understand if the solution will work in my home because of the distance. The people on the phone were very patient and helpful.
I've integrated the switches with my Echo dot and Echo and it works! Be aware that if you want to group a bunch of lights to turn on and off with a name that is similar to the names pre-programmed, you will need to create a group on the Alexa website. For example, I have 4 switches in my kitchen. I created a group called Kitchen Lights. Then I can tell Alexa to turn on the Kitchen Lights. I also used it with Apple's Home. It also worked pretty well. I've also integrated it with the Logitech Harmony remote. That also works pretty well.
My wife is happy that the outside lights are on when we come home using the sunset feature. I like that I can have all of the lights that I want turned on automatically when I come home.
Also, you should be aware that if you plan to install remotes on the wall, you have to buy a separate wall adapter. These cost about $7. This seems pretty expensive for a cheap piece of plastic. I don't know why they don't include those in the product when you are already paying $60 for a dimmer.
Be aware that the RA product line does not work with the Caseta system. If you have a really large house, you may need the RA2 system to reach all of the locations. I suggest trying out the Caseta system in the furthest distance from the hub to make sure it will work in your situation.
I just wish that they had a solution for my ceiling fans and lights. I haven't found a good solution that integrated with the Lutron and Echo systems. For now, I just used the Caseta switches for the lights and a traditional 3 way fan switch for the fans.",5.0 out of 5 stars

They were so easy to install and use that I decided to use them in another home that is more modern, but had two ""problem"" locations where I needed a smart switch. One was for the front porch light, which didn't have a neutral wire in the switchbox becasue of the way it was wired. I installed this switch into that outlet, installed and configured the Caseta Hub, and I now have a smart switch for the porch lights that I access through Smartthings.

D. Johnson,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2021","Three and half years ago I started to automate the house. Being an original Apple fan boy I also decided to only use HomeKit enabled smart devices. Choices being what they were I decided to go with Wemo devices because they didn't need a hub so I bought several dimmers, switches and outlets. Big mistake! I would find switches blinking blue because for some reason they reset themselves and good luck trying to get them on the network again because the iPhone app was finicky. I had to turn off the cellular and bluetooth radios and only use wifi and then some switches never connected again. I had to buy a z-way fan control and use a Raspberry Pi with a z-way adapter connected to my network to get that to work. Then I had to also use another Raspberry Pi running Homebridge to have other devices join HomeKit. Turn on one Wemo switch and others would also turn on. Finally I corrected everything with Lutron.
I bought a starter kit with the smart hub and a dimmer switch. I also bought a fan control and another switch to start the changeover. After replacing the units in the wall I was up and running 10 minutes later. I was astonished! I have been through three thermostats, a garage door opener and 15 other smart switches and nothing had been this easy. I immediately went about not only swapping out all my Wemo experiments, but I also added a few additional switches to fully automate my entire downstairs. I'm so impressed with the ease of use and dependable performance that I'm going to update the entire house. I was able to retire my Raspberry Pi devices as now all my smart devices are connected and working well with HomeKit.
I now own six dimmer controls, four switches and one fan control from Lutron. I'll be replacing my outlets with dimmer outlets and looking for other solutions that work with Lutron.
Just for record I also use the MyQ garage door opener, Arlo floodlight cams and an Ecobee thermostat.",5.0 out of 5 stars
SafetySteve,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2017","I recently purchased two Amazon Echo Dots and have quickly fallen in love with the ability to voice control just about everything around my house. The first integration was with my AT&T Digital Life security system, which allows me to control lots of stuff around the house that is already integrated to my Digital Life system.
After doing some research about the best way to replace existing light switches with Alexa compatible hardware, I decided to go with the Lutron Caseta system. I ordered the two switch/dimmer starter kit with the hub and two wireless remotes. I have an older home that doesn't have neutral wires in most of the junction boxes, so it was imperative to have switches that don't require a neutral wire and the Lutron Caseta switches fit the bill. The hub system can acommodate up to 50 wireless switches, and each one can be up to 30 feet away from the hub. I have Chicago bungalow, and the hub is centrally located, so there is no problem communicating with the switches.
The installation of each switch took less than 15 minutes and simply requires grounding on the junction box and connection of the two hot wires connected to your current switch. They fit into any standard Decora style faceplate, and are not any bigger than my existing non-smart lutron dimmer switches.
Once the switches were installed, I connected the hub to my router, downloaded the Lutron app from the iOS app store and followed the instructions within the app. The setup of the hub took less than 5 minutes, most of which was a required software update. Once the hub was installed I followed the in app steps for adding each of the new smart dimmers that I had installed. Again, it worked flawlessly and took about 2 minutes per switch.
I then went into the Alexa app and clicked on smart home. Alexa started looking for devices and within 20 seconds found both switches, and gave me the ability to change the name and edit the properties.
Once everything was setup in the Alexa app, I simply asked Alexa to ""turn on the living room lights""... and voila! The lights turned on!
If you're on the fence about getting into the whole Alexa / Echo Dot scene, and using it to control the lights and other smart devices around your house... I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT, and HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE LUTRON CASETA system. I'll certainly be upgrading every switch in the house to the Caseta wireless switches.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kyle J. Slick,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2019","TL;DR: The Caseta system delivers wireless dimming switches and a functional app, which matters a lot. However, many features were overlooked or omitted entirely that would've made this an excellent product. Added to that, it's very expensive for what comes in the box.
I now have three wall switches (with associated remotes) and a dimmable plug installed in my house and have been using them for the past year and a half. At first glance, Caseta did an excellent job in building a complete wireless system that can control a variety of functions in your house. In this particular package, there are two dimmable switches, two wireless auxiliary switches, and the mandatory ""smart bridge"" that makes the whole thing work. I'll tackle this review in three sections: the wall switches, the wireless switches, and the app. Oh, and the smart bridge... it works fine, no comment. Also, for the record, I don't have Alexa or any of the other ""smart home"" assistants.
WALL SWITCHES: These were easy to install and set up. They are a bit deep so you may have a problem fitting wires into your switch box if you use low profile boxes. Check the dimensions before purchasing! Once installed, the trim kit included looks very professional. The buttons, however, feel quite flimsy. Additionally, as others have noted, there is no center ""preferred setting"" button like you find on the wireless remotes. The biggest problem with this is that it's challenging to turn the light on in the dark. I find myself mashing the switch until I happen to turn it on because there is no tactile feedback telling you that you're touching the right button.
REMOTE SWITCHES: The small remote switches can be installed in an included wall plate and mounted to the wall if you so choose. I did this with one of my remotes and am pleased with the functionality all around. These remote switches are probably the best part of the system and allow me to slowly turn up the lights from bed or from the couch. The middle ""preferred setting"" button, while rarely used, provides the necessary tactile feedback to let me know where I am on the remote. The remotes are quite small and light and can probably be lost in the couch very easily... but I actually like the size.
CASETA APP: The app consistently works, which automatically makes it better than 95% of the apps out there in my experience. That being said, the app doesn't do much more than turn your lights on and off. You can create ""scenes,"" which are self-programmed lighting levels on any of the lights in your house. You can also set lights to turn on/off relative to sunset and sunrise. The big feature I wish it had: a ""sunrise alarm"" that would slowly fade in lighting based off of a specific time that you need to wake up. I can wirelessly program my thermostat to turn on whenever I want... why can't I do that with my wireless lighting? To clarify, you can turn on a light to a preprogrammed lighting level on a schedule but you CANNOT fade the light to simulate sunrise or sunset. I would add one star if this feature became reality.
THE GOUGE: The brandy-new feel of having an all wireless lighting system is pretty cool. But then you want to expand the system and every expansion costs $50. In my opinion, the quality of the switches just don't merit that price. To compare, go play around with the buttons on non-wireless switches at Home Depot. Once you get into the $20 range, those buttons feel solid and there is either a nightlight or some sort of tactile feedback to let you know you're on the right one.
Caseta is very close in having an excellent design but needs to focus a bit more on real-world functionality of their hardware before they can charge this much for these switches.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Luther,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2021","I had changed out porch ceiling lights as well as added an additional one. Wanted to have a smart dimmer switch that would give me lots of flexibility. Tried 3 different kinds before finally going with Lutron Caseta. I will say right up front that I was trying to save money as this is pricey. But a perfect case of you get what you pay for. Received this kit and before starting did make one call to Lutron customer service over a wiring question. No issue on getting through and the lady I spoke with answered all my questions completely. NOTE, the tech support lady I spoke with did suggest that setting up the bridge first would be a good way to start.
Got the dimmer wired up (very easy) and took out the second switch in the three way circuit to be replace by the accompanying Pico adapter. Set up with the bridge again is very easy and the Lutron Caseta app walks you through everything.
Yes, you can control the lights from you phone (Google Pixel as well as Google Home) with on/off and of course dim. You can also control time of day as well as the days of the week you want the lights to function. But here's what I was impressed by. In the Lutron app there is an astronomical timer set up so that the porch lights will turn on at sunset and off at sunrise throughout the year. And on top of that if you wish for the lights to turn on at sunset and off at preset time later in the night, you can do that as well. There are also other setting options in the Lutron app.
And finally, I had a couple of years ago purchased a Lutron plug in dimmer for a light. And that now can be controlled with the Lutron Caseta app.

Chuck M.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2019","Lutron Caseta products are the finest available today. Other electrical brand or systems typically require a 3 wire (including ground wire) connection, Lutron Caseta only requires 2-wire connections. Adding the Lutron Caseta Bridge to your Internet Wi-Fi Router allows you to create controller schemes and schedules, and more importantly, modify the Bridge and remotely control your entire home from anywhere you have cell phone connectivity.
For the anyone who may be reluctant to mess around with electricity, Lutron provides a internet link that will walk you through the entire procedure for every Lutron product, complete with ""layman"" drawings, safety precautions (just turn off the circuits or the entire panel), and go at it. Suggestion: has a flash light handy, and do the swap-out during daylight hours (duh?). Another added bonus: Lutron even provides a phone number for 24/7 human technical support. You'll talk to a real person. What more could you want? OK. You can hire a professional electrician if you so desire
My Experience: I've ""played"" with electricity over many year, I'm not a pro. My first switch replacement was a 3-way swap-out. I did exactly what the Lutron docs instructed, and when I reset the circuit breaker, the house did NOT blow up. Switch / Pico remote 3-way combo worked perfectly. Since then, I've replaced 2 others switches, added 2 plug-in lamp dimmers, and 1 lamp dimmer module ""programmed"" as a switch for an old stereo system. And I'm planning on converting the entire house, all on my own. As long as you practice safety, you and your home will survive. Then, show it off to your friends.
I also purchased three Fire 7 tablets, to act as remote controllers for all on the Lutron Caseta devices. Fire's are located in the Master Bedroom, Kitchen, and the 3rd can go anywhere as long as it have Wi-Fi connectivity. And you still have your smartphone to control it all.
CONS: No software for Windows/Apple PCs and laptops. I don't have a Surface or any Apple products to test on. Also, the Lutron App is only displays a list of devices.

S. Davis,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2022","We recently finished our basement and the finished area is sort of split into three usage areas: crafts/projects, TV viewing/sitting, game room (ping pong, air hockey, etc). I wanted to control the lights in these areas separately (and there are limits on how many lights you can have on one anyway. But since these three areas are all part of one large open layout I also wanted the ability to control them together.
So I got a bridge/switch/remote and two switch/remote packages. I wired it as three different circuits leading to three wall switches inside the basement doorway around a corner. The key to my setup is that you can link multiple switches to a single remote (and as many remotes as you want). So I added a remote to the switch box before the basement door that controls all of the basement lights together. You come down the stairs and turn all the lights on or turn them all off as you leave, then if you want separate control you step inside the basement and can modify using the three switches. Then I connected the bridge and can voice control the three switches together or the remote and affect all three areas. And honestly, I did not even change the two gang outlet box outside the basement door to three. I just changed the two switch cover to a three and put the remote against the drywall and it fit perfectly. Really liked not having to tear out the box.

Pros:
- Easy Install. I mean, SUPER easy.
- Can mount the pico remotes to another wall in the room to simulate a 3-way switch. (perfect for older homes or homes with weird wiring layouts)
- Comes with a screw-less wall plate which makes the switch look modern/elegant
- Lutron is a big name in home electric's so it's definitely something I trust
Cons:
- Switch button layout/style is a little strange, not you average switch style, and will be something to get used to
- Buttons on the switch are very ""clicky"" and make a clicky sound. This is not something that bothers me that much as I use voice control for the lights for the most part
- Must buy a hub and hard wire it to your Wireless router. A wifi option may be good for the hub, but honestly it's more annoying to have to pay an additional $50 for the hub when the switches are over $50/piece.
- When turning off the light it dims first then turns off, which is kind of weird in my opinion. (maybe just a preference)
Long review:
I originally ordered the TP-Link wireless switches to use in my 85-year-old house, however, I should have checked the wires first. Most of my switch boxes did not have neutral wires so I was unable to use the TP-Link switches. I was hesitant on buying the Lutron Caseta because I would need to buy an additional hub to get the switches to work. After much headache and a call to an electrician (to fix the light switch I broke while trying to install the TP-Link), I finally decided to give the Lutron Caseta a try. Wow, what an easy install. You don't have to bend those stiff wires in your wall around a little screw on the side of the switch, you simply just tie the wires from the switch to the wires in the wall with a wire nut and you're done! I'm not a huge fan of the light switch style itself, however it's not too bad once you have them matching throughout your home. I've set up the Caseta system with my Amazon Alexa AND Apple Homekit so I can use my voice pretty consistently to control the lights. I'm so happy with the system, I bought more Caseta switches to install in my home.",5.0 out of 5 stars

J. Meyers,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2021","I bought this system mainly because the previous owner of my house already installed two Lutron switches and a Pico Adapter to control the lights, but didn't leave the Smart Bridge. (The Pico Adapter only works with the Smart Bridge. The switches do work on their own)
Setup was very easy, and so far has been very reliable. People may think having a separate bridge should be unnecessary and that switches should just be Wi-fi enabled directly, but there are issues with those devices. 1) Wifi switches very often need a neutral wire, which is rare in conventional lightswitch wiring, and 2) A lot of IoT devices have very spotty Wifi reliability, often requiring you to reset and reconnect the switch. (Check the reviews on those things.)
I haven't run into any connectivity issues yet with the Lutron Smart Bridge, and the scheduling seems to work pretty well. I wish you could create a single schedule for a light to both turn on and turn off, but you have to create two events, which makes your event list pretty messy with multiple devices, and harder to find both on/off events if you have two different schedules for a switch. (Say a daily schedule, and then a vacation-only schedule)
The range on the Smart Bridge has been good enough for my 3000 sqft single-story home, but I have the device toward the center of the house. I do wish the bridge had a smaller LED on it, or that you could disable it, because it is a ring around the whole device, and a bit on the bright side.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I have Meross smart switches, Legrand dimmers (and remotes) Innovelli light/fan dimmers/controllers, and now Caseta dimmer with smart bridge. Caseta is superior!
Performance: Caseta dimmers work perfectly! The switch itself has immediate and smooth operation, and response/operation is just as great via a Pico remote, the Lutron app and Apple HomeKit. Unlike all my other devices, Caseta devices have not had a single bug or hiccup at all...no slow response, no dropping from the network or from my Home app, no issues at all!
Install: Caseta dimmers do not require a neutral wire, which makes wiring easier and makes it possible to use in locations where neutral is not available. The Lutron app is well designed, intuitive and functional. Smart bridge setup was simple and efficient...automatic setup and firmware update. Smart bridge clearly walks you through adding the dimmer and also automatically handles firmware updates.
Scalable: Here’s where the Lutron architecture shines! My other smart switches connect directly to my WiFi for connectivity. I now have 60+ devices on my 3-node mesh network and it was very problematic...when your WiFi is saturated with devices, it causes a lot of problems for everything in the network. Devices were dropping off and reconnecting to the WiFi, internet access performance was terrible, even on-network communications (like printing to a wireless printer) was impacted. Because Caseta devices don’t connect to the WiFi (they instead connect to the smart bridge), they don’t impact the rest of your wireless devices in the home. This alone may be cause for me to go back and replace all my other smart switches with Caseta devices.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I installed this in our new sunroom addition, where we have four entrances. Two of those entrances are on the other side of a concrete block wall. I also installed the hub on the other side of that wall. My biggest concern was if the signals from the remotes and to/from the hub would be strong enough to pass through the concrete walls, but it turns out to be no problem at all. All remotes and hub work fine.
The Alexa and Google Home integration is seamless, once set up. We can control the switch just like all the other wifi smart switches.
My only complaints, and the reason for docking two stars are:
This is an expensive ""smart switch"". I realize the functions can't be performed easily with standard smart switches, but $99 to get one switch, one remote, and the hub that makes it ""smart"" seems high. No real competition is likely the reason for this.
One thing that should be improved - When turning on a light, it defaults to maximum brightness. I would prefer that it returns to the previous dimming level.

barnabasdb,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2018","Pricey, but work as intended. I like connecting multiple switches to a single remote, creating a ""master remote"" which I leave by the door. Some LED bulbs do not dim well, but changing the bulbs fixed the issue. There has been no dropped connections and works flawlessly with Alexa. If you search for ""Caseta advanced wiring"", the manufacturer has some easy-to-follow tips on wiring anything more complicated than a single pole switch (one switch that controls one plug/light)
Though there are lots of options for smart lights, this is the most elegant because 1) the ability to tie everything to one remote and 2) smart bulbs or the much cheaper sonoffs require power at all times. This means manually turning the switch off disables the ""smart"" function. Disabling the switch and have it always-on requires operating the lights only via Alexa/google which sometimes can be finicky (if you're sick!) and will be useless if your network goes down. 3) finally, my new apt has many 3-way switches all next to each other and I dislike figuring out which switch is on but in the off position, etc.. and for this switch, on is always on, off is always off.
Minor complaint - Turning the lights off makes them dim quickly and then off. I don't know why that bothers me, but I think there's a way to fix it and I'll probably change it.
In the future, I'd like to see lutron make
1) a wall plug that wires into the wall
2) a 3 switch 1 gang version with enough amps to toggle bathroom light/fan/heater.
3) a motion sensor tied to the hub (like phillips hue)

I have since purchased seven more Lutron Caseta in wall dimmers to outfit every switch in my house.
Everything. Works. Flawlessly.
The remotes will serve as your 3 way switch if you have any setup that way, other wise you can just file them in a drawer. I cannot remember the last time I actually used a switch. I use my voice 100% of the time for light control.
Super easy to setup and the control is amazing. I can even say ""Alexa, lights 1 percent"" and I can get this perfect ambient glow through the entire house. All of my lights are in ceiling recessed LED ""can"" lights. I have zero lamps in this house. I have several groups of lights that do various parts of the house and they are named accordingly. Island Kitchen. Living. Familly. Patio, etc. I made groups for them but the main setting I do is just say ""Alexa Island On"" and those 2 can lights above the island give the perfect light.
I did not try any other brands or switches so I cannot comment about Lutron vs. any competitors. All I can tell you is that this just WORKS.
Believe me, there is nothing better than firing up a movie on yoru couch and realizing you forgot to turn off a light. ""Alexa lights off"". Done

Ryan,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2021","Basically, this is IT. If you're like me, and you've got a home that was built in the early 2000 era, some of your switches may not have a white neutral wire. THIS IS WHERE LUTRON COMES IN.
You see, they've got a smart switch that requires no neutral. I also purchased the kit, that comes with the bridge that enables Alexa integration, it also comes with a remote you can pair and stick anywhere to use to control that same switch on the wall. It's wonderful.
Expensive? Yes. Guess what? If you want nice things, you've gotta pay for the good stuff. And when you get this item and it's set up, you're good to go. I downloaded the app and set up my scheduling for my front door porch light. I set it up for when I want it to turn on and off, and it's lovely.
Dont' bother getting other lesser-known company switches that purport to use no neutral. It won't work. Trust me, I tried. GE sold a GE smart switch, and it caused nothing but headaches for me. Not that there's something wrong with the company as a whole, but that switch, which said works with NO NEUTRAL, didn't work. Lutron did.
Get it, set it up, and forget about it. Control it from your phone or the remote, or set up a schedule so you never have to worry about forgetting to turn the porch light on if you're home late.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Robert Chen,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2018","I like this product; in fact, I bought another dimmer from Amazon, and another dimmer set (dimmer, pico remote, wallplate) from Home Depot.
My house was built in 1929 so I have no neutral wire. My friend recommended I buy this as the Lutron Caseta is probably the only ""smart"" light switch that doesn't need a neutral.
Caseta app is okay. Thank goodness it has basic IFTTT support. Only downside of the app for me is 1) the sunset setting doesn't seem to work for me (hence why the IFTTT support matters that much more), 2) I have no idea why some of the circles in the ""schedule"" tab are gray and which are blue. All I know is that I can manually trigger a schedule even when it's not time yet
The dimmer itself is quite interesting. I really like all the small touches that went into its design, such as: a) the hidden ""FASS"" disconnect switch, b) that you can adjust the high/low trim level from the switch itself, c) you can pair the remote from the app or from the dimmer
Downside of the dimmer is that only the pico remote has the ""favourite"" button, and not the dimmer. So if I want to turn the lights on, but not fully on, I have to use the app, the remote, or hold the ""up"" button. Conversely, if I want the lights to be full on, there is no way for the light to go from 0% to 100% instantly. If this dimmer was so ""smart"", it would have been nice to have the option of acting like a traditional switch.
Despite the downsides, I still give it 4 stars because at the end of the day, those are only minor annoyances and the main purpose still works, to allow me to turn the lights on and off based on a schedule or IFTTT triggers",4.0 out of 5 stars
J. Reid,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2020","I've been eyeing this whole Lutron Caseta for quite a long time now. Replacing my X10 system from 30+ years ago. But to do the whole house will get quite expensive. I prefer this over individual smart bulbs, as that can get REALLY expensive, especially when replacing many bulbs.
This was a breeze to connect to the hub, to Alexa, to my iPad and Android, and to integrate with the modules and Pico remotes. I wish I hopped on board earlier. Amazon had a little sale on these, so I went full in. By the end of the day my entire home was set up with multiple switches, modules, the hub and Picos.
The switches and modules look very sleek and modern, without standing out like they are trying to win a design award. Just a nice basic modern look. Honestly, some of the other brands are very nice looking, but not in a classic way, much more like a passing fad. I can't attest to the operability of the other brands, since this Lutron set up worked out of the box. Also, it was the only one I found that worked on older homes with out the third wire. My home was built in 1893, the elctrical probably is from the 1950's or earlier. Bam! It worked. Oh, and YES, you can brighten from a ""dead off"" position without having to go first to full brightness as on some brands. The ONLY issue: With the wall switches, it will not remember the last brightness setting. (Pico's will, with a pre-programmed dim/bright level - center round button). On either, you can brighten up from zero as I said.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Michael,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2016","While initially down on having another smart-home device with its own hub (think I'm up to 4 hubs now...) I really wanted the ability to dim and control lights without relying on a phone to make the changes. That's where this switch shines (yes, that's a pun). My Philips Hue and other smart lights are nice, but to dim and get the most use out of them, you need to use your phone. The problem is that I don't carry my phone around in the house all the time. I don't like walking into a dark room and having to use a phone to turn on the lights. I'd like to use a typical wall switch. This gives you the best of both worlds. Smartphone control with traditional switch control.
This set came with the Lutron screwless plate covers, but I installed the switches in a box with other switches. So it's easy to remove the baseplate off the switch and install in any standard wall box with standard plate.
A note on LED bulbs: This was tricky. On initial install, my LED bulbs flashed, buzzed, hummed, and generally didn't work. There is a separate installation manual to calibrate the switch to LED bulbs. Just Google Caseta Lowend Setup. Essentially you program the switch the the power range of your fixture/bulbs. Not too difficult. And if you LED bulbs don't work using this, then you need to find a compatible bulb. I had a set of Sylvania bulbs that would never work. A cheaper set of Osram bulbs from a home improvement store worked perfectly.
I also used the iPhone app and it's easy and intuitive to control the switches.
My single biggest complaint is that it is not compatible with Smartthings.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Alan-1,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2019","I wanted to install a timer system so I could program the lights when we are away, and this product exceeded my expectations. It was super easy to install in about 30 minutes with just a pair of wire cutters and a screwdriver, then I downloaded the app to my phone and started programming right away. I installed two of these sets on wall sconces in one room, 2 hallway chandeliers and a floor lamp in two different rooms using an additional plug-in unit for the lamp.
What's even better is that you can control the lights in real time as long as you have cell service or wi-fi. This allows us to turn on the lights before we enter the house as well as mix up the programmed times when we are away so they don't follow the same pat schedule. And it's great to be able to dim the lights in the room without having to get up and go to the wall switch.
This product set is for incandescent or halogen bulbs, not LEDs. It's not that they won't work with LEDs but the power draw for the timer chip causes a faint light to appear if you only have LED bulbs because they have such a low threshold for wattage. Lutron has another product made specifically for LEDs, but you can also solve the issue by having just one non-LED bulb on the circuit to draw the excess power.
I installed this about 6 months ago and haven't had one issue with the programming or normal use of the lights since. The service is also supposed to work with Amazon Echo or Google Home, but I don't have either so I can't comment on its applicability for those. v",5.0 out of 5 stars
BRose,"Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2018",We bought these because we recently had a baby and didn't want to have to turn the lights on full blast in the baby nursery in the middle of the night when doing changing or feedings. The hands-free option with Alexa allows us to turn on the lights in the nursery before we even get to the room so we don't trip or stub our toes etc. and right now she sleeps in a bassinet in our room so our hands are often full and we don't have the ability to get to the light switch. The hands free options also allows us to turn the lights off when we leave the room without having to touch a light switch which is great when we are taking the baby back to the bassinet. The remote is nice because when we are rocking our baby in the rocking chair we can adjust the lighting once she is done feeding because we have the remote sitting next to the glider on a side table. We got the 2 dimmer switch package since our master bedroom already had a dimmer switch but it wasn't smart so we thought it would be a great time to replace the regular dimmer switch in our master bedroom with a smart one. It's working great in our master bedroom as well since she is sleeping in a bassinet in our room so we can turn the lights on just a slight bit while we pick her up or put her back in the bassinet. Then I can turn the lights off via remote or alexa instead of having to try to find my way back to my bed in the dark in the middle of the night.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Daniel,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2022","The kitchen ceiling lights in my home were switched at 3 locations, using a 3 way dimmer at one end, a regular 3 way at the other, and a 4-way in the middle.
I installed the Lutron Caseta in wall dimmer in one location like it was a single pole switch, one black wire to the ""hot"" black, the green wire to the ground, and the second black wire gets twisted to all the other wires. In the other 2 locations, I removed the switches, capped the ground wire, and everything else twisted together. I also had to set up a Lutron bridge in another room where my router is located (super easy).
At this point, the physical part of my installation was done, but we didn't want blank plates at the other 2 switch locations, so I added the Lutron Pico wireless remotes at those locations. They have no wires, but can be mounted to a bracket and installed where the old 3 and 4 way switches were.

Laura K.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2020","Got this because we kept accidently forgetting to turn lights on in the house for our pup and our main area is open with no spot for a floor lamp on a timer, as I've used before. Our main area is just overhead lights and we have old wiring so no c-wire. While this is pricier than other switches it's cheaper than an electrician and repairing ceilings and walls. I didn't really need the second switch but we have another bank of overhead lights in the living room so figure i could always use it there and it was cheaper to buy this kit regardless. SO GLAD I DID!
It installed like a dream, my husband leaves these things to me, I'm handi-mom, and he was amazed at how fast I installed it. Harder part was getting the hub recognized. This needs direct plug in to the router only headache. We have smart bulbs with a hub that only needs power. It integrated perfectly with Alexa.
My fave feature? Being able to set it to turn on xx min before sunset! Our house can get dark so I had to fiddle with it but found the perfect setting. I dont need to keep adjusting the ""on"" time as sunset changes! Unlike my smart bulbs. I might see if Lutron has smart bulbs or plugs to get all lights on this system one day. Once in a while when it dims or turns on only 1 light turns on but that happened with our old switch too. Which was an analog lutron switch made for LEDs so it was the correct switch.

Jeff,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2017","This review focuses on the Caseta Dimmer PD-6WCL-WH (no neutral wire). I won’t spent too much time going over the issues, just highlighting a couple and making a recommendation to another, improved, Caseta Dimmer.
PROS:
- Works without white neutral wire. If your older Home has no neutral wire, this is the best LED smart dimmer available.
- Quality product, and in many rooms the cons aren’t an issue
- Controls up to 17 8.5 watt led bulbs
- Has unique ability to modify/set the high and/or low end of the dimming range (i.e. set the dim range so a bulb/fixture will dim lower)
CONS:
- Lutron certifies bulbs for use in the dimmer and many bulbs, including the top rated BR30 GE Reveals, will not work in this dimmer. We like to use the new ‘vintage look’ LED bulbs, and none of mine work properly in this PD-6WCL-WH Caseta dimmer.
- The problem must people have with this product is it’s inability to set a default dimming level. When turned on at the switch it goes to max brightness.
Many people, like myself, like that when using LEDs with a dimmer, you can buy bulbs brighter than you could for an incandescent, and it only adds 2-5 watts and virtually no heat. This allows you to light a room super bright if needed, but use the dimmer so you can tone it down for everyday use. Here in lies the problem with this dimmer. It starts at max ever time you use the switch. This is terrible for a bathroom in the middle of the night.
The last thing is the layout is complicated. Guests won’t know how to use it, and you have to pause and think before you choose a button (especially in the dark). It not like a GE paddle where you can walk by and quickly tap it up or down.
If you like the layout, I strongly suggest you check out the Caseta PD-5NE-WH dimmer switch. It uses a neutral wire and functions with way more bulbs (I check compatibility myself - if there’s no flicker, hum, or on/off flash they work). It also has a button for a preset default, but it is a little pricey - no more pricy than spending $54 on a dimmer and switching it out!
See my product review on Caseta’s more advanced dimmer (PD-5NE-WH), it resolves almost all of this products issues.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Nate S.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2017","Works great with Alexa and Wink hub 2. With the wink hub 2 I can only program 1 pick remote for each switch but it's really not a big deal as additional remotes can be programmed directly to each switch. The only loss this way is inside the wink app you loose the ability to change Controll of additional remotes through the app. Example: my basement entry lights had 3 switch locations (1 at top and bottom of stairs and 1 in theatre). I set the switch up in the theatre then used a pick remote through wink for the top of stairs and another pick remote (programmed direct to switch) at the bottom of stairs. I can use all 3 locations to turn lights on or off but with the top of stairs pick remote going through my wink hub I can go into wink and make it Controll additional circuits etc through the app. So if I wanted to program it as a ""master off"" for the entire basement or entire house etc I can do it through the wink app where as the bottom switch has to be manually added and deleted from various switches that I would want it to Controll. This really isn't a big deal for me because I have the switches and remotes where I want them and really don't need to change the configurations. Wink grouping is also pretty sweet. I can say ""Alexa trigger basement lights off"" she sends the command through IFTTT to a wink shortcut that turns all of the lights in the basement group off (theatre, stairs, bedroom etc)",5.0 out of 5 stars

J Cali,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2019","I wish I knew about Lutron Caseta sooner. I feel that Philips Hue has more marketing push for the features of smart bulbs, but a Lutron smart switch is much better for normal applications focused on on/off + dimming without color switching.
This dimmer doesn't even need a neutral wire! This means it's super easy to set up assuming you know where your breaker box is and have a screwdriver. In the time it took me to install this switch, I would still be waiting for the Philips Hue software update to download onto a single bulb. Plus, Since this smart dimer is meant for a standard Decora wall plate, so it looks much better integrated with your room than the bulky/weird Hue dimmer switch.
Lutron requires a bridge to control the switches, which could be a turn-off to some. But with the bridge, it's well integrated with Google Home, and one switch can control every recessed light in my room. Way better than buying 10 smart bulbs.
I still like Hue color lights and the LED strips due to their novelty and color flexibility. But the default dimmer ""switch"" from Philips is hideous and sticks out like a sore thumb. The Decora offering from RunlessWire that works with Hue is basically the cost of one of these Lutron Caseta dimmers.
Bottom line, Lutron Caseta wins out for ease of install while blending into your room's existing wall plate. It is is the better choice for those that just want a normal application to make room lighting smart and connected (without fancy colors).",5.0 out of 5 stars
Ashley S.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2019","Exactly what I was looking for! Perfect HomeKit Dimmer. My wife recently gave birth to twins. Since they are in our room, we needed a way to have some light on for when my wife nursed them. I needed a dimmer that would allow full brightness for getting ready but dim low enough to sleep under. I also needed to be able to use Siri and my Apple Watch, since we weren’t about to get up to adjust. You can set between 1-100%. I set 1% so low, you can only see them on when it’s pitch black, and even then it’s a faint glow. 4% is enough to see your dresser across the room, but sleep with no trouble. 100% is very bright. It’s super convenient using Watch crown to control brightness or ask Siri. You might as well invest in the bridge up front, since the kit is so much cheaper than individual pieces. Super easy set-up and install. The Pico remote is nice to have by the bedside when your phone or watch isn’t handy, like charging or upstairs. The favorite button is very nice.
One downside is when using the wall switch, you have to turn on to 100%, you can turn on from off to low. But since I mostly use my phone or watch it doesn’t bother me.

I put 3 of them on 3-way circuits, 1 on a single pole. They just have you take all the wires on the second location (except neutral and ground) and wire nut them together. Then you install the pico switch over where the second switch used to be. This is nice because smart switches are huge and can be a pain to fit into a box, especially if you have a lot of extra wire or other smart switches installed in the same box.
For the single pole switch, it was nice to have the ability to add the second switch. We wanted another switch for the dining room but it wouldn't have made sense to have someone come out and wire it (too costly). This pic was simple and cost effective.
The app is good as well. Not perfect, but you can control lights without issues and there are some scenes that are nice.
I use Philips warm dim bulbs with the switch. I had installed Feit LED retrofit prior to installing the switches, but they turned out to not work well and I swapped the light kits back in and got the Philips.

llp,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2021","This and several other Lutron Caseta wireless dimmer products were bought to replace my previous but now unsupported X-10 ""smart home"" automated lighting system. Bottom line is the system works as advertised and has several advantages over my previous system.
Most notable is the reliability of switching. The preprogrammed switching and dimming works all the time - no exceptions. The installation is straight forward - simple plug in with the plug in modules. The switches, of course, require replacing the old switches so you have to be comfortable working with your 120 VAC house circuits. The wireless control is convenient but range can be limited by walls or other barriers between the control and the dimmer.
As compared to X-10 with it's software based control, Caseta does not have the ability to be programmed with complex, random appearing light switching schedules. However, it does allow coupling switching times to sunrise, sunset and be different on each day of the week which largely circumvents this limitation.

Could have been a defective unit though decided to try the Lutron line instead and opt for the Pico remotes to replace my two 3 way set ups.
Install was a piece of cake comparatively to the Decora setup, including the hubs and remotes. The app works flawlessly, my automations are working well, and no more random lights on issues! Yes, you do need to use the hub even if you have an Apple TV like myself, but it integrates seamlessly with HomeKit or you can use the Lutron app. I cannot say how insanely easy the set up is compared to the Decora. You only have to worry about which wire is load vs traveler which is easy to identify using a voltage tester. No need to install neutrals or anything else.

Mr. Amusing,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2018","I probably should have done more research. There are many old horror stories about problems with the ""Bridge"". E.g. 'New Connect Bridge Not Connecting'.
Although I'm a network and software engineer, I find the usability deplorable. The app insists on ""updating the bridge"" before actually setting anything up. After many, many retries, I can't get past the screen I posted. Seriously frustrating. Perhaps I have a bad bridge. Perhaps the software is just horrible.
Or perhaps it's trying to drill holes through my internet that are unsafe and being rejected by my network.
Regardless, the app and the box are clearly have flaws in anything other than the ""happy path"". In the course of trying to trouble shoot, I've found many complaints about interoperability, including on Lutron's own site.
The switches themselves were not difficult to install. But my wife asked a good question: ""Why are there so many buttons?"" And more significantly, why does the remote have one MORE button than the switch itself. It's almost as if someone said, hey, you know what, when they turn this light on manually, they may not want to start at the lowest level and work their way up... nor would they want to start at the highest level and work their way down... so lets add another button so they can ""pick"" the last setting and start there. But that button is only available on the remote. And that extra button can't be used to turn OFF the light, only turn it on.
Also, while the base switch has a dim green light on it making it findable in the dark, the remote does not. My lighted Leviton paddle switches are super findable in the dim light. And speaking of Leviton....
In our bedroom we have a dimmer that is not ""wifi"" enabled, but it's a model for how this kind of switch SHOULD work. The dimmer has one BIG button that turns the light off it is on, or turns it on to the last set light level if it is off. A rocker button on the side can be used to brighten or dim. THAT is how it should work. Big, findable button less fiddling. Leviton, by the way, also has a wifi enabled switch that works exactly the same way.
Finally, my kit that included two switches and the base unit doesn't have any explanation what the different ""light"" configurations are for the base unit. It can flash ""circularly"", slowly, dimly, be off or stay on continuously. I found no explanation what those indicators may mean. Apparently they figured ""connect to power"" and ""connect to your router"" were sufficient and the app would do the rest. But, for Android, at least, it sure doesn't give a clue what is really wrong.
In short, good idea, bad execution, and might prove for you, as it is to me, an expensive, time waster. The switches work... but now I'm thinking I should rip this all out and replace it with Leviton... because without a working base station, it's rather useless for the purpose I had in mind. I've had no such trouble with any of the other wifi controlled devices in my home... except that my wifi doesn't reach to the far side of my house!
Oh, and if you want to use the app to control lights (assuming you can get the base station to work), it seems you have to LOG IN each time. That is the epitome of inconvenience. Further reading including app reviews seems to indicate that the programability is poor, too.
IN SUMMARY:
I will have to contact customer service to try to resolve this. If I do, and the matter is resolved I'll follow up. But first impressions mean the best this product is going to get from me is 3 stars.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Philip M.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2018","This is about the kit with dimmer, bridge and pico: use: dim a set of LED spotlights/rail (about 10 dimmable LEDs)
This is just day one, received it at 7pm and it was all running by 7:30pm,
i may update if anything happens but so far I'm very satisfied:
- the bridge just connects to the router with a supplied wire, easy
- the bridge setup done with cellphone, was easy, took 5 minutes to update software, (happened automatically)
- installing the dimmer was easy, i already had a non-smart electronic dimmer before.
- i was able to adjust the dim level easily (great feature even though it's buried deep in the manual),
it goes much farther down/dark than my old dimmer (=good!)
- Pico pairing was painless, used phone app
- Alexa pairing is typical, have to set up a Lutron account and link it to the Alexa ""Lutron"" skill.
I have some other smart devices so it was similar.
One qualm: I don't understand why the Pico has a ""favorite light setting"" button
but the wall dimmer does not have that nice round middle button, maybe there's a key-combination that does the same thing but not seen it so far.

Justin D. Boggs,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2019","I used these to control some dimmable LED can lights in my kitchen. The install just like a light switch, with pigtail leads, not lugs. It actually makes it easier because you can push the solid wire to the back of the box after wire nutting the pig tails to them, then fold the stranded pigtails in easily when you screw the switch to the box. No neutral required, but you should hook up the ground.
After that you sync them with the hub (sold separately) and, if you choose to, tie the hub into the smart home system of your choice. I use Apple Homekit. The hookup is easy, and the iOS app is reasonably intuitive. The hub is a versatile one, and accepts a whole host of non Lutron devices. I haven't personally put anything on it yet that isn't a Lutron device, so I can't tell you how any non-lutron devices would interact with the hub and Homekit.

ALBERTO VARGAS,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2019","If you watch the news, you can read one month how one ""smart-something"" company is bankrupt. The next month other company stops supporting its smart stuff, and on and on.

The Caseta line of products allow almost anyone to make a house smart. Their most popular dimmer doesn't even need a ""Neutral"" wire, so it's easy to use on old houses without such wiring.
I have tested it with several diferent dimmable LED light bulbs and luminaires. Work flawlessly!
I have been able to dim without flicker down to about 5% (But this is with my particular bulbs and luminaires, you may get other results).
The app integration via the Lutron bridge is also flawlessly. Setup is really easy: You will have favorite scenes in no time.
It works with most ""phase-dimmable"" LED bulbs and lights, as well as incandescent, halogen ones. So you have freedom to choose your light sources from many brands.",5.0 out of 5 stars
M. Markman,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2018","I put up my first Caseta dimmer switch and Pico remotes two years ago in a room that had three doors, but only one light switch. The system made it possible to have a light switch at every door without having to run new wires. The three switches talk to each other wirelessly without using a smart bridge. Each of the three switches (main dimmer and two remotes) gives full control of on, off, and dimming.
This month, I added some new lights to a covered patio and a storage shed. With the Starter Kit, I could add two new dimmer switches and remotes, so I have switches, both indoors and out. The smart bridge lets me put control all three rooms from an iPhone app, or by Alexa. The system is simple and reliable.
I was able to add the original room to the setup. I had one technical issue that I raised to the Luton support team. I was super impressed that they not only responded promptly with instructions on how to resolve my issue, but also a week later they sent a follow up email to ask if I was still having a problem. I've never seen a customer support operation follow up like that.",5.0 out of 5 stars
John M. Ward,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2021","My house doesn't have neutral wires on any of the light switches so these are the only ones that work for me. I don't need or like the dimmable capabilities. It controls a ceiling fan and light.
When pressing the buttons on the light switch it steadily ramps up or down the brightness but using the app or voice commands sends it to full power immediately which causes the light to flash like a slow strobe and the fan to him loudly and pulse as well.
I rigged it to ramp on by creating a ""Routine"" that turns it on at 33%, wait 5 second, then at 100%.
There's better switches even from this brand but if you're without neutral wires then you're stuck with this model because of copyright ownership.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Zach S.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2018","Great so far! This review is more 4.5/5 then a pure 5/5 stars. Ended up paying an electrician for the install, and it went super smooth. They loved the mounting the remote as a 3 way switch, said all 3 way switches should be like that haha. Pairing was super easy from the remotes to the switch and getting it setup and setting up in the app. Really like how the app is organized and pretty easy to set it up there too. Only thing I wished the app had was inviting guests access so they can control it via the app, but not have administrative rights. Right now it looks like you can only give other people your login credentials. Every other smart device I own (between 2 place's) has this feature. For that I'm knocking off a half star, otherwise it'd be a pure 5/5. Was able to set it up with my Google Mini and the voice activated feature works great, just like my Phillips Hue bulbs in my primary residence. Was worried about the bulbs being compatible (don't know what brands they all are), but various styles are. Definitely happy with my purchase, even if a bit pricey.

CC,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2021","The electrician who wired the track lights in my living room neglected to route the neutral wire to the switch junction box, so I was unable to use a less-expensive smart switch that simply connects to a WiFi network. Happily, these Lutron Caseta smart switches don't require a neutral. The switch was simple to install and nearly effortless to connect to the Caseta Bridge (which connects to my router). I know I have another location with a similar situation (no neutral wire), which is why I bought this starter kit (which comes with two switches and a bridge). The fact that it also includes a remote for each switch means that I don't have to rewire that other switch as a 3-way. I can just put the remote in the location where I would have otherwise run the other 3-way switch. So, although these switches are more expensive than WiFi smart switches, in this case I will actually end up saving money.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I put the real switches next to each other and set them up. The installation was pretty straightforward if you can use a screwdriver and wirenuts.
Once I confirmed that the installation did work and the lights turned on and off, I set up HomeKit by plugging the Lutron hub into my router and used the Lutron app on iOS to add the switches and remotes, then tested using Apple's Home app. It works flawlessly! I can control the lights from home or at work.

jaye,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2019","I was a bit dismayed seeing the majority of the smart switches require a neutral wire. Our home is 1960s construction and most often there is no neutral present in the switch box. Then I found these and boy, are they good.
The installation of these are a breeze, just connect the switching wires (hot and switched hot) and the ground, and you are ready to pair any non-three way fixtures to the Lutron app, provided you have the bridge connected to your home network. If you have a three way dimmable fixture, no problem, there are advanced directions which allow you to just use a pico remote on one end and this on the other switch.
The Alexa integration is good, but one quirk is that it appears you have to use Lutron's naming convention unless you rename it as a group in Alexa devices. I would prefer it if I could just give each of my switches a custom name in the Lutron app to avoid this.
If you have an older home and dimmable bulbs and fixtures, I would HIGHLY recommend these dimmers. I am very satisfied with them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Captain Packrat,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2018","Part of my home is an old farmhouse build over 100 years ago. While the wiring was upgraded a couple decades ago, they still didn't add a neutral line to any of the switch gang boxes. Lutron makes one of the few available smart switches that will work without a neutral. This kit comes with a hub, 2 switches and 2 remotes.
Installing the switches was easy, though I prefer the GE design where the wires are inserted into the switch body, rather than using wire nuts as Lutron has done. The hub was also easy to install, though it looks like it needs to be on the same switch as your WiFi access point.
The remotes have a lot of possibilities. I can put switches in new locations, such as on both ends of a hallway, without having to run new wires. And with the wall mount adapter and a new cover plate, it'll look like it's built into the wall!
My only complaint is that the switches are rather particular about the bulbs if you're using LEDs. Not all dimmable LED and CFL bulbs are compatible, and non-dimmable bulbs just plain won't work.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Water Lover,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2017","Lutron Switches are extremely flexible and Apple HomeKit compatibility is second to none. You can configure 3-way, 4-way, and many way applications. The switches have advance programming features to set max and min dimmable ranges. You can do just about anything with these switches; however, I have two cautions:
1. Be very careful which LED trim kits you purchase with these lights because I am having difficulty with the Sunco brand sold on Amazon. They are humming and buzzing. If I find a fix for this concern, I will be sure to post back. I would love to hear from any fellow Amazon lovers who are having that same concern.
2. Do not use these switches with outdoor motion lights, even if you buy dimmable LED bulbs. You will not be able to turn on/off fast enough to have manual override on your motion lights. Also, you cannot configure the Lutron Caseta switches with the motion lights because you need to have a load on the circuit when setting up the light. I am looking at using Lutron's switch sold here https://www.amazon.com/Lutron-Caseta-Wireless-Switch-Multi-Location/dp/B017LRCG38/ref=pd_sim_60_8?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=T4A990N4AWQNKCM1ZC3K to fix this situation and I will report back if it works out.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Sarah,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2021","This dimmer switch has a few flaws. It was listed to integrate with my light bulbs but still caused a slight ringing sound, especially around 50%. Additionally, the three way functionality is a bit confusing. I thought this would work with my existing three way switches (aka multiple light switches on the same light). Turns out they are just saying that mounting a remote on the wall on the other side of the room creates that functionality.
In the end, I returned this model. BUT I did purchase the non dimmer version of this. It solved BOTH of my problems. No dimming meant no ringing noise from the light bulbs. And for some reason, they made the non dimmer version actually three way comparable. This means that I can have the switch on one light switch and the other light switch can still work. Then to get the dimming effect, we use warm lightbulbs in lamps.
The other big thing to talk about here vs other switches is that it doesn’t rely on wifi - which is a huge perk. I have some Phillips Hue bulbs that come on in the event of a power flash that knocks out the wifi. It’s a terrifying surprise in the middle of the night. These do NOT do that as they run on their own system outside of wifi. Also, they don’t eat up your bandwidth.

I have some exterior lights programmed to turn on in the early morning and again late at night as a security measure.
Others have noted that the in-wall dimmer don't have a favorite setting, but I won't ding the item for this. With Alexa, I can turn on the lights to the percentage of light output I require.

I don't like how they work with Dimmer Lighting. The Dimmer lights have 5 presets (20%, 40%... 100%). So if you want the lights just barely on, you can't put them 10% level.

The issue I had was with safety. There was a high pitch noise coming from the switch itself which can be a bad sign. (If you hear the sound from your bulbs that’s not necessarily a safety hazard but likely means your bulbs will not last as long and you could likely fix that just by putting a different bulb in). This noise only occurred when the switch was powered off (a very small amount of current continues to pass through the switch purposefully). This doesn’t necessarily guarantee a fire will occur, but it can be a sign that there is a potential fire hazard and I personally am not willing to take that risk. If you do look past that concern, the noise isn’t particularly loud so if you have any background noise in the room you likely wouldn’t notice unless you’re right next to the switch.

To register the second Lutron and control it over wi-if I had to create a second account after consulting with Lutron. No problem. Then i discovered that I could not pair the Caseta with Alexa in the second house because I was already paired with the first Lutron account. I called Lutron and they told me they could not help me and I should call Amazon. I was told by Amazon tech support that I could not link my Alexa with Lutron Caseta in 2 separate locations. They suggested that I open 2 separate Alexa accounts which would be very confusing for my family in the long run. I emailed Lutron and asked them to contact me, as it should be an easy problem to circumvent in a smart home. (I have 6 smart plugs of the same brand in my 2 houses and I can control both easily with my Alexa app.) Very disappointing product and service for a company that wants their products in smart homes!. Perhaps Amazon should have a disclaimer on this product site stating that “it works seamlessly with Alexa, but only in 1 location.”",1.0 out of 5 stars
michael,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2022","I don't have many complaints with Amazon, but this time I thought my experience was below par. First off I did not receive the order as it is shown above but parceled out in separate boxes. MY particular issue is with the smart bridge. I began set-up of the smart bridge at a clients house, opened the Lutron app and smart bridge was not recognized. Fiddled about with it for an hour with no success then brought it back to my house to suss out the issue. The ring light did not illuminate, so finally broke down and called Lutron. They asked for the MAC address of the bridge, and when I had purchased it. They said that the smart bridge was already associated with an email address from 6 months prior to my purchase. Shame on you Amazon. Both the Smart Bridge and the usb charger were broken. Prior purchaser must have fried them. Lutron is sending out a pro Smart bridge for my trouble. Thank you Lutron.",1.0 out of 5 stars

They just let you mount the remote control to a wall and pretend it's 3 way, so you can't actually replace 3 way switches with it. The max wattage is listed as three different values in three different places. The ""Deluxe* version is the exact same thing, but with an extra light switch.

Josh Hamman,"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2019","We've been converting most of our switches to smart ones, but being an old house, a lot don't have neutral wires. This is the only solution available, and it is junk. I tried these switches in several different places throughout the house, from just a one-pole light, to a fan, to just controlling an outlet.
THEY SUCK. Nothing seems to get full power, half of the time it didn't even turn the light on, with verified power to the outlet.
Turning on the lights using Google Home causes them to blink off and on, where using the switch itself works about 50% of the time.
What a waste of time and money. I ended up putting all my old switches back in where I attempted to install these, as they JUST DON'T WORK.
Sadly I missed my return window as we were doing a remodel, so I am stuck with these overprices, unusable, junk switches. AVOID THEM.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2019","The dimmer product line is simply defective. When in the ""off"" setting, it feeds a small amount of current through the circuit, which if using an energy-efficient LED bulb, means that the bulb never turns off when the switch is off. When I called Technical Support, I spoke to a representative named Phillip who explained that all their dimmers work this way by design. He was rude and aggressive; when I asked to speak to his manager, Phillip hung up the phone on me. There are other bulbs you can buy to get around the glowing lights in the off position; however, you will be feeding current through your circuit 24/7 whether your lights are on or off which is wasteful and bad for the environment.",1.0 out of 5 stars

If you’re internet ever goes down, your lights will not come on. Huge flaw and it goes against common sense.
My timer is far away from my home internet signal and the bridge frequently can’t get the signal to the timer.

NigelTuffkin,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2019","Afeter a year of use with switches in most rooms and it’s a very reliable and about the same price as comparable products. As I’m looking to expand for things like remote occupancy/motion sensors there’s not much there for caseta. Lutrons caseta and maestro product lines are confusing and incompatible like they’re still trying to figure out the DIY audience. After realizing now what to look for in these products I can see other brands more evolved than Lutron that satisfy more what I’m interested in. I’m interested in adding on to automation beyond just a switch and a control hub. I’m interested in choices for types of switches with same integration capabilities. Lutron doesn’t provide that.
Functionally I miss the traditional switch, and the only switch between the two caseta options that seem to work in the most common wiring configurations is the dimmer switches. Ideally I would be happy with the traditional rocker switch along with the automation capabilities. If you want to add motion sensors switches or remote sensors your out of luck with caseta. I don’t understand why they couldn’t have just mashed together the pico remote with a motion sensor. The Pico remote is a handy wafer-cookie sized remote light switch. If you want to get into more event triggered automation, your out of luck After following the lutron message boards and product questions, the frustration seems like a very common thread among most of us who bought into caseta.

The best thing about this product is the app. It also works with my Honeywell Thermostats so that's a plus. But there are so many misses that shadow this product given its high cost. In particular, I'm extremely frustrated with how incompatible this switch is with pretty much most bulbs out there. How do you know it's incompatible? At first, it was contacting Tech Support for flickering or blinking. You end up playing musical bulbs till you find what works. Does that solve the problem? Apparently not. Today it rained and my bulbs which have worked fine for weeks have been flickering and occasionally going off. But that's not the kicker about this switch - it essentially cripples your Outlet. What I mean is that your Outlet can only power lamps. Like most Outlets, there are two plug in receptacles. Like most of us, I had other devices plugged into the second receptacles - Bar plug, radio, electric sofa chair, phone charger, nebulizer, etc. I used a very affordable Wireless plug adapter switch to control my lamps. Everything worked great. Hoping to modernize and ""smart home"" my house, I forked over $$ for this package. Now, other things plugged into the second receptacle rarely works. And, it affects the bulbs too. What a waste. Again, the only thing I really like about this thing is the app. Finally don't get me started on what it takes to set this up as a dual pole switch.

• Compatibility with Amazon Alexa apple HomeKit and Google assistant is fantastic.
• Setting up with the hub was a breeze. All told, installation was an A+
Then, the bad:
• The pico remotes don’t come with brackets for wall mounting installation. Expect to pay another $6 on top of what is a fairly expensive light switch.
• The dimming function is horrible. My Phillips hue and Wemo dimmers provide a nice fade when turning on and off. Not these. Turning off has a fast-but-noticeable dimming function. Turning them on, though, is just on. There’s no gradualness to the lighting, and no way to adjust the speed.
• Turning the lights on from the Pico remotes has a noticeable delay—often making you question if you hit the button at all.
• The app itself is basic to the extreme. You can’t program the Pico remotes, or set the “trim level” of the switches.
They’re installed, and I won’t be uninstalling them. But, at the end of the day, I do not plan on buying more of these to complete my smart home.",2.0 out of 5 stars
M. Pataky,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2018","I bought these thinking to set up the whole house. I'm glad I only bought a couple of switches and the bridge to make sure it works before making a larger order. Long story short, the switches are nice and they dim my Nora LED recessed lights well when operated manually, but it's almost impossible to get the bridge set up so the wifi functionality is non existent. Poor documentation for troubleshooting. I spent hours trying different things, researching documentation on the internet, and calling tech support. It's amazing that a supposedly plug and play product is such a massive fail. I will give it one more try tomorrow and update my review if anything changes. I will also be trying the new Noon home system tomorrow and will give feedback on that one for anyone who may be interested.",2.0 out of 5 stars

But, that's not why I bought it - I bought it so that I can automate my house. The problem is that, unless you like being stuck with Lutron's app, you are not free to integrate it with any third party systems. In fact, Lutron goes out of their way to make sure you cannot!

LoneJohnny5,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2017","Initially put one in my kitchen running dimmable LED bulbs on their very small approved list. Worked perfectly. Easy install (I have deep boxes), including the wireless hub (worked great with their app). The Pico remote is even ""solid"" above their 30' stated limit). But we couldn't find any reasonable priced and available MR16 GU10 LED dimmable bulbs on the approved list when we installed two new ""track lights"", so we went with the Hyperikon offering (same brand as the kitchen bulbs). Sorta' works. The initial install flashed when turned on (albeit the brightness of the flash changed with the dim level). Found no help on the Caseta web site or in google searches. But when we connected only the first set in the circuit, it worked. When we skipped over the first set, running only the second, it worked. But with both sets operational, they flashed. We then moved the wires in the attic around (straightening out the coil of extra-length wire we left in because it was easier than cutting it out), it worked. After several months of use, the kitchen is still solid (would get a 5* rating). But the track lights still go into flash mode every now and then. The other ding is they loudly proclaim ""Alexa compatible"", but neither Caseta nor Alexa gives clear instructions. It took google searches to discover you had to load a ""skill"" in order for Alexa to find the controlled lights. I would buy more of these, and probably will at some point (just so everything is the same), but let the buyer beware that there are issues.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Omar W.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2019","No need for there to be a base. I haven't used any cheap smart light switch but I do have cheap smart plugs and they work fine. I have multiple smart devices such as, wireless cameras (outdoor and indoor), multiple smart plugs (under 10 plugs), Chromecast, multiple laptops and phones connected to my router. It's a tp link cheaper but probably midyear router. Handles all the device just fine. The lutron switch is very high end and I guess simpler because you don't have to correct to negative/white wire. Not that much difficult though if you have the wire accessible. I think this brand is just an expensive alternative to a smart switch. It works smooth and I haven't had a problem but with my experience in all levels of the market with smart devices I don't think I will ever have problems. The only good thing about the base is there's one Central hub for all the smart devices to connect to but I never have had problems with too many devices connected to my router. The devices are marked up by 4x the price I see on Amazon for other brands. I would recommend going with another brand but I guess if you have the money to waste go with this as it would be more supported. Each device is still very expensive so take that into consideration",3.0 out of 5 stars
del,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2022","This is a well made switch that effectively turns lights on and off but lacks critical functionality that should not be absent in a so called ""premium"" product. I bought this to replace a three way setup in my house. The switches are easy to install but the wired dimmer does not resume the previous dimmer setting, instead turning the lights to 100% brightness everytime the switch is cycled on and off. This is a huge issue at night, when you might want to turn on the lights on but not not feel like you are in full daylight. Considering this is a basic functionality of even the cheapest smart switches it is absolutely not acceptable to have this functionality missing and frankly embarrassing considering the price you have to pay (including bridge) to have this setup.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Imadrummer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2017","The good:
Nice looking/feeling switches with good YouTube videos to install on the site, including instructions for replacing 3-way switches. The system has no noticeable lag, and the Hub was extremely plug and play. HomeKit integration is also nice.
The bad:
1)expensive closed system - since the switches are $60 each (or worse), in some areas it's much more economical to use Cree connected bulbs ($14 each) or other solutions. However that means you need a different Hub. That also means you use a different app for those. You could use a wink Hub instead of the Lutron Hub for the switches, but then you loose HomeKit, xfinity home, and other integrations that the Lutron environment supports.
2) Lack of neutral wire connection makes for a bit of confusion on 3-way switch installation. Combined with the bigger issue below, this made it hard as I couldn't tell if my switch wasn't working because I combined the neutral wire in the wrong place or if my LEDs we're screwing up the switch.
The ugly:
Doesn't work with newer LED bulbs (chandelier, led Edison bulbs, etc). You'll get a strobe effect at best, or just no light at all, even when adjusting the Dimmer floor. For a modern switch calling itself LED/CFL comparable, this is disappointing. Even my big overhead can lighting LEDs flicker on occasion.",3.0 out of 5 stars

These come in many different wiring configurations.
1. Ergonomics are atrocious. The buttons are symmetrical, so you can't tell which way is up on the remote. The wall buttons are also symmetrical so it's incredibly easy to hit the wrong button.
2. No memory. There is no slider to set the brightness. So when you turn the light back on, it's full bright. The remote has a middle button returns to some default brightness, but doesn't remember either. I find myself just asking Siri for a specific percentage brightness. Fine.

Cons: This is a huge one for me: the switch FORCES the lights to ""dim off"" (instead of just shutting off normally). If you don't care, maybe it isn't a con, but I find it super annoying.

Midwest Guy,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2023","Overall the Caséta system shows promise. Nicely designed and simple to operate. Cheaper than Hue lights. The smart hub works and provides a few nice features.
However, what you can do with it is very limited. Simple concepts that would require a firmware update or updates to the app, might help and are needed. One example is turning on a light in a room and you almost never want it at full brightness. You can do that with the Pico remote by pressing the middle round button but the main controller that does not have a round button, but is needed to control the light cannot do that. You either turn the light on high (too bright) ot press the up arrow and wait five painful seconds to get the light just right. Could that app allow you to set a maximum brightness? Could one tap of the on button give you one brightness level and a quick second tap take it up to 100%? Those kinds of little details are completely missing from the implementation. Another idea, how about every wall unit having a middle round button that is programmable? One quick tap could turn on the main lights in the room. Two quick taps in a row would turn on all the lights in a room. Great idea, but Caséta has not thought that far ahead.
If these kinds of improvements can't be accomplished with firmware and app updates, then you might want to wait for the second generation of this tech. Or just understand the limitations it currently has. It can turn on and off the lights. It can dim them, although in a painfully slow way. It can set a schedule which is good for security, and you can make up scenes if you don't mind pulling out your phone to execute them or talking to Alexa. If that is enough for you, then enjoy.

Maka Fox,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2017","Nice kit. Installation of switches requires basic electrical skills, but nothing too technical.

The bridge installed without any issues and works flawlessly with its app and Alexa interface. Remotes are a little fiddly to program, but I've seen worse.
The big issue is compatibility with fixtures. If you install these switches with dimmable LEDs, the fixtures must be on the list of compatible equipment provided by Lutron. I tried to use fixtures that were not listed as compatible and ran into serious operational issues (flashing, flickering, unpredictable dimming).

Paul W,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2017","Easy to install and works perfectly with Alexa. Keep a few things in mind:
1) You will have to create a Lutron account (it's free),
2) Don't forget to enable the Caseta Wireless Alexa skill or Alexa won't be able to find the switch! Don't use Lutron Connect.
3) Only one Lutron account is allowed per bridge, so others in the house will need to use that account if they want to control the lights.
4) The bridge will require an outlet, and the included power supply cord is only about three feet long.
5) Turning on the lights without specifying a percent illumination will turn the lights on to 100%. Lutron will not remember the previous setting after turning them off.
6) If you install more than one of these and the partial names have a common word, (e.g. ""bedroom lights"", ""Kitchen lights""), Alexa will ask which one you mean before executing the command. So try to make each device name unique.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Dan,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2019","I had intended, for some time, to install smart lighting - and decided to try the Caseta line after visiting a relative who had this same product installed. So - I picked up the starter kit and a few extra switches. The instructions were clear and simple - just follow along (make sure you turn off the power prior to install) and everything should work perfectly.
Adding additional switches is easy (I have Google home) - once you add them with the Lutron App - just ask google to update the Caseta device and it adds the extra switches.
I also like the ability to set timers on any of the switches. A great option for when you're away - makes it seem like someone is home. Save the hassle of doing it old school - running lamps through the old plug-in timers.
I'll be installing more of these over time for sure.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Tom,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2017","I absolutely love these switches. I started by buying this starter kit to try them out. I have since added 3 more with no intent on stopping until every switch in my house is a Lutron smart switch. I obviously don’t need the dimmer version for every switch, so I have a couple of the non dimming switches for lights that I would never need to dim and for ceiling fans, which work equally as well. I love that they are compatible with HomeKit, allowing me to use Siri to control them. I personally don’t really have a need for the pico remotes that come with this. Anywhere I would have the remote available, I would have my phone available too, so I just use that. They would be very useful to make a “3-way” switch if you wanted to add another wall switch without having to run wiring. This kit, however, does not come with the pico wall mounts.

These switches are more expensive than the GE zwave but well worth it for unique situation where you don’t have a neutral or you need to add remote switches with no wires. They are also very beautiful to look at as well. The led lights have a nice dim green look when the power is off and indicates level when the lights are on.

Arthur Saus,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2020","I have installed these Lutron Caseta smart switches throughout my home. While changing a wall switch may require having an electrician do it, unless the homeowner knows a little bit about wiring switches, the information in the package explains the process clearly if the homeowner wants to tackle it as a do-it-yourself project. Connecting the hub to an existing Cable Modem or Router is an important first step, but it is as easy as connecting it to a LAN port and plugging it in to the electrical outlet. If the idea of controlling lights and fans in the house is appealing, whether at home or even from 100 miles away, this is a great system to do it, and I feel like the installation and set-up is very easy.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Install was straightforward. The one major difficulty was finding lights that would not buzz with these smart dimmers. I found compatibility lists from Lutron and from bulb manufacturers in particular not terribly reliable. By testing a number of lights I settled on Cree 55 kW-equivalent 4"" recessed light trim kits.

Nikki Miller,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2023","I really wanted these switches for my living room light and foyer light during my irrational ""nesting phase"" of pregnancy and I'm so glad they worked out like I thought they did! Smart switches turned out to be a better fit for us because they don't die like smart bulbs so you shouldn't have to replace them, and they still turn on with voice control or scheduled routines even if the switch accidentally gets flipped down.
For installation, definitely read the instructions and follow the video. My husband and father in law tried to wing it and it took them a few hours to figure out until they followed the instructions and then it was much smoother going. Also, we incorrectly assumed that if we didn't have dimmable bulbs then that feature just wouldn't work and the switches would be limited to just on and off. We were wrong; you must have dimmable bulbs for these to work properly. With regular bulbs, they were stuck at about 25% brightness. Once we changed the bulbs, everything worked as it should.
Now it is GREAT to have our lights turn on in the morning so we can see as we pack our baby up for daycare and great to have the lights on when we get home in the evenings. I set these 2 routines up with Alexa, but the Lutron app seems like it could schedule this easily as well.
Being able to tell Alexa to dim, brighten, turn on/off the lights when your hands are full with a baby is a God send and I truly think this is something that should be on the radar of more parents to be. I can already see upgrading bedroom and hall and bathroom lights on for when my baby is older so everything turns on to get her up at put of bed in the morning and yet I never have to worry about lights accidentally being left on all day.

Edward McTigue,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2022",My home wiring wasn't made for the newer devices so these really help me integrate my home. These switches and controllers need a hub to operate (Wish they could find a way to integrate with the echo directly).,5.0 out of 5 stars
Gilbert Davis,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2022","These are fast and reliable switches, easy integration with Home Assistant. No neutral wire needed",5.0 out of 5 stars
Lance_big_daddy,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2022","These are the best smart home switches I have ever used, and I've been into it since the early 2000's. These are responsive and reliable. The only missing feature is dim level memory or a way to set a default dim level. I LOVE LOVE LOVE that they can operate without a neutral since one of my switches is a switch loop.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Staci Lewis White,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022",Love these switches. Had them installed when I did a kitchen remodel and just ordered a set for my parents as well. They are wonderful and work with Alexa. I highly recommend them.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Kev,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2022","I have over 30 Lutron Caseta items now... mainly lightswitches/dimmers. I hooked up some Lutron Serena Shades as well. I can't speak highly enough about the brand. I have had ZERO issues with their products. Bullet-proof connection, consistent performance, and a great app with great features like scheduling, random away modes, etc.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Steve Murphy,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2022",I had installed several lutron dimmers and Serena shades. They worked well with wink but when wink became unreliable this hub made the switch from wink to the Amazon echo a breeze.,5.0 out of 5 stars
LATOYA,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2022",Ive been on a mission replacing all my current switches at home with Lutron Caseta Smart Switches and I made the start with this set as it came with the hub and have since grown my project to 18 Caseta switches and counting. I love the brand and the reliability it offers. I haven't had any issues since I've started using the system months ago. I have purchased all the face plates from the Lutron Claro line to complete the look. They are a bit pricey so I purchase them piece by piece. Im almost complete and so happy I chose Lutron.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Elvin,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2022","These are a great solution for your smart home lighting needs. I started my smart home journey with a lutron dimmer and fan control. I now have the hub and several other switches. They are a bit more pricier than others but they are a high quality product. When paired with a solid network, there’s almost no lag when using the lutron app, pico remotes, and Alexa voice to control the lights. I’ve never had a device disconnect. The install was a breeze. The dimmers and fan control were easier than a normal switch install! The instructions are clear and straightforward. Highly recommend",5.0 out of 5 stars

Orlando,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2022","Good-looking switches! I know, sounds weird but they do look amazing. They were easy to install. Also, the hub and mobile app were easy to set up. The included instructions were pretty clear and straightforward. Finally, the pico remotes are super convenient, especially for the dining table, hehehe.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Leo,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2022","Got two switches to start out, both with remotes. Some how one remote paired with two switches. Not a big deal. I tried using the second light switch to control my ceiling fan, but the fan made a weird noise. I'll find another use for the switch, likely adding more in the future.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jon Karner,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2022","A great solution to remote control or adding a 3 or 4-way without more wire.
I would suggest placing the remote at the most used location because of the 50% light button on the remote.
Remotes that save scenes (light levels) available.
App easy to use with scene/timer function.
Works well with Apple home widgets.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Richard Huynh,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2022",It works! Just moved into a new home and sometimes very bright warm lighting isn't ideal. I have recessed lighting and the system worked great! I like to break my lighting evenly so I can fall asleep easier and not strain my eyes. And since the switch is far from where my bed is I can either use the pico remote or Alexa to control the lights and take them down a little. Would recommend this highly if you have access to the fuse panel within your home.and only takes about 10 to 15 minutes if done right.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Hans,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2022","If you are looking for ‘no neutral’ devices, there is nothing that comes close to Lutron. I’ve tried other brands just for kicks and most flat-out don’t function at all. Yes, Lutron is a tad bit more expensive but is the only I’ve found to work every time - and that matters",5.0 out of 5 stars
Joe M.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2022","I'll keep this as short and sweet as possible. I'm very familiar doing electrical work so I found installation to be a breeze. As for the functionality, I just love being able to control my lights just using my phone. I don't use Alexa or Siri or any other voice-activated helper, so I can't say how well it works with those, but I love being able to control my lights from the comfort of my bed using my phone or the Pico Remote instead of having to get up and walk to the doorway to switch off or dim the lights. It's definitely nice for those times when you watch one too many episodes on Netflix, stayed up way later than you should have, and start feeling pretty drowsy at night. Excellent product!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Emmanuel,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2022","This is great, though you only need the in wall switch and the remote, if you want to controll with alexa and phones then get this but i only use the ones i mentioned, i love this, lazy +1",5.0 out of 5 stars
