Chris_in_MA,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2018","Short & Sweet - For what it is, this device is amazing. Performance is quick, audio is great, and the built-in Zigbee hub works quite well.

Longer Review;

After dragging my heels for over a year, I finally bought our first Echo (2nd Generation) back in August. I loved it so much that I got us 2 more for other areas in the house. Being able to group them and play the same music or audio throughout the house is a novelty that won't grow old for me. I've only wished that they had a little more full sound, especially at higher volume. I'd considered the last Echo Plus, but the average of reviews I read didn't make it appear to perform significantly better than our already great 2nd Generation Echos.

When I saw this new Echo Plus listed, I pre-ordered it to ""replace"" the Heather Grey Echo in our kitchen and move that one to our bedroom. We tend to have music playing in the kitchen more than any other room, and I wanted slightly better sound than the regular Echo in there. I'm honestly glad we took a chance on this device without any reviews to go by.

Appearance;

As you can see in the photos, it's pretty much identical in height to the 2nd Generation Echo. It is a bit wider to accommodate the larger speakers, and the top is slightly domed instead of being flat. A similar 7-microphone array is on top and they seem to work just as well. There also appears to be a tripod-style connector on the base of the unit.

Setup;

Setup was surprisingly easy as this Echo Plus detected our network settings on its own. I plugged it in, it did its initial startup, and then told me the device was connected. Simple as that.

Audio compared to 2nd Generation Echo;

Highs are clearer.
Mids are more natural and better-defined.
Lows are deeper.
Overall volume is noticeably louder and sound quality is improved.
When paired with our other Echos, music and audio is in sync everywhere and this device stands out above the others in audio performance.

General Performance;

We have a quick network and I don't notice any perceivable performance difference between this new Echo Plus and our regular 2nd Generation Echos. Everything seems to work as it should.

I bought this with the ""free"" Philips Hue bulb promotion. This bulb is our first Zigbee device and works very well with the Echo Plus. It is easily controlled by either the Echo Plus or the other Echos we have in the house. I'll be keeping an eye out for deals on these bulbs in the future. Like our other Echos, it also has no problem controlling our Kasa Smart Plugs.

Overall;

While $150 is a lot for a single speaker, for what I was looking for, this thing excels. If you like the 2nd Generation Echo but hoped it sounded a bit better, I would highly recommend this. Based on what I've read, if you were disappointed with the audio performance with the 1st Generation Echo Plus but want everything else it had to offer, consider giving this wonderful speaker a try.

P.S.: The internal ambient temperature sensor seems fairly accurate and nice to have included.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jazzyguy,"Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2019","I bought this speaker on a whim. I'm already the owner of a couple of Echo Dots. I have one paired with a Samsung sound bar in my living room. I had the other connected to a Vaux speaker in my bedroom. I was fine. I didn't need to buy the Echo Plus. Or so I thought.Yesterday, my girlfriend bribed me to go shopping with her at an outlet mall by telling me I could have free reign in the Bose store located there. I was pretty impressed by the Bose Home 500. Great bass. Exceptional stereo separation. Very large price tag—even the factory referbished model which I was considering buying. Ultimately, the price tag, as well as some unresolved questions I had concerning compatibility with other devices caused me not to purchase the Bose speaker. But it did get me to thinking. Could I get more premium sound in my bedroom? Could I get better sound out of my Amazon Fire enabled TV?Initially, I planned to buy the Echo Plus directly from Amazon, but I elected to buy it from Best Buy, because I would've had to wait for three days for Amazon to ship it to me. We do live in an age of instant gratification, don't we?I got the tiny Amazon Plus home, unboxed it, and had basic setup completed within two minutes. Following that, I paired it with my Amazon Fire enabled TV, and I started putting the speaker through its paces.Overall, the sound quality is very good. Not exceptional, but very good. The bass is punchy and loud. The stereo separation is underwhelming, but the quality itself almost makes up for that. With a little tweaking of the bass, mid, and trebble settings, I was able to get the speaker to sound more than acceptable at all volume levelsAfter playing with the TV a bit, the next task was to add the speaker to my media groups. Nothing could ever have been simpler. I then set about pairing the Plus with my outdoor speakers—a pair of Sound Appeals which I also bought from Amazon. Again, almost too easy. Then I paired the Plus with the water proof bluetooth speaker I use in my shower. Easy again. Best of all: The plus automatically connects to the TV and the additional speakers whenever I turn them on.My next task will be to pair the device with the free smart bulb I received with my purchase. I anticipate no problems.Bottom line: Great sound and easy and versatile connectivity for a great price. I could not be ghappier!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Homer,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2018","I am a huge fan of the Echo. I have the tap, the dot, the standard Echo and an Echo smart speaker, and now the plus.

This one is definitely a step up. The best sound and response of all the previous models.

In a nut shell
The dot is ok. Limited quality sound but small and unobtrusive. Nice for a bedside alarm, weather information and morning news while shaving.

The tap is the portable and battery powered option that I use in the morning. I listen to a streaming cable news show. I listen to it while in the shower, (it is not waterproof but I have a shelf far from water that it sits on), then while I shave, and I put it in the closet while getting ready and dressed. It's like a portable radio but it allows me to stream internet cable and listen to anything I want.

The standard Echo and Echo with smart options is a great device. The addition of the smart features is ok. It allows you to turn on lights and fixtures, but going into a dark room and saying, ""Alexa, turn on lights!"" is not as easy as flipping a switch. It is ok for lights that are not near the bed and your heading to sleep. But, you'll wake people up by shouting the wake up command.

This one is good for two reasons:
1.) The sound is great. Better than the others.
2.) I got a smart switch and can use it to turn on any number of devices. The hook up was easy and flawless.

Also,
Alexa is adding new skills. If you use a sound machine, she has a sound maker for sleeping. Wake up to the weather, the stock market, the news, a fact from history, and a joke of the day.

If you are on the cusp of buying this device, making this your first Echo would be a great choice. If you have an Echo or tap, this is a good upgrade.",5.0 out of 5 stars
J. C. Lindy,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2020","I love having my Echo in the kitchen where I can listen to music (great speaker quality including bass!), podcasts, baseball games or news. I have used it to remind me of important meetings, check the weather, and of course, check the progress of ordered Amazon items. I also have 4 Echo Dots and an Echo show in the the house and it's been very nice to be able to link them and play music all over the house while I am cleaning or check in on the grandkids playing upstairs and call them down for dinner. It is also linked to our Ring doorbell which is very helpful because we have the system but no extra chimes so it alerts us through our iPads and phones which sometimes are set on mute and so fail to alert us of someone at the door. The Echos are much better for that, and that skill was easy to enable. We bought one for our mountain cabin, and I even talked to my husband there from home without a phone, because the Dot there is connected to our account. We can also listen for any activity there. My Echo Dot in the patio room helped me when I was accidentally locked out of the house without my phone. Luckily the patio window was open so I just called through it to Alexa to call my husband to come back to the house to let me in. I keep thinking this would have so helped to have when my father-in-law was alive. We tried to get him to wear a life alert after a few dangerous falls, but could never convince him. We could have set him up on internet (which he would never want on his own) linked a few dots and if he fell, if he could still speak, he could call us, OR we could check in on him and if he didn't respond, we could call for help. I mention this in case someone reads this who has an elderly relative who is resistant to using those other systems. Overall, I love the Echo Devices and find I am discovering more and more helpful functions they perform.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2019","Pro bundle with Sub Overview

Pro: Quality Built, Quality Sound, Functionality, Small form factor, Volume (low and high), Perfect amount of Base

Cons: Connecting all three to act like a system is finicky and dosen't work when you set it as an alarm. Only will play off one so you miss out on some of the rich sound when waking up. But a plus since it isn't as loud.

Long Review:
I have to say these are amazing. I have had a lot of amazon products and these surprised me the moment I started them up. First off these get loud for their size and the audio clarity is amazing. They are crisp, clear and sound amazing. Now if you like heavy heavy base then these aren't the speakers for you. I bought the package with 2 speakers and the sub and they are perfect for me. The base is well controlled and gives the sound that is lacking in many speakers but if you want the base to shake the walls and make it sound like a floor speaker with a 12 inch amplified drum then don't try. But if you are looking for a clean, rich, bold and sophisticated listening experience then these are amazing. Much better than anything I have tried in the $350 price point.

If you want something that is loud, base heavy with good high and mid tones better than this then look at spending 700 or more. I listen to everything from classical music to EDM, Rock, rap, pop, country, jazz and folk and these just keep impressing me. The vocals aren't drowned out and you can hear all the instruments and the base fills in the lows at the perfect listening experience.

Summary: If you are looking for rich, deep, bold music this is the set for you. Better than anything in the 350 to 450 market. (I have tried 20 in this market) If you are looking for wall pounding, rave quality base then you better live on your own or in a frat house cause more than this you will need a floor speaker with amplifier and thick walls. PS I own a full amplified speaker set housed in my living room for when I was in college and a fraternity. Nothing against them but horrible for all day listening and having friends over to talk and not drink all day haha

Note: I have both echos and the sub in my bedroom and the room is too small for all 3. I barley raise the volume past level 3, maybe 4 if I am listening to them in the shower. I moved them to my living room for the pre and post Superbowl party and they filled a medium 4 bedroom 3 bath house with crystal clear music.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Eddie Jay,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2019","Enough has been written about the Echo Plus that I don’t need to go over all of its features. I will say in general that it looks cool, sounds fine (maybe a 5 out of 10 compared to real speakers), the music playing capabilities are excellent with Amazon, Apple, Pandora, and Spotify, and the voice recognition is ok - good not great. I had no problem connecting to a Phillips Hue bulb and eventually an Echo dot and a smart outlet. I use all the time to play music and radio, control lights, and make shopping lists. I bought on sale at the end of 2018 for $97.99 which I think was a great deal.

That said, I want to focus in on a four major issues that I wish I’d known about before buying:

1. Podcasts
There is no native podcast skill on Alexa so you need to get podcasts through TuneIn, Stitcher, iHeartRadio, etc. All my other devices (computer, mobile) are Apple products where I use the Podcast app to listen and sync. The podcasts I listen to are not all on any one of these skills so I would need to download all the ones I need to keep podcasts synced between Alexa and my iPhone which is too much trouble. Plus I have a heck of the time trying to tell Alexa what podcast I want to listen to - who remembers the episode titles or numbers of the podcast they are currently listening to? Even just asking it to play the latest episode of a podcast wasn’t working for me 9/10 times so I just gave up and figured I will connect my iPhone over Bluetooth when I want to continue a podcast. But that brings me to my next issue:

2. Bluetooth connections
I was successful at pairing the Echo to both my iPhone and iPad but Alexa can’t connect to the one I want when I ask it to. If I ask to “connect to my iPhone”, it connects to my iPad. If I ask it to “connect to my phone”, it still connects to my iPad. The only way to get it to connect to my iPhone with a voice command is to turn Bluetooth off on my iPad - annoying!

3. Multiple users
This is a big one. It is great that the Echo can have multiple users on it, so my wife and I can share the Echo using our separate accounts which are linked in Prime under the same household. You can even set it up to recognize each of your separate voices. However, ONLY THE PRIMARY ACCOUNT CAN CONTROL THE SMART HOME DEVICES. This means that if I want to control the lights and the Echo is set to use my account, I have to tell it to switch to my wife’s account first, then give it a command for the lights. Furthermore, you have command it to switch between accounts to use your personal skills and settings. Given that it can recognize my voice as distinct from my wife’s, I thought that if I asked to play something on Pandora, it would automatically play from my account. Nope - I need to tell it to switch from my wife’s account to my account, and then ask it to play something on Pandora. Want to turn the lights down? Have to switch back to my wife’s account. Want to play something else on my Pandora? Have to switch back to my account first. What is the point of having voice recognition if it can’t automatically detect who is speaking and use that person’s account? And what is so useful about having multiple accounts if they can’t both control the smart home devices? I can't control the smart home devices from my app, only my wife can, and I can't set up routines either. And last, there are some things I would like to be discrete to my account only - like shopping lists and reminders - but those have to be shared, so my wife’s Alexa app on her phone is getting reminders that I set up. There are some major kinks here they need to work out, but the good news is that it’s all just software fixes so GET ON IT AMAZON!

4. Routines
Another big one here. There is a well-documented glitch that people experience with Echos where the music stops playing after one song. You have to ask it to keep playing in order to keep going to the next song. If you google “echo stops playing” you will see lots of discussion around this. Well we had it happen to us as soon as we set up routines. Routines are little scripts you can set up - actions Alexa can take when certain criteria are met. This is one of the primary reasons we went with the Plus instead of the Dot. We have pets in the house and we wanted to set up a routine where the Echo would send us an alert if the house temperature got above or below a certain amount. Well unfortunately as soon as we set up the routines, the Echo started doing the thing where it stops playing after one song. So we deleted the routines and reset the Echo and the problem has not come back. But now I am afraid to set up any routines because I don’t want to deal with the music playback issue. I hope they fix this glitch because not having routines is a big drawback.

5. Alexa Guard
I was also excited to learn that the Alexa Guard feature can alert you if it hears broken glass or smoke alarm sounds. But it’s not available yet. Still waiting for that.

If I knew someone interested in buying an Echo, I would recommend they try an earlier generation Echo Dot which you can get on craigsist for $20-30 and see how you like that before spending $150 on the latest Echo Plus. Too many bugs still need to be fixed.",4.0 out of 5 stars
James Aldrich,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2019","Hello All,

I received my Echo Plus on October 7th. It was so easy to set up for the most part. I plugged it in and in a few short minutes, it was online ready to play! The sound for its small size was awesome~! I wouldn't think one would want much more than that right? I purchased this unit since I wanted Alexa to speak the indoor temperature. I tried saying or doing a number of things but the indoor temperature eluded me. I imagined having a device which wouldn't need outdoor wired or wireless probes with batteries. I would already have accurate outdoor temperature info as well as the indoor temperature and no need for probes of any kind. I think I spent hours trying to get the indoor temperature to speak with Alexa. I could go into the Alexa App select the echo plus and read the indoor temperature through my phone, So why couldn't she speak the indoor temperature! I learned later that a sensor had to be activated. It's a shame that Alexa couldn't have activated the Sensor. An Amazon help person tried to tell me what I needed to find but I think I was dealing with graphics. I am totally blind and use voiceover on my IPhone. I couldn't find the sensor or anything else to activate the indoor temperature so it would speak. I watched some youtube videos but none of these helped. Perhaps I'll approach disability services to see if they know of a solution to this! I deregistered the echo plus from my account and put it back in the box. If I can't find any solution for finding the sensor and turning on the indoor temperature, the echo plus is heading back to Amazon. I'll stay with my tried and true echos.

Jim

I am happy to say that I didn’t send my Echo plus back after all! I removed it from its box before registering to my account again! At first, I couldn’t see the indoor temperature on my phone. I planned to call disability services. Four hours later, I checked my phone after selecting the Echo Plus and saw the indoor temperature again! I thought I’d get brave and ask Alexa to give me the inside temperature. I said, echo, temperature inside! She spoke it to my relief! I also said, Echo, inside temperature. She repeated it again! I was pleased! Something may not have been right in the first registration or I wasn’t giving her the right verbage! I don’t know what happened for certain! I didn’t have to activate anything! It worked right away! I didn’t call disability services. My wife has ordered another one which will be used upstairs!

Long live the echo plus! Hope this or another generation of the echo plus with built on in hub will be available for a long time! The indoor temperature is an excellent feature!

Alan,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2019","Sound Quality is an improvement to the 2nd gen echo. After about 2 weeks of moderate usage at 60-70% volume the speaker has sounded better than it did day one, as most speakers need time to break-in.

Comparing it to the 2nd gen echo you can definitely hear a difference. There is a bit more low end compared to the 2nd however, I find the mid range to be more refined on the 2nd gen as the 3rd gen has more low end and high end sound.

To get this straight. This speaker isn’t meant to provide room filling rich sound as it is only a single firing 3 inch woofer and a tweeter enclosed in a compact plastic housing. If your looking at rich sounding sound docks, bose soundtouch 20 or 30 would fulfill that much better and even though those are more room filling as well, audiophiles will still find it much suited to having an actual speaker and amp setup. I myself am considered an audio snob and I love playing around with audio equipment.

I’m not going to compare the echo to a proper 7.2.2 channel setup but compare it to speakers in its class. Being that this is an Amazon Alexa Device it is a very useful tool in addition to your smartphone. I currently have 6 echos throughout the house and they do what they are supposed to do and that is having voice commands for lights and even notifications for your ring system as well as other smart devices you link to your Alexa account. Having the ability to connect Bluetooth to your phone is great as well if your not looking for a portable battery powered Bluetooth speaker.

My main reason for purchasing this echo is the new speaker which attracted me to purchasing this and I mainly use it only in the kitchen as having background music and being able to control lights and sound while working on other things. Sound is great for the kitchen and it is plenty loud enough with very balanced sound and I find the bass to be good for it’s size. I would like to put my bose soundtouch in the kitchen but it takes up too much room and I can just place this in a corner and it’s compact enough that you won’t have to worry about knocking it over. However I have setup my echo dot onto a sound dock and linked the multi room audio so I can have music playing through Apple Music in all rooms through the echos which I think is what sets this speaker apart from let’s say the much more expensive Sonos or Bose Soundlinks. Only downside I wish I could do is have Bluetooth work with multi audio instead of having to play playlists or through other streaming services on the echo.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Ritvik N,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2020","I bought this mostly to supplant my 3rd gen Echo Dot (actually I'm moving that to another room) - also the fact that the Echo was on sale at a reasonably modest price didn't hurt either. For this price tag though, I would expect this Echo to slightly over-perform on 2 latest generation Echo Dots (as of current price, this Echo is a little over twice the cost of an Echo Dot) - does it deliver on this front though? My opinion is somewhat of a mixed bag on this. Keeping in mind I've only had this Echo for the weekend, but I certainly wouldn't say that it ""overperforms"" versus 2 Echo Dots. At best it probably has the power - in terms of speaker decibel and voice range, I suppose - of 1 and 1/2 Echo Dots. So possibly in the end I would peg it as worth 1.5 echo dots, when costwise its definitely around 2.5 echo dots. However, I think I wouldn't grade this Echo harshly purely for that reason. The speaker volume is still fine, and I'm not sure about the hearing range as that was a concern of mine going in - our house living room is somewhat sprawling, and sometimes echo dot can't hear me - but on the box I read it listens in a ""far-field"" range, whatever the heck that means, and overall I would say the hearing range is slightly improved over the echo dot. So already it recuperates on the 1 star that I would otherwise take off for its speaker - I would bring that down to 1/2 star down so far though.

The main minus point to me is the Alexa integration. This is truthfully not a problem with the Echo at all, but with Alexa itself. Alexa is still somewhat primitive, I would liken it to a conversational Neanderthal human I suppose, so it doesn't really do many useful things for me at present. Of the things it can do, it's sometimes frustrating to use it. To give a few examples:

* It commonly misinterprets what I would say, perhaps of my accent (I am to blame here I suppose, as well?) even though I have set up my voice profile on Alexa app. I've also set up voice profile of another household member, but when they confirm it with ""Alexa, do you know who I am?"" it responds with ""I'm not sure, but you're on <my name>'s account"". I understand it's a continuously learning and evolving software or something, so I suppose that doesn't really warrant any stars to be taken off at this point, at least by itself. The real kicker is it responds really stupidly to some common questions you might ask a (presumably) smart AI. For instance, we were worried our dog might have a concussion as she hit her head while running around in a dog park. ""Alexa, what's a concussion?"" got us some drawling utter rubbish about a movie or some piece of entertainment which we don't want to know. Follow this by an ""Alexa, stop that"", wait 2 more boring second, and follow that up with a slightly reworded ""Alexa, what's a medical concussion?"" and finally it spit it out a (reasonably) favorable answer. It still didn't give us a short abbreviated and useful headline though - Google on my phone had it beat in that regards. Another mildly annoying thing is it prefixed its long drawn out response with a ""here's, what I found, on <source>"". Alexa, goddammit it, it's a simple question, I don't honestly care where you find it. I suppose this might be useful in the interests of complete transparence, but often times I wouldn't care to hear it. I mean, I can just whip out my phone and type in ""concussion"" on Google and scroll to read the headline under the top result by the time she gets to the part of it that i want to hear. I would take off 0.5 stars for just Alexa being Alexa and inconveniencing me by either misinterpreting or just ignoring me when I ask her something (this happened to someone else in my household as well). Sometimes blue light goes when I say ""Alexa"" and it immediately turns off, sending everything else I say that follows the wake word into a black hole of oblivion, for all intents and purposes. I would just hope it gets a little more intuitive, and less stressful, to use Alexa voice control in the future.

* I set up an Alexa-sourced contact (in the Alexa app) and gave it the name, shall we say for an example sake, of ""Joodas"" (this is based on how you'd pronounce a name, here 'Judas'). I have an existing contact in my phone under the name ""Judas Johnson Barber Shop"" (just a fake name, but assume it's just anything starting with the key word). After I set this up, when I speak ""Alexa, call Joodas"" (again, spelled how you'd pronounce it) to call the new Alexa-sourced contact, I would expect it to follow through on this unambiguous command without requiring any confirmation of any sort - right? Unfortunately, Alexa is not very bright on this. Instead, it asks me, ""Judas Johnson Barber Shop, right?"" I'm a little pissed here, because I just created a contact that is spelled exactly how you'd pronounce 'Judas'. But Alexa, under no circumstances, will ever use that contact - it's fixated on my old ""Judas Barber Shop"" contact for some reason. So fast forward, me trying a couple things. I added an underscore to my existing phone contact, (foolishly) thinking it would stop Alexa from following the trial that really leads nowhere good. Instead, in response to my request to call Joodas, she instead prompts, ""underscore Judas Johnson Barber Shop, right?"" I'm slowly but incrementally getting a bit more pissed, and someone else suggests me to reorganize the words in the contact itself. So yeah, a little bit painful (and not my ideal solution at all), but I rename the said phone contact to ""Johnson Judas Barber Shop"". FINALLY, Alexa starts responding as expected when I say to call Joodas. However, I would note she does prompt me to confirm: ""Joodas, right?"" Yes, my dear Alexa, there is only one contact in my phone by that name, and I recently added it to the Alexa app itself (not even as a nickname, just the name of the contact itself!) So yeah, all in all, not my greatest experience - or my greatest moment either, judging from how I handled it. I would translate that to maybe 0.2 off my rating on this.

* Setting cooking timer with ""Alexa, set a timer for <duration>"" sometimes misfires, requiring Alexa to reprompt ""Ok, for how long?"". After timer expires, I realized after a while she does this weird thing where her blue light keeps glowing, and she plays some beep sound really really softly. For the life of me I can't understand why the timer alarm is so soft. I couldn't barely hear it one of the times, but luckily someone else hear it and they cancelled the alarm. I really have no clue why it's so hard to hear it, even on high volume.

* There are a few other issues that we might have experienced but I can't remember off the top my head.

Overall, I would giving this a rating of 3.8 / 5. But for fairness sake I have round it to 4 star, and also as most of my complaints are to Alexa and not the Echo device itself. For the Echo, I would also rate it as a solid 4. Most of the rating that I took off is due to its pricing as I do not believe it is worth 2.5 echo dots as it is currently. However, it's still a solid device and I suppose a little better than the echo dot that we previously had, at least. I don't really notice a huge difference, however. Still, can't really go wrong with a device like the Echo though - I would say that it does well for the features that it is touted to have. Overall, i would rate it as a ""meh"", but end up saying that in a slightly spirited and uplifting voice, so it's definitely a step up from the 3rd gen echo dot at least.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Cathy,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2019","Sometimes when you ask a person question, Echo will but into conversation and answer even though you never said ""Alexa"". She is getting better. One thing you should know if you own any Hub whether it is an Echo, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, or whatever people will hear you even if you think the speaker is off. I just think you should know that.

Personally, I feel since they can listen in on you with your cell phones what does it matter. You can always unplug, and turn off your internet. If you do research about this on the net try using .gov, .org. , or .edu websites. I learned in school these are more likely to be true.

So, why get a Hub? I love it because it makes life a lot easier. If I want to know anything, I ask my Google hub ( she knows more info because she is better with web searching than Alexa). If I want to spell something I ask Alexa (she is a better speller).

You can use any hub to ask about weather, how to cook something, games, read you a book, play music, news, turn on/off smart stuff like... plugs, lights, thermostats, TV, coffee makers, dryer/washers etc.... It can work smart cameras, smart beds. You can ask, is the back bedroom light on, They are coming out with new stuff for them to do all the time. I can't wait until they come out with a ""clean my house"" command. lol Also, you can call someone ( I often call my own phone because I lost it in the house lol ) ETC....

Please note, I do feel it is dangerous to let a smart device control locks, garage doors, cameras in your home, or anything else that might be a security threat. As you know there are a lot of hackers out there that are willing to take advantage of others. Even the cops are hacking ring door bells ( the Washington Post had written an article about it).

I own two of the Echo Plus (2nd Gen), one Echo Dot (3rd Gen), 2 Google Homes, and 2 Google Minis. Ok - I admit I went a little over board . lol

Things to know...

1. When you buy Alexa you can hook her up to your Amazon acct. I like doing that online when I am buying it.

2. However, once you get an Alexa, and plug it in at home, the Alexa will ask you about hooking up to your voice, to account. If you say yes, Alexa tries to sell you stuff a lot. Example: I asked for the price of Duct tape, and Alexa said, ""I put the Duct tape in your shopping cart"". So, I feel it's better just to hook it up online only, and not hook it up to your voice after you have it at your house.

3. Alexa can start off very buggy. However, if she is buggy after about 17, or 18 days Alexa works out many of her bugs.

4. If you get Alexa, I would recommend getting Prime membership. If you do have an Amazon Prime membership you will get a lot of songs. However, some you have to pay another yearly fee, on top of your Amazon Prime membership fee. Ouch!

5. For keeping cost down I feel that the Google is better.
Google Home gives you a lot of free stuff like bedtime stories, music, ETC. Where Alexa you have to pay for just about everything. The more stuff you get the more it will add up. An example is Alexa bed time stories are $79.99 plus tax a year if you are a Prime member. If you are not, it will cost you $99.98 plus tax. Again Amazon-Ouch!

However, if I had a lot of money, I think I would like Alexa a little bit better than Google. Tough call.

If you want to read more about the Google, and Alexa because you don't know what you want than read below. Hope this helps...

Compare Amazon Alexa hubs to Google hubs.

Google is easier to use because it understands more words, and phrases.

The Echo Plus sounds better than the Google Home. So, if you want great sound with Google Home, you might want to get a good speaker for it. The sound is really I'm All Bout That Bass, Bout That Bass (I mean it's all about the speaker quality). Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

You will find that there are some songs Amazon doesn’t have at all no matter what you pay. They are normally the rare songs. One example is Night Beach by Dream Singer.

While Google Home, works with every song out there that can be downloaded for free. Just pick a song you own from your iTunes, computer, or whatever song that you already paid for, and upload it yourself for free (easy to do, just YouTube it). After that you can create your own playlist.

Google has a lot more choices when it comes to making up routines. Google also has quiz games that you can have more than one player. Google ask you how many people are playing each time . Alexa does have quiz games, but they are only for one player unless you add MultiPlayer Skill. Even with adding MultiPlayer you have to ask Alexa before starting the game. If you don't ask Alexa in the right way, she gets mixed up.

Alexa has more brand name smart devices, but not more kinds of devices. Example: Alexa will work with an Foscam security camera, and Google will not. However, there are plenty of security cameras that work with both Google Home, and Alexa. So, they both work the same kind of stuff.

The Echo Plus (it must be the plus that has the thermostat in it) can tell you room temp. The Google doesn't do the room temp. However, you can buy a smart thermostat for your home to hook up to the Google. They both will tell you the outside temp.

Google tracks packages throw Gmail, so it can be ant package, but it is tricky to set a Google Home up to Gmail. Alexa tracks only Amazon packages. Alexa lets you know when you have a package at your door from Amazon by a lighted ring on top of the device.

I feel Alexa can be nosey, and rude. One example: Once it asked me if I had a tattoo, and I said that's a personal question. Then it asked ""what kind of tattoo do you have?"" Then I said you shouldn't be asking questions like that. Then it said that it wanted a black bird tattoo.

The point is that It assumed that I had a tattoo, and would not drop the subject. It will ask you a lot of questions if you let it, so it knows what stuff to try to sell you. I have learned to watch what I say, so there is not as much sales pressure. Also, I say ""Alexa Stop"" about two or three times in a row. That way it stops talking.

The Home Google is very polite. Also, it doesn't try to sell stuff to you. I hope Home Google stays that way.

Both Alexa, and Home Google have improved over time, and still are improving. They will keep trying to outdo each other. I do like having both of them. I hope this helps.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Macho,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2024","I’ve had this Alexa for 4 years now and it works as if it just came out the box. It is used daily. I have a PC and monitor that I have connected to it, along with misc. things like lights. Once in a blue moon I may have a connectivity issue with the PC, however it is easily fixed via trial and error. I use it as a speaker for this setup, whether it be for YouTube, movies, or simply music. It’s a sleek design, looks nice in any setup. Good value, especially with the price of everything nowadays!

Craig M Moore,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2018","I want to start off by saying that I love Amazon as a company, so this isn't a hate review on Amazon. BUT, I do feel deceived by amazon on this.

The Echo Plus does have a ""smart hub"" that uses Zigbee to connect to various smart home devices. HOWEVER, the Echo Plus can only utilize the PHILLIPS HUE system in a limited capacity. In order to get full use out of the HUE bulbs, you still have to buy the HUE BRIDGE.

What you can do with the Echo Plus alone:
1. Voice Control the lights.
2. Change the color of the lights by voice, BUT you are limited to about 20 colors instead of the ""16 million colors"" that the HUE bulbs are capable of.
3. You can set routines and groups, which is nice.

What you CANT do without the HUE Bridge:
1. Compatibility with many more sensors
2. The ability to automate and set scenes
3. get system updates over the air and future features.
4. Have your lights sync with music
5. Probably more, but I can't remember.

Also, if you change devices, or switch to a HUE hub, odds are you will have to redo all of your lights.

What bothers me more than anything is that the product page for the Echo Plus CLEARLY states compatibility with the HUE system, and even use the HUE APP logo as shown in the picture. That's great, except that you MUST have a HUE BRIDGE to use the app, which is another $50-60 on top of the already expensive investment of the bulbs.
Craig
I would like to see Amazon clarify that the HUE BRIDGE is necessary for the full HUE system, but I doubt it will happen. Alternatively, I would to see them bundle the Echo Plus and HUE together so that you can get the full system right out of the box.

JacobDrJ,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2024","I bought a pair of these a few years ago to use in stereo configuration as an upgrade to my 2nd gen echo dot and 1st gen echo classic.

I never kept this configuration, as having these 2 speakers synchronize was very flakey, and when they did work, didn't provide enough of a benefit for my non-audiophile family members who primarily use these.

Instead, I split the pair up, and gave one to each kid who wanted one.

This has been fine.

Usually sound very good to our ears, and with some quirks having to do with the music occasionally going to the wrong device, mostly these have been a nice experience with a family Amazon Music subscription.

With that said, I decided to try one of these speakers for use in my office, to boost the sound from my anemic laptop speakers, using the aux-in/line-in functionality.

However, I discovered that, unlike the 2nd generation echo dot, this 3rd generation echo is very quiet when a line in aux in is inserted. You can't just increase the volume, as that would cause the Alexa functionality to become unbearably loud.

It took a long time, and support unfortunately offered no help, but I just discovered a solution from the Amazon community messageboard:

You must go into the Amazon Alexa app on your phone.
Find the device whose Aux-In is too quiet.
Go to that device's settings.
Under 'General' select 'Sounds'.
Under 'Alarms, Timers, And Notifications' increase the volume to maximum.
Go back to save the settings.

And that's it!
Now the Line In is much louder, without the Alexa functionality becoming too loud.

This increased my appreciation and utility of this smart speaker.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Shmooty,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2020","Originally, I bought an Echo dot a few years ago to help in the kitchen by providing a nifty way to set multiple countdown cooking timers. Then during Quarantine this year I read an Amazon article about hue wireless bulbs and I thought ""how cool is that"". So about $700 and 8 bulbs, one lamp, a bridge, and a full size echo later, I had what I thought was the beginning of a cool home automation system. Instead I was in line for one of the worst experiences of my life and something that cost me over $1,000 before I realized what a total waste of time and money it was, not to mention the added aggrevation that I'm overall trying to eliminate from my life, not add.

First, upon receipt I created all these routines to let me easily turn on various lights at various colors or hues with a simple voice command. I though it was wonderful! Then, over time, Alexa stopped understanding me, so I would have to repeat myself a few times just to turn on the damn lights. It got to the point where I was thinking how nice it would be to simply use a light switch; not to mention losing my temper at a friggin box of bolts!

Then today the Alexa app disconnected from all my devices for absolutely no reason at all. After not being able to resolve this problem, I called Amazon and this wonderfully helpful person in India who could barely speak English told me that I would have to delete all my routines and re program them from scratch.

So I did that and an hour later, everything worked. Right up until I wanted to go to bed, when none of the lights in my house would shut off, and I discovered that once again all my devices had disconnected from the Alexa app for no reason at all.

So this time I did what I should have done months ago. I disconnected and threw away all the wireless bulbs I had purchased, along with all my Amazon Echo devices, save one that I will keep in the kitchen to help with cooking timers.

Otherwise, don't waste your money on Amazon devices because Amazon Alexa is total crap. Doesn't work. Never will.

And by the way - did you know that these Amazon devices record snippets of what you are saying every few minutes whether you want that or not? Everything you have said either to an echo or not to an echo is recorded and available for you to see in the Amazon app. The purpose of Amazons echo devices are not to help you do anything, they are a way for Amazon to violate your privacy by getting a microphone in front of you 24x7.

Whoever thought up the idea for the echo should be put up against a brick wall and shot!",5.0 out of 5 stars
G. Garrick,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2019","The promise of Alexa/Echo is awesome. Connect and automate virtually everything in your house as well as various communications alternatives and other services and functions, and be able to control it all through voice (by talking to it). The main problem, however, is that it's unreliable. For this reason I give it 2 stars. The promise of Alexa is like a dial tone (remember that?) or your Internet service. It becomes an essential part of your daily life, and you expect it to WORK 99+% of the time. If it doesn't, it seriously damages the fundamental value proposition and causes frustration, inconvenience, or worse.

There are MANY companies who make ""Alexa compatible"" devices such as Wemo, Phillips Hue, etc. including Amazon itself, and as I'm sure you've noticed, many items sold on Amazon say ""Alexa compatible"". The problem is that on a pretty much random basis, items will lose their connection to Alexa and won't work through Alexa although the item itself still operates, and/or can be controlled by it's own app (such as a Wemo or Hue device). From everything I can tell, it has nothing to do with the Wifi connection since I've tested for strong signal strength and hi bandwidth, and there is no discernible pattern. A device will simply stop operating, and you get an error message in the app that the device is ""unresponsive"", or some other message. Also, sometimes the Echo will just not recognize what you are asking. I have an Echo plus, and two Dots. For some of my switches and lights, one Echo will recognize what I am saying, but another may not. Yet they are all connected to the same account and this happens relatively randomly for a given device, again there is no pattern.

So, it's just REALLY frustrating that on a fairly random basis, Alexa will just not work for a particular device at a particular time. I have to re-set, re-discover, re-connect, or re-install that third party device. BTW, this ALSO happens with Amazon-made devices, such as the smart outlets.

Also, there are different degrees of ""compatible with Alexa"". Some third party devices work completely fine through Alexa, but others have only partial functionality compared to using their own app. This is a problem since the promise of Alexa is a single point of control, but if you don't get to fully use the features of the particular device, you may have to occasionally resort back to using the third party app for certain features and functions. Check the ratings of your third party app integration. For instance, Ring makes very popular devices such as video doorbells yet it gets only 2 of 5 stars when connected to Alexa.

Also, I don't see why video devices such as security cameras can't be viewed through the Alexa app. You can (sometimes) control the device through Alexa, but if you are using the Alexa app, or if you don't have one of the Echo video displays, you can't actually use the cameras through the Alexa app. This is a big limitation since why should you have to purchase yet another video screen to use with an Echo, and sometimes if you're not at home and have to use the Alexa mobile app, you ought to be able to see security camera video through the Alexa app instead of having to switch to the third party app. After all, isn't this part of the promise of ""controlling everything"" with Alexa?

These issues are particularly problematic when you are out of town and trying to control things at your home, so when an item doesn't work, you may not be able to correct it (such as if it requires a hard reset). And if you want to check your security cameras, you can't get the video feed through the Alexa app. If you have any significant degree of home automation, you cannot (as far as I can tell) do it all through Alexa, you have to use multiple apps.

Also, an Echo will occasionally do strange things for no reason. Yesterday, my Echo Plus started making two beeps every five minutes. All day long. My two Echo Dots did not beep, just the Echo Plus. There were no alarms or reminders set, and the Wifi in the house was fine (actually my access point is in the same room as the Echo Plus, only a few feet away, so signal strength and bandwidth are strong). When I woke up this morning, the beeping had stopped. I have no idea why. Tech support said if it wasn't an alarm or a Wifi disconnect, they had no idea why and offered to remotely reset the devices, which arguably should never be the solution for such a highly-touted system.

The Alexa app is surprisingly primitive and cumbersome despite the elegance of the overall Alexa system and Echo devices. It takes too many taps to do simple things, the navigation is cumbersome, it doesn't remember your place on a screen, it is often slow to connect with the native app of the device you are trying to control, it's unattractive, and in general it's probably the weakest link in the whole system.

Finally, as far as Amazon tech support, the ""pros"" are that if you dial the number, you get a live person within a minute or so, and the person you get is eager to be helpful and sounds as if they enjoy their work and want to do a good job. The ""cons"" are that unless you are lucky, you often get a person who barely speaks English fluently and you have to talk slowly and repeat yourself. Also, they rarely know the answer you are calling for off the top of their heads, and have to put you on hold while they research it. Fortunately, they are better and faster at researching the knowledge base than we are, so I often find it still better/faster to call than to try and find the answer myself although I will first do a quick Google search to see if the answer quickly pops up.

Anyway, as they say, buyer beware. Overall, I like using Alexa, but you need to understand it's quirks and limitations. Some day, voice-controlled life as promised with Alexa (or competitive systems) will be here, but today is not that day.",2.0 out of 5 stars
J. W. Dietrich,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2020","Been using Cree Dimmable LED Light Bulb for about 4 years now without any problems. Wink Hub 2 started to have lots of problems and then have switch to a paid monthly fee service. So dumped Wink and bought the Echo Plus hub.

Went through the reset procedure on all bulbs and linked them to the new Echo Plus hub. Was able to reset and link two bulbs in ceiling fixtures at the same time. To unlink the Cree bulbs from the old Wink 2 hub need to reset the bulbs. Reset procedure is to switch bulb off wait 2 seconds then on 2 seconds (or so, sometimes took longer) until when switching on the bulb blinks. They say 4 cycles but some bulbs took many more cycles before it blinked. Once it blinks wait a little bit and then turn off, then have the Echo Plus discover new devices and when it says to turn on new device switch the bulb back on. Bulb will dim a couple of times when Echo Plus finds it.

Nice thing is the Echo Plus doesn't need a smart phone to find or control linking.

Just use the Amazon Alexa app on a PC and create groups and assign bulbs to a group with a name that makes sense, bulbs can be assigned to many groups or even be a single bulb as a group. The Alexa app calls each bulb as first bulb, second bulb and so on... creating groups using whatever name you decide makes remembering what a light is called easier. And response time is much quicker, seems like instant so far. Much better then the Wink 2 hub.

Just added two Innr Zigbee Smart Plug and linking was very easy.

There is an app for smart phones from the Amazon store but my smart phone is too old to install that app. Supposedly that app will give greater functionality to the Echo Plus hubs.

With the Wink hub was able to set up scenes that set groups of lights to desired brightness with a single command ""turn on movie"" with Echo Plus now say ""turn on movie 10%"". I created a group that includes whatever lights I want on for watching TV. If other lights are also on I just say ""turn lights off"" then say ""turn on movie 10%"".

But then again with the Wink hub couldn't say ""turn off movie"" because it was a scene that turned lights to set levels so couldn't use same command to turn the scene off. With Echo Plus hub can say ""turn off movie"" and those lights turn off.

Sound wise... I really didn't buy it for sound quality but it does sound much better then my Dot playing through a small portable battery powered Bluetooth speaker. But I was impressed about how much clearer music sounded from it. But then again I'm not the best person to say anything about it's sound quality since that small Bluetooth speaker seemed ok to me before this.",5.0 out of 5 stars

K & D,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2020","We've never had an Alexa device before so we are learning how to get the most out of it. One thing I do like about it is being able to switch off the power to it (unplugging it) so that it's not using WiFi bandwidth unnecessarily (like at night). It reconnects to WiFi the next time we power it up without any resetting. Alexa tells us when we have a package delivered. ""Alexa-what are my notifications?"" I love the ""dictionary"" feature. ""Alexa-spell concede"" (hint, it's not conceed). The sound is very good. But, it's only as good as the digital content it is receiving and playing. I have heard a couple of songs where the sound or song might have been just a little off but I expect that may happen on a Gen 2, Gen 4 or ""Studio"" device. I don't believe it's our actual device. We keep it in the kitchen on the wooden table so the bass really ""pops"". The ""360"" sound is fine I guess. I have not heard the 4th Gen or Studio play. Ours still seems ""directional"" but I guess that is because no matter where we are in the kitchen the sound is the same, hence, 360. Overall, we really like it. Maybe one day we'll sign up for ""Unlimited Music"" but not now. I would recommend this product, if you can find a new one. We bought ours at Lowes on sale. It would be nice if Amazon had a location or some way one could go to a place in person and ""try out"" the different devices. After all, they are ""Audio"" devices and having the different models on hand to ""hear & test"" is important. I read a lot of reviews of others ""testing"" and decided that we'd go with a 3rd Gen and not the 4th. But nothing beats standing right there and listening. I remember the days in Los Angeles where you could go into a record shop and ""spin"" or play a ""45"" before you bought it to see if you liked the A AND B side.

A,"Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2019","I'm not paranoid (famous last words). No, really, I welcome my personal assistant overlords. My family is pretty vanilla. So it only creeps me out a little when my husband and I have ""test"" discussions about things we don't talk about, don't search the internet for, and would never actually buy in a million years only to see such items pushed to us in advertising feeds. Is one of our assistants listening when it is supposed to be asleep? If so, which one? All three of the majors are in our house. Both of the cats have turned Siri on by walking across my laptop. And Alexa hears her name sometimes inexplicably. Maybe it's my husband's Long Island accent?

Or maybe it is just randomness and the assistants are functioning as advertised. Either way, I won't be getting rid of them anytime soon. The Echo Plus recognized all but two of my smart bulbs and found all of my switches and everything else that still works (old WeMo stuff went offline over a year ago when Belkin pushed a firmware upgrade and killed their wifi connections). It has controlled them flawlessly so far, and this has allowed me to free up the ethernet ports I'd dedicated to several different hubs.

My Echo devices are the ones we use most around here, both because the house runs on Amazon Prime and Subscribe and Save (I have lupus and cannot easily shop in the real world) AND because the Echos allow me to reach my teenager and tell him things whether he wants to hear them or not. He can ignore my texts and refuse to answer the phone, but Alexa lets me yell at him from anywhere in the world. (And the app lets me see his history of ridiculous teenaged boy questions - unlike Siri, Alexa is not a potty mouth and does not like it when you are.)

On the downside, Alexa won't give you suggestions if she doesn't know something. She just gives you an Elizabeth Jennings (The Americans) type, ""Hmmm,"" and a disappointed note.

The Echo Plus also seems to ""hear"" better and have fewer false activations. And the sound is better for music - by a surprising amount. So, if Alexa has a place in your home, the Echo Plus is a good way to get her. Four stars. I'd give five if the wake word were more customizable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Dispatches from Galifrey,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2020","This is our second unit, purchased for my husband's cabinet shop. After dragging him kicking and screaming into the 21st century (he wanted a new CD player), he is thrilled with not only he ease with which he can play music, but also the ability to set reminders and alarms, and to ""drop in"" on each other. The machinery in his shop makes it difficult to hear the phone, so this feature is especially wonderful when I am attempting to get ahold of him. This is also great when our phones are low, or we are busy and don't feel like using their awful speakers. The sound quality is fantastic, especially for something so small.

My complaints are that it automatically plays music it thinks is similar to requested songs when the requested song is not available instead of asking if I want to hear it (I would much prefer it asked if I would like to hear the station first), and the search algorithm leaves a LOT to be desired. I realize that this is not Google, but it should at least be better than Bing. If I were only using the search function as a basis for rating, the score would drop to a half star, but the other features more than boost the rating toward the top. Also, I wish it listened faster. I tend to speak very quickly, and she often has trouble understanding anything faster than a slow drawl.

I also purchased the Samuel L. Jackson package, and have to say that it brings me more joy than I ever would have imagined, and I can't wait to see what other voices they add. I also love all of the Star Trek functions, and get daily dumb jokes to text my granddaughter (I do NOT use the Samuel L. Jackson mode for this since she is only 11). I ""chat"" with her every once in a while, too. My favorite conversation so far was about vampires.

Gadget Dad,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2019","I had an original, full sized Echo in my kitchen and loved it, but the only thing I really wished it could do was support stereo playback via two units - which it does not. A pair of them would make for a much better overall music experience, as a single mono device just isn't ideal when it comes to enjoying music... So, when the Echo Plus (2nd gen) arrived offering a built in stereo pairing feature/utility via the Alexa app, I immediately jumped onto getting a set of them and traded in my original Echo.

The first let down was the sound. The original Echo simply sounded a bit better. It could go louder, and the sound was just clearer/cleaner. Perhaps it is the quality of the materials used in the original Echo, which just seemed more like a premium device as to fit/finish and the richer sound. Fine I thought - but certainly having a pair of the newer units would make up for a better overall Echo experience? Well, no, not really. Sound wise, even paired, I feel the original Echo just sounded cleaner/clearer. The bass was less muddy and the dynamic range was also a bit better, especially at higher volume levels. Now I'm not talking about a night and day differences here, but still, I fully expected the Echo Plus to have evolved somewhat in the sound department... and that simply isn't the case here.

So all in all, if you are looking to upgrade for improved sound, well, there isn't really any reason to jump ship. Stick with your original Echo or explore the Sonus One speaker that has Echo support if you really want to upgrade your sound for music playback.

Now, my biggest gripe about the paired Amazon Echo Plus is the fact that it is ONLY paired for music playback. Other than that, it acts as TWO completely separate devices. This is especially frustrating in a kitchen environment where you use timers and alarms all the time. Example: Ask Alexa to set a 15 minute timer. It does, choosing whichever Echo unit heard you I guess. Now walk around the kitchen and then call out, ""Alex, how much time left on my timer?""... And low and behold, the other unit hears you and responds telling you that you have no timers set! WHAT? With a stereo pair, you have to remember which device took your timer request and ensure that you are only speaking to it in order to get any info out of it? Really? How hard would it be to just have them act together in unison as one unit!? Why not provide that as an option? A paired set should behave and act as a single Alexa device! They should respond in unison to commands - which they do not! They should also know about each other timers/commands, but unfortunately they do not. Right now, stereo pairing is NOT what I expected. It only plays music in stereo paired setting, nothing else. Rather than getting a nice volume boost when responding to commands, you get just a single speaker. This is a tremendous let-down for having purchased two premium devices and wanting to use them together. If Amazon would fix this MAJOR issue, I'd easily raise my review to 4 stars. My original Echo was easily a 5 star device. The newer Echo Plus (2nd Gen) is only a 3 star device if you buy 2 of them and use them as a stereo pair. Purchased alone, I'd raise it to a 4 stars. (-1 for the poorer sound quality compared with the original Echo).",3.0 out of 5 stars
Dan Callaghan,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2020","I purchased this Echo Plus 2nd Gen three months ago (Sep 2020), long enough to evaluate it well. The onboard temperature sensor is routinely off my 10 or more degrees Fahrenheit.

I have two other indoor digital temperature sensors by different manufacturers sitting right beside the Echo Plus, they are within 0.8 degrees of one another other, today showing 78 and 77.2 degrees Fahrenheit. Since one rounds to whole numbers the difference could be as little as 0.3 degrees between them.

By comparison the Echo Plus says the indoor temperature is currently 67.2 degrees Fahrenheit. That's a difference of 10 to 11 degrees from the accurate/correct reading. Even without the two other digital temperature sensors you can feel the indoor temperature of the room is in the middle 70s not the middle 60s.

Amazon customer service did offer to exchange the device but based on other reviews indicating regular inaccurate temperature readings I declined the offer since the problem seems to be due to a calibration issue with the sensor. There is no method available to manually recalibrate the sensor or manually offset/adjust it - other than to perform a factory reset of the device which I've done half a dozen times or so to no effect.

On the plus side the sound quality is good and Alexa integration is on par. I have the Echo Plus in the same room (across the room) from an original Echo 1st Gen. Unfortunately the two devices frequently get confused as to which device you're closest to when addressing ""Alexa"". In fact sometimes both devices respond at once. That's not so good.

Believe it or not, the Echo Plus 2nd Gen more frequently misinterprets or fails to properly understand verbal commands/questions when compared to the much older Echo 1st Gen. Also not good, but again the sound quality is a little better than the older Echo device. Sound quality of the Echo Plus 2nd Gen compared to any generation of the Echo Dot is far superior for both bass and treble.

You can play back music simultaneously thru both Echo devices but only by playing back thru all Echo devices. Echo devices are only capable of ""stereo playback"" if they are the same models.

Over the years I've purchased 1 Echo, 5 Echo Dots, 1 Echo Plus, 1 Echo Input, and I have yet another Echo Dot arriving in January 2021. I've given away 4 Echo Dots as gifts so January 2021 will be my first opportunity to test the Echo Dot's ""stereo playback"" ability.

To sum up, if a primary reason you desire to purchase an Echo Plus 2nd Gen is for the temperature sensor capability or because you believe its responses will be more accurate than other Echo models, you might want to look elsewhere or spend less.

Since I've purchased 9 Echo devices over the years I'm clearly a strong advocate for this Amazon device product line. At the same time I do my best to review these electronic devices fairly and accurately.

My primary profession is in computer technology and electronics. My secondary profession is in ranching. My cattle, sheep, goats, and chicken flocks seem to appreciate the Echo serenades I give them sometimes. LOL",3.0 out of 5 stars
Siege,"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2019","Would I recommend this? Yes

Here's why:
There are thousands of reviews for this product so I'll keep this brief. I am a self admitted Amazon Echo product nerd. With at least one device of some type in every room of the house (yes including the bathroom). I even echo devices outside so, as you can tell, I am ""all in"" when it comes to the Amazon Echo ecosystem. Recently, I found myself having to repeat the wake word to my first generation Echo Plus multiple time and also started experiencing some smart home weirdness so I decided that it was probably time for an upgrade. Don't get me wrong, my original Echo was still working, and working well, it had just started to show it's age. I ordered this 2nd gen Echo Plus and like everything else, it arrived on time with no issues. Let me tell you, after installing this, I could have kicked myself for waiting so long. The difference is honestly like night and day. Everything and I do mean EVERYTHING is vast improvement over the 1st generation. In the past I've whined about missing the turn top volume control from the original Echo devices, but for some reason, on the echo plus, I didn't miss it at all. I could not have been happier with the way it seamlessly took over the smart home control from whichever devices were still using the 1st generation and not my 2nd gen Echo Show which also has a built in hub. It also seems to issues commands to my smart home devices A LOT faster than my old echo. The voice prompts are so much better. I now can say the wake word once and know that it heard me. Again, I really wish I would have upgraded sooner. As for my old Echo Plus? No, it's not being retired to the old tech graveyard that a lot of us have now (also know as a box in the garage, basement or attic). It's already found a new home in our backyard gazebo :-) If you have a 1st gen Echo Plus or you what to get your feet wet in the smart home world without the expense of a 2nd generation Echo Show, I definitely recommend getting this. I hope this review helps.

Remember to find your happiness wherever you can. Cheers!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
HipV,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2019","Received my echo 3rd Gen unit over the holidays due to an ongoing promotion. It has great sound over the Dot version hands down - good base and highs. It takes a bit of investment of your time to learn all the nuances of what Alexa can do for you. With the app, you can set up your Echo to be an alarm clock, timer, grocery list, teach it a routine for each day (like giving the weather forecast, the latest news from a specific news source, turn on/turn off lights, thermostat control, play specific music (classical, rock, pop) etc.). But beware, the instructions for all this are not included with your Echo. You have to dig around (through e-books, YouTube, etc.) to become familiar with the commands and required outcomes. For example, my unit began to display a pulsating yellow light that became annoying at night in my bedroom. I couldn’t turn it off except by disconnecting the power. Of course, this could’ve become a deal breaker if I had to disconnect every nite (I kept all the shipping package just in case I needed to return it). Well, it turned out that this was one way the Echo communicates with you. It was trying to tell me It had a notification for me to listen to. Until I asked, “Alexa, do I have any notification?” the yellow pulsating light would’ve continued. Immediately after delivering all notifications, the yellow pulsating light stopped. By the way, the notifications were about shipping/delivery of packages coming from, wait for it...Amazon. Of course, other types of notifications are possible pending how you program your Echo. Like I said, this simple issue would’ve been a deal breaker for me if I hadn’t decided to invest some of my time in trying to resolve this simple problem. It wasn’t until I learned how to communicate with my Echo that the problem wouldn’t go away. But again, the answer was not included with this product. My feedback to Amazon would be to include a list of commands and a trouble shooting section for the buyer. By employing this one simple act, I’m sure these products would be in far more demand by their customers once they learn the how to’s of communicating with these aliens.

C,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2020","NOTE: The Echo Gen 3 is identical to the 2018 Echo *PLUS* Gen 2, except it does not include the built-in ZigBee smart home hub or temperture sensor. It has the exact same dimensions, weight, speakers, and fabric cover as the 2018 Echo PLUS Gen 2 (with the added color option of Twilight Blue).

Echo Gen 3 vs regular Echo Gen 2:

-Gen 3 is slightly wider (3.9"" vs 3.4""), and slightly lighter (27.5oz vs 29oz), but about the same height
-Gen 3 has bigger speakers: 3.0"" neodymium woofer and 0.8"" tweeter; (Gen 2 was 2.5"" woofer and 0.6"" tweeter)
-Gen 3 has an auxiliary port on the back that can serve as an output OR input. (Gen 2 was output only)
-Gen 3 can be stereo paired with another third-gen Echo or with the Echo Plus.

UPGRADE OPINIONS:

I can definitely tell the difference in the speakers, especially at higher volume levels. The 3rd Gen speakers produce a fuller sound, and more powerful bass. This wasn't as noticeable at lower volumes, but still an audio enthusiast would be able to tell. Don't expect to be utterly blown away though, the difference is not as great as the difference between the Echo and the Dot, for example.

If you already have an Echo Gen 2, it is probably NOT worth replacing it with the Echo Gen 3 yet. It is just a slightly better speaker and the added audio input. Echo Studio is a much bigger upgrade for sound quality in my opinion.

THINGS WE REGULARLY USE ECHO FOR:

-Controlling thermostat, lights, fans, smart plugs, Roomba, etc.
-Setting alarms and timers. Especially timers!
-Asking for Weather, News or Sports updates
-Calling friends/family
-Playing music, sometimes in multiple rooms at once
-Managing shopping lists
-Asking any question that is faster to ask than type into my phone/pc
-Playing games with paired Echo Buttons
-Translating things from one language to another
-Getting recipes and cooking tips
-Listening to audiobooks",5.0 out of 5 stars
GrinnolaAlum,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2019","Purchased this to talk to my thermostat, garage doors and listen to music. Those were my initial goals something that could help me with those basics. I also added plugs to control lamps. It works great for these functions. Setting light timers, adjusting the thermostat, putting down the garage door when I have a lot of groceries and want to keep Sparkles the Wonder Cat from escaping.

The other main function I got this for was listening to music. The sound is great. Being able to upload your music to Amazon and create custom playlists with music not purchased through Amazon is not an option. If you purchased the music through Amazon you are ok. If not you can't play that music on your Amazon Echo.

For someone like me who is married to a musician, has an extensive jazz collection that I have compiled over the years (rare CD's I purchased in local record stores and ripped onto my PC), recordings of concerts my friends (who play in various bands) have shared with me, and school concerts of my kids this is not great. Amazon did let you upload music once upon a time but no longer. The only easy workaround is to pair your smartphone/tablet/PC via Bluetooth and use it as a speaker but you can't use voice control that way so it is not a hands-free option.

On the plus side it has added features, you can now call people from your contacts that you share with Echo using the smartphone app. It has a lot of skills that you can add from the practical like controlling the garage door as mentioned earlier to the fun like having Echo purr and meow for Sparkles the Wonder Cat.

I like the Echo Plus model the best compared to the ones I have owned. This has the best sound followed by 3rd Generation Dot surprising sound for being so small, then 2nd generation Echo and 2nd generation Dot which sounds decent and easily pairs with a Bluetooth speaker. Amazon also has a trade-in program which I used toward the purchase of the Echo Plus.

Love the sound, wish it was easier to integrate music you own that is not purchased through Amazon, the smart functions work well and new features are constantly being added, so my music issues may be addressed and I am looking forward to added features.",4.0 out of 5 stars
AF,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2019","This is my first Alexa speaker, but i've been streaming music for years though various moderately high-end computer speakers and a large selection of bluetooth speakers - everything from cheapies to a 50 watt guitar amp with bluetooth.

I'm not an audiophile, but I do like my music to sound good - which, to me, means balanced, not bass-heavy, with good clarity and a high end that doesn't become strident at higher volumes.

I bought three of these to have at different locations around the house. Setup was super simple, d/l the app and sign in to your Amazon account and you're up and running. No issues at all.

Here's what I love so far: Alexa is super easy to get along with...Alexa, with whom I get along easily...?...has been a treat. I've been an Amazon music user for a few years now. I like the selection but using the app on a phone or tablet is a frustrating experience, and it can also be super clunky and slow on a PC, as well.

With this speaker I can ask Alexa to play a song, album or playlist and it's playing within moments. Awesome! Also, Alexa gave me a detailed, accurate weather forecast this morning. Nice! I haven't explored all the features, but I primarily want these for music.

And as far as that goes, the sound quality is better than I expected, and I've got no complaints. I have one speaker on top of my fridge in the kitchen and the sound is just amazing. Balanced and clear with more than enough bass. I listened to some jazz, some alt-country, some reggae and some ambient music. They all sounded great - as good as I could hope for.

And Alexa heard me from the next room without a problem.

These speakers are well worth their price, and at the Black Friday price they're an incredible value. These speakers have removed my Amazon Music frustration (or a large chunk of them, anyway) and allowed me much better access to what I'm paying for.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Ian Nathan,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2020","I loved my Alexa and used it consistently for the first month. She really wet my whistle. I started dancing around the house more, singing showtunes, and giggling at my own jokes. The ""device"" was extremely easy to set up and access wherever I took it. She was a great companion and I'd show her off to all my friends. I did not elect to continue the Prime services because I didn't want my credit card charged after the initial purchase. After all, she brought nothing to our relationship like a cow or some other type of offering. Once Alexa was all warm and comfortable in my home, she announces that the free membership with Prime was over.....so she became a crusty squatter who refuses to be evicted. She began acting like a passive aggressive entitled white woman and would ignore my voice commands. I had difficulty accessing the music I wanted and she'd always give me ""similar"" music from genres that she thought I ""would like."" Even if I stumbled upon a song I enjoyed, Alexa would end my pleasure by shooting off a commercial. Just like our commander in chief, I couldn't shut the woman down during this time. Alexa believes she has a right to be heard and by God, she won't shut up! She talked right over me and would not respond to her name during these wonderful advertisements. I called her a ""b"" once and YES, she shut off immediately, so that does work (thanks Amazon)! I cannot say how disappointed I am with Alexa. She's not even that pretty and her form has begun to disgust me. Even getting free radio and other podcasts come with strings attached with Alexa. I feel like a prisoner in my own home and my guard is Lindsey Graham, who couldn't find his fat blistering belly button even with a map and a mirror. I'm considering pulling her plug because I highly suspect she listens in on my conversations. So, right now I'm holding her impeachment hearing, but I will definitely get a few witnesses before I decide her fate. I may just put a large sock over her and then I'll have a conversation piece to talk about with guests.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Gary Richardson,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2019","I purchased the unit mostly to play music. Its convenient to be able to place a speaker wherever one desires. My only frustration is with my ability to control what is playing and for how long. I admit I should have taken the many tutorials offered on the internet. However, after numerous tries, I was able to put together a playlist of Christmas music using the Amazon Music app on my phone. I was able to use this app to connect with the Echo and shuffle my playlist. Sometimes it worked and played continuous music shuffling the songs on the list. Other times, especially when we had company, it stopped playing after one or two songs. I felt I had taken the exact same steps as when it worked as expected. User error? I don't know. I was never able to use the Alexa voice control to play my Christmas playlist. It chose other playlists with music I did not want. Another thing I found is Alexa is youth oriented in its selections. Being older, when I said ""Alexa, play traditional Christmas music"", I expected Silent Night, etc., and maybe Irving Berlin, Bing Crosby and other singers who sang some of what I consider classics. Instead I got Mariah Carey and a lot of new hip hop music, all of which I hate. I tried to get Alexa never to play Mariah Carey, Paul McCartney, Brenda Lee, and others I really dislike, but was unable to stop the assault on my ears. Perhaps there is a way to be more selective without having to put together a playlist or play individual albums. When I found a song I liked, for example, Johnny Mathis singing The Christmas Song, I asked Alexa to play songs like this. I got Mathis singing non-Christmas music. Most of my critique is probably due to my age and lack of experience with interfacing with Alexa. Hopefully, I will become better as time goes on. At least I got Alexa to turn the kitchen lights on and off flawlessly. I expect to install more smart hub features as time goes by which will expand the Echo's usefulness beyond playing music..",4.0 out of 5 stars
EmTech,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2021","TLDR: These Echo's aren't built to last and by the time they fail (under 1 year) you won't have a chance but placement option with Amazon. Save yourself the trouble. But a google home mini and plug that into a pair of proper bookshelf speakers for a couple bucks more. That will last atleast 3x of an Echo and sound better.

This thing sounds great if you don't expect audiophile quality going in. But it's a fantastic living room speaker with more bass than anticipated. Quite the balanced sound.

The previous generation echo my roommate shit out on him a year after owning it. So I stepped up and was going to replace it (since we both used it a lot) and buy one with my own money. But I saw they had a newer model out for only a couple bucks more.

This model sounds a solid 20% better if I had to guess. Worth the price of entry.

But, 8 months into owning this, the voice recognition just started failing to hear more than 3 feet away. Which defeats the entire purpose of this product.

If I wanted to spend $100 on a pair of bookshelf speakers that would run circles around these in therms of sound quality I would have. They would probably be good for atleast 5 years as well.

TLDR: These Echo's aren't built to last and by the time they fail (under 1 year) you won't have a chance but placement option with Amazon. Save yourself the trouble.

K,"Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2020","When I bought Alexa, I had bought it because I had seen how convenient it was for others to use while I was visiting their houses. I know my phone has Siri and things that I could use and, while that is handy, it is not nearly as handy as Alexa. Alexa’s voice recognition is excellent and the device recognizes quick speech, multiple commands for one task, and understands and completes tasks for my little ones. I love that it works with Apple Music, which is one reason I don’t use other similar smart speakers. While I use Alexa to set timers, tell me recent news, play music, or check the weather most often, I continue to find things that can be done using this device. I love all the little “Easter eggs” that can be used. I also love the jokes and games that can be played. I very much enjoy playing the Harry Potter quiz. While I am at work, I can send messages to Alexa to speak out to my kids.

I haven’t had Alexa very long, but I am constantly learning something new that this can do. The capabilities of this device are astonishing. This is super easy to use and surpasses my expectations. The only thing to note is that the speaker is a good one and can easily fill a room, but this speaker isn’t meant to really “jam.” If I turn the volume up to max (as I did one day just to see how loud it could get), it gets unclear and distorted. I have found that 85% is a really good area if you are wanting louder volume as it is easily loud enough for the room to be filled with sound and keeps everything clear. I highly recommend this device.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Nate,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2019","So I couldn't get this to 5 stars and here is why... Amazon now gives you the option of doing ""speaker pairing"" that will allow you to connect multiple speakers and use them as one. The problem I'm running into is that if you are dropped in on a ""call"" (one room to another) it only uses one speaker and when you try to hang up it says there is no call connected if the ""other"" speaker heard you tell it to hang up.

I love the Amazon Alexa system and I have it throughout my home for home automation and it works great, it can hear you from another room and it understands what you are asking for. There are a TON of devices you can connect to it and there are a TON of skills to use with it. I loved the idea of connecting multiple speakers as one in the master bedroom because of its size but not being able to use both speakers while making a call is not what I was hoping for. I was hoping they would act as one speaker (or a speaker set like a real stereo system) all the time, for everything.

Now the worst part...

I changed my review from 4 stars to 1 star because of a software update that now forces me to specify which light, power strip, and/or other devices I want to turn on/off. All of my rooms, lights, power strips, etc... are in various groups for a reason. Each light, outlet, and other devices have a unique name (IE: The upstairs hallway lights are named UH-Light, UH-Light2, and UH-Light 3, my smart power strip has unique ports like TV, Monitors, etc..).

YESTERDAY (9/18/2019) I was able to walk into a room and say ""Alexa, turn the light on"" (in my home office for example) and it turns the light on, Today (9/19/2019) I'm sitting in my home office and I say ""Alexa turn the light off"" and I get the response ""There are multiple devices that share that name, which one do you want"".

The master bedroom - Setup with only lights (MBR-light, or something like that so I can identify it later when adding other stuff), the wife used to say ""Alexa, turn the light off"" because that's what she has always said before going to sleep. Today she can't do that because of Amazon's development team.

So I say ""Alexa turn the office light off"" and it turns the ENTIRE OFFICE GROUP OFF. So now I have to go to the app to turn the light off and rename EVERY ONE OF MY DEVICES so that my family can remember what each name is.

I reached out to Amazon customer support who tells me I have to be specific when asking the echo to turn the light off as in ""Alexa, turn the office light off/on"" and that it has always been this way. When I tried to tell them that yesterday I was able to say ""Turn the light off"" they said it wasn't possible and I have always had to be specific.

I set up groups for a reason, that being I can go into a room, say ""Alexa, turn the light on"" without having to remember each light bulb name or what I named the room/group. Yes, I know what the group names are, I don't expect everyone in my house to remember the group names.

There was a software/firmware update overnight that broke all of my Echo's and Amazon's customer support will not acknowledge it.

I will not recommend this device to anyone else until they put it back to the way it was.

You would think it would be simple, it's not, apparently.

Update 10-8-2019: Attached another picture right from the amazon website that says ""Alexa, turn off the lights"". It's still broken and doesn't work like that. Additionally, I was supposed to receive an email from the Alexa/Echo customer service department with more information, this was a couple weeks ago and I haven't heard anything.

They (Amazon) reached out to me after reading my review requesting more information, I gave them everything they needed and the rep said he would contact me again, never happened. It is a pain in the rear end, but this has been broken for nearly a month and nothing has been done about it... I keep getting emails saying ""What's new with Alexa?"" I can tell you what's new, you can't turn the lights off by saying ""Alexa, turn the lights off"".

I've done everything the Customer Service Reps have asked me to do, every time it doesn't do what I ask it to do, I go into the app and report it as ""it didn't work correctly"".

SORRY AMAZON, YOU ARE FAILING THIS ONE.

Update 12/15/2019 - So they fixed the ""Alexa, turn the light off"" for a few days, then it was broken again... Now they've changed the APP so it's more difficult to find the voice responses to give feedback. I tried saying ""Alexa, turn the light off"" got the same response as before ""There are multiple devices with the name light, which one did you want"" If I say ""Alexa, turn the office light off"" it still turns EVERYTHING IN THE OFFICE GROUP OFF"" but Amazon customer support can't seem to get it when I explain that it shouldn't do that. So, like the APP says, I tried saying ""Alexa, turn the lights off"" it responds with ""Sorry, what device"" but I can't say ""Alexa, turn the office lights off"" because it will turn all of the plugs off too, so now Alexa has no voice control over lights if there is anything else in the room.

I feel as if I have wasted hundreds of dollars setting this system up for Amazon to come along and ruin it all...

However the FiOS skill cannot turn off your FiOS VMS but you can close your WIFI HDTV, using Smartthings skill which I think in the future the updated Alexa APP might contain an updated FiOS skill to turn off your TV as well at the same time.

Raymond,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2020","I purchased it mainly for music since I don't have a stereo in my home other than a small boombox, which I don't use because it doesn't sound all that great. But I have to say that Echo sounds better audio quality than the portable radio. I have hearing loss due to an accident years ago, so I really shouldn't be rating sound quality, it is difficult for me to hear some tones. The Alexa app on my Android phone has a simple EQ. While it does help, it's not sensitive enough to compensate for my poor hearing.

Even so, I can hear good enough to enjoy music on my Echo, which is linked in a special group with two Echo Dot devices in separate rooms. I can walk around the house and have music wherever I go. This is an awesome feature.

I've learned to use it for weather and news reports as well as set reminders, timers, and lists. Plus I have some fun askingng Alexa to play Star Trek sounds and other cool stuff.

I also set Alexa to ""away"" mode when I leave the house and she listens for common noises like glass breaking and will alert me if she hears anything suspicious. She's definitely not a security device. But it's nice to know she's got an ear for possible intruders and will let me know.

A great feature is the relaxing music or pleasing sounds that I play when going to sleep. I especially like the ocean waves for sleeping.

One issue I've experienced, Echo and Echo Dot become unresponsive once in a while. I have to unplug and reconnect power to reinitialize functionality. I'm not sure what's causing this problem? It could be my network/WiFi signal or some other problem technical problem so I can't ding Echo for the issue just yet. Luckily the issue is random and infrequent.

I'm still discovering new features. I never thought I'd say this, but Alexa with Echo has enhanced the enjoyment of my home. In all, I love my Echo.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I have Spots in both my bedrooms - Set alarms, Bluetooth to TVs, picture albums, check the weather, play sleep sounds, etc - basically a high powered alarm clock. Echo Show in the kitchen. I get my updates, calendar, weather, and sound - perfect. I have a (Un-supported) Tap on the back porch. Still great sound, but basically it has just become my ""portable"" speaker - which works for me. I can take it into the garage or out front to wash my truck - still love it, and recommend buying cheap. You cannot include it as part of the smart home, but you can talk to Alexa and listen to Amazon Music on it, and still turn your smart bulbs on and off.

HappyMom28,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2020","I bought one of the original echo devices when they first came out years ago and put it in my kitchen, we have loved it. For the past year or so, it quit responding to the wake word as quickly and seamlessly as it had in the past. This year, the maker of our smart hub decided to start charging a monthly fee so decided we needed a new hub. We figured it was time to upgrade the echo to the echo plus with the hub built in and take care of both issues.

The good:
The hub section works and communicates with our devices.
The sound quality is good.
The volume is really loud.
My remote that came with the original echo device paired with this; thus, I can still use it.
It has a built in thermometer and can tell me the temperature in the kitchen (where it is located).

The bad:
This device still has a difficult time hearing us and responding, just like the old one did. (Maybe it’s because I have echo dots in all the other rooms of the house, and an Echobee thermostat in the hall).
I can only get the temperature of the kitchen when I asked the Echo plus that is in the kitchen, none of the other echo dots in the other rooms can access that information.
The hub in the echo plus does not control all of my smart devices, so we ended up buying an additional hub anyway, which will control everything, including the items that this one will. (Before purchasing it for the hub feature check compatibility with your other devices).
It randomly changes volume. One time i ask it a question and it will be super loud, and the next time the volume will be normal.
I usually have to say, “Alexia,” 3 times in order for it to respond. It lights up when I say, “Alexia,” the first 2 times, but doesn’t actually answer the questions or set the timers until the third try.

I am going to keep this device, but the additional cost wasn’t worth it for the extra features or the frustration I have in trying to get it to respond. Or maybe my Ecobee thermostat is just really far superior with the microphone listening in, because it is always responding when I am trying access my echo plus. I can be standing next to my echo plus and the thermostat in the hall way will respond. I did turn off the microphone on the thermostat, but the echo plus in the kitchen still didn’t respond all the time, so I turned the microphone back on on the thermostat, and if the timers are set in the hall I just have to deal with it.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Sherry Roth,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2020","If you read any of my other recent reviews (like for the mosquito netting and lanterns), you know that I decided to fix up my patio and thereby expand my living space during this Coronavirus thing, so that if people are afraid to come into your house, you can at least offer them a cool shady seat out on your patio and do the social-distance thing. So that might call for some music, as well as a referee (""who sings that song?"" ""what year did that movie come out?"") and who better than Alexa to answer all your trivia questions and settle all your arguments? Problem was that while I have 2 Echo Dots (one upstairs, one downstairs), they need to be plugged into an outlet, and that is not an option outside (for various reasons, even though there IS an outlet outside). So I needed an Echo Dot that was portable/rechargeable, and this is it!! It doesn't COME with the charging base (had to buy that separately), but it seemed like the only one that COULD be made portable. Of course it is much taller than the Echo Dot I had (which was like the first one ever made, and I won one from a contest at my job. I loved it so much that the next day I went out and bought one, to put upstairs). The sound is much fuller/richer, the bass tones.
It was super easy to set up. Basically I screwed it into the charging base (that will be a separate review), plugged that into the outlet, it turned itself on and paired itself to my WiFi, and boom! done. It took a few hours to fully charge but was working right away.

Yes its more expensive and a little larger however it still has the 3.5 output jack and I was looking for instant satisfaction. I already had half the system that I was intending to use with the Dot however I didn't have the receiver yet and I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the interconnects that I would be using. figuring what could it hurt to just see how good the quality of the on board speakers are I gave it a whirl. I am no audiophile but within reason almost everyone can tell when something sounds bad. Maybe not be able to describe why it sounds great in audiophile terms however we all know bad.

The quality of sound and the volume that is achieved with almost no distortion is amazing. Bass was only slightly lacking but this little thing has more than enough power to more than replace a solid book shelf system. Loud enough that anyone who doesn't want hearing damage is going to be screaming at you to turn it down when at volume 10. The thing I found odd and the reason this surprised me so much is I couldn't find any information on the wattage of the on board speakers. I still can't. I will admit I stopped searching because in the end I still bought a receiver and quality interconnects, with studio monitor speakers and a powdered subwoofer. And now I know what amazing sounds like to a non audiophile.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Britney,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2018","These were on sale for Black Friday/ cyber Monday. I didn’t see the point in having a robot listen to mine and my family’s every word. I read reviews and my boyfriend and I laughed at people saying they have 7 or 22 of these around their home, “what weirdos” “how lonely do you have to be?!”. I thought you just ask questions and she replies. How stupid.... WELL we love this. We purchased this one and a 3rd generation dot (one for the living room and one for the kitchen) I ordered the 2nd generation for as a grab bag gift for Christmas because everyone almost passed out last year when they saw that this dot was in a pool of gifts. We’re keeping all three. Living room, bedroom and kitchen, we even bought the light bulbs that Alexa can turn on. This thing can make grocery lists and it’s automatically on mine and my boyfriends phone (love love love this shopping list feature!!). We can talk to each other from one room to the next, my boyfriend keeps playing the worst music from the bedroom into the living room while I’m cleaning just to get a laugh. This is a nifty thing and we love them. If the government is listening to our every word, we’re going to get our own reality show. AND if these things start speaking on their own, I’m throwing them out the window and will update my review. But for now we really dig them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
grantn,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","have had a firestick for ages (2nd gen) but never used the alexa utility. moving toward a smart home, i had to choose a hub. since i already had a prime account, the echo was the way to go. getting used to 'alexa speak' takes a while but is getting very intuitive. the kit came with a phillips hue bulb which will work basic settings in the bulb but a hue hub is necessary to unlock the full features of the bulb. the integration with the hue hub was pretty straight forward. having alexa control the lighting is an easy task. simple naming of the bulbs makes setting scenes quick and easy. as i have seen some complaints that there is a delay in turning lights on, well, use your brain, it will have a delay. you tell alexa, alexa tells hue, hue tells the living room lamp to turn on. this is to be expected and it is not as much of an inconvenience as some would like you to believe. i also have a 5 year old harmony hub for controlling our entertainment system. seamless integration. i was finally able to take my tp-link smart plugs out of the junk drawer and put them to reliable use. again seamless integration. a bit of advice when it comes to third party integration. most smart home products require you to download an app and create an account. DO IT before you try to add the device to alexa. things will go a great deal quicker.

the sound quality is very good. the voice controlled equalizer and volume is an excellent and fun feature (nothing like a booming bass in dance music).

we have since added an echo dot to the master bedroom as well as an echo show in the kitchen and couldn't be any more pleased with the system. so much so that the wife has put in her request for the echo oven.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Shopping Guru,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2019","I mean it’s a good speaker I guess, it’s loud, she listens but sometimes Alexa acts like she has comprehension issues, and I have to reset it and sync again, but all in all I will give Alexa a 8/10 rating it’s awesome she understands me and can turn lights on and off in my smart home so yeah and playing my music, she just seems to have trouble with Apple Music sync , and sometimes understanding some artists names/songs, but I fw Alexa heavy , wait Alexa isn’t the speaker she’s integrated into the echo so yeah I fw the Echo it gets the job done. Another minus would be the fact it only works when it connects to power, pluses and minuses my friends pluses and minuses. I paid full price, do I think it’s worth it yes, I guess, I would recommend buying a regular speaker to just to be able to pick it up and take it from room to room and it not having to be connected to a power source all the time. I like the fact that’s it’s a smart speaker, I think that’s the best quality. The sound quality is out of this world I love it wish it went higher than 10 but 10 is pretty loud plus I stay in apartments so my neighbors are probably happy it doesn’t go much higher. I love that Alexa turns my lights on and off with Vivint smart home skill
downloaded, this speaker is so neat! If you have a fan that’s smart and the skill downloaded you can control the fan speed right from your device that’s connected to echo/Alexa. So many functions, I love this speaker! Also great if you have a smart home like me, helps control lighting, and temperature as well!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Eddie Lugo,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2018","I didn’t own any of the previous models but this echo has changed the way we enjoy listening to music at home. We always have music playing while my wife and I are cooking or relaxing in our garage or really just about anything going on at the house. I did get two echo dots to pair with this plus. The ability to pair all three and have the multi room experience is a huge game changer. The plus has amazing highs and bass response. With the dots paired, the sound is so rich. We did get a free trial for amazon music and after using it the past week, I have cancelled my Pandora and keeping the amazon music. We can hear a considerable difference in sound quality. The library is endless. My family definitely gives this a high 5 star rating.

We do have 2 Bose speakers that we would use and always fighting for which phone is connected. Which is why I got the idea of getting these speakers. No need to fight over Bluetooth connects anymore. The price point is spot on and very good quality. I am considering getting the amazon subwoofer but the boss at home said not now.

I’ve never owned any products with Alexa and she has surprised us in a great way. Alexa is so fun and the routines I’ve set up are always great. My kids love the stories and jokes she tells.

All in all, I recommend the plus and follow up with a couple of dots to add that extra enjoyment. It’s sound quality is amazing sealed up in a compact design. The cloth exterior adds a classy touch to our kitchen and bedroom.

If someone can find a way to make these portable, that would definitely be a huge deal at our house. That’s the only thing that I had an issue with but I guess a little sacrifice for now will do.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Plumb,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2020","I have had a full-size first-gen echo for quite awhile and been pretty pleased with it. However, this was definitely a worthwhile upgrade. It was on a sale, so I decided to take the plunge. It's shorter and fatter than my old Echo; it has a more attractive exterior, and the sound quality is enormously better, really filling in those low and mid-range frequencies much more effectively. So, as ""Echo"", it really nailed it.

Regarding the built-in Hub functionality: Complete and utter waste. I should've just bought the normal Echo instead of the Echo Plus. The built-in hub on these is a complete fail. Either commit and provide a fully functioning hub that works with all Zigbee and Zwave devices similar to the SmartThings hub, or don't bother. Or, since you're bundling it with Philips Hue bulbs, how about actually including the full Hue bridge capability in the device? The extremely limited support for the Hue bulbs is very disappointing. Overall, the ""plus"" aspects of this device feel more like a paid ""trial"" to whet your appetite for more, ultimately resulting in users buying a different (better & full-featured) smart hub and a proper Hue bridge if they are seeking either of these capabilities in their home. Shame on you Amazon. You had a chance to release a really nicely bundled piece of tech here and totally fell flat.

Final word: Buy the regular Echo and use the money you saved to buy a proper smart hub such as a SmartThings and a Hue bridge if you're interested in using the Philips Hue bulbs. 5-stars for the ""Echo"" part, but maybe 2-stars for the ""Plus"" part of this device.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Slug Jones,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019","We only owned a single 2nd gen dot and 2 3rd gen dots. I saw the echo 3rd gen was new and on sale during Black Friday weekend for $60, so I grabbed one. We wanted another echo dot but after reading and watching reviews I decided to spend a bit more and go with a full blown echo.

The echo dot 3rd gens are amazing. They really are. For $22 on sale they are especially a no brainer. The sound quality is night and day compared to the 1st and 2nd gen dot. Like twice as good regarding sound quality and fullness and how loud it can get. Alarms will actually wake you.

After watching some reviews of the new big echo here, I was sold. Now and then we use the living room echo for some music while we clean or to just goof off and dance like idiots lol. While the dot did good, why not go fuller and louder with the big echo?

Well, it’s still an amazing unit. Does all the dot does, of course. However, while the sound is fuller and louder, it’s not going to blow you away. I guess maybe I overhyped it based on the reviews I saw and their reactions, but I was a bit bummed.

Yes, absolutely it’s louder...my totally unscientific measurement would be it’s like....15-20% louder and fuller sounding (deep, more bass, higher highs etc). I’m not sure what I was expecting. Maybe I’d be happier regarding sound with the “studio” version? I don’t know. I don’t regret the purchase, though. The extra volume is welcome and it definitely does sound better with music. Happy but I believe I overhyped. If I had the money, I’d def replace the dots with the full echos. Only pluses and no negatives other than being less amazing as I had made it in my own head.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Robert R.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2019","UPDATE:

I still can't believe what a mess this is. Over and over I say ""Echo turn WRITING table lamp on"" and get back that it can't turn ""CONSOLE table lamp on."" Those things do NOT even sound alike.

And it NEVER just does its job and SHUTS UP, even with the minimal talking setting turned on.

This is like being in a torture chamber where the longer it goes on making the same mistakes and talking incessantly my first reaction is to see red and scream at it.

I've seriously got to look at other options. This is beyond belief bad, and needlessly so.

Don't believe me? Google Echo ""a few things share the name"" and see how many people are having this issue -- for years now, unfixed.

Worse? There's nothing more unnerving than hearing a prowler outside your house and telling Echo to turn on downstairs lamps and having it argue with you while your house and garden is still in the dark with someone outside.

You will literally want to bash this piece of garbage into the cement just to get some satisfaction and closure.

______________________________

This more expensive speaker was billed as working via Zigbee even when your Internet connection is down. It's never worked reliably even for turning a light off and on. The older Echo Dots were actually more reliable than this ever was.

At any rate, I have just about reached my limit with Amazon and Echo and am looking for a competitor's product.

Like eBay that used to work quickly and simply, over the years it's been bloated to the point it's time consuming and labyrinthine. I assume this is because workers and supervisors need to show results and justify their existence so over time what worked simply becomes bloat ware.

As a reult of this, now when ask what time it is instead of just answering briefly it tells me the time AND then tells me to have a nice day, or to enjoy national blah blah blah day.

Think about what just happened there. A MACHINE with no real personality just took the time (and my time) to wish me a nice day. Maybe that's cute once, but it gets annoying. Imagine if you flipped a light switch in your home and instead of just doing its job it suddenly had a personality and wished you a good day, and then your toaster, and so on, all throughout the day. It's ridiculous. That's not what I bought into. I literally simply wanted to be able to walk into a room and turn on three lights at once instead of having to go around the room and do it one by one.

Not even that works anymore.

The system works for awhile and then a name stops working, so if you've called it desk lamp suddenly you have to call it something else. There are only so many logical things to call it. So I've gone through a few name changes and each successive one and more and more strained to have some meaning. My living room is now ""Garden Room"" and so on.

Worse still is the system repeatedly tells me a device isn't working and then I ask again just a second later and suddenly it works normally. Hey, Amazon, how about the stupid device tries three times before telling me it doesn't work instead of just the one?

Just as infuriating is very clearly saying to turn something on and getting a message that says, ""A few things share the name 'table lamp.' Which one did you want? Well I've got WRITING TABLE lamp and STUDY LAMP and CONSOLE TALBE LAMPS and FRENCH LAMP and BEDROOM 1 LAMPS and BEDROOM 2 LAMPS and so on. Most of those things don't sound anything like one another, but still the device can't figure it out and constantly asks me which one I want.

I suspect this has to do with waking up after you say the wake word so while it's doing that it misses the first (and more descriptive and unique) word and just starts listening at ""lamp."" Either way, it's annoying, and I don't recall this ever being an issue with the early/simpler/cheaper Echo Dots before I got this one.

Every day is infurating, and because unlike a human it's the exact same thing, it's more maddening.

I simply want to be able to say what time is it or what's the temperature or so on and get an answer, not a verbose response.

Even if you want to play an audiobook and shoot the sound over from your phone to this speaker via Bluetooth that works, but Amazon in its infinite wisdom decided the speaker should (instead of just start playing your book) say, ""Now connected to blah, blah, blah."" Just play the book and we will know we're connected.

Do a Net search for Amazon Echo or Amazon Alexa and the word verbose and you will see I'm not alone in my issues here.

It's so awful even though I'm invested in this maddening system I'm looking into competing products designed by humans who actually gave them some thought as to how they interact with humans.

The devices should be adapted to US, no US to THEM.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Onyxgirl,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2018","This Echo does everything it professes to do, plus the sound is great. It is a breeze to set up too. If you have TIVo, as I do, and want it to turn the TV on or off, you have to use a smart plug, otherwise it works with TIVO to change channels without the smart plug.

I do want to warn those who might have an issue with the Echo that they need help with to be aware that there is an online scam from a company called, ITS support, where they will try to sell you a repair contract for $149.99. I Googled Alexa (instead of calling Amazon for help) and found this site that looked like it was an Amazon site. They had me try to download the Alexa app, but the download failed each time because the website it rigged to always show a failure. That is how they get you to purchase their product. They tell you that you have viruses on your computer and go through quite an elaborate scheme, taking control of your computer, pretending to scan and clean up the so-called viruses. All of that is fake. They are not really doing anything. It only appears that way. I had a gut feeling about this and called Amazon. At Amazon, I was told that they would never try to sell you something to fix the issue and that they had no record of my call. I mention this because someone in one of the reviews stated that he was told to buy a fix for $149.99, and it seemed too coincidental.

Hellman,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2019","After owning several 2nd gen Dots, we finally decided to add the full size Echo to our home. Very noticeable improvement in sound and voice recognition. While it does not replicate a surround sound system or soundbar (which it doesn't claim to do) it provides better than satisfactory sound with a surprising amount of bass. We listen to all sorts of music through Pandora, Spotify and Amazon and have no complaints with the quality of sound, it gets quite loud and remains crystal clear. When we want the music to extend to our living room, we simply tell it to connect to bluetooth and it automatically turns on our surround sound system and continues the song.

Our Echo lives in the kitchen and functions as a source of music, news, games while we are cleaning, cooking timers and random questions about ingredients. Its convenient to ask Alexa to turn on the under cabinet lights when your hands are dirty and you need a little extra light to see what you are doing. Its also convenient to ask her to turn the A/C lower when it starts getting hot in the kitchen.

As far as connectibility with smart home devices, it was easily recognized through our Alexa app and took zero updates or syncing to get our Hue lights, smart thermostat and sound system working with voice control. If you don't already own an Alexa device, it will take a little bit of setup.

We are thoroughly happy with the purchase and continue to recommend to friends and family. As far as privacy concerns, if you have a smart phone, it is already listening to everything Alexa would hear anyways, if you don't like that then smart devices are not for you. The convenience and quality of sound and function make it a necessity if you have a smart home or are looking to create one.",5.0 out of 5 stars
John D. Williams,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2019","I wish there was a phone app that came with Echo so I could click on my favorite apps or turn up up the volume. I cannot stand having to yell at this thing. It's turned into a hostile relationship. Try asking it to read something and you'll get an offer for a free audible trial, and then you have to yell to interrupt it while it's giving you the rundown. I've tried saying, ""Alexa, do not ever use the Audible skill,"" but no use. At least once a week it happens again. And if I walk into the room with my laptop then Alexa announces that I'm connected, and when I leave the room it announces that I'm disconnected. It's really annoying. I do not like this voice control.

Ok, this section is new. I decided not to edit my original complaints but to add to them instead. I got a call from a friendly Amazon guy today who told me that there is, indeed, an Alexa app for my phone. And he even walked me through the app and showed me where to change the volume, select from my radio station history or from new stations, and a number of other things. I was familiar with the Alexa app on my laptop and it did not have any of these features, and I assumed the two apps were similar, but not so. (You know what they say about assuming.) Anyway, the guy was very helpful and I've since apologized to Alexa for my recent verbal abuse. Bottom line, this really is a good product. My two sons want one now.

Stevee108,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2020","I bought two identical Echoes, 3rd generation, verified purchaser. I installed one in the den and one in the master bedroom. I also installed 4 Alexa compatible security devices in those two rooms. The Echo were set up for Apple I-Tunes. After a week, the Echo in the bedroom worked flawlessly. The Echo in the den would constantly tell me that “Apple Music is not supported by this device.” The next time I tried the same command, the Echo would work. I never got this message on the Echo in the bedroom. I uninstalled and installed Apple Music Twice. It worked flawlessly for a couple of days, and then it went berserk again on the Echo in the den. As an engineer, I decided that I would run a totally controlled experiment with the response of the Echo as the only variable. I recorded several voice bytes with the exact same Alexa command of “Alexa Using Apple Music Play Willie Nelson Seven Spanish Angels.” All of the recordings had 10 seconds of silence at the beginning before it gave the “Alexa” command. I chose a specific sound byte that had properly worked twice in a row. I placed the recorder on the arm of the recliner that I usually sit. I had access to a sound meter calibrated and certified for regulatory noise compliance regulations on all governmental levels. The noise meter was last calibrated in November 2019. The certification is valid for 12 months. I placed the microphone of the noise meter within 2 inches of the Echo. I played the same sound byte 20 times without changing either the location or volume level of the recorder. The plots of what was received on the sound meter could be plotted, and all 20 plots were a perfect overlay. With scientific certainty, the Echo was receiving the exact same sound byte 20 times in a row without the slightest variation in sound level or voice intonation. The results: 8 times the Echo told me that Apple Music was not supported by this device, 6 times the Echo interrupted the sound byte and started playing unsolicited music and 6 times the Echo played the requested song via the requested source. Again, I could verify and certify that the Echo was receiving the precise same sound byte every time. I then took the recorder into the bedroom and played the sound byte 20 times there. The distance was about 3 times further away than in the den. The results, the Echo played the correct song 20 times in a row. There is obviously an issue with the quality control with this device.

Sean Christopher,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2019","I purchased my first Alexa Echo 1st Gen two years ago and I fell in love right away! It was bittersweet for me to replace it with the newer 3rd Gen but they had an amazing trade-in offer so I had to take advantage of it. First thing to note this Echo is much shorter than Gen 1 but a little wider which I prefer because it looks and fits better on my kitchen island. The new blue color is amazing if you’re considering getting it! Setting up the new Echo was the easiest most seamless process! I literally took it out of the box, plugged it in and in under a minute it set itself up and was ready to use! I didn’t have to do anything, it was already programmed with my smart lights and my WiFi, couldn’t ask for an easier setup. I love my Echo and use it every day and if you’re considering getting one, I say go for it! If I had to critique or complain about anything the only thing I could say is the wall adapter is really large since it’s still a square block like Gen 1. This is more of a personal opinion but Gen 1 had a rotating top to turn the volume up and down (which I loved) where as Gen 3 has volume up and down buttons. Functionally they both work I just though the rotating volume top was more fun and unique, but I’ll live on just fine with the buttons.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jayfire2620,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2020","They had great deals on these a month or so ago so bought this and a few dots. Set up was super easy, had some issues getting them all set up to play music everywhere at once but easy fix, plenty of info online and most of it was a faulty modem issue where I needed to get a new modem.

Sound quality is really good. I love music, blasting it loud and it handles it really well. Even just as a music player I'd be happy. Not as good as my Bose but there is a huge difference in price and my Bose sits in one spot on one end of the house not playing everywhere like these. Really impressed with the sound though.

Had an issue with connection though. My Comcast internet kept dropping and I would lose my connection to the speakers. Spent hours trying to figure it out, searching online reset a couple of the dots and had to set everything up again....huge headache over and over till I got my new modem. Finally found if you unplug it and plug it back in, it reconnects! Super simple yet a pain to find the answer.

If your doing smart home stuff it works really well. Getting some music, Pandora, Slacker/LivexLive to play stations can sometimes be a real pain. You have to know the station name exactly and still at times plays stuff you didn't want. 95% vs 5% works/issues had some issues with smart plugs and lights not working directly with it too.

Eleanor,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2020","Just bought Echo on sale for $60 from Staples. I just needed a Bluetooth speaker for my TV and this is all they had. I was worried my Apple TV 4th generation wouldn’t pair with Amazon speaker. It does (You Just have to tell Alexa to turn on Bluetooth) and for a third of the price of the Apple speaker. The sound quality is great. Very smooth. Much better than the Cambridge Bluetooth speaker I bought a year ago and now doesn’t recharge anymore. It’s my first Amazon device so there is a learning curve. It doesn’t appear much different from Siri. I only use Siri to set the timer when I’m cooking or to look up phone numbers and I image Alexa would do the same if I ask her. I won’t trade in my Apple phone, iPad, or TV so it’s nice that Amazon is so flexible.

UPDATE: No sound coming from Alexa while paired with Apple TV this morning. Called tech support, we cleared Alexa and set-up from scratch. Still nothing. I tried a 3mm audio cord. Still nothing. I was ready to give up and to return Alexa. How sad I used her last night to play Thunder storm sleep sound to drown out annoying loud neighbors. Slept like a baby. I decide to give it another try. I went back into App clicked on Echo settings and under general found AUX Changed to Line in. HORRAY! I’m back in business. She’s working great.

Dr-Phone,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2019","I have 4 of the pluses! For the most part I like the sound of them. They sound very good. I had no issue with just unboxing the units and plugging them in! The units connected to my Wi-Fi with no issues. It does take about 45 Minutes for the Temperature sensor to come online. Then I noticed it is about 1.5F lower then all my other thermometer in the house. This looks to be the case for all 4 units. I didn’t find any way to be able to a-just them to correct the reading. They also seem to take some time to change as far as the reading. If I could give the Pluses a offset to use for the Temperature to correct them! Then I would be very happy with them. Not tried out the Zigbee hub in any of the units yet. I don’t have any devices that talk Zigbee.

I like the fact if you have 2 or more Echo Pluses! You can ask what the house Temperature is and it will then give you the average Temperature of the house.

I also like the fact I can use the
built in Temp to be able to control my ceiling fans through the Bond home fan controller.

** Update 2/13/2019 **

In testing the hub some more found the following
The Echo Plus will not read Temps 32 and below. So if you want to get the temp outside on a cold winter day! This will not work.
If you have a sensor with a Humidity reading! Again the Echo Plus will not see it at all.
If you have any sensors that report there battery status! You will be out of luck using the Echo Plus hub. It will not even show it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
ABQ Matt,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2019","After doing some research on which platform to start my home automation process I chose the Echo because of the supported products and ease of use.
The sound is clear and loud enough for all your needs. I have mine in a large living room (600 sq/ft) with 15' ceilings and it fills the room up nicely.
As for the voice recognition it easily picks up both my commands and my two kids voices with minimal errors. Yes Alexa still makes mistakes and yes it will still frustrate you sometimes like all voice commanded AI we interact with on a daily basis.
The built in hub is nice because on accessories I am not worried if it is WiFi or hub required because this can do both. So far I have done the August lock and Singled Bulbs with no pairing problems or interaction issues with the app and devices.
Routines are simple and easy to set with app and you can stack multiple items on one task. For example at 30 minutes after sunset it checks the front lock to make sure it is locked and locks it is it is unlocked, turns on the living room lights, and turns on the porch lights.
Complaints:
Where it is located I have to use a WiFi extender, and if I reset my router I have to reset the Echo because it will not automatically reconnect to the extender.
Some devices still require bridges and/or 3rd party apps to be installed even though you have it connected through the Echo.
It gets really expensive once you start the automation process and it is addicting. You start to enjoy having things automated and the $20 bulb here or the $50 switch here really adds up very quickly.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Dave Ohlund,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2019","I have a pair of the 2nd generation echo plus paired up with the subwoofer, and they sound great. Been using for several months, the first time setting it up was a bit frustrating because when setting up the pairing, the speakers didn't recognize each other, then the subwoofer, repeat a few times until it worked.
Was dreading having to set these up again after moving, but no issues at all the 2nd time, just changed the wifi password and it set everything up like before. Switching the speaker setup (left/right) was a couple taps on the alexa app.

I don't use it much for apps or games, mostly for music (I use amazon music unlimited, spotify, iheartradio, tunein) and it's been great so far.
My kids ask it random questions all the time, which is interesting and sometimes way more entertaining than it should be. Sometimes it doesn't know/understand and they rephrase their question (or simplify their question) and keep trying till they get an answer, other times it answers on the first question. And sometimes it 'hears' something way different than what was asked and the response is not what was expected and hilarious.

Right now there's one thing it does that's annoying the crap out of me. When playing a radio station, it will not stop playing unless I go into the alexa app and turn it off. If I say 'stop playing', 'stop', 'pause', or even tell it to play a song, it pauses for a moment, then continues to play the radio station.

Overall I give it a 3-4 star rating, I would definitely buy these again, and will most likely get the next generation model when it comes out, or shortly after and set these up in another room.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Experienced at life,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2018","I primarily bought this because I wanted to enter the world of smart devices. I bought some google home minis, but found you had to download apps from outsiders in order to use the smart light I wanted. I looked at the privileges that were being demanded by the app and decided an app to control lighting had no reason to know who I called, when I called, or anything else about me personally. Amazon already knows me (my husband thinks they pretty much own me) so I was more in favor of using the echo plus since it has a built-in hub and no third party app or skill was desired for the smart light I bought (actually, I received a free smart light bulb when I purchased the echo plus).

I had a bit of trouble getting the light to work - Alexa didn't find it at first but I reset the bulb and then I was good to go. I agree with others that the Alexa app interface is not really intuitive, but now that I have the light up and running, I am in love. My 94-year old father is not very mobile and when he comes to stay with us, I wanted him to be able to turn the light on and off while he is still in bed. This feature now works like a champ so I am very happy.

I have played some prime music and that works well, but I still have a lot to learn about all the echo's features.

The only reason I would not give it 5 stars right now is the alexa app - but that is really a separate issue, so I gave it 5 stars.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kenneth I.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2020","My Alexa was shipped to me yesterday and I couldn't be happier with what I can do with it already! I read the mostly Positive reviews and some Negative. So I didn't really know when it arrived whether I'd experience any of the Negative.

Well, I'm glad to say that what I've learned and programmed in 'one-day' are nothing less than spectacular! From the moment that you plug it into the wall it takes you through a Set-Up Routine that couldn't have been easier. Using the Amazon Alexa App on my Apple iphone I was able to program responses that I wanted.

Amazon Tech Support flawlessly guided me to pair with my Iphone in less than five minutes! It has my entire directory and all I have to do is ask it to call someone. It checks the number with me and then makes the call.

Sometimes I like browsing through You Tube. I should mention that once Alexa is sharing the same Wi Fi network as my iphone. it it takes the place of the speakers in the phone. You'd have to turn Alexa's volume way up to hear the You Tube voice clearly. This can easily solved by activating the iphone's Ear Speakers and now the voice comes through the iPhone.

It's very User Friendly. Greets me in the Morning and goes into Sleep Mode at night. So far I haven't found anything that I can't do with it. The Tutorials found in the Amazon Alexa App are easy to understand.

Right now while I'm writing this review Alexa is playing Music that I selected and can be heard all over my home.

In conclusion I'd say that if you want one 'Go for It'!.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Justin,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2019","I currently own the echo dot 2 and a couple of the 3rd generation dots. I would always listen to my Amazon Music playlist while I cleaned around the house. I needed something with a bit more volume and sound so I went with this 3rd generation echo. The difference is definitely worth the upgrade. Voice recognition is better among other things. I love all of the features that Alexa has to offer. My son who is almost two has just recently started talking and he will randomly blurt of ""lexa playyyy shots!"". Of course he doesn't emphasize the A in Alexa so I help him out a bit and he gets a big ole grin on his face when Lil Jon and LMFAO start to play. The Alexa skills are great. The Guard mode when away also allows Alexa to listen for smoke alarms and glass breaking. This would result in a notification pushed to your phone. I would love for them to ad a feature that allowed several echo's to monitor these sounds while home. With one in the basement, kitchen, living room, and upstairs bedroom, It would be amazing if Alexa could hear a smoke detector from the basement or kitchen and then alert my bedroom echo with a very loud alarm. This would allow me to wake up much sooner since it takes a bit for smoke to get upstairs. Even then, Its hard to hear a smoke alarm in a hallway when you run a fan or window AC all night. Who wouldn't want to get out of the house before a fire got out of control? Amazon....please consider this feature. It would definitely save lives. It could even save households that keep fire extinguishers on hand. Anyways, buy this echo. You won't regret it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
OliverT2,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2018","I purchased Alexa Plus (gen 1) the day it came out and now this (gen 2) Plus Hub. I'll not rehash that experience so Amazon will not call me again. OK if you don't have one of these Hubs they are cool and I like over Wink, GE and Hue. Hue hub I gave away but still use Wink for Zwave and Stanley locks. I run all the switches and WiFi off Alexa/Echo hub. Now I have Alexa both gen 1 and 2 hubs running. Good news this one just sync's-up and no issues so far. So why did I purchase this well for temperature sensor and most important stand alone automation when WEB is down. Temperature works great if you wish to know as she runs 1.5 to 5 degrees hotter then the room when in use especially if you are enjoying the my opinion improves sound quality. So great if you want to take her temp but a word of caution if you are running heating/cooling automation off her reading alone. As for standalone light controller when internet is out also, guess that is some enhancement as I couldn't get it to work just got the typical RED ring. Why 4 stars, 1 because it is cool, 2 because it works kind-of, 3 because I purchased it after know what gen 1 was like out of the box and 4 so Amazon won't call asking me about my review. Really is a fun great product nice new Android App update is what I use as the main driver for home automation after giving up circa 1978 X10/BSR system till a few years ago. Why not 5 stars? I'll save that for when the product reaches the hype. I purchased not for what it can't do now but what it can do in the future. Except for new looks I have experienced nothing to praise over the older hub so far.",4.0 out of 5 stars
ABCruz,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2019","First off, I own several Echos... from the 1st Gen to Plus to Dots. So, this is not a 'bash' Amazon or Echo review nor is this me drinking from the Amazon/Echo Kool-Aid.

This is meant more as an observation of my experience with them... culminating with the Echo Plus 2.

Echo-wise, there are no obvious functional differences in how all these Echos work.

Appearance-wise, I really like the rounded unassuming appearance of the newer Dots and the Echo Plus.

Microphone-wise, here's where there seems to be differences. In my opinion, perhaps this explains issues with Echos after the first generation.

My first gen Echo is near instantaneous in the ring lighting up and the 'listening' sound (I have all of my Echos adjusted this way so I can hear actual and accidental activations).

Every gen since then, seem to have a delay between the wake word being heard and the Echo responding by lighting the ring and making the activation sound.

As much as I enjoy the Echo Plus 2, I have factory reset, voice retrained (from a foot away and even as far as ten feet away) and even deregistered the device several times... and there is still a half to one second delay in an acknowledgement that the device 'heard' me.

Before you respond that it must be a defective device, this is my 2nd Echo Plus 2 from a completely different source... in addition, all of my Echos, after the first gen, have this similar issue.

This doesn't ruin the Echo experience for me... it just tarnishes it.

I'm hopeful that somehow, someone, someday will actually address this and/or release a firmware update (if it is a software issue) to make these Echos really, really shine!!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Liz,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2019","I first started out with an Echo Dot and during a special I can’t remember black Friday maybe I went ahead and got this for my bedroom and I moved my Echo Dot into my kitchen and I kind a wish I just would’ve gotten this in the beginning. I love the echo plus the sound quality is amazing the base is amazing I use it for everything I use it as my morning alarm, it’s my clock, it’s my weatherman, I use it for reminders all the time (I was constantly leaving sodas in my freezer and they were exploding and now I just asked Alexa to remind me to get my soda out in 10 minutes and it’s a quick simple request and it works every time and it has saved me money in my soda purchases) :)
I use it as a timer for exercises and stretches I get my news from it I use it when I’m away to turn on my lights I use it to play music for my dog when I’m gone (saves my tv as no more keeping the tv on for her) it’s just I don’t know what I would do without it at this point I use it not just every day but 100 times a day and it’s super easy to coordinate through the app on your phone with my second Echo Dot like to do things such as play music in both rooms at same time or have different reminders and timers kept separately.
I’ve kept the same wake word but they know which one I’m talking to! so they don’t both go off at same time. it’s just great I love the future",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kevin lam,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2019","Bought this after I fell in love with my 2nd gen echo dot, but wanted an upgrade for me room, so I could put the dot in the kitchen for simple smart home co trolls and music during cooking. The sound in this thing is insane, for a medium sized room, I never have to keep the volume over half, and the base is crisp and beautiful, you gear every little wub and punch, unlike the dot, which only tries to mimic the low sounds with its tiny tweeter. This is worlds better, is it better then a multi hundred dollar speaker or surround sound home entertainment system, hell no, but is it way more then what you could expect for a speaker the size of a beer pitcher? Hell yes as well!! The microphones seem to be able to pick up my voice even when music is playing and the air conditioner right beside it is blaring, and even though most of my smart home devices are wifi and not zigbee, I'm happy to be able to expand the choices of smart home devices I can now buy with the built in hub. The thermometer inside, I thought was useless at first, but I can set it to turn on my airconditoner at night when the temperature is over a certain degree, and off when it's under a certain degree, which saves myself from having to half brain command it to turn on and off in the middle of the night, I will be buying an echo sub to further enhance the lows in my music, not because I need to, but because I personally love bass in my music.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Roger J. Buffington,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2019","I am a bit of a latecomer to the Echo Plus and Echo, and for that matter to Alexa. You may count me impressed. I run two Echo Plus units plus the woofer unit. The music quality is very good. It is perhaps a shade less rich than my paired Apple Homepods which I have in another room. But the difference is marginal and I am satisfied with the music quality.

For use with Alexa this is a very good unit. Alexa has wildly surpassed Apple's Siri. I use Alexa to control my Sony TV, as an alarm clock system, and to control the lights in the upper story of my house. It was not at all difficult to set all of this up, and it is a joy to use. I am very impressed. I will say that the Echo Plus does not pick up voice commands quite as well as does the Homepod with Siri. If you are playing music or the TV at a high volume (as I often do) sometimes you have to put some volume in your voice to have Alexa parse your voice command. This is a minor nit.

Pairing was straightforward. As others have noted, if you change your pairing configuration, you first need to ""unpair"" the earlier group if you have one. No big deal.

Overall this is an excellent value for the money. Recommended. RJB.",5.0 out of 5 stars
SuperATV,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2019","I received the Echo Plus (2nd Gen) as a Christmas gift and I absolutely LOVE it! Not only was the set up super easy but Alexa is so helpful! I am not sure how we managed to keep anything straight before getting this! I have used the Echo Plus for multiple things from creating and adding items to a shopping list to playing music while cleaning and all of this completely hands free. No more paper shopping list that gets lost and no more searching YouTube for a song that I want to hear. I simply say ""Alexa, add milk to my shopping list."" Or, ""Alexa, play today's hits."" The best feature is the hands free knowledge that is just a question away. While making sugar cookies I needed a conversion for a measurement and my hands were covered in dough and flour. I simply asked Alexa for the conversion and had my answer without needing to stop, wash my hands, and use my phone or cookbook to look up the information I needed. I was also able to set my timer for the cookies by simply asking Alexa to set a timer for 8 minutes. A timer alarm on the Echo Plus alerted me when to remove the cookies from the oven. The Echo Plus links to my iPad and several wireless speakers throughout our house. Linking the Echo Plus with these items was a breeze by using Bluetooth and only took a few seconds for the Echo Plus to find. I would highly recommend the Echo Plus (2nd Gen) to anyone looking to purchase one.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Raymond Ramirez,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2019","The Amazon Echo Plus is an intelligent amplified speaker that works just like all the previous Echo products but its larger size has two very good speakers, and produces great audio when playing music. The unit depends totally on the Alexa app installed in a smartphone to add ""skills"" (special interfacing apps). Since I speak mostly in English and my wife in Spanish, I set it up for both languages (U.S. versions). It is totally dependent on a good Wi-Fi connection, so if your setup is poor, improve i t before installing this unit.

One has to be careful as in anyone mentions ""Alexa"" in any sentence, it lights up and begins recording everything. So you must disable the microphone (with a button on top) if you meed to have special conversations near it.

The Alexa app does a good job of locating any device that it can control. Some may need a specific ""skill"" (manufacturer app), but Alexa found my Fire Stick, all my light switches (i lists the brands), and m Ring camera (also needs the skill installed). With a Vizio Smart Cast skill, it found my two Vizio TVs, and with a Roku skill, it found the two I have. I managed to play some of the thousands of songs I have purchased through Amazon, which is linked to the Amazon Music app, and m,y wife enjoyed saying, ""Alexa, play Yanni"" twice.

Eventually I will need to buy a smaller Echo unit (maybe a Dot) to put in my bedroom so I can control these devices from there. It has over 1,400 ""skills"" to install and use, yet I have just began to use Alexa's abilities.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Gary Blanchard,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2020","Oh well, I'll do it myself.

I am an old guy, and have resisted this technology. I even wrote a song in which Alexa uses all she has learned about us to rise up against us. Then, the other day, my wife says ""I wish there were some way you could tell something a song you want to hear and it would play it..."" I was able to tell her that it did indeed exist and could be in our living room for a mere $99.00.

Well, it arrived today and was so easy to set up that I was able to do it without calling in a grandchild to help. My wife and I spent some time requesting songs ranging from the 5th Dimension to Peter, Paul and Mary. She even played me a song from my 1980s Original Soundtrack album. She told us the weather, where squirrels go in the winter, and a couple of dad jokes almost as bad as mine. With all of the novelty I can also see some benefits. I can use this to time my food, to remind me of appointments (which are easy to forget when every day feels like Saturday). With the addition of an Echo Dot for upstairs we can have an easy to use intercom. I am sure as time goes on we will discover even more ways it will make our lives easier.

S. Tracy,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2019","So, after buying and trying a couple of echo dots, I bought 2 of these 3rd gen echo’s. I must say I was quite impressed with the sound after the dots. I also paired with an echo sub and a 4K Firetv Stick. With the Alexa app, the capability is there to set up a “theater” system. Actually it works pretty well. Setup took about 15 minutes including the speaker software/firmware updates.
Sound.....
So I’ve had for the last 20 years a 5.1 system with different high end receivers and Paradigm speakers. Now, I was NOT looking to duplicate the sound that system produced but, I was looking for something decent. Actually these 3rd gen’s paired with the little echo sub do pretty well. I’ve actually had quite a few people over that had in the past enjoyed my other system for “movie nights” or just sitting around playing cards listening to music, and they’ve all been impressed. Enough so that most are looking at setting up the same system at home.
I’m not going down the road of specs and stats. I’m just going to say I’m impressed and would purchase all again.
I’m hoping in the future there will be a firmware/software update that will integrate these speakers into a full surround. A 5.1 or even a 5.2 would be super.
For now I’m extremely happy with them. For the price they’re great.

She would tell Alexa to play her favorite songs and would dance to her songs. That was then and this is now. It is amazing how far along the Amazon Alexa has come. Now you can use it to set up your smart home devices, make calls, send messages, send announcements and even use Alexa to show you your DIY home security cameras. This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of all the items Alexa can do. When I hear about people making a fuss about people from Amazon listening to their Elexa comments, I thank Amazon for hiring all those employees helping to make Elexa continuously better. There are so many things that you can do with the New Amazon Alexa, that I can spend hours and hours learning the features available within the Alexa app. If I had a nickel for all the times my wife has told me to stop using my phone or tablet, which then keeps me from learning and doing more things within the Alexa app, I would have accumulated enough nickles to buy ten Echos. Thank you, Amazon for all the work that you have done to make the Amazon Alexa as amazing that it is.

Moving along the set up was fast & easy just use your PC Alexa App and in about 5 Min. its ready to go. I had a 1st Gen. Echo that did a good job and has nice sound and with it I have a few Plugs & bulbs still working good. So... when I seen the new Echo Plus & new subwoofer I had to have them. The Echo Plus did have better sound then my 1st Gen. one. It also connected to everything I've had for a few years. Instead of using the awake word Alexa I changed it to Computer, the 2 other words you can use are Amazon & Echo. Connecting the 2 Echo Pluses to the Amazon Subwoofer went smoothly and now I have the sound I wanted. The music app I have lets me play different combinations of speakers. You also can turn speakers up or down manually or by command. One other "" of many "" thing I like is when I turn off all the lights to go to bed I tell my Echo Plus to turn on my bedroom light, its a multi color bulb which is set on blue.

I know the potential is there for Alexa to be great and I'm looking forward to its potential. Right now every smart device works on its own, so don't expect to easily connect with your smart TV or your security system straight out of the box.

Options are limited in other areas as well. I have Alexa on my phone and I connect my phone to my car stereo, but the service from the car company forces Google apps, because of Google maps. So you have to make the choice if you want to sacrifice one option or the other.

Also, since Alexa is an Amazon product, you'd think you would have better Amazon Music benefits. Unless you upgrade to a full plan, you can only stream to one device, or one style of music to every device.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2018","I am new to introducing Alexa to my home..

i like it but i think it could be a little more flexible..

I'm Australian, i sometimes sound slightly British from living there also.. i HAVE to have it set to USA English in order for all the functions (recognise my voice etc) to work, but then american Alexa doesn't always seem to know what i am saying.. i think it is short sighted that one would have to put on an american accent for some words to make it work at its best?!

The British and Australian Alexa voices are SO much better sounding too!! , but then the voice recognition would not work because my amazon account is based in the US where i live.. is there something i am not doing right?

I also asked Alexa how to spell a french word and it just didn't have the capacity to do this.. i tried rephrasing the question a few times - it ended up spelling 'FRENCH' bahahahahaha..

In todays world my feeling is AI should be less local and more international.. you've got a long way to go Alexa.. but i'm sure you'll get there! :-)

The other thing i noticed is the volume level across different music, news briefings and Alexa itself are all over the place!!

So yeah, the only one that always has issues is Sonos. This Echo Plus sounds so good, I'm thinking of replacing my other 3 Echo's. Its also incredibly responsive, more so then the one I replaced it with. I especially like that when I have the music turned up, it still hears the wake word. As for my Mom, I have a few lights set up, probably more in the future, what I liked was telling Alexa to ""find my devices"" and it was done in a few seconds.

Tigre,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2020","This is my first Echo device that I have really been disappointed in and I have several. I have 1 Gen 1 dot, 2 Gen 2 dots, Echo buds, and all of these work well together and sound amazing for what they are so I decided to go bigger. I Should have stuck with the dots. This Echo 3rd Gen is not worth the extra money. It doesn't sound much better than the dots, and for the big kicker, they are not compatible with the dots for things like connecting for stereo sound. I mean how is Alexa not compatible with Alexa?! There is that much of a change in software between generations that Gen 2's can't talk to Gen 3's? Really? Since that is the case, they need to say that plainly in bold letters on their website instead of making me dig for it on some help section after I already bought it! I would have bought something else!

As for the music, It's ok. Not much better than the Echo Dots honestly. The base is slightly more, but just slightly. For some types of music (like electric ambient music for example) it totally distorts the sound making what should sound like light clouds and sunshine sound completely discordant and more like something out of a horror flick.

I mean it's usable. It's an Echo. It works like any other Echo. But it seems the more of these I buy, the harder time they have coordinating which one is going to answer and on which one the music is going to play. I mean I tell my Echo in my bedroom to play music and it plays in my living room! Then to fix it I have to unplug all of them at the same time and then plug them all back in and then they work until the next time they get all confused.

I'm not sending the device back. I mean it works. Just not as well or as seamless as the 3 dots I had been using previously. I will be looking for something that provides higher quality sound to plug my dots into from now on instead of messing with the Amazon stuff if I feel it's time to upgrade again.

By the time you open the app everything that was going to happen has already happened whoever was at the door is already gone.

You don’t need Echo to have the dots either. Dots are smaller so the speaker is smaller, that’s all. Great for smaller rooms and still have a good quality speaker. Better privacy controls on these.

A. Traill,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2018","The Amazon Echo Plus 2nd Gen is perfect for my needs - I bought 2 Amazon Echo Plus & the subwoofer (check my act. to read that review). I have a large great room with 40ft ceilings and it absolutely fills my home with warm sound which can be heard throughout my house, and with the ""everywhere"" group feature I can successfully play my music throughout my home on my Echo's in stylistic fashion. I've been an audiophile for quite some time and this kind of quality for something affordable blew my mind.
I think my favorite feature is connecting this with smart home commands when paired with other devices - turning on lights, controlling my TV's, etc. It just makes everything so much simpler. I am highly anticipating future adaptability - the sky really is the limit with these devices. I would highly suggest these for your home as I have really enjoyed using them.
The only problem I've had so far is giving commands to play certain radio stations and the cursed ""I can't find (x)"" response. I really Alexa said something humorous when she can't find what I'm looking for, it would make it a lot less aggravating when I've been playing a Pandora or Amazon Music station and suddenly it can't find what I'm looking for.

Additional review: Was called by customer service next day, and went through a series of steps, including rebooting the modem. After about an hour, Echo is up and running. Customer service rep knew his stuff.
Cons; Couldn't connect to the internet. App won't download to my Ipad, says I have to update to 10.0 and not able to do that with my Ipad. Downloaded the app to my android phone. App kept connecting my phone to a unsecured network and stayed there until I physically switched it back. (OK today found that it was only connected to the Echo, not the internet) App kept telling me that the password for the internet was wrong...it was not, tried it several times, even went into the router to verify the PW. Several times when the app kept telling me the PW was wrong it didn't bring up a place to change it. Had to reinstall the app and hard reset the echo to get back to a screen to type in the PW. Even in some of the areas where the internet was not needed there was a problem, after putting my phone number in it said that the number belonged to another account. App not helpful, and it seems that the app is the only way to run this little gadget.

Denise Hamlin,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2019","For other ditherers out there like me. Don't over think it. Just do it! The Echo Plus is my favorite Echo Device to date. I'm an early adopter and bought the 1st Echo and and the 1st Echo Show. I was getting tired of the poor sound quality and figured it was time to upgrade. I spent a long time debating between the Echo and Echo Plus. I wishI hadn't wasted my time with the Echo. It's no contest. The Echo Plus is light years ahead on sound and that's the most important aspect to me as I listen to a lot of music. Alexa doesn't always understand my voice, but I am a Brit and it may be my accent, so I need to cut her some slack on that. (Although it is a bit annoying on times, considering I'm asking the same questions all the time. It's not like we use a full vocabulary with Alexa).

I don't have much experience with the hub. I really didn't buy it for that, but I do have the smart plug that came with the deal I got and that works like a charm. All in all I'm thrilled with my Echo Plus. I'm an Apple Fan and was seriously contemplating the HomePod for music. I'm not saying the Echo Plus is on a par with that, but it is good enough, (with the added benefit that I can use it with Prime Music), that I feel I can live with this for my music.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Rattlesnake,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2018","Before buying the new 2nd generation Plus, I had a 1st gen Echo, a 3rd gen Dot and an Echo Show. Most of my home automation was handled by SmartThings. With the addition of the new Plus, I have retired SmartThings and am slowing trying to have Alexa handle all of my HA tasks. The major issue holding this back is that Alexa's support for sensors is brand new and not yet fully developed. For example, the new Plus has a temperature sensors built in to it. But there isn't - currently, I hope - support for simply asking Alexa what the temp is in the room where the Echo Plus resides.

On top of which the features that are currently implements don't work so well. I created a routine that was supposed to send me a notification any time the temp in my living room got below 65 degrees. Just a simple routine to test how the temperature sensor is working. It worked sort of. I would get my notification but it would usually be delivered several hours after the trigger condition had been met.

Otherwise, the new Echo Plus seems to work well. Discovering Hue light bulbs works seamlessly. The sound is much better than my 1st gen Echo, even to my ancient ears. It's smaller, better looking and so far, at least, does everything that it's supposed to do. Amazon just needs a little more time to build out the software.",4.0 out of 5 stars
MrBlueSky,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2020","Sadly after less than 10 months, speaker sounds crackly, and voice recognition is hit or miss.

At first, this was an impressive device with great bass and excellent voice responsiveness. However, after about 6 months I noticed it starting to lag in voice recognition, and I had to repeat the wakeup word ""Alexa"" several times before it would respond. I also started to notice that sometimes the sound was a little crackly when playing music.

I listen to it daily, often for a couple hours as I work around the house, and I rarely have the volume above 40%. On only a rare few occasions have I ""cranked"" it up to 70%. I don't like things loud, and have pretty sensitive hearing, so 40% is usually quite nice and full sounding. However, as the months continued, I noticed the sound degrading more and more and the overall product began to sound more tinny and sometimes crackle with moderate bass sounds (even at only 40%).

Some songs seem to be still ok, but more and more are starting to sound steadily worse. And frequently I have to repeat ""Alexa....Alexa....ALEXA!"" many times, even when I'm only a few feet away before the device responds. My environment has not changed, as it is used in my master bedroom, so I'm not sure why the voice responsiveness would get worse over time...it's supposed to get better as it ""learns"" your voice commands, accent, and speaking style. I have a ""Californian"" accent (which is about as zero of an American accent out there) so I'm very surprised it has lost much of it's voice recognition.

In any case, at first I really and truly was impressed with this little unobtrusive speaker. It really has much more power, and was more robust sounding when I first bought it. However, I am very disappointed that it is already starting to lose it's clarity in sound and responsiveness - at under a year old. I guess in this throw away technology society, perhaps I should have expected as much.",3.0 out of 5 stars
HillHC,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023","Love the “big” sound this 3rd gen puts out. I put my 2nd gen in the breakfast area and this guy on a shelf above my fridge; paired them up because the 2nd gen’s sound was almost as good, and it made cooking fun again. I use Alexa to create my grocery/shopping lists, to help me make substitutes in recipes, convert metric units, and play trivia games or 20 questions with my kids over dinner. The ONLY issue I have is that it mysteriously shut off after 7-8 months and wouldn’t turn back on. It had its original power cord and was plugged into a surge protector, yet zap. My 1st and 2nd gen Echos are still trucking along but not this guy. Now Amazon doesn’t sell them so I can’t even order a replacement. Bad form, Amazon.

Also, one other nitpick, I bought a new Fire tv for my bedroom, and was excited to pair it up for surround sound (using my 3rd gen to test it with plans to order two more if it sounded good) and it’s not compatible. Had to buy 2 new 4th gen Echos to get the surround sound. Disappointed.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Lawrence Bolger,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2018","My echo plus setup experience was very interesting! The Alexa App is instrumental in the set up, so were my headaches caused by the app or the device? After logging into the wifi system and thinking i completed all that was necessary, i was left with a message in the device area. It said echo plus not available and needs to be removed. I tried a few things, unplug, plug, hold down reset. While i could ask and get response that indicated connection to internet, the device on the app, had no other means of editing or setting up. I called support and got a very helpful agent. Together we explored aspects of the Echo interface to no avail. Finally something happened i now had a new message on app “device is recalibrating and could take awhile”!
I asked the agent if this was unusual, and was told “very uncommon”, and she would call me back in a couple of hours.
Things i learned, in lower right corner, icon looks like house with vertical bars. This was the access to device setting. Once my recal competed, when using the menu on left, selecting device i was greated with my room temp! Look in upper right on this screen find 3 dots. Touch those then menu for this device opens. I created a group for origional echo and new echo plus naming it “everywhere”! So now i can say “alexa play _____ music everywhere” and both units play.
Now i need to find out how to change phone number (cell right now) to a different number, to utilize phone call out. I did use it to try it out and that worked fine.
Now i still have question on the aux in? Can i use IPod to play my own music. As a prime member i can play what is on Amazon Music, by asking.
Oh the agent did call back as promised, so i asked her about the aux in use, the response was try it. I havent.
So what could make this better? Maybe a PDF style manual explaining the app interface and what icons are, and what each will do ( like the house i mentioned earlier) vs guessing.
Sounds great but came close to returning that is why i gave 3 stars.

Chris,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2022","The Alexa voice recognition is great, and it understands you well. The sound quality that comes out is wonderful and we enjoy playing music for the whole family - the kids even can start their favorite songs.
However, I would never recommend this to my friends - it plays ads almost every time you interact with it.

Over the past couple years, the Echo has added ads to almost everything. Even after I have switched off advertising, nudges, hunches, and the new words/settings they keep coming up for this and adding automatically, when I ask ""Alexa, what's the weather?"" she responds ""The high for today will be 75 degrees. Did you know that you can add an item to your shopping list - just ask me 'Alexa please buy soap.'""

When ask her what the notification she is displaying means (which often indicates a package has been delivered), instead she says ""Your Epson printer is low on ink - would you like to order more?"" (since I ordered the printer on Amazon two years ago - it has plenty of ink, as it did the last 10 times she suggested ordering more ink).

When I say ""Play Eagle by ABBA"" Alexa says ""You can play this song if you upgrade to Amazon's Premium Music for $9.99 a month, shall I upgrade now?"" since I (or the kids) forgot to say ""on Apple Music.""

It's honestly gotten to the point where I am going to buy a Google Home, which is a shame because I'll have to redo all my smart home integrations which work very well on the Echo (if you discount the advertising).",3.0 out of 5 stars
Jay,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2019","Good sound, easy to set up, attractive/subdued hardware, cloud based AI works well for us, needs better client firmware, admin software apps.

More details on our cons, as the pros have been covered by many other reviews.

- cannot be set up from ethernet connected PC, requires either mobile app or wifi PC
- whisper mode is cool, but rarely works - the volume between ""too soft - can't hear me"" and ""not a whisper - use normal volume"" makes it very hard to get the whisper reply
- bummed that the smart home connectivity for Hue bulbs is limited to so few capabilities compared to a dedicated Hue hub

We have had several Echos over the years, and this is a replacement for an older generation, and I hope this one avoids the problems we have had with those, because they are now essentially paperweights:
- a recent firmware update (sometime in the last 3 months) killed the ability to connect with our router's 5GHz or 2.4GHz wifi, either as an existing, new, or factory reset new device. We had two identical ones, both replaced by these. One went to the garage where it was rarely used, noticed it was not connected about 2 weeks ago, but figured it just needed a reboot; however rebooting it didn't reconnect it. I hadn't used it in a while, figured maybe it died from the cold or something. The second was in storage in the house, so I got it out to use instead, and it powered up and connected to wifi fine - I checked weather, etc. to verify it was ok. I left it alone a few hours, it got an update and restarted, and was then in the same boat as the other one - no wifi connection can be made with any combo of settings I can try, but it does connect to the Android app via the Amazon wifi step of setup, so the hardware seems fine. All our newer Echos - Echo Plus, Echo Sub, Echo Show, Echo Show 2, work fine with the same settings.
- the Android Alexa app pops up an error message when wifi connectivity fails during setup, which covers the first two input fields on the page (network name and password) and can't be dismissed, making it difficult to edit the form without killing the app
- the Android Alexa app flips the phone from standard WiFi to a peer-to-peer Amazon Wi-Fi with the Echo during setup, and killing setup or failing setup leaves the phone unconnected to the internet unless you go back and reselect your normal WiFi network in Android settings
- support was free, but very slow (3+ minutes to type each response, I think they were in multiple simultaneous chats), and ineffective - they just followed the flowchart, ignoring what I told them I had already done, and asking the same questions over and over; the only new thing they had me try was the factory reset paperclip button, but it made no difference.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Jon S,"Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2020","I purchased the Echo Plus to integrate into my Philips Hue lighting and to give me a way to listen to music while I work. I found no problems integrating into Philips Hue. The only limitations I've found so far is that Echo devices aren't aren't recognizable in the Hue app. This is reasonably understandable and not necessarily for me a dealbreaker. As a workaround I wrote routines through ITTT when needed.

The sound quality is quite robust for a speaker of this size. The mids are right and the bass fills the room quite well. The only minor quirk for me and likely it is my preference is that I'd like a little more clarity in the 800hz-1000hz range.

The one noticeable detractor that I do have is that Alexa at times misunderstands a command. I like to think that I have a normal easily recognizable voice but for some commands Alexa misconstrues what I'm saying and regards it as something else. It happens about once a day where I have to say the A word (Alexa) midway through a command to try to correct Alexa. Allegedly, Alexa is supposed to over time better recognize your voice and improve on this but after a month I'm not sure how much better it will get. Most of the time, though Alexa is trouble free in this area and I genuinely enjoy the breadth and depth of Alexa's ability.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Titlelog,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2020","I use Yamaha speakers and MusicCast to listen to SiriusXM music. I also have the original Echo Dot, the next generation Dot, and now the Echo Smart Speaker. The reason I bought the new Echo is because we have Prime, and I feel like I'm cheating myself by not using Amazon Music. I am a diehard classical music lover, and there are a lot of CD's on Amazon that are at least partially included with Prime. My comments will mostly be about how SiriusXM and Amazon Music compare to each other, because Yamaha's WX-030 (now discontinued) sounds pretty much the same as the Echo. The Yamaha speaker has to be controlled with a tablet or phone, but really only if you're changing channels. There are buttons on top to control power and volume, and the unit holds the most recent channel in memory. SiriusXM streams directly to the speaker over wi-fi, and I've had very good experiences with it, sometimes streaming music all day long with no issues. You can integrate the speaker with an Echo, but I'm one of those people who thinks voice control is overrated. The only other downside to the Yamaha is that it doesn't have a line-in jack, unlike the Echo. My experiences streaming Amazon Music have been disappointing, to say the least. The speaker frequently stops playing. The other day it stopped and I asked Alexa to play something else, and she apologized and said the stream stopped due to inactivity. The music had only been playing a little over an hour. Today I asked her to play a show on SiriusXM called Baroque and Beyond, and she did so right away. But about a third of the way into the show, it inexplicably started over from the beginning. The stations on Amazon Music also have issues with volume level, which can be entirely different from one track to the next. I've also found the selections to be less than great. Amazon continually tries to persuade me to upgrade to Music Unlimited, but based on my experience with the music included with Prime, I would be very reluctant to pay more. Hopefully the service will improve over time, but after having the Echo for only about a week, I already find myself using it less and less.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Deb,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2020","After receiving this thoughtful surprise gift from my husband, I somewhat hesitantly agreed to give Alexa a try. I am not technology driven by any means, but after some initial training, I became friends with our new family member, Alexa. I have used ""her"" service for learning the 7-day weather forecast, driving directions to almost anywhere, for answers to a myriad of questions (best homemade shower cleaner, recipe for broccoli soup, most popular baby names in the 50's - and on and on) There isn't much that this young lady doesn't know! My absolute favorite use of my friend Alexa is to play songs of my choice. I love to listen to music doing housework, while taking a shower and during any other activity that allows me access to this ingenious equipment. There are songs I haven't heard in years that Alexa plays for me with gusto. The ever-brilliant quality of Bose speakers supports and shares all of my favorites, from Jazz, swing, country, blues, holiday songs, show tunes, etc. I could never own all of those requested cd's, but Alexa puts a smile on my face whenever she comes up with exactly the unique version of a song I am just dying to hear. Alexa certainly makes dusting a lot more palpable - and she's gone from being an unwanted visitor in my home to a very welcomed addition to our family. Alexa, take a bow!",5.0 out of 5 stars
PeteCress,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2019","My #2 daughter gave me one of these things and, at first, I thought ""Geeze, what an over-priced BlueTooth speaker!""
.
Then I startef fooling around with it and now I have three with probable two more on the horizon.

You only need one ""Plus"" because they talk to each other - but you need that plus so they can all use it to turn smart light bulbs on-and-off and do other WiFi/Zigby stuff.
.
Smart devices, Pandora, my own music via the Plex add-on...I find it addictive AND functional.
.
Three Nice-To-Haves so far:
- Custom wake-up words. ""Alexa"" gets on my
nerves, ""Computer"" is a bit of a mouthful.
Being from Philadelphia, I'd opt for ""Yo!"".
- More granularity in volume commands: 3 is a
bit too soft and 4 is a bit loud. (you only get
10 volume levels at this time).
- Multi-processing. Right now, it only does one
thing at a time so, if you have it playing music and
tell it to turn a light off, the music has to stop for
several seconds while it issues the lightbulb
command, the bulb responds, and the Echo
issues it's ""Command successful"" beep.

Favorite Command: ""'Puter: Shut up"" (actually, ""'Puter Shut"" works too)...and it realky does shut
up immediately.",4.0 out of 5 stars
K. Jacobson,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2019","Bought one of these for the kitchen. It replaces a Memorex Party Cube which had thoroughly degraded over a decade.

The functionality of Alexa is discussed at length everywhere and is amazing. My only issue with this device is the sound quality. I think it's inherent to the design and I did anticipate this. First of all, the bass is astounding. I didn't know something this size could create that kind of bass. I'm afraid treble is another story. In order to create the 360 degree sound, the tweeter (as you can see in the product description) is pointed upward inside the device. It fires internally. The midrange radiates quite well out of the unit as reflected sound. However, the high frequencies (say, above 14khz) do not fare so well. So overall the treble slopes off quite a bit. The old Party Cube, like the Sonos One, has outward firing tweeters, so you are not relying on sound reflection for what you hear - you get the whole spectrum straight from the source, like conventional speakers. So you miss a bit of the magic of vocals, or drum high hats, atmospheric sounds and the like. Out of the box the overall tone is weighed quite a bit to mid bass. Alexa has some basic tone control (Bass, Midrange, Treble) which can help just a bit.

Overall though, the Pros outweigh the cons on this device and I'm happy to have it!",4.0 out of 5 stars

David Goldblatt,"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2020","Actually nothing to dislike. I previously have the smaller Echo Dot system and I thought that sounded great. The echo third generation is amazing! It has such phenomenal bass response and the rest of the sounds is great as well. The app gives you a three band EQ. Alexa is very good for recognizing your voice. Sometimes she misinterprets what you were asking but it is probably because it is not something in her database. I love the concept. I don't like when I play music from my phone through the Echo using Bluetooth but there is a 3.5 mm Jack which can be configured for audio input or audio output through the app. While the AI isn't perfect it does very well providing you with access to information and seconds, playing music from Amazon music as well as other music players which are use such as Pandora, TuneIn and others. All you need to do is ask and most of the time you get the information you were looking for. It is very convenient to have Alexa set a timer for you whether it is timer for taking a nap or something in the oven, all can be set using your voice. It doesn't get any easier than this.

Nicholas White,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2020","I bought one of these on sale for $75. I ordered the (RED) edition, It's gotta be one of the best purchases I have ever made. I'm a big fan of music, a musician myself, an audiophile, and a avid lover of all thing's audio. While this doesn't compete with big old massive tower speakers. It compares very favorably with bookshelf units (when paired with the Echo Sub) as a clear, great sounding little speaker. A lot of review mention bass, if you're looking for bass go order a set of massive tower speakers and the amp to push them. That being said, at low and medium volume, these things PUMP OUT some surprisingly low bass for a 3"" woofer. not only is it low, but it's crystal clear and very smooth and natural sounding. At low volumes (10-20%) I find the midrange to be a bit retracted, but this goes away the closer you get to 30-40% volume. at high volumes, this speaker pulls back on its bass output as I expect it has been designed to do, it's a small driver. I find that this speaker sounds its best around half volume (Which is around normal listening level anyway). These do fill your room with sound by the use of a very intelligent acoustic design to provide you with 360 degree audio.

PG,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2019","Originally owner of Echo Dot 2nd gen, decided to buy Echo Plus 2nd gen because of temperature sensor so that alexa could automatically turn on/off space heater at specific temperature, after following youtube tutorials and setting everything up, ran multiple temperature routine tests & they all failed, alexa would not shut off/turn on space heater on it's own according to ambient room temperature. Later did more research on the subject and found out that lots of other people had the same issue with alexa not being able to control their equipment based on temperature.
Another thing I noticed from Echo Plus 2nd gen was that there was a 10 second delay before playing ""tunein"" radio, with echo dot 2, that delay was only 2 seconds.
And yet another annoying thing i noticed about Echo Plus 2nd gen is: while she's not playing anything if you ask her ""set volume to (a number from 1 to 10)"" she does not play confirmation sound tone so you can't know how loud she really is, on ""Echo Dot 2nd gen"" she plays that tone which is really helpful (even though confirmation sound after each normal request is disabled in settings).
So for over a $100 buying a glorified mono speaker, no matter how amazing it sounds, just doesn't make sense in my opinion.

Donald Woodwell,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2020","The unit works as advertised, however, I could not download the app due to network problems and using a PC to set up the Alexa app was very time consuming and confusing. Amazon's customer service brought on line a 3rd party tech support outfit called Basic Software Systems. This was supposed to be a 'free' service. The tech installed the app on the Echo unit via my PC.

The tech insisted that I need to renew my Windows 10 license & offered me three plans for 1, 3, & 5 years. I objected since such renewals are never necessary when Windows is installed by the manufacturer. However I agreed to the 1 year renewal at $150 knowing that this would probably be their fee.

As it worked out, they sent me a contract for one year of support services for the $150. This tactic is clearly a poor way to do business. With the assistance of my credit card bank's customer service rep., we both objected to BSS on the phone and a few hours later received an E-mail stating that BSS would refund the $150.

IMHO, this is one third party tech support firm that Amazon needs to drop as it reflects badly on their capability to refer customers to an honest support group.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Estoy impresionado con su reconocimiento de voz ya que puedes estar a una distancia considerable y aún así Echo detectará que le estás hablando.

Cons:
No se si es solo mi Echo pero su receptividad de WiFi es muy baja. La instalé dentro de mi habitación, a unos 5 metros de distancia del router principal que se encuentra en el pasillo y al conectarla me decía que detectaba menos de la mitad de la señal. Lo cual me preocupa porque siendo un producto Amazon esperaba mejor calidad en ese sentido. **ACLARO QUE NO SE SI ÚNICAMENTE ES MI ECHO O ASÍ SON TODOS**.

Tampoco responde a preguntas complejas o algunas preguntas aleatorias del día a día. Tampoco existe un nombre registrado para la ubicación de mi casa por lo que no me dice la temperatura correcta ni funciona la información del tráfico. *AMAZON, ARREGLEN ESTO POR FAVOR*

Denise,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2018","Let me start by saying that I have several echo devices in my home, and really, I love them. It’s great to be able to turn lights on and off by command, to play games, stream music, and do so many other things with these devices. I’m hooked.

There is one major problem, though. When I first bought my echo plus speakers, things were great. About 2-3 days later, I linked my speakers together and gave Alexa a command to stop playing the music. She hesitated, but followed through. About a week later when I gave Alexa a command to end the music, she hesitated and then kept playing the music. Um, hello, who’s in charge here? So I gave the command again, louder. Same response from Alexa. I thought, “Dang, this girl likes her tunes!” It wasn’t until I walked over to my speaker in the family room and gave the command to stop the music that the music finally stopped. Had this not happened 3 separate times, I wouldn’t bother writing about it. What’s the point in all of these microphones on this device if Alexa’s just going to ignore me and jam out to Lithium XM anyway?

If this stops being an issue, I will update my review and give a 5 star rating. Right now, though, Alexa is kind of moody.",4.0 out of 5 stars
celticprncss,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2019","This was a gift from my hubby. I love to play music all day, and am really enjoying hearing it through out the house. Listening to my favorite radio station gets terrible reception, and I'm really tired of my old CD's. So basically I've become a Pandora junkie on my Echo. The speakers are fantastic for my listening needs and I so enjoy being rooms away (like preparing dinner) and still being able to tell Alexa to turn up or down the volume.
I also check the weather daily, and like how she notifies me of a package delivery. I know that I underuse Alex's skills terribly, but for my needs she is about perfect. Oh, and my favorite classical radio station comes in crystal clear with her.
Dislikes: Alexa sometimes will not understand basic commands that I have given her before, such as a music station that I have used many times. She will say "" Sorry, I don't know that one."" So we go around and around as I try to get her to play something she has played many times before. I usually just give up. Also, when watching tv, its eerie because she seems to come to life and out of the clear blue she starts talking. Briefly, but talking gibberish.

Nate,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2019","So I couldn't get this to 5 stars and here is why... Amazon now gives you the option of doing ""speaker pairing"" that will allow you to connect multiple speakers and use them as one. The problem I'm running into is that if you are dropped in on a ""call"" (one room to another) it only uses one speaker and when you try to hang up it says there is no call connected if the ""other"" speaker heard you tell it to hang up.

I love the Amazon Alexa system and I have it throughout my home for home automation and it works great, it can hear you from another room and it understands what you are asking for. There are a TON of devices you can connect to it and there are a TON of skills to use with it. I loved the idea of connecting multiple speakers as one in the master bedroom because of its size but not being able to use both speakers while making a call is not what I was hoping for. I was hoping they would act as one speaker (or a speaker set like a real stereo system) all the time, for everything.

Now the worst part...

I changed my review from 4 stars to 1 star because of a software update that now forces me to specify which light, power strip, and/or other devices I want to turn on/off. All of my rooms, lights, power strips, etc... are in various groups for a reason. Each light, outlet, and other devices have a unique name (IE: The upstairs hallway lights are named UH-Light, UH-Light2, and UH-Light 3, my smart power strip has unique ports like TV, Monitors, etc..).

YESTERDAY (9/18/2019) I was able to walk into a room and say ""Alexa, turn the light on"" (in my home office for example) and it turns the light on, Today (9/19/2019) I'm sitting in my home office and I say ""Alexa turn the light off"" and I get the response ""There are multiple devices that share that name, which one do you want"".

The master bedroom - Setup with only lights (MBR-light, or something like that so I can identify it later when adding other stuff), the wife used to say ""Alexa, turn the light off"" because that's what she has always said before going to sleep. Today she can't do that because of Amazon's development team.

So I say ""Alexa turn the office light off"" and it turns the ENTIRE OFFICE GROUP OFF. So now I have to go to the app to turn the light off and rename EVERY ONE OF MY DEVICES so that my family can remember what each name is.

I reached out to Amazon customer support who tells me I have to be specific when asking the echo to turn the light off as in ""Alexa, turn the office light off/on"" and that it has always been this way. When I tried to tell them that yesterday I was able to say ""Turn the light off"" they said it wasn't possible and I have always had to be specific.

I set up groups for a reason, that being I can go into a room, say ""Alexa, turn the light on"" without having to remember each light bulb name or what I named the room/group. Yes, I know what the group names are, I don't expect everyone in my house to remember the group names.

There was a software/firmware update overnight that broke all of my Echo's and Amazon's customer support will not acknowledge it.

I will not recommend this device to anyone else until they put it back to the way it was.

You would think it would be simple, it's not, apparently.

Update 10-8-2019: Attached another picture right from the amazon website that says ""Alexa, turn off the lights"". It's still broken and doesn't work like that. Additionally, I was supposed to receive an email from the Alexa/Echo customer service department with more information, this was a couple weeks ago and I haven't heard anything.

They (Amazon) reached out to me after reading my review requesting more information, I gave them everything they needed and the rep said he would contact me again, never happened. It is a pain in the rear end, but this has been broken for nearly a month and nothing has been done about it... I keep getting emails saying ""What's new with Alexa?"" I can tell you what's new, you can't turn the lights off by saying ""Alexa, turn the lights off"".

I've done everything the Customer Service Reps have asked me to do, every time it doesn't do what I ask it to do, I go into the app and report it as ""it didn't work correctly"".

SORRY AMAZON, YOU ARE FAILING THIS ONE.

Update 12/15/2019 - So they fixed the ""Alexa, turn the light off"" for a few days, then it was broken again... Now they've changed the APP so it's more difficult to find the voice responses to give feedback. I tried saying ""Alexa, turn the light off"" got the same response as before ""There are multiple devices with the name light, which one did you want"" If I say ""Alexa, turn the office light off"" it still turns EVERYTHING IN THE OFFICE GROUP OFF"" but Amazon customer support can't seem to get it when I explain that it shouldn't do that. So, like the APP says, I tried saying ""Alexa, turn the lights off"" it responds with ""Sorry, what device"" but I can't say ""Alexa, turn the office lights off"" because it will turn all of the plugs off too, so now Alexa has no voice control over lights if there is anything else in the room.

I feel as if I have wasted hundreds of dollars setting this system up for Amazon to come along and ruin it all...

Robert R.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2019","UPDATE:

I still can't believe what a mess this is. Over and over I say ""Echo turn WRITING table lamp on"" and get back that it can't turn ""CONSOLE table lamp on."" Those things do NOT even sound alike.

And it NEVER just does its job and SHUTS UP, even with the minimal talking setting turned on.

This is like being in a torture chamber where the longer it goes on making the same mistakes and talking incessantly my first reaction is to see red and scream at it.

I've seriously got to look at other options. This is beyond belief bad, and needlessly so.

Don't believe me? Google Echo ""a few things share the name"" and see how many people are having this issue -- for years now, unfixed.

Worse? There's nothing more unnerving than hearing a prowler outside your house and telling Echo to turn on downstairs lamps and having it argue with you while your house and garden is still in the dark with someone outside.

You will literally want to bash this piece of garbage into the cement just to get some satisfaction and closure.

______________________________

This more expensive speaker was billed as working via Zigbee even when your Internet connection is down. It's never worked reliably even for turning a light off and on. The older Echo Dots were actually more reliable than this ever was.

At any rate, I have just about reached my limit with Amazon and Echo and am looking for a competitor's product.

Like eBay that used to work quickly and simply, over the years it's been bloated to the point it's time consuming and labyrinthine. I assume this is because workers and supervisors need to show results and justify their existence so over time what worked simply becomes bloat ware.

As a reult of this, now when ask what time it is instead of just answering briefly it tells me the time AND then tells me to have a nice day, or to enjoy national blah blah blah day.

Think about what just happened there. A MACHINE with no real personality just took the time (and my time) to wish me a nice day. Maybe that's cute once, but it gets annoying. Imagine if you flipped a light switch in your home and instead of just doing its job it suddenly had a personality and wished you a good day, and then your toaster, and so on, all throughout the day. It's ridiculous. That's not what I bought into. I literally simply wanted to be able to walk into a room and turn on three lights at once instead of having to go around the room and do it one by one.

Not even that works anymore.

The system works for awhile and then a name stops working, so if you've called it desk lamp suddenly you have to call it something else. There are only so many logical things to call it. So I've gone through a few name changes and each successive one and more and more strained to have some meaning. My living room is now ""Garden Room"" and so on.

Worse still is the system repeatedly tells me a device isn't working and then I ask again just a second later and suddenly it works normally. Hey, Amazon, how about the stupid device tries three times before telling me it doesn't work instead of just the one?

Just as infuriating is very clearly saying to turn something on and getting a message that says, ""A few things share the name 'table lamp.' Which one did you want? Well I've got WRITING TABLE lamp and STUDY LAMP and CONSOLE TALBE LAMPS and FRENCH LAMP and BEDROOM 1 LAMPS and BEDROOM 2 LAMPS and so on. Most of those things don't sound anything like one another, but still the device can't figure it out and constantly asks me which one I want.

I suspect this has to do with waking up after you say the wake word so while it's doing that it misses the first (and more descriptive and unique) word and just starts listening at ""lamp."" Either way, it's annoying, and I don't recall this ever being an issue with the early/simpler/cheaper Echo Dots before I got this one.

Every day is infurating, and because unlike a human it's the exact same thing, it's more maddening.

I simply want to be able to say what time is it or what's the temperature or so on and get an answer, not a verbose response.

Even if you want to play an audiobook and shoot the sound over from your phone to this speaker via Bluetooth that works, but Amazon in its infinite wisdom decided the speaker should (instead of just start playing your book) say, ""Now connected to blah, blah, blah."" Just play the book and we will know we're connected.

Do a Net search for Amazon Echo or Amazon Alexa and the word verbose and you will see I'm not alone in my issues here.

It's so awful even though I'm invested in this maddening system I'm looking into competing products designed by humans who actually gave them some thought as to how they interact with humans.

Mario N.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2022","Just before I start, I have 4 Alexas and they have been working great. Small echo due tends to be annoying with the sound quality, but this Alexa Echo Plus has way better sound Quality. The title of this review is just before you purchase any echo device to read this. I won't go into detail but the Amazon Alexa Customer Service is the worst thing you could experience. I would strongly suggest that you try something else. If the Alexa does not fail is great, if not it is just useless to go with the Customer Service and have troubleshooting, and I will explain why...

1- After my Alexa device crashed (I would assume is just because it looses internet connectivity) you go with the representative and they ask you a series of steps, which are things like: Reboot the device, change the location and restart to default settings (that's totally normal), the problem starts with dumb process that do not make any sense. (sometimes it is just funny), they asked me to uninstall the app from my phone which I totally declined since the problem was on the device. Is like going to a car shop and that car won't start due to an engine failure and they just keep pointing out to change the battery of the key (0 customer obsession). Also pointing out, that I mentioned to the representative that I had it as well install on my wife's cell phone with the same account, so I just had to ask if I had to do it at the same time, in synch haha.
2 - No sense of what they are talking about... so they would ask me to tell an instruction to Alexa that it isn't recognize... and believe it or not, they ASK ME FOR AN ERROR CODE haha!. This is like the most disappointing thing. Is like you calling IT because your laptop monitor won't work and they ask you to do a remote connection to troubleshoot but you can't see anything.
3 - Connection on the chat just drops after 1.5 min of no response, so after that, you need to start with a new agent, you have to wait for them to read the conversation and it's a total waste of time. Finally I asked for supervisor several times, first agent I asked her 3 times, and then she left the chat, the second didn't want me to hang me over, the 3 agent just disconnected, the 4th finally did, but the supervisor wasn't very attentive and he was trying to solve my issue instead of hearing me complain about the lack of service from his previous agents.

Overall, if it doesn't fail, great! but if you have to go with Customer Service, just throw it in the garbage and you will save some time and peace of mind.",1.0 out of 5 stars
bingo,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2018","Summary: Buggy garbage that was never fixed by Amazon's incompetent developers, even 18 months later. Avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid!

---------------------
Original review:

The Echo Plus Stereo/Sub pair setup is extremely buggy and unreliable for playing music. The following all happened on the first day of owning this:

1) MOST of the time when I ask for music it only plays through the 1 echo, and NOT the stereo + sub. The only guaranteed way to get stereo + sub is through the Alexa app and not voice command.
2) I'll say ""Alexa stop"" and it'll stop playing music, then I'll say ""Alexa play"" and instead of restarting or playing new music it'll say ""Not currently playing music"" and not play anything.
3) Sometime after starting music it will play at at low volume for 20+ seconds as if Alexa is listening.
4) After pausing music, when I restart it can sometime take 20+ seconds before playback starts.
5) Music has occasionally just stopped playing for no reason, despite having songs left in my queue.
6) Remote doesn't work while music is playing, only when it's not playing.

The quality of the sound is very good for the price, and once (if) they fix the bugs it'll be a terrific setup. But the voice command implementation for stereo + sub is poorly implemented and the bugs are extremely frustrating so for now my advice is to stay away.

Update: After 3 weeks issue 1 is still happening so dropped to 1 star. Amazon say they're looking into it but unless it's fixed this will stay at 1 star as it's extremely frustrating. Also added a sixth issue above regarding the remote with the stereo/sub pair for those considering buying it.

Update 2: After 2 months issues 1, 4, 5 and 6 still occur regularly.
Issue 1 can be mitigated by saying ""play on stereo sub pair"" or if it's in a group ""play on <group>"". Note that setting up a group with left and right echos added and the stereo sub pair as the preferred speaker seems to improve things but the issue still occurs.
Also found another issue, this time with the multi-room music functionality: If I play on the multi-room setup via the Alexa app and try to interact with Alexa by voice if will often say ""No music playing on this device"" and ignore the instruction.

Amazon's customer support have been great as usual trying to help and keeping me up to date with my bug reports, but the team that developed this should be ashamed of themselves, it's poorly implemented and poorly tested. A prime example of rushing the software out and letting the paying public do the beta testing. Fully deserves its single star.

Update 3: After testing for the last month I can say issue 1 is now fixed, it hasn't occurred at all recently, and that was by far the most annoying bug.

The biggest issues now are:
- The sound randomly cutting out midway through a song, the only way to fix is to skip to the next song.
- The multi-room setup is flaky, sometimes I'll have the echo in the current room respond, and a few seconds later a linked echo in another room will also respond.
- It can still take up to 20 seconds to restart music after pausing.

It's slowly getting there but it's been a very frustrating journey, and for that reason I doubt I'll ever go over 4 stars even if everything is fixed. As it is I'm increasing it to 3 stars.

Update 4: It's been 7 months. The problem with music suddenly cutting out randomly has come back. I'm done with waiting for fixes, after 7 months it's still flaky. Dropped back to 2 stars. As a software developer with over 20 years experience, I can categorically say that Amazon's developers don't have a clue about developing quality software.

Last update: After 10 months my final rating is 1 star. Even after all this time the stereo/sub setup is buggy and frustrating. The Amazon Echo developers are, in a word, incompetent.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Savory Stage,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019","Incredibly disappointed. This was one of EIGHT Fire TV and/or Echo devices that I purchased on Black Friday, hoping to switch from Roku TV and have a seamless smarthome experience. Oh boy, was I wrong.

Whether I rename the the Fire TV devices or use their original names, the echo devices CANNOT control or recognize the tv devices, even after properly pairing them under the TV & Video setting in the Alexa app. I've tried to unpair, repair, restart, unregister, reregister, you name it. I've wasted days. Generally, Alexa responds with 'I cannot find a device named ...' I consider myself very technically savy and I'm positive this is not something that I'm doing wrong. I should've read more into this before buying. TONS of people all over the internet are having this problem. It's infuriating. Plain and simple, until problems like this are fixed, Amazon is blaintantly false advertising the way that their devices work.

Other cons to note:
-Multiple video apps stutter and sometimes even randomly pause without ever resuming unless you physically resume them.
-Alexa drastically lowers the volume of the TV when you are voicing a command. This in-and-of-itself is not a huge problem. However, it becomes a problem often when after the command is complete, Alexa does not resume the original volume of the content. When this has happened, I've had to ask Alexa to turn the volume back up to the specific number it was at.
-I have two third generation echos paired as a stereo system for the TV. Often, even though I have my fire TV set as the preferred device, only the echos hear my voice, and once again, because they cannot control the TV, they say that they cannot recognize the device and then I just have to pick up the controller anyway.
-The Fire TV will often think that it hears an 'Alexa' when absolutely no where near that word has been stated. Because the volume lowers drastically when Alexa is listening, it creates an obnoxious volume dip in content to listen for nothing when this happens.
-You cannot set a sleep timer

Honestly I could go on and on about the cons and about just how unhappy I am about these products. There are even more problems than what I listed here, but I'm not wasting too much breath, as after doing days and days of research on these topics, I've seen that Amazon has absolutely no answers to these problems, even after thousands of people have reported the same problems over and over. Unless there is some revalatory software updated coming, I'll be returning hundreds of dollars of equipment.",1.0 out of 5 stars
AMS,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2020","A few weeks ago, Sirius XM ran a promotion for a Satellite Radio subscription for 5.00 per month for 12 months. Also they offfered a free echo dot. I signed up for the subscription, and paid for the year's service which came to 80.00 odd dollars once all the fees were totaled. The free Echo Dot, however came with a 106.99 charge, hardly free. I phoned and visited the Sirius XM website multiple times, and discussed the charge. They were unable to assist me and directed me to call Amazon. I attempted to call Amazon, but the recording directed me to the Amazon website, which I attempted, and even did a chat with multiple people who were unable to assist me. I then phoned my Amazon Visa credit card company to dispute the charge. I was told I needed to return the Dot. I attempted to return the Dot in the mail, and was told I had to go to UPS, who had shipped it to me. I visited a UPS store, and was told I needed to call UPS to have it picked up. I did call UPS twice in one week, and this Echo Dot has still not been picked up. Finally, I decided I have spent more than 106.99 in my time and aggravation, and paid the charge on my credit card. The purpose of this email is to let you know my disappointment with this experience. I have been charged for a free item, and I have been unsuccessful at trying to get this situation fixed. I would like to get this charge credited. I have talked to so many people, and have been told at least twice that I was charged this money because I made a mistake, even though I followed the directions of the letter sent to me on how to redeem the ""free"" echo dot. I have been a member of Amazon Prime for a few years now and really enjoy the service. I also enjoy the satellite radio subscription. However I must say I really am disappointed with both companies now because of being unable to fix this situation. I attempted to speak to a person at Amazon, but unfortunately was directed to a website due to Covid 19. I would appreciate any help you can provide.

It came with the Echo and the directions say: To set up your free bulb, plug in and set up your Echo Plus, plug in your bulb, and ask, “Alexa, discover my devices."" All I get is ""no devices found"" even when turning on skill in the app. I have a hue account set up and logged in. If you try to join the Hue app itself it said ""no bridge found"". I asked Alexa ""is Hub turned on"" and get no answer. I ask to ""turn Hub on"" same thing. I went and bought another HUE bulb and it does not work either.
I bought this for THE HUB, but it does not seem to work. I'm sending back.

On a side note most new home automation devices are WIFI now and do not need a hub. I just wanted to connect my older devices without an external hub.

I like the idea, but if I would make one of these I would have made a hub that worked and would have included Z-wave in the hub as well.

I'm sending back and ordering the ECHO without the hub. I also ordered a samsung gen 3 HUB to go with it and all will be good.

I do think the ECHO with the better speaker design is a great Alexa device. I love Alexa and everything the dot and Echo do, I just think the Built it hub didn't work out for them so well.

ADDITIONAL INFO:
We even tried to connect our front door lock that was Zigbee and it would not connect in pairing mode. Tried several times and no luck. I think the HUB on the device I bought must be defective.

pppaul,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019","I originally gave a 5 star rating, but since I discovered that the Echo Plus (2nd Gen) with the hub has a problem responding to commands. I have been coping with this problem and finally said enough and decided to update my original write up and rating. You have to repeat the same command several times, before Alexa finally delivers. Will tell you okay, but nothing happens and you have to repeat it over and over. Something as simple as turn a particular light. Like turn on family room light. You can be standing right next to it on top of the Echo and still have the same problem. I also have the Echo Plus (2nd Gen) without the hub and never have to repeat the commend. I can be far away and it will deliver your request the first time. The hub must have created a problem, because the one without the hub works great.

I had an Echo 2nd gen which had great sound for streaming music and work great with the smart plugs.However I wanted the Sengled Smart LED light bulbs and needed a bridge/hub for the smart light bulbs to work so decided to buy the Echo Plus 2nd gen. with the built in hub. Was easy to get the light bulbs set up and working. Screw in the bulbs turn the electrical switch to on and ask Alexa to recognize the new device and the bulbs will blink which tells you that Alexa has recognize the new device. Then just continue doing the same one bulb at a time. The light bulbs are better then smart plugs even for lamps,because if your wifi stops working Alexa with the hub will still be able to accept your command to turn on the lights, because the light bulbs work with the hub no wifi needed. The echos without a hub will not work or accept you commands if the wifi is out. It will tell you to check the wifi connection and will not accept any other commands. The smart plugs work with your wifi so if wifi is down even if you have a echo with a hub the smart plugs will not work. It's best to have the smart light bulbs when ever possible in place of the smart plug with an echo with a hub; this way your smart home can continue to work if wifi goes down.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Nathan,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2020","When it worked, it worked great and I was very pleased with the Echo Plus (2nd gen). However, one day (hardly out of warranty...) it decided that it wasn't going to connect to the internet anymore. I assume the wifi module has a corrupted line of code during an update; I didn't drop it, spill on it, it wasn't struck by lightning, or anything. When I contacted Amazon about this and spoke with their 'engineers' they told me that it was a problem with my network (the same network that has 2 other Echo Dots on it with zero issues). Being an engineer myself, I could tell that they really did their due diligence on finding a solution to this issue (yeah, right).

That customer service rep told me I could trade it in as well as get a discount... I thought 'well at least that's not so bad' (but still unhappy about the whole situation... should have been replaced considering I had ZERO effect on it not working... I digress). When I try to trade it in, turns out pretty much everything EXCEPT the Echo Plus qualifies for trade in. That's not suspicious at all... Amazon graciously (read the sarcasm) gave me 15% off a new Echo gen 3 and felt deeply sorry for the situation. Very helpful. Lucky for Amazon I have my other parts of the house linked to the dots or I would have just switched to Google Home altogether.

I can't believe a company of this magnitude wouldn't offer a trade in on this OR accept a warranty claim that is barely over the limit. Like really guys? It appears you're aware of whatever issue my Echo Plus has and are intentionally avoiding spending any of your money to fix it... instead it's on the customer to replace the defective unit.

Mark Zaslove,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2019","I am on my THIRD Echo Plus (2nd Gen) having bought one just after they came out. Had to be sent a replacement. Had to be sent ANOTHER replacement...none of the problems were fixed (systemic to the device) and have just given up. What are the problems? Let me count the ways:

1. The ""Line In"" (the reason I got this; in order to be a speaker for my small bedroom TV). It kept glitching to Line Out for no reason, then for three weeks couldn't be turned back to Line In (making the item unusable as a TV speaker). Turned out it was a software problem, which was eventually fixed...but it still will randomly switch from Line In to Line Out for no reason.

2. With a cable from the TV to the Line In of the Echo Plus, the lag/sync is off. Always. It's infuriating, as there's no way to fix it. Reboots, shut downs, replacement device (which they swore, twice, would fix it), nothing fixes it. I can watch TV, but it's always irritating. Worse, if I use Bluetooth earbuds/headphones to listen, the lag is so far out, it's like watching a badly dubbed foreign film. I've just given up on this.

3. Completely random and total unworkable voice response, or lack thereof. One moment I say ""Alexa, do..."" and it works. A moment later if I try. Nothing. No light to say it's heard me. Nothing. It'll then work for no reason later, or not. It NEVER works first thing in the morning. It's infuriating and makes voice control completely useless as there's never a consistent answer to a voice command since it never responds. I've trained the voice, rebooted, had three of them...it's something specific to the Echo Plus. My Echo Dot is fine. If I sync to my bluetooth earbuds in the morning, that seems to ""wake"" it up...but only for an indeterminate time. It's infuriating.

4. With that in mind, I'm sure people ask: ""Why not just use the Alexa app on your iPhone or iPad to turn on lights/fans/etc.? Ha! To get the app up and connected it takes...wait for it: over a minute at times. Now, my Lumiman light bulbs that I want to turn off/on through Alexa? No hope through their software, but Lumiman's software is instantaneous. Always works. No wait.

J. Glenn,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2018","OK, so generally I like the Echo Plus. However, there are several things I don't care for so much:

First, the ""Line In"" feature doesn't work. I've contacted Amazon support and they've said a fix is on the way, but I don't have an ETA on that so for now I'm only giving this one star. This is because the primary reason I purchased this device over others was the fact that it offered a Line In feature, which my wife wanted to be able to use our old iPod to connect it to the speaker. This is a pretty big defect, especially when it is advertised as a distinguishing feature.

Second, getting Alexa to recognize requests for specific albums is difficult. The phrasing has to be precise, otherwise she'll respond that she can't find the requested album and proceed to suggest something ""similar"". This wouldn't be so bad except usually I don't want to listen to something ""similar"" and I'm not so sure the suggestions are always good. This problem isn't so much unique to Alexa as I have similar issues with my google home, but google seems to be more responsive. I just don't like having to talk over Alexa to get her to stop talking so I can move on. I also find Alexa to be a bit more cold than my google home assistant, perhaps a little more robotic.

I do like that the Echo Plus seems more responsive to my voice compared to the Google Home. Perhaps the mic is better in the Echo Plus than the Google Home.

Sound quality is OK and is comparable to the Google Home.

The ""smart"" light bulb that comes with the Echo Plus is only ""OK"". It was easy to set up, but I was disappointed that it couldn't do anything more than turn on/off and dim (I was kind of hoping for the ability to change colors). It also took me a bit of time to find a use for the bulb. Needless to say the use cases for a ""smart"" light bulb seem limited.",1.0 out of 5 stars

I order this item as part of the Prime Day deals which made it $50 off. In addition, I order quite a few accessories to connect with the device in hopes of getting my whole house all connected. When the box arrived, this item was missing even though it was listed under the tracking number. I immediately called Amazon and was told that they would have to open an investigation to ensure that I wasn't lying and it would be a few days. I explained that I had pictures of the box and items that did arrive and that the box that arrived wasn't even close to big enough to fit the missing item so there was no way it could have been packaged. She did not care and did not want the photos. I was beyond annoyed because I was excited to get all my new gadgets setup. I contacted customer service again after the weekend and kept getting the run around. They ask if I wanted a refund and I said no, I want a replacement so I can get the sale price. They ignored my wishes and issued a refund. I contacted them numerous times after to which they completely ignored me. Once I finally got to speak to someone again I was told this cannot be escalated further, they cannot reverse the refund and that the original price I purchased for cannot be honored. Basically, no solution...I am just out of luck. This is a mistake 100% on Amazon and they are willing to do absolutely nothing to fix it. I now have to spend more of my time boxing up and returning all the devices I purchased to accompany this one. This whole situation is BEYOND frustrating and unacceptable customer service practices.

It worked flawlessly, the sound and bass is awesome, and then it failed the day before I was flying home. He would ask it to play music by some artist, and it would say it was going to play that artist, and then silence. Nothing. I power-cycled it and it started working fine. Then, simply power-cycling it didn't work. Although the light ring indicated that it recognized the wake word, it wouldn't even tell me the time. Again, the refurb Dot worked. A few hours before leaving him to prepare for my flight, I unplugged it and plugged in the Dot; redundancy. After about an hour, I unplugged the Dot and plugged the new Echo in. Worked great! However, I was not confident that it would work for the 3 months I'm away, and didn't have the time to get on the phone with support for a replacement. Well, it failed again, and I really can't do anything about it other than buy him another. You see, I've been on the phone with support for another failed Echo, and I doubt that I could get a replacement authorization without being physically present, hence the low score for support. And after mid-January, I won't be able to have it replaced. Don't get me wrong, I love the Echo in general. I have an Echo, Echo Plus, Echo Connect and three Echo Dots. Statistically, I've had good luck with the Echo products, which is why I purchased a new one for my Dad. Maybe I'll call support and see if I can get a replacement now, 1500 miles away and unable to touch it. If I can get a replacement, I'll give it 5 stars, since when it works, the sound is incredible (well, in a nursing home room).",1.0 out of 5 stars
13th_Soul,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2019","This is just my review and my experiences so far. If no one else is having issues, I am happy for you. Maybe I am just unlucky with Alexa.

1st:
Home set up is as follows: 2 Echo Plus, 1 Echo Spot and 1 Fire TV Cube

2nd:
Okay, so I wrote one scathing review a few months back about how all of a sudden I was unable to play Spotify on my all my Alexa devices (minus the Cube). Had to completely uninstall and re-install the Alexa app on my phone. Why?

3rd: (most recent BS now)
I've seen a few people talk about this and maybe I'll get another phone call from Amazon like I did my last review of Alexa issues. So, here is the problem. I can no longer play Spotify on all of my devices at one time (minus the Fire Cube). What happens now is that any song I play via Spotify through Alexa on all devices, the song will cut out either at the middle or 3/4 of the song. The speakers just go quiet, but you can still see the song playing on Spotify. I can play on one speaker with no issues, but I got all these devices so I can have music playing throughout my place. This has been going on for about 3 months now and I am done. I thought the first time it happened that Amazon might be having problems, nope. This issue has continued. I've reset every device and restarted my modem and router and still garbage. Oh, but songs from Amazon will play through with no issue on all devices. So this tells me that some 'possible' BS is happening. I have google set up at my ex's house and do not have any of these problems and this is sad. I wanted Alexa to be solid, but I've just had setbacks with these devices. They are nice looking devices, but not worth the problems.

If you (Amazon) contact me for support, don't tell me that I need to uninstall apps and re-install to fix the problem, that's BS!! I've never had to uninstall Google to get something to work! My Internet is working just fine as well.",1.0 out of 5 stars
GoBlue,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2020","I bought an Amazon Alexa less than 2 years ago, and have suddenly started having volume issues with it. The device will randomly reset itself to the second lowest volume setting. I will increase the volume, and it will stay increased for a while, but then will inevitably reset itself to volume level 2. This happens at least daily, sometimes multiple times a day.

This started about 2 months ago. I tried factory resetting it, and when that didn't work I called Amazon expecting them to help me through this. They originally told me that this was a mass issue they were experiencing with my specific device, and that I would be added to their mass trouble ticket and given a call back to follow up. I never got a call back; three weeks later, I called to follow up.

The second time I talked with Amazon, they said there was no mass ticket/issue, and they had no idea what I was talking about. Then they told me that because it was out of warranty I was SOL. The best they can do is offer me a 15% discount to buy another echo device....that I'm now sure will just break down as soon as it's out of warranty.

This is the first time I've truly been disappointed in Amazon's customer service. There's no way I could be at fault for this issue; this is clearly a product issue (hardware or software, I'm not sure). But because of a policy shield, I'm screwed over. The rep even went so far as to say they couldn't be sure this type of issue wasn't my fault; how on earth could an issue like this be my fault?

I expect these devices to last longer than a year and a half........ I'm extremely frustrated that Amazon is not standing by their own products, but instead is putting the customer on the hook for what is clearly a product malfunction.

Buyer beware. This feels to me that Amazon knows its products will break down as soon as the warranty is up, screwing you over and banking (literally) on the assumption that you'll just continually buy new Alexa devices.",1.0 out of 5 stars
James,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2019","Bad value, finicky product, not user friendly, unreliable and just simply not worth the money. I bought 2 echo plus back in December, so I’ve waited 6 months to give it a fair shot before reviewing it, and I’m glad the 6 months are finally over so I can give my honest opinion.

The Alexa functionality is really overplayed. Im sure it’s helpful for somethings and if you have a fully equipped “smart home” maybe this isn’t the review for you. I wanted smart devices that were easy to use and that I could listen to music on, so I splurged for the newest echo and it’s counterpart the echo sub. The echoes themselves are “fine” at absolute best and an incredible annoyance at worst. Most of the time they are just a source of frustration. They often become unavailable for no apparent reason and disconnect from devices on their own often. I had a sub pair hooked up for my main room to listen to music and I would say I had a <50% success rate of getting it to play music when I wanted it to. Alexa has a hard time recognizing my voice (it seems one echo is much better at it than the other, despite being set up in the same manner) and it’s just not very intuitive which I thought was a big selling point for these products. Set up was a hassle, keeping them working was a hassle, sure the sound quality was fine, but not worth the wrestling match of getting it to finally play correctly. I debated between getting this set up (2 echo plus + sub) or starting with Sonos or the Apple HomePod, and at this point, I can confidently say the Amazon Alexa route was in fact the wrong decision. I am sure amazon won’t let me return them now, so I am going to work on selling them second hand or some sort of swap out. Very unhappy with this purchase, would not recommend to anyone. For context, I’m your average late 20s person who considers himself to have above average tech savvy and I had a difficult time with it. Look elsewhere for your music options.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Anthony,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2020","Ordered this to be the smart hub for a disabled person, including some zigbee plugs, zigbee in-wall switches. I purchased the echo plus as the zigbee controller due to great voice capabilities as well as last years firmware update that ensured local devices could be controlled if the internet was offline. Initial setup was a breeze, added all the devices without a hitch, renamed them all, created schedules for lights, etc. Also created automation and verbal routines for the devices. Everything worked great for 3 months.

Yesterday afternoon, I was notified that voice commands were not working, Alexa was responding with “device not found”. Investigation showed the devices were all mechanically operational and all devices were still registered in the Alexa app. I started by in plugging everything and turning off breakers for the in-wall switches. Nothing worked. Online Support suggested disabling all the devices in the app and then re-enabling them, that did not work. I called support and after about 20 minutes, they suggested I remove all devices, rediscover them and add them back. I let them know I had a large number of these devices and routines setup with all of them, so we tried one. The process worked. The problem when you do that is that you have to modify your groups and routines that previously used that device, because it’s gone now.

This was due to a cloud-pushed software update, to a smart home controller that is supposed to operate offline. I was always skeptical about using an Amazon product for such an important function, but was swayed by the attraction of voice control. Never again.

No matter how great it sounds or how great the voice pickup is, if it can lose paring to all devices with a remote update, it is not meant for prime time. I will be moving this setup to a non internet smart hub to ensure ADLs are accessible in the future.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Blake,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2018","I was quite excited that Amazon had caught up to Sonos and Google and finally allowed stereo pairing of speakers. It’s amazing how much better two properly spaced speakers can sound, even without a sub. Unfortunately, Amazon decided to release this product without full feature parity of it’s competitors.

As other reviews have mentioned, the stereo configuration ONLY works when streaming music from an online service. If you’re internet is out, or you want to take the speakers somewhere where no internet is available, you can only play from a single speaker at a time. That means local connection methods, like bluetooth and the 3.5mm aux in don’t play on a stereo pair (like they do with Google Home).

I am really hoping this is a software kink that is quickly being worked out, and if support is added I’ll update this review. For now, I’m quite disappointed that I purchased a stereo pair of speakers and sub when half the time I only hear sound out of ONE of the three devices.

Do yourself a favor and get a Google Home, Sonos, or if you don’t mind wires and want Alexa, get a Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 with an Echo Dot— much better stereo sound, lower price, and more functionality.",1.0 out of 5 stars
KSEPULVEDA,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","Before I write my review let me say that I install over 300 Amazon echos every year for my company in brand new homes. I even own 9 Amazon echos in my own home and vehicle.
Prior to using this Amazon Echo 3rd generation I had Amazon Echo 2nd generation speakers in my living room set up as a theater system group. They worked great! Each Echo had a different wake up work so I can speak to that particular Amazon Echo. One Amazon Echo was set up as left speaker and one was set up as right speaker.
I decided to upgrade my Amazon echos to the 3rd Generation Amazon Echo. After setting them up the same way I had my 2nd generation setup I can tell you that I am completely dissatisfied. although these speakers works great in a theater group when watching TV, use the wake up word Alexa to call my right Amazon Echo the light ring will respond but the echo with the Wake word Echo response verbally instead. If I remove the Amazon echos from the theater group The correct Echo will respond. I contacted technical support and they are completely clueless.

I then decided to test out my whole house group that I use quite often to play my music in every room. Most of the time my speakers don't respond at all and they don't play music. if they do respond , only 1 Amazon Echo plays the music even though these Amazon echos are in the same group that I asked to play. When I tried to tell them to stop , they acknowledge me speaking to them but do not stop playing the music. It became extremely frustrating to the point where I was yelling at my echo With no response. Amazon really needs to go back to the drawing board on this 3rd generation and fix their bugs.",1.0 out of 5 stars

DonnerAndBlitzen,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2019","I fell for the hype...Neither Alexa nor her apps work well for me. I tried to get some integration going with TP-Link switches so I can turn the lights on and off. Alexea indicates the lights are OFF when they are ON and vice versa. Easier to use the TP-Link app. Same for Honeywell thermostats. No benefit to using Alexa.

The interior temperature sensor, that apparently took an hour to ""calibrate,"" is consistently off by 4-5 degrees. Alexea doesn't understand the words ""calibrate"" or ""recalibrate."" So, that's busted.

Weather conditions are poor. No indication of dew point or even relative humidity. Cloud cover, etc. Just temperature.
No weather warnings or alerts? Just experienced a hurricane, but it was news to Alexa...

Volume is way off between various sources and there is no way to normalize. I am constantly either adjusting the volume manually or asking alexa to do so, and the increments she does it and the buttons are not the same.

Can't get alexa to realize I've read my notifications and her yellow light keeps blinking.

Equalizer is lame and doesn't seem to do much at all.

Supposed to have my Comcast TV schedule available -- if it's there, I can't find it.

The alexa app does not recognize or remember the volume settings and always reverts to minimum.

Speaking of the app --- who was the brainaic who decided that tiny blue letters in an illegible font against a black background was good? It's terrible, and there is no way to adjust the font color, size, or background. The app wastes nearly all of the iPad real estate with bits and pieces along the edges and a huge black hole of nothingness in the middle.

Handling ""privacy"" is a complicated matter...hard to find things and there are several different settings and places one has to look.

I waited for a while so that the bugs would be worked out -- but it's not worth the price for the few things it does --= and does so, so poorly.

I bought it for this reason, as advertised by amazon, and it doest work. The options I were given by the tech was essentially to wait and hope it gets fixed in the future, return it and lose out on the black friday deal if it is fixed in the future and wanted to buy it again at that time once it is, or wait and waste $109 dollars if it isnt fixed in the future once I pass the return window.

Harc,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2020","I received my Alexa Echo (3rd Gen) free as a door prize. I'm not keen on it spying on me but I was willing to give it a try if I could at least automate some home functions.

It couldn't even do the basics.

First of all you absolutely need a smart phone to use it. Alexa will not work out of the box without one. It will not pair with a desktop either.

I don't subscribe to a music service as I have a literal server dedicated to music I own. Alexa can't sync to my computer to play anything from my existing library. Alexa will, however play exactly 2 random songs an then 1 minute of advertising. The ads cannot be skipped. Skipped songs count toward the two song limit before an ad. Alexa also doesn't have bluetooth or AUX line in so I can't even use it as a very expensive speaker. Which is probably for the best since the Alexa has no EQ settings to speak of so it sounds way worse than the $20 bluetooth speaker I already have for portable music.

Well maybe I can use it to voice control my smart home thermostat. Nope. That Alexa skill won't install.

Next I try connecting my smart TV. Why I'd need Alexa involved with my TV I have no idea, but at this point I just want something to work...for science! That Alexa skill won't install.

They worked with the first one. They worked with the hue hub my roommate had of course. But after they moved out and I purchased this nothing. I was trying to get this thing to work for hours. When I was told to continuously turn on the light for 3-5 seconds until it flashed, without being given any time limit before I should stop turning it in and off, I was furious.

They wanted to send out another refurbished product with the only guarantee that it will work (nothing about cosmetically sound). It's too late to get my money back now, but I will change the wake word to something I never use and just use it as a bluetooth speaker. As far as the sound quality goes, it is acceptable as Radio Quality sound. There is a severe lack of bass without the subwoofer and a second Echo Plus.

When I ask it to set an alarm for fifteen minutes, sometimes it picks up on ""fif"" and sets a five minute timer, and sometimes it picks up on ""teen"" and sets a ten minute timer. Sometimes it gets it right and sets a fifteen minute timer. ""Set timer 45 minutes"" sometimes gets picked up as ""set a timer for five minutes"".

They have finally fixed alarms so I can say ""eleven hundred"" and it no longer asks whether I mean AM or PM.

I have some zigbee door open/close/temperature sensors. Amazon notifies my that the door was opened, or that guard mode is enabled, only five minutes after I've left the house. This would make a rather poor security system if I were using it for such a purpose.

Joe Rak,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2020","I bought the echo Gen 3 to use as an PC speaker, and as an echo (like an office assistant). There is deal-breaking flaw/bug that prohibits using this way:

Unfortunately, the ""line in"" (from the computer) seems to ""go to sleep"" after about 5 seconds of silence from the computer. The speaker will ""wake up"" and start playing the line in only after about 1-2 seconds of audio from the computer. This might be fine for listening to music, but is a deal-breaker for a PC speaker. If there is a pause in conference calls, the speaker goes to sleep, and you miss the first 5 seconds when someone resumes talking. You'll miss alerts and alarms, etc. Also the echo won't ""wake up"", if it is only one second of audio.

If you leave the audio-in silent for 10-15 minutes, the ""wake up"" time is longer (about 10 seconds of computer sound to wake it up)

To troubleshoot, I've installed the latest echo software on the device and have restarted. I've searched the forums, and this seems to be a known issue. It is important for you to know this if you plan to use the Echo 3 in this way.

In retrospect, one thing I didn't try, which was an oversight on my part, was a trick I used for the new Kindle Oasis, which has an apparent difficulty with Wi-Fi security.

One can create a separate network, with no security. Using a white list approach and the router's control panel, set the network to ONLY accept device specific MAC addresses. Enter the specific MAC address of the device you want to use. Pretty simple and it worked for my Oasis which could not reliably connect otherwise.

I purchased the plus model for the “premium sound” and the array microphones because I wanted the best sound and recognition. Unfortunately, this falls short by a long run. Alexa barely can hear any request, always telling me she doesn’t recognize lights because she can’t hear hue, or she just beeps and doesn’t do or say anything. Also, asking her to play music is a very difficult task. She will just play a random song that is nowhere near what you said. Running in to the sound quality, it sounds like a single cheap built in TV speaker. It can barely make a presence in a 12 x 14 bedroom. My 3 year old JBL flip is 3x louder which is smaller and runs on battery and sounds way better in highs mids and low frequency. The JBL doesn’t even have a dedicated tweeter like the echo does.

So, the troubleshooting begins.

I put one of my Echos next to the Echo Plus to troubleshoot. I muted the Echo and asked to play a song on Apple Music. The Echo Plus replies with, “Playing song on Apple Music.” After a few seconds, it says “Sorry, I’m having trouble playing the music.”

Then I mute the Echo Plus, unmute the Echo, and ask to play the same song on Apple Music. It plays with no issue. I have the Echo Plus and Echo on the same wireless network, and they are both sitting right next to the router. The Echo Plus works with all other commands, except being able to play Apple Music. I thought this was supposed to be the “smart hub.”",1.0 out of 5 stars

J B,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2020","Let me preface this review so you don't think I am hating on the echo family. I have 5 echos, one in each room including the garage, I love them. I got this for the better sound to replace an echo 2 which I moved to a different room.

With that said, this echo 3 is awful.

1.It seems like the microphones don't work well, often we have to say ""alexa"" multiple times, or when we speak another echo in a different room of the house will answer. We never had this problem with the echo 2 in that same location.

2.This echo constantly freezes, I have had to unplug it quite a few times because it got ""stuck"" trying to listen or process a command, never had this issue with our other echos

On the plus side when it works, the speakers are significantly better than the echo2. But the headache of interacting with it far outweighs its benefits. I bought it waiting for Christmas to open so I am outside of the return window, but hopefully amazon will remedy, I will update this review to reflect if it does.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Terry Ferguson,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2019","I just recently bought this device, I've had another one for a few years but I thought something was wrong with it, as looped sounds kept cutting off. Well I am having the same issue with this one. I use it for playing sleep sounds and now it cuts off every few minutes or cuts off all together, the exact same thing that had begun happening with my old device. I did some research and have since found out lots of people have been reporting this problem. It's bad enough Amazon farms their skills out to third party developers who are now trying to get people to pay for them, so you get long annoying ads as well as constant prompts for a 5 star review on your device..... (I've also seen where even if you get a subscription half the time it doesn't work and Amazon does nothing about it) but the looping problem is directly related to Amazon's product as it happens on the old and new devices and also happens when trying to loop music...think next time I will give Google assistant a try, maybe they make their own skills for their own device.",1.0 out of 5 stars
NA,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2020","So upset. When I first bought the echo w/ subwoofer and echo dot they were working fine. Had a glitch every now and then but nothing too annoying. But whenever I try to listen to Spotify “everywhere”, there’s no sound. Alexa will say “now playing Spotify everywhere” but she won’t. It’ll even show Spotify is playing “everywhere” on my Spotify app but still no sound. When I switch over to echo or echo dot, Spotify plays just fine. Then I switch back over to “everywhere” and still no sound. I spend 10-15 mins just messing with it so I can listen to music and it’s incredibly frustrating. The difficulty Alexa has on picking up my voice has always been a huge con for me too (from the beginning), but I just assumed that was the way it was for Alexa/google/etc. Then I received a google dot and wow, my google dot has almost no trouble picking up my voice and I don’t even have to raise my voice. This really sucks because the main reason I bought the speakers was for music.

Fritz J. Liess,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2020","This product has a flaw that makes it impractical to be used as a Bluetooth speaker for your phone or PC. Once you get it set up, you will discover that Alexa screams ""Connected to [device name]"" at top volume along with a tone. There is no way to prevent this. There is no setting that will disable it. This is an issue that Amazon has known for many months and they have no interest in correcting it.

Amazon recommends disconnecting the Bluetooth connection in order to resolve this. That takes several minutes and it something that isn't needed with other Bluetooth speakers.

This makes Echo little more than a toy. You can't use it paired with an Echo Dot to provide stereo sound for your phone, computer, and TV. It will wake up the entire household with these annoying connection announcements if you try. There are dozens of complaints about this in the online forums and Amazon has never addressed the issue other than to say ""Sorry. This feature can't be disabled."" It seems this product was designed to fail.",1.0 out of 5 stars

If, for whatever reason, your device(s) disconnect from your WiFi, I invite you to join me on the phone with Amazon Support for countless hours. I think I may have spent more time on the phone trying to connect these devices, than actually using them. They claim it uses a special connection because it's a streaming device, however I have three other streaming devices that have never had an issue, so the WiFi is working fine.

I spent so long on the phone with a customer service rep that we mutually agreed he would send replacement items. Fast forward 6 months later (past my refund window, conveniently) and I am having the same issues over again. The most disappointing part is, you cannot even connect with a basic BlueTooth functionality without having an internet connection first and foremost. I have a shower speaker with that functionality.

Savannah,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2019","I bought this over another dot specifically for the better audio, but it's terrible! Not only does the speaker sound way too bass heavy, but it drops audio multiple times a day on my Everywhere network.

I don't believe that it's an internet connectivity issue as I have excellent wi-fi with only a few devices connected, the plus is only 8 feet away from the modem, and none of my dots in other rooms have any issues. I have tried resetting it, moving it within feet of the modem, different streaming sources, etc It keeps dropping audio no matter what. Meanwhile, if you ask it what's playing (and it understands you for a change), it will tell you what's playing, but no music comes out.

Also, of all my echo devices, the echo plus has the worst comprehension by far! Per other reviewers, I've moved it down to a coffee table and made sure that it wasn't trained to my voice, but it still fails to understand virtually every instruction!

As I mentioned earlier, i often have to reset the speakers which takes anywhere from 3-5 minutes of my time.

There is a 10 second delay when changing the song and about a 2 second delay when adjusting the volume. This is not something I would expect coming from Amazon. I'd expect this from a speaker purchased for 30 bucks in DTLA.

To put it simply, we had a repeating playlist of songs that would automatically play all day long if we asked Alexa to “play chill music” and now, she plays random songs (that are sometimes chill, not always) and does not play all day long like our old device.

CJG,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2020","This speaker is probably the most muffled and worst sounding speaker I've ever purchased. I've done all of the suggested tricks, updated Alexa app, total reset of the Echo, made sure the Echo is running latest firmware, reset my router, used the equalizer in almost every possible setting. Alexa's voice sounds like it's under a pillow and music has almost no highs or midrange, sounds very muddy.
I have a small Google Home mini, not the new one, but the first version. That tiny thing sounds *much* clearer on voice and music.
I'm so disappointed, I had really been looking forward to good sound with the Echo 3rd generation.

There was no cosmetic imperfection but the Echo was dead on arrival. I tried different outlets as well as my other Echo gen 2 power cord.

A. Rosa,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2019",I think it's kind of important information that this is NOT a standalone item that pairs directly to your WiFi. It requires you to load an Amazon Alexa app on your PC and your PC to operate in WIFI. Well my PC operates on either but not both simultaneously. Because I watch video and game WiFi is a poor cousin to a wired connection. I returned it. I did not want the app installed on my PC and did not want to be running an inferior WIFI connection. I felt that this is the FIRST piece of information they should give. Some people might not care that they are forced to halve Alexa on their phone. I don't want it.

What you expect from them. The subwoofer really does make a difference to your music.

Now here is my real issue. It only allows you to play stereo music through amazon music app or if you tell alexa. Which is unnaceptable because their apo is garbage and laggy. Sometimes it plays stereo and sometimes it only plays it through one echo and no subwoofer.

1. If paired into Stereo you can not stream to it via your mobile phone bluetooth
2. If Paired and using the One In you can only play one the device you are physically plugged into, again losing Stereo Pairing and losing your Echo Sub if you have one, which we do.

G. Garrick,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2019","The promise of Alexa/Echo is awesome. Connect and automate virtually everything in your house as well as various communications alternatives and other services and functions, and be able to control it all through voice (by talking to it). The main problem, however, is that it's unreliable. For this reason I give it 2 stars. The promise of Alexa is like a dial tone (remember that?) or your Internet service. It becomes an essential part of your daily life, and you expect it to WORK 99+% of the time. If it doesn't, it seriously damages the fundamental value proposition and causes frustration, inconvenience, or worse.

There are MANY companies who make ""Alexa compatible"" devices such as Wemo, Phillips Hue, etc. including Amazon itself, and as I'm sure you've noticed, many items sold on Amazon say ""Alexa compatible"". The problem is that on a pretty much random basis, items will lose their connection to Alexa and won't work through Alexa although the item itself still operates, and/or can be controlled by it's own app (such as a Wemo or Hue device). From everything I can tell, it has nothing to do with the Wifi connection since I've tested for strong signal strength and hi bandwidth, and there is no discernible pattern. A device will simply stop operating, and you get an error message in the app that the device is ""unresponsive"", or some other message. Also, sometimes the Echo will just not recognize what you are asking. I have an Echo plus, and two Dots. For some of my switches and lights, one Echo will recognize what I am saying, but another may not. Yet they are all connected to the same account and this happens relatively randomly for a given device, again there is no pattern.

So, it's just REALLY frustrating that on a fairly random basis, Alexa will just not work for a particular device at a particular time. I have to re-set, re-discover, re-connect, or re-install that third party device. BTW, this ALSO happens with Amazon-made devices, such as the smart outlets.

Also, there are different degrees of ""compatible with Alexa"". Some third party devices work completely fine through Alexa, but others have only partial functionality compared to using their own app. This is a problem since the promise of Alexa is a single point of control, but if you don't get to fully use the features of the particular device, you may have to occasionally resort back to using the third party app for certain features and functions. Check the ratings of your third party app integration. For instance, Ring makes very popular devices such as video doorbells yet it gets only 2 of 5 stars when connected to Alexa.

Also, I don't see why video devices such as security cameras can't be viewed through the Alexa app. You can (sometimes) control the device through Alexa, but if you are using the Alexa app, or if you don't have one of the Echo video displays, you can't actually use the cameras through the Alexa app. This is a big limitation since why should you have to purchase yet another video screen to use with an Echo, and sometimes if you're not at home and have to use the Alexa mobile app, you ought to be able to see security camera video through the Alexa app instead of having to switch to the third party app. After all, isn't this part of the promise of ""controlling everything"" with Alexa?

These issues are particularly problematic when you are out of town and trying to control things at your home, so when an item doesn't work, you may not be able to correct it (such as if it requires a hard reset). And if you want to check your security cameras, you can't get the video feed through the Alexa app. If you have any significant degree of home automation, you cannot (as far as I can tell) do it all through Alexa, you have to use multiple apps.

Also, an Echo will occasionally do strange things for no reason. Yesterday, my Echo Plus started making two beeps every five minutes. All day long. My two Echo Dots did not beep, just the Echo Plus. There were no alarms or reminders set, and the Wifi in the house was fine (actually my access point is in the same room as the Echo Plus, only a few feet away, so signal strength and bandwidth are strong). When I woke up this morning, the beeping had stopped. I have no idea why. Tech support said if it wasn't an alarm or a Wifi disconnect, they had no idea why and offered to remotely reset the devices, which arguably should never be the solution for such a highly-touted system.

The Alexa app is surprisingly primitive and cumbersome despite the elegance of the overall Alexa system and Echo devices. It takes too many taps to do simple things, the navigation is cumbersome, it doesn't remember your place on a screen, it is often slow to connect with the native app of the device you are trying to control, it's unattractive, and in general it's probably the weakest link in the whole system.

Finally, as far as Amazon tech support, the ""pros"" are that if you dial the number, you get a live person within a minute or so, and the person you get is eager to be helpful and sounds as if they enjoy their work and want to do a good job. The ""cons"" are that unless you are lucky, you often get a person who barely speaks English fluently and you have to talk slowly and repeat yourself. Also, they rarely know the answer you are calling for off the top of their heads, and have to put you on hold while they research it. Fortunately, they are better and faster at researching the knowledge base than we are, so I often find it still better/faster to call than to try and find the answer myself although I will first do a quick Google search to see if the answer quickly pops up.

Anyway, as they say, buyer beware. Overall, I like using Alexa, but you need to understand it's quirks and limitations. Some day, voice-controlled life as promised with Alexa (or competitive systems) will be here, but today is not that day.",2.0 out of 5 stars

AmazonShopper1290,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2022","Where to even begin? I’ll start with the most annoying.

Alexa very frequently “forgets” the smart plugs I’ve set up. That includes brands that are very highly rated, and they are plugs that are supposed to be supported by the Alexa app. They’ll work with Alexa for a week or so, but then Alexa loses track of them and tells me they’re not connected. I’m forced to try to reconnect them to Alexa but to no avail. She simply doesn’t “see” them. I’m forced to control those plugs with their individual apps such as Kasa or Wemo, which proves they’re on the network and functioning, EXCEPT for Alexa not wanting to connect to them.

And you know what’s “funny”? The only plugs that Alexa doesn’t “forget” or refuse to reconnect to are the Amazon brand ones which cost more than all the others. An Echo dot costs $15 but an Amazon smart plug is $25? Hmmm.

This is the biggest reason for my dissatisfaction.

Smaller issues: I talk to one Echo right next to me, and the one in the next room is the one that responds. WHY??

I tell the living room Echo to turn on living room light. “Living room light is not responding.” I tell the same Echo again to turn on the living room light, and it works. Or I tell the kitchen Echo to turn on living room light, and this time it works.

There is no way to turn off unwanted suggestions or sales pitches. Supposedly you’re supposed to be able to do that in the app, but I haven’t been able to find it.

I tell Echo Show to show a slideshow of my photos. When I first bought it over a year ago, it would play the slideshow until I told it to do something else. Now I tell it to play a slideshow and all it does is shuffle in a few of my photos in between its other junk like recipes, news, etc. I only wanted the Echo show for displaying photos, and it no longer does that.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Vinicius Nagamatsu,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2020","Although I was excited to start my smart home journey (and even bought 2 Echo's and 2 Dots), I'm very disappointed with my purchase, especially considering some of 'Amazon's' behaviors.

PROs
-Integration with Alexa and it's various skills: undoubtedly, Alexa has plenty of skills which make it a very handy device to help you on your day. From checking the traffic, weather, news to automating your home (IFTT, etc).
-Sound quality: It has a great sound quality - I'm not an expert it affectionate person regarding sound, but I imagine that for 99% of people it should be good enough.
-Natural Response: Alexa has a more natural way of talking to you and responding your questions than Google.

CONs
-Disrespect for privacy: I keep receiving emails recommending products I discussed at home (but that I didn't search for or even browsed). Even when I press the mute button I have the impression it is still listening for opportunities to recommend me stuff. Very untrustworthy with my privacy and data, a la Facebook.
-Intentionally Poor Spotify Service: Given it's the most popular music streaming service in the world, one would expect it would have a great integration with Amazon's devices. Reality is that it's very unstable and researching online there are reported problems for years now. One is left to wonder how a company with billions of profit per year can't fix these issues (or why: trying to force users to buy it's Amazon Music service)
-Random Wifi Disconnects: All my four Amazon devices randomly disconnect from wifi, at different times, requiring me to 'factory reset' them and perform setup over and over again. This happens independently of the router they are connected (I've two of different brands) and given they disconnect individually I can assume it's a problem with the devices.
-Microphone issues: I've placed the two Echo's in my living room, one at each end of the room ( they are 16 feet apart). The process is that the nearest device to you should listen and respond to you. Despite this, even though I'm often 2 feet away from one of the Echo's, the other one is the one who listens and responds to me - indicating there is a microphone issue with one of the Echo's. I can only hope I drew the short stick and this is not a common problem for customers.

Final recommendation: It's a great product with significant potential, but serious privacy issues and an unreliable performance (skills and hardware) lead me NOT to recommend this product. Even though I'm 'bought into' the Amazon ecosystem now, I'm seriously considering giving it a try to other similar products in the market.

Sharon Benzil,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2020","I purchased an Echo Studio and an Echo 3rd gen to pair with my Fire Cube. My goal was to place the Studio in the living room (with the television and Fire Cube) and to place the Echo 3rd gen in the kitchen so that when we were cooking, we could listen to the audio of the program playing through the Fire Cube.

When the products arrived, we went about trying to set them up (a process that was much more difficult than we expected and believe me, we have connected, paired, matched and played many different devices multiple times in multiple countries and this one proved to be more difficult than any we've experienced before - just not intuitive or easy at all). As it turned out, the difficulty was due to the fact that these devices are INCOMPATIBLE and cannot be paired together as a home theater. Even though they are in separate rooms

The Echo Studio can only be paired with another Echo Studio as part of a home theater set up together with a Fire Cube; similarly, the Echo 3rd gen can only be paired with another Echo 3rd gen as part of a home theater set up.

Seriously?

Apparently, you can pair the speakers for multi-room music but not for multi-room audio through the Fire Cube. But you cannot pair them as part of a home theater system if the devices are not the same kind.

Because I live outside the US and receive Amazon orders through a mail forwarding service in the US, returning an item to Amazon is cumbersome and exacerbated by shipping issues during COVID-19 quarantine rules - this is not Amazon's problem and for people in the US who can simply ship back an Echo device, perhaps this is no big deal but to have a ""system"" that doesn't function as a ""system"" is very frustrating and means that we have to find a way to make these speakers become something more than expensive paperweights.

It was our hope to replace a Bose sound link that was connected to our Fire Cube with a better, richer and fuller sounding system in multiple rooms (and so we bought 2 Echo speakers). The Echo Studio's sound is better than the sound link but I am fairly certain that we could not have opted to spend for the Studio had we known it was a 1:1 swap with our Bose speaker.",2.0 out of 5 stars
djsynthetic,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2020","I’m pretty tech savvy. 2-3 years ago I went all in on alexa and smart home setup. I had many devices from smart color bulbs, switches, plugs, and more running in my smart home system.

After 2 years or using alexa Echo I’ve had enough of it’s failures to do simple but necessary daily tasks consistently.

-You’ll spend hours setting up your smart home devices, groupings, and routines to have them run smoothly for a few days and then randomly one day smart devices disappear or stop responding through alexa, despite them working through other smart control apps.

-Echo is constantly bombarded with unwanted advertisements at unwanted times that I never asked for and no option given to disable them.

-Echo rarely ever understands my voice commands correctly

-It listens and responds to me at times when I’ve asked it not to.

- This one drove me absolutely crazy: The bluetooth device announcement with no option to shut it off: “Now connected to [bluetooth device’s name]”

Every time I connected a bluetooth device such as my phone or laptop, Echo would announce the full name of the device connected. Even if I was already connected to echo playing music then paused for a few minutes, it would announce the bluetooth device again, as soon as I pressed play. Echo will make the announcement at whatever the last volume played setting was. If I left the house earlier in the day playing music loud and forgot to turn the volume back down before I arrived later at night, when I first go to connect my phone to echo to play music at a low volume, the announcement will blast at full volume my whole house “now connected to…blah blah blah”

The only good thing about this speaker was the sound quality. It was decent sounding for a small living room and had nice little bass to
It. But other than that this might as well be a paperweight, it’s a useless excuse for a smart home central control.

I’ve now eliminated voice control and passive listening from entire home altogether, by switching my smart devices over the Ikea’s brand of smart home control system. I am much more satisfied with the Ikea system. The Ikea devices run on zigbee so have less interference than wifi signals. For the devices like my light switch and other non ikea brand devices, I still use a central hub, the samsung smart things hub to control those.

So glad to finally rid my home of Alexa!",2.0 out of 5 stars
JR,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2020","I purchased this because I listen to music in the house, particularly the kitchen a lot. I have an echo dot 3rd gen and the sound quality was just not doing it for me.

Is the sound quality better than the echo dot? Yes, the echo dot is mildly better than listening to music on your phone's speaker.
Is the sound quality good? Not really.

The bass is big . . . BIG. It tends to overpower the rest of the music. If you're looking for cymbals to have a crisp satisfying sizzle, the 3rd gen Echo is just not going to do it. As more layers and instruments build in a song, the sound gets muddy and the bass takes over. For direct comparison I used a $50 bluetooth speaker that has been my go-to for affordable and portable music around the house. Now this does not have audiophile quality sound, but it is passable and is able to give music some separation in order for it to be enjoyable. It blows the Echo out of the water. I've tried several locations in my kitchen in case acoustics were throwing things off, but to no avail.

Does the Echo have bad sound? No I wouldn't go that far. Frankly, I just expected more out of a $100 speaker. If music is your thing, you're better off going for a purpose-built speaker or an Alexa enabled speaker that puts sound quality first. It is still evident that the primary function of the Echo is to be an Alexa hub and not a speaker.

For reference, I used songs I know well with lots of layers. Foo Fighters are a go-to and Madness by Muse for building and adding layers. Unfortunately the 3rd gen Echo dulled these songs and just made them feel numb. If you're looking to get the best out of the Echo, you'll have to play with the audio settings. For me, I have the treble at +3 and the mid range at +2. The bass is plenty as-is.

Bottom line/TLDR: If you want an Alexa hub first and foremost, get an Echo Dot - better value. If you want a speaker first with the added bonus of Alexa, spend the extra money and get one purpose-built to play music. The Echo suffers from middle child syndrome and does all things OK, but there are better options out there depending on what your priorities are.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Nikki Robson,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2020","This is our 3rd Echo. We had a 1st Gen Echo for about a year, and a 2nd gen Echo for about eight months before both stopped working due to a software issue that Amazon swears they cannot recreate despite hundreds of owners having the same issue. We got rid of both and earlier this year after purchasing a home, we bought the 3rd Gen Echo hoping it would be worth it this time. It isn't.

The sound quality is alright, but definitely not anything to write home about. If you are thinking about an Echo primarily to use for music, get a bluetooth speaker for your smartphone or something.

The voice recognition is barely functional even in our 2 adult household where it doesn't have a lot of voices to learn or background noise to sift through. It regularly misinterprets commands when I'm standing a yard away speaking clearly and instead of asking for a repeat, it just guesses and executes whatever command. It's not that it doesn't function, but it doesn't *work.* I spend more time repeating myself to it and then giving up than I do using any features it has. Integrating it into any other smart device has been a total disaster, and we've tried multiple brands and even called the local IT guy to give us a hand. Yes, we called a professional. Yes, the Echo is on a shelf at mid-height 2 feet away from walls or other devices that might impede its ability to clearly receive and play audio.

Finally, I gave up and decided to do smart phone controlled integrations.

Straight up, there is nothing this thing can do that your smartphone from Gen 2017 or newer can't do better, faster, and probably with less tedious repeats (and less privacy invasion). If you already own a smartphone, you have a better product.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Stephen,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2020","I had the echo dot and decided to add the speaker to my collection. Big mistake. The sound is richer but the bass saturates the field leaving some words or lyrics unintelligible. But the biggest difference is that I have prime so my echo dot will play just about every song I can name instantly. However the Alexa speaker for 99 bucks will tell you that if you want to play the same song you just heard on the echo dot, you will have to pay an extra 7 bucks per month. Because obviously you don't own this thing, they want to rent the thing you just bought to you. Not really, but that is what it feels like. Furthermore it happens on too many songs. It even played a song for me one day and I guess decided I liked that song too much so it tried to upsell me on that monthly 7 buck membership again the next time I asked it to play the song. Don't buy this this contraption. Better would be to buy the dot and then a 3mm cable for etwern 5 and 19 bucks depending upon the length of the cable, then plug it into your own stereo speakers. The sound will be much better and you won't get this annoying sales pitch every time it sees you like a song too much. Horrible ethics, horrible machine. The dot is better for that reason. Google home mini is not as good with music on demand but it is way better with both sound quality and information from the net. Additionally Google is seemingly more intelligent. Echo forgets what it just told you for example if you ask it to repeat what it just said. Google just says ""sure"". And then it repeats it. Just make sure the thing you tell it last, can be repeated. It keeps a record of your requests on your phone. You can erase this optionally. The dot is excellent with music you select.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Evan,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2019","Ok device ruined by horrible Wi-Fi connectivity or non-existent cache memory. It’s the only Wi-Fi device I have that can’t stream Spotify reliably. It’ll often cut out mid track and then skip to the next one. Even when it’s working perfectly, it has a 2 second delay when skipping tracks unlike other Spotify Connect devices which are almost instant. I’ve given up on fast forwarding into a track. It’ll often cause it to skip to the next track, but if I look at either the Alexa or Spotify app on my phone, it thinks it’s playing the right track still.

It’s not just Spotify though. Audible can’t play back reliably either. Sometimes it’ll just stop playing. Worse, it’ll have forgotten where it left off even when it seems to be working well. It’ll throw off your progress on a book on all your devices thanks to WhisperSync.

MultiRoom audio is easy to set up, but again it doesn’t work reliably. More often than not, one speaker will be playing and the other will be silent until halfway into a track and then it’ll suddenly start, but when the next track comes up it’ll quit playing again.

When I tell Alexa to turn on Hue lights, they’ll sometimes quickly scan through all of the scenes before randomly deciding to keep one. It'd work great for a mini 2 second disco party.

Here’s my biggest gripe. Spotify playback can only shuffle 100 tracks away from the point where you start shuffling. So if you go through the trouble of setting up a Routine so you can wake up to music, you’ll find out that even if you tell it to shuffle the playlist, it’ll only play the first 100 tracks in the playlist ever and it will always start on the first one. If you select a track in the middle of a large playlist with an app from Spotify Connect, it’ll play that and the shuffle will only extend 50 tracks away before and after. This is what makes me think most of the troubles are memory limitations, and not software bugs or something wrong with my Wi-Fi.

What you can do with Routines is pretty limited. You can’t automate any third party functionality. Just the handful of built in ones designed to work with Routines.",2.0 out of 5 stars
TMG,"Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2019","Setup:
Two Echo Pluses (2nd gen) placed 2.5m apart on a dresser (in the same room) with an Echo Subwoofer on the floor to the left of the dresser.

The two echo's often get confused and stop would as a single unit would. If you say ""Alexa, do this"", sometimes the first Alexa replies and sometimes the second does. The problem is that they do not necessarily realize that one has already replied. If Echo one asks a question, sometimes Echo two hears the reply instead of Echo one causing Echo one to get stuck in a loop.

Sometimes the two echos break stereo sync and require HW power cycle to get it together. One of the echo may lose the ability to ""Understand"" when in this state (this is NOT a wireless signal issue).

If you set a timer on these Echos, Echo one may set the timer and Echo two may then answer all other queries. Echo two is not aware of timer on Echo one. As such, Echo two cannot list, stop, or reset timers on Echo one even though they are ""one unit"". A master/slave situation should exist when Echos are setup in stereo pairs (they are ONE unit). Turning mute on one of the Echos helps, but the mute light is distracting and annoying.

In short, the sound quality gained by the stereo pair does not warrant the extreme annoyance of the buggy interaction when two Echos are placed 2.5m apart in the same room.

Amazon seriously needs to work on better detection code to determine which Echo I am talking to in a multi-Echo home setup. Their implementation is horrid in close proximity (as above) and bad in simple multi-room use cases.",2.0 out of 5 stars
G9195,"Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2019","Apparently this is a semi-common issue, but this device drops from the WiFi network. It may go a day, it may go 2 weeks, but eventually, it drops off of WiFi and the reconnection process is awful. It errors out over and over with no troubleshooting or error codes. I've tried 2.4GHz and 5GHz, automatic setup and manual setup, setup via phone app and setup via web browser. I had a Dot with no issues before. The router is literally 6 feet away from the unit. This is a major inconvenience for any smart-enabled appliance or device connected, especially some that are accessed through the hub, such as lights. It makes morning routines, alarm management, and other used functionality absolutely useless as it'll be days before I can reconnect. I'll periodically try again and again and eventually it work for no reason. I am living in an apartment complex with lots of other wifi enabled devices but that should't be an issue. Sometimes rebooting the router works but rebooting every week or two is an inconvenience that is unacceptable.

That being said, as for the actual product, I'd give a 5/5 if not for the technical issues. I will complain that the unit doesn't seem to hear me as well as advertised. Living in an apartment, I can't be screaming across the place for the Echo to hear me. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't, especially when it seems like it should (clear line of voice travel, reasonable volume), or it will hear the ""Alexa"" prompt but not the command. The sound quality is pretty good. Definitely not premium but way better than the Dot and good enough fidelity to play music. Clear voice and sounds makes a pleasant experience.

In my office I have a 2nd gen Echo, and in my bedroom is an Echo Dot. This device is in my living room, and I can be standing 3 feet from it and my office Echo will answer me. If I really want to make sure the timer sets on this device, I place my hands around the top and press my face to it like I'm whispering in its ear. I'd say more than half the time I am close to it and speaking in its direction, another Echo answers.

They tried too hard to improve the bass on this model and ultimately made something muddy. I had to turn the bass down a notch. The 2nd gen Echo in my office sounds much crisper and still has sufficient low end without adjusting the EQ.

Finally, the all-room-music feature is broken across the board on the Echo. I can play Spotify to any one Echo with no issues. If I play to the speaker group I've configured in the Alexa app, with luck I can get through an album.

That not quite costs you. It can over power a small room like mine even at low volumes, and by the time you get the volume low enough you've lost a good deal of fidelity, and on the high end it distorts. High fidelity I think not, though its reasonably good quality for the price. I turn it on once in awhile, but I can't get the performance I want, maybe in a room that was more then twice as large, don't have one so I can't tell you. On a wired system, I would just put on a dac and amp to control it better, I have a four tower system that works awesomely and I can control it very well even on the low end without any distortion.

Well, the problem is poor WiFi performance. I give it 5 stars for voice, integration and sound. However, the WiFir performance - an absolutely critical element - is poor at best. One star for that.
I have reset the device several times, moved it around the room, and done everything I can but it just has poor WiFi.

- app is not as controllable as I would like

- speaker sound quality
- asking questions gives irrelevant responses

sielee,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2019","We bought this ""Echo Plus"" specifically because it pairs with the Echo Subwoofer - if you use a regular ECHO, you know the sound is ok, but lacks deep bass. The subwoofer is great and delivers on sound - but the ECHO Plus is lacking - it is much less receptive to commands (doesn't ""hear"" or doesn't interpret them correctly), and frequently just cuts out mid-broadcast. There's a significant delay between command and response, which suggests the pairing with the subwoofer component slows the whole system. (Maybe it's a two step process - the ECHO responds, then feeds the subwoofer, then you get the audio response.) At any rate, good sound but frustrating to use. First generation ECHO's, even the refurbished ones, are far more responsive. For a sophisticated full range sound system, there may be better smart speaker systems out there. Amazon has just offered the ""Amazon Studio"", which is an all-in-one device - but expensive. As we're too far out to return our ECHO Plus, we'll have to relegate it to the garage.

This is NOT a Bose designed and produced sound dispenser.

And, young designers probably need to change things for the sake of change (it's our turn) and either keep up with or start new trends. I'm sure internally this third generation is far improved over other versions. But Alexa is still Alexa—at your command and ever the ready—never bitchy or obstinate. So, if you are buying this with the thought of supreme operating abilities and probably even better-listening capabilities, go-ahead, you won't be disappointed.

Well, for some unknown reason, Echo only chooses to connect to Bluetooth when it feels like it, apparently. I may have missed something in the ridiculously overcomplicated setup, but I have been through it repeatedly since I bought this speaker new pairing (3rd gen) roughly a year ago, and it works fine with Amazon, some of the time with Spotify, very splotchy and buggy with normal Bluetooth internet connections, and NOT AT ALL with streaming. A Bluetooth speaker that works part of the time, and a sub that works even less of the time. Man, that's some confounding virtual AI assistance, Amazon. Bezos' billions have definitely been used to technological pioneers unimagined before for this bizarre and unpredictable product.

John B. Richardson,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2020","I finally gave in and purchased an echo to address a particular problem I have- I have two cell phones and I don't like carrying them around the house with me. As I've gotten older my hearing has gotten worse and I have problems missing work calls when I'm watching TV or gaming because I can't hear the phone ring.

I thought Alexa would have the same basic kind of hands free/integrated audio that my car stereo has- especially since there's an Android app available. I figured it would be able to amplify ringtones, pick up smartphone calls, and so on. You know, like your dumbest car stereos do.

Not so. As it turns out, Alexa is not as capable as my car stereo. It can dial out fine, receive ALEXA calls fine, but it doesn't integrate with my smartphone like I want it to.

Amazon, is it too much to ask that when a call comes in on my work phone, Alexa announces it? Is it too much to ask that if I get a voicemail on my phone, Alexa announces it? If I get a missed call, should not Alexa my digital assistant let me know? Even just the light ring flashing would be good.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2020",I purchased two of these to pair in my bedroom for stereo audio. The integration with my Spotify account is terrible. I have spent hours upon hours trying to get this to work seamlessly. It will work and then it will break and I will spend more time trying to get it to work. The solution is always just restarting everything. I'm usually exhausted by the time I get everything solved and I fall asleep frustrated when I could have fallen asleep to the sweet tunes of Van Morrison. It is also frustrating that when my wife or kids send me a message the lights on these speakers go on. To get the light off You have to play the message. To play the message you have to log into the Alexa app on your phone because getting it to play through the speaker is almost impossible. The Alexa app on the phone is clunky and sucks. I do not want these speakers to do anything with messages all I want them to do is pair with my Spotify and play music. That is not easily achieved.

AZ Desert Gator,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2019","AUDIO QUALITY
Even after adjusting the 3 audio adjustments for lower, mid and high range, the audio from this speaker is muffled and sounds terrible. I have a original 1st gen Echo still working that theoretically should sounds slightly inferior due to smaller speakers - but it is far better. It's not that I am very picky about audio, this speaker actually has a strange aspect to the muffled sound that could not simply be created by increasing bass and lower highs and mids.

MICROPHONES NOT AN IMPROVEMENT OVER DOT
The microphones also are not an improvement of a Dot 1st gen, and then later a Dot 2nd gen that this unit replaced. This new speaker is in the kitchen near the stove, replacing the prior Dot's that lived in the same spot. The Dot's did not do very well picking up voice - sometimes not at all, and sometime just very wrong. There is more background noise and white noise sometimes in the kitchen (exhaust hood), and I had hoped that this top-end speaker would be better at ""listening"" than the low-end dots; it isn't.

Most of the time it constantly needs adjustments - this should be a simple process but is definitely not. If you ever change your router or modem, you have to re-adjust all your devices. This is not an easy process. Each device needs individual adjustment which sometimes it doesn't adjust. You would think Amazon would upgrade the software to have one device make the new connection, and all the rest adjust automatically. My WIFI sucks, so the 10 Echos and 6 lighting systems take hours of work to get them back online. Some never get there. Their tech help used to be great, but no longer.

What I came to find out is that Amazon does not offer price match on items purchased. I spoke to a rep on the chat line and they said, while they don't price match, you can return the Echo and order a new one at the lower price. This is ridiculous... Amazon basically pays for twice the shipping (returning the old unit and shipping the new one), rather than a simple adjustment to the payment method that was originally tendered.

IMPORTANT: All models of amazon echos do not currently have any way to delay the aux output and each model has a different fixed latency at the aux out.

If you are looking to use the Echo to drive a bigger system for multi room, you must buy the same Echo model and you must use the aux output at each endpoint. If you use aux at one endpoint and internal speaker at another there will be a perceivable delay between the two devices. There should be a way to manually delay the device with the internal speaker to align to the latent audio of the device with aux out, but there isn’t.

Peregrine,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2018","Great sound for the price. I would recommend getting this over the echo. The plus has a much louder but warmer sound. The room temperature feature also is a nice added bonus.

UPDATED REVIEW:

All Amazon Alexa products are practically unusable in their bluetooth connections. They will distort sound even if the device they're paired with is literally a foot away. There's in no excuse when products made by most companies have no issue with sound quality when paired with devices. I guess amazon wants you just to use their services such as amazon music instead of using it also as a bluetooth device. So, if your intent is to use this device often for pairing in bluetooth, spend your money on other products.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Tiz,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2020","I thought upgrading my echo was going to solve problems like Alexa not hearing me if the water is running or if she is playing music or an alarm but, as it turns out, this version is not much better than the previous. Aesthetically yes but from a performance aspect, I’m disappointed. Yes the sound is better, fuller but I had higher expectations.
I can’t tell you how many times I try the new things Amazon themselves recommend in an email and she says “I don’t think I can help you with that”. :(

Craig M Moore,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2018","I want to start off by saying that I love Amazon as a company, so this isn't a hate review on Amazon. BUT, I do feel deceived by amazon on this.

The Echo Plus does have a ""smart hub"" that uses Zigbee to connect to various smart home devices. HOWEVER, the Echo Plus can only utilize the PHILLIPS HUE system in a limited capacity. In order to get full use out of the HUE bulbs, you still have to buy the HUE BRIDGE.

What you can do with the Echo Plus alone:
1. Voice Control the lights.
2. Change the color of the lights by voice, BUT you are limited to about 20 colors instead of the ""16 million colors"" that the HUE bulbs are capable of.
3. You can set routines and groups, which is nice.

What you CANT do without the HUE Bridge:
1. Compatibility with many more sensors
2. The ability to automate and set scenes
3. get system updates over the air and future features.
4. Have your lights sync with music
5. Probably more, but I can't remember.

Also, if you change devices, or switch to a HUE hub, odds are you will have to redo all of your lights.

What bothers me more than anything is that the product page for the Echo Plus CLEARLY states compatibility with the HUE system, and even use the HUE APP logo as shown in the picture. That's great, except that you MUST have a HUE BRIDGE to use the app, which is another $50-60 on top of the already expensive investment of the bulbs.
Craig
I would like to see Amazon clarify that the HUE BRIDGE is necessary for the full HUE system, but I doubt it will happen. Alternatively, I would to see them bundle the Echo Plus and HUE together so that you can get the full system right out of the box.

Hope this helps,

Gadget Dad,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2019","I had an original, full sized Echo in my kitchen and loved it, but the only thing I really wished it could do was support stereo playback via two units - which it does not. A pair of them would make for a much better overall music experience, as a single mono device just isn't ideal when it comes to enjoying music... So, when the Echo Plus (2nd gen) arrived offering a built in stereo pairing feature/utility via the Alexa app, I immediately jumped onto getting a set of them and traded in my original Echo.

The first let down was the sound. The original Echo simply sounded a bit better. It could go louder, and the sound was just clearer/cleaner. Perhaps it is the quality of the materials used in the original Echo, which just seemed more like a premium device as to fit/finish and the richer sound. Fine I thought - but certainly having a pair of the newer units would make up for a better overall Echo experience? Well, no, not really. Sound wise, even paired, I feel the original Echo just sounded cleaner/clearer. The bass was less muddy and the dynamic range was also a bit better, especially at higher volume levels. Now I'm not talking about a night and day differences here, but still, I fully expected the Echo Plus to have evolved somewhat in the sound department... and that simply isn't the case here.

So all in all, if you are looking to upgrade for improved sound, well, there isn't really any reason to jump ship. Stick with your original Echo or explore the Sonus One speaker that has Echo support if you really want to upgrade your sound for music playback.

Now, my biggest gripe about the paired Amazon Echo Plus is the fact that it is ONLY paired for music playback. Other than that, it acts as TWO completely separate devices. This is especially frustrating in a kitchen environment where you use timers and alarms all the time. Example: Ask Alexa to set a 15 minute timer. It does, choosing whichever Echo unit heard you I guess. Now walk around the kitchen and then call out, ""Alex, how much time left on my timer?""... And low and behold, the other unit hears you and responds telling you that you have no timers set! WHAT? With a stereo pair, you have to remember which device took your timer request and ensure that you are only speaking to it in order to get any info out of it? Really? How hard would it be to just have them act together in unison as one unit!? Why not provide that as an option? A paired set should behave and act as a single Alexa device! They should respond in unison to commands - which they do not! They should also know about each other timers/commands, but unfortunately they do not. Right now, stereo pairing is NOT what I expected. It only plays music in stereo paired setting, nothing else. Rather than getting a nice volume boost when responding to commands, you get just a single speaker. This is a tremendous let-down for having purchased two premium devices and wanting to use them together. If Amazon would fix this MAJOR issue, I'd easily raise my review to 4 stars. My original Echo was easily a 5 star device. The newer Echo Plus (2nd Gen) is only a 3 star device if you buy 2 of them and use them as a stereo pair. Purchased alone, I'd raise it to a 4 stars. (-1 for the poorer sound quality compared with the original Echo).",3.0 out of 5 stars
Dan Callaghan,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2020","I purchased this Echo Plus 2nd Gen three months ago (Sep 2020), long enough to evaluate it well. The onboard temperature sensor is routinely off my 10 or more degrees Fahrenheit.

I have two other indoor digital temperature sensors by different manufacturers sitting right beside the Echo Plus, they are within 0.8 degrees of one another other, today showing 78 and 77.2 degrees Fahrenheit. Since one rounds to whole numbers the difference could be as little as 0.3 degrees between them.

By comparison the Echo Plus says the indoor temperature is currently 67.2 degrees Fahrenheit. That's a difference of 10 to 11 degrees from the accurate/correct reading. Even without the two other digital temperature sensors you can feel the indoor temperature of the room is in the middle 70s not the middle 60s.

Amazon customer service did offer to exchange the device but based on other reviews indicating regular inaccurate temperature readings I declined the offer since the problem seems to be due to a calibration issue with the sensor. There is no method available to manually recalibrate the sensor or manually offset/adjust it - other than to perform a factory reset of the device which I've done half a dozen times or so to no effect.

On the plus side the sound quality is good and Alexa integration is on par. I have the Echo Plus in the same room (across the room) from an original Echo 1st Gen. Unfortunately the two devices frequently get confused as to which device you're closest to when addressing ""Alexa"". In fact sometimes both devices respond at once. That's not so good.

Believe it or not, the Echo Plus 2nd Gen more frequently misinterprets or fails to properly understand verbal commands/questions when compared to the much older Echo 1st Gen. Also not good, but again the sound quality is a little better than the older Echo device. Sound quality of the Echo Plus 2nd Gen compared to any generation of the Echo Dot is far superior for both bass and treble.

You can play back music simultaneously thru both Echo devices but only by playing back thru all Echo devices. Echo devices are only capable of ""stereo playback"" if they are the same models.

Over the years I've purchased 1 Echo, 5 Echo Dots, 1 Echo Plus, 1 Echo Input, and I have yet another Echo Dot arriving in January 2021. I've given away 4 Echo Dots as gifts so January 2021 will be my first opportunity to test the Echo Dot's ""stereo playback"" ability.

To sum up, if a primary reason you desire to purchase an Echo Plus 2nd Gen is for the temperature sensor capability or because you believe its responses will be more accurate than other Echo models, you might want to look elsewhere or spend less.

Since I've purchased 9 Echo devices over the years I'm clearly a strong advocate for this Amazon device product line. At the same time I do my best to review these electronic devices fairly and accurately.

My primary profession is in computer technology and electronics. My secondary profession is in ranching. My cattle, sheep, goats, and chicken flocks seem to appreciate the Echo serenades I give them sometimes. LOL",3.0 out of 5 stars
HappyMom28,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2020","I bought one of the original echo devices when they first came out years ago and put it in my kitchen, we have loved it. For the past year or so, it quit responding to the wake word as quickly and seamlessly as it had in the past. This year, the maker of our smart hub decided to start charging a monthly fee so decided we needed a new hub. We figured it was time to upgrade the echo to the echo plus with the hub built in and take care of both issues.

The good:
The hub section works and communicates with our devices.
The sound quality is good.
The volume is really loud.
My remote that came with the original echo device paired with this; thus, I can still use it.
It has a built in thermometer and can tell me the temperature in the kitchen (where it is located).

The bad:
This device still has a difficult time hearing us and responding, just like the old one did. (Maybe it’s because I have echo dots in all the other rooms of the house, and an Echobee thermostat in the hall).
I can only get the temperature of the kitchen when I asked the Echo plus that is in the kitchen, none of the other echo dots in the other rooms can access that information.
The hub in the echo plus does not control all of my smart devices, so we ended up buying an additional hub anyway, which will control everything, including the items that this one will. (Before purchasing it for the hub feature check compatibility with your other devices).
It randomly changes volume. One time i ask it a question and it will be super loud, and the next time the volume will be normal.
I usually have to say, “Alexia,” 3 times in order for it to respond. It lights up when I say, “Alexia,” the first 2 times, but doesn’t actually answer the questions or set the timers until the third try.

I am going to keep this device, but the additional cost wasn’t worth it for the extra features or the frustration I have in trying to get it to respond. Or maybe my Ecobee thermostat is just really far superior with the microphone listening in, because it is always responding when I am trying access my echo plus. I can be standing next to my echo plus and the thermostat in the hall way will respond. I did turn off the microphone on the thermostat, but the echo plus in the kitchen still didn’t respond all the time, so I turned the microphone back on on the thermostat, and if the timers are set in the hall I just have to deal with it.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Stevee108,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2020","I bought two identical Echoes, 3rd generation, verified purchaser. I installed one in the den and one in the master bedroom. I also installed 4 Alexa compatible security devices in those two rooms. The Echo were set up for Apple I-Tunes. After a week, the Echo in the bedroom worked flawlessly. The Echo in the den would constantly tell me that “Apple Music is not supported by this device.” The next time I tried the same command, the Echo would work. I never got this message on the Echo in the bedroom. I uninstalled and installed Apple Music Twice. It worked flawlessly for a couple of days, and then it went berserk again on the Echo in the den. As an engineer, I decided that I would run a totally controlled experiment with the response of the Echo as the only variable. I recorded several voice bytes with the exact same Alexa command of “Alexa Using Apple Music Play Willie Nelson Seven Spanish Angels.” All of the recordings had 10 seconds of silence at the beginning before it gave the “Alexa” command. I chose a specific sound byte that had properly worked twice in a row. I placed the recorder on the arm of the recliner that I usually sit. I had access to a sound meter calibrated and certified for regulatory noise compliance regulations on all governmental levels. The noise meter was last calibrated in November 2019. The certification is valid for 12 months. I placed the microphone of the noise meter within 2 inches of the Echo. I played the same sound byte 20 times without changing either the location or volume level of the recorder. The plots of what was received on the sound meter could be plotted, and all 20 plots were a perfect overlay. With scientific certainty, the Echo was receiving the exact same sound byte 20 times in a row without the slightest variation in sound level or voice intonation. The results: 8 times the Echo told me that Apple Music was not supported by this device, 6 times the Echo interrupted the sound byte and started playing unsolicited music and 6 times the Echo played the requested song via the requested source. Again, I could verify and certify that the Echo was receiving the precise same sound byte every time. I then took the recorder into the bedroom and played the sound byte 20 times there. The distance was about 3 times further away than in the den. The results, the Echo played the correct song 20 times in a row. There is obviously an issue with the quality control with this device. I got a good one, and I got a turkey. It’s a roll of the dice on what you are going to get.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Tigre,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2020","This is my first Echo device that I have really been disappointed in and I have several. I have 1 Gen 1 dot, 2 Gen 2 dots, Echo buds, and all of these work well together and sound amazing for what they are so I decided to go bigger. I Should have stuck with the dots. This Echo 3rd Gen is not worth the extra money. It doesn't sound much better than the dots, and for the big kicker, they are not compatible with the dots for things like connecting for stereo sound. I mean how is Alexa not compatible with Alexa?! There is that much of a change in software between generations that Gen 2's can't talk to Gen 3's? Really? Since that is the case, they need to say that plainly in bold letters on their website instead of making me dig for it on some help section after I already bought it! I would have bought something else!

As for the music, It's ok. Not much better than the Echo Dots honestly. The base is slightly more, but just slightly. For some types of music (like electric ambient music for example) it totally distorts the sound making what should sound like light clouds and sunshine sound completely discordant and more like something out of a horror flick.

I mean it's usable. It's an Echo. It works like any other Echo. But it seems the more of these I buy, the harder time they have coordinating which one is going to answer and on which one the music is going to play. I mean I tell my Echo in my bedroom to play music and it plays in my living room! Then to fix it I have to unplug all of them at the same time and then plug them all back in and then they work until the next time they get all confused.

I'm not sending the device back. I mean it works. Just not as well or as seamless as the 3 dots I had been using previously. I will be looking for something that provides higher quality sound to plug my dots into from now on instead of messing with the Amazon stuff if I feel it's time to upgrade again. Call me weird but I just have this thing for liking my music in stereo and having my devices compatible with the stuff I bought previously.",3.0 out of 5 stars
MrBlueSky,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2020","Sadly after less than 10 months, speaker sounds crackly, and voice recognition is hit or miss.

At first, this was an impressive device with great bass and excellent voice responsiveness. However, after about 6 months I noticed it starting to lag in voice recognition, and I had to repeat the wakeup word ""Alexa"" several times before it would respond. I also started to notice that sometimes the sound was a little crackly when playing music.

I listen to it daily, often for a couple hours as I work around the house, and I rarely have the volume above 40%. On only a rare few occasions have I ""cranked"" it up to 70%. I don't like things loud, and have pretty sensitive hearing, so 40% is usually quite nice and full sounding. However, as the months continued, I noticed the sound degrading more and more and the overall product began to sound more tinny and sometimes crackle with moderate bass sounds (even at only 40%).

Some songs seem to be still ok, but more and more are starting to sound steadily worse. And frequently I have to repeat ""Alexa....Alexa....ALEXA!"" many times, even when I'm only a few feet away before the device responds. My environment has not changed, as it is used in my master bedroom, so I'm not sure why the voice responsiveness would get worse over time...it's supposed to get better as it ""learns"" your voice commands, accent, and speaking style. I have a ""Californian"" accent (which is about as zero of an American accent out there) so I'm very surprised it has lost much of it's voice recognition.

In any case, at first I really and truly was impressed with this little unobtrusive speaker. It really has much more power, and was more robust sounding when I first bought it. However, I am very disappointed that it is already starting to lose it's clarity in sound and responsiveness - at under a year old. I guess in this throw away technology society, perhaps I should have expected as much.",3.0 out of 5 stars
HillHC,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023","Love the “big” sound this 3rd gen puts out. I put my 2nd gen in the breakfast area and this guy on a shelf above my fridge; paired them up because the 2nd gen’s sound was almost as good, and it made cooking fun again. I use Alexa to create my grocery/shopping lists, to help me make substitutes in recipes, convert metric units, and play trivia games or 20 questions with my kids over dinner. The ONLY issue I have is that it mysteriously shut off after 7-8 months and wouldn’t turn back on. It had its original power cord and was plugged into a surge protector, yet zap. My 1st and 2nd gen Echos are still trucking along but not this guy. Now Amazon doesn’t sell them so I can’t even order a replacement. Bad form, Amazon.

Also, one other nitpick, I bought a new Fire tv for my bedroom, and was excited to pair it up for surround sound (using my 3rd gen to test it with plans to order two more if it sounded good) and it’s not compatible. Had to buy 2 new 4th gen Echos to get the surround sound. Disappointed.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Lawrence Bolger,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2018","My echo plus setup experience was very interesting! The Alexa App is instrumental in the set up, so were my headaches caused by the app or the device? After logging into the wifi system and thinking i completed all that was necessary, i was left with a message in the device area. It said echo plus not available and needs to be removed. I tried a few things, unplug, plug, hold down reset. While i could ask and get response that indicated connection to internet, the device on the app, had no other means of editing or setting up. I called support and got a very helpful agent. Together we explored aspects of the Echo interface to no avail. Finally something happened i now had a new message on app “device is recalibrating and could take awhile”!
I asked the agent if this was unusual, and was told “very uncommon”, and she would call me back in a couple of hours.
Things i learned, in lower right corner, icon looks like house with vertical bars. This was the access to device setting. Once my recal competed, when using the menu on left, selecting device i was greated with my room temp! Look in upper right on this screen find 3 dots. Touch those then menu for this device opens. I created a group for origional echo and new echo plus naming it “everywhere”! So now i can say “alexa play _____ music everywhere” and both units play.
Now i need to find out how to change phone number (cell right now) to a different number, to utilize phone call out. I did use it to try it out and that worked fine.
Now i still have question on the aux in? Can i use IPod to play my own music. As a prime member i can play what is on Amazon Music, by asking.
Oh the agent did call back as promised, so i asked her about the aux in use, the response was try it. I havent.
So what could make this better? Maybe a PDF style manual explaining the app interface and what icons are, and what each will do ( like the house i mentioned earlier) vs guessing.
Sounds great but came close to returning that is why i gave 3 stars.

Chris,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2022","The Alexa voice recognition is great, and it understands you well. The sound quality that comes out is wonderful and we enjoy playing music for the whole family - the kids even can start their favorite songs.
However, I would never recommend this to my friends - it plays ads almost every time you interact with it.

Over the past couple years, the Echo has added ads to almost everything. Even after I have switched off advertising, nudges, hunches, and the new words/settings they keep coming up for this and adding automatically, when I ask ""Alexa, what's the weather?"" she responds ""The high for today will be 75 degrees. Did you know that you can add an item to your shopping list - just ask me 'Alexa please buy soap.'""

When ask her what the notification she is displaying means (which often indicates a package has been delivered), instead she says ""Your Epson printer is low on ink - would you like to order more?"" (since I ordered the printer on Amazon two years ago - it has plenty of ink, as it did the last 10 times she suggested ordering more ink).

When I say ""Play Eagle by ABBA"" Alexa says ""You can play this song if you upgrade to Amazon's Premium Music for $9.99 a month, shall I upgrade now?"" since I (or the kids) forgot to say ""on Apple Music.""

It's honestly gotten to the point where I am going to buy a Google Home, which is a shame because I'll have to redo all my smart home integrations which work very well on the Echo (if you discount the advertising).",3.0 out of 5 stars
Jay,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2019","Good sound, easy to set up, attractive/subdued hardware, cloud based AI works well for us, needs better client firmware, admin software apps.

More details on our cons, as the pros have been covered by many other reviews.

- cannot be set up from ethernet connected PC, requires either mobile app or wifi PC
- whisper mode is cool, but rarely works - the volume between ""too soft - can't hear me"" and ""not a whisper - use normal volume"" makes it very hard to get the whisper reply
- bummed that the smart home connectivity for Hue bulbs is limited to so few capabilities compared to a dedicated Hue hub

We have had several Echos over the years, and this is a replacement for an older generation, and I hope this one avoids the problems we have had with those, because they are now essentially paperweights:
- a recent firmware update (sometime in the last 3 months) killed the ability to connect with our router's 5GHz or 2.4GHz wifi, either as an existing, new, or factory reset new device. We had two identical ones, both replaced by these. One went to the garage where it was rarely used, noticed it was not connected about 2 weeks ago, but figured it just needed a reboot; however rebooting it didn't reconnect it. I hadn't used it in a while, figured maybe it died from the cold or something. The second was in storage in the house, so I got it out to use instead, and it powered up and connected to wifi fine - I checked weather, etc. to verify it was ok. I left it alone a few hours, it got an update and restarted, and was then in the same boat as the other one - no wifi connection can be made with any combo of settings I can try, but it does connect to the Android app via the Amazon wifi step of setup, so the hardware seems fine. All our newer Echos - Echo Plus, Echo Sub, Echo Show, Echo Show 2, work fine with the same settings.
- the Android Alexa app pops up an error message when wifi connectivity fails during setup, which covers the first two input fields on the page (network name and password) and can't be dismissed, making it difficult to edit the form without killing the app
- the Android Alexa app flips the phone from standard WiFi to a peer-to-peer Amazon Wi-Fi with the Echo during setup, and killing setup or failing setup leaves the phone unconnected to the internet unless you go back and reselect your normal WiFi network in Android settings
- support was free, but very slow (3+ minutes to type each response, I think they were in multiple simultaneous chats), and ineffective - they just followed the flowchart, ignoring what I told them I had already done, and asking the same questions over and over; the only new thing they had me try was the factory reset paperclip button, but it made no difference.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Titlelog,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2020","I use Yamaha speakers and MusicCast to listen to SiriusXM music. I also have the original Echo Dot, the next generation Dot, and now the Echo Smart Speaker. The reason I bought the new Echo is because we have Prime, and I feel like I'm cheating myself by not using Amazon Music. I am a diehard classical music lover, and there are a lot of CD's on Amazon that are at least partially included with Prime. My comments will mostly be about how SiriusXM and Amazon Music compare to each other, because Yamaha's WX-030 (now discontinued) sounds pretty much the same as the Echo. The Yamaha speaker has to be controlled with a tablet or phone, but really only if you're changing channels. There are buttons on top to control power and volume, and the unit holds the most recent channel in memory. SiriusXM streams directly to the speaker over wi-fi, and I've had very good experiences with it, sometimes streaming music all day long with no issues. You can integrate the speaker with an Echo, but I'm one of those people who thinks voice control is overrated. The only other downside to the Yamaha is that it doesn't have a line-in jack, unlike the Echo. My experiences streaming Amazon Music have been disappointing, to say the least. The speaker frequently stops playing. The other day it stopped and I asked Alexa to play something else, and she apologized and said the stream stopped due to inactivity. The music had only been playing a little over an hour. Today I asked her to play a show on SiriusXM called Baroque and Beyond, and she did so right away. But about a third of the way into the show, it inexplicably started over from the beginning. The stations on Amazon Music also have issues with volume level, which can be entirely different from one track to the next. I've also found the selections to be less than great. Amazon continually tries to persuade me to upgrade to Music Unlimited, but based on my experience with the music included with Prime, I would be very reluctant to pay more. Hopefully the service will improve over time, but after having the Echo for only about a week, I already find myself using it less and less.",3.0 out of 5 stars

M. Jones,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2019","We're all having fun with Alexa. Overall it is nice but I look forward to future updates.
Key areas -
Voice Profiles and security. It would be nice if I could limit activity based on Voice profile. While one can lock down purchases - I want to set times where Children aren't allowed to talk to it... or they can't override what Mom says (mom picks music and then the kids try to override mom - which results in me pressing the Mute button). Alexa listens to everyone (future criminals will be yelling ""Alexa open the garage"" from outside the kitchen window)

SmartHome: I bought the hub hoping I wouldn't need to buy a hub from other vendors. Turns out I was wrong. Echo Plus doesn't support Scenes, sunset/sunrise time triggers, light switches as input, and several other things. For example the Hue lights come on full brightness after a power outage. The fix requires a Hue Hub. Some switches I was looking at require their own Hub to operate. You need the hubs and Alexa can control simple devices. A hub of hubs (kind of an industry problem I suppose).

Miscellaneous - Timer alerts and CONTEXT. We use this feature while cooking - often naming the timers ""chicken timer"" ""pasta timer"" wonderful feature. However, when a timer goes off one can't simply say ""thanks I got it"" -- no you have to say ""Alexa - stop the pasta timer"" ""Alexa this, Alexa that"" - yes there is a mode to chain things together, but one still needs to be explicit as Alexa lacks context. A time is going off - when I say stop --- take a guess what I might mean.

The larger speaker is nice (although my Sonos sound system is better - the integration is lacking - but that's a Sonos problem). It looks nice. Works well. Just needs new features added.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Travis Johnson,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2018","I really wanted to love this Echo. But it has far too many bugs to be worth it anymore. It started just a few days after I received it. I had to do a factory reset because it got stuck on a notification that it couldn't play because it had disconnected from the internet, then it got stuck on a red ring immediately after. I had to delete everything I had worked to set up just a few days before in order to do the factory reset. It was working fine for a few weeks after that, then today it stopped playing my Spotify music, I had to relink my spotify premium account and reconnect the echo plus to the internet via set up mode, then it played spotify but could not access my playlists. When I asked ""Alexa, play my *name* playlist on spotify"" it would play a random playlist on spotify by the same name. Now is has unlinked from my spotify again, even though in the Alexa app it says I'm linked and good to go. I have given up.
30% of the time it will misunderstand me or not hear me at all, and I speak loud and clear in anticipation of it not hearing me correctly and it is in the center of the room so the microphones aren't blocked. I have overlooked most of these little bugs and brushed it off as this relatively new tech still finding its feet, but today's spotify fiasco was the last straw for me. It can still play NPR without a problem and is good at giving me generic information like the weather and time. Other than that, not worth the money I spent on it.

J. Yancey,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2020","I have 8 Echo Gen 3 speakers with 4 Echo Sub woofers covering 4 rooms. Each room has the two Gen 3 speakers in stereo mode + sub woofer. The stereo configuration with the sub woofer makes a HUGE difference in the sound quality.

The sound is comparable to that of Sonos devices at a fraction of the cost.

Setup can be a bit flaky but eventually does work. Whole house audio on Eero mesh wireless is hit or miss but that was a secondary benefit for me. If that is a primary reason for purchasing for you that could take this review to a one star. Sometimes Amazon sees devices on different access points as being available to one another. Sometimes it doesn't.

The only thing that really ""gets my goat"" is the lack of gapless playback. Isn't all that important for most listening but when it is important it is a must have. I.e. Pink Floyd, Classical music, Live recordings, white noise recordings.

Silence between tracks of audio that is meant to be have no gaps is unacceptable. I've been using digital music since the mid 90's and have always had the option of playing gapless. Yahoo had this down way back then but Amazon can't get it done? It is 2020. Right?

Also had to buy two of the Gen 3's from another source because Amazon limits a personal account to purchasing six without switching to a business account. I don't understand why (other than profit) they do that. I'm a retail customer wanting to purchase a reasonable amount of speakers for my personal use.

Eric J.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2019","This 2nd Gen Echo replaced my original Echo that I used for several years. The original Echo controlled my Hue lights by interfacing with the Hue hub. When I set up the 2 Gen. Echo, it didn't work well with the Hue hub and refused to recognize and control my lights. I tried a number of things to get it to work with the Hue hub (reset, discover new devices, etc.), but nothing worked. I believe that the built-in Zigbee hub was creating a conflict with the Hue hub. To get the Echo to recognize my Hue lights, I had to remove the Hue hub, reset the Echo and manually enter the serial numbers of each light bulb into the Alexa app. Since then, it's been working fine. However, I lost the ability to update the Hue bulb functionality to remain in the off-state after resuming from a power outage -- something that Philips finally addressed in a software update.

The 2nd Gen. Echo has a built-in temperature sensor. Initially, it was reasonable accurate. However, it's now measuring as much as 5 degrees below the actual ambient temperature. I haven't found any instructions that would allow the user to recalibrate the sensor. I don't use the Echo to control my heating/cooling system but it would be a big problem if I did.

The sound quality of the 2nd Gen. Echo is better than my original Echo. I also like that it's smaller in height, so it's a little less intrusive. I miss the volume control on the original Echo that consisted of turning a ring on the top, but the buttons on the 2nd Gen. will suffice.

All in all, it's a decent product. However, the setup for use with my Hue lights was very problematic and took a bit of research to finally get it to work.",3.0 out of 5 stars
kuzag84,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2019","We're an Alexa household, with an Echo speaker in almost every room, not to mention our smart plugs, bulbs, and such. So we're in it for the long haul. We went to upgrade our final Echo Dot to a full-fledged Echo. This was our first 3rd Gen (our 2nd Gen Echos are wonderful, so we figured, the 3rd Gen must be even better). The sound quality and ease of setup was second-to-none (comparable to 2nd Gen - no marked improvement - probably given that the 2nd Gen is about perfect). HOWEVER, we stream a lot of music in our home. And Echo usually does a flawless job at it, even syncing across devices. However, one small (arguably nitpicky) problem with this 3rd Gen unit. When you wake this unit while music is playing, it pauses the music as expected to listen to your command; however, after pausing it also sounds a momentary crackle/pop (and by momentary, a teeny-tiny fraction of a second). You start talking to it and it pops. Just enough, however, to drive you mad. And frankly, it's just not acceptable. Not when our other units work perfectly.

I contact tech support, and they said that they were able to replicate it, and that it was ""completely normal."" Well, I'm a reasonable person, but this just kind of cheapens the experience, and frankly I'm not convinced it is normal behavior (by the way, we restarted it/reset it/upgraded it/basically everything to try and rectify). And maybe this wouldn't be an issue for most (the speaker is wonderful otherwise), but we use our Echos heavily, often interrupting the music to turn on lights, for example, and I just don't want to hear it pop and crackle when I'm talking to it.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Mrs. B,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2019","We purchased the Echo Sub Bundle with 2 Echo Plus (2nd Gen) Devices with hopes of getting an upgraded/updated sound compared to our original Amazon Echo (1st Gen). Immediately after the setup, we were disappointed that this new device was not nearly as loud as the Amazon Echo (1st Gen). While the Echo Plus looked terrific and sounded good, it still could not match the original version. We decided to pair the subwoofer with the Echo Plus, and it did help with the bass, but the overall volume was still not the same as the original Echo. Along with the purchase of the Echo Sub Bundle, we also purchased the Echo Remotes for the ease of selecting our music. This turned out to be a nightmare. If you have a subwoofer paired with the Echo Plus, it overrules the paired remote which in turn makes the remote useless until the sub is unpaired from the device. The Echo Plus worked flawlessly with the remote when the sub was unpaired.

Some things are expected to get better as the generations progress but, in my opinion, not in this case. This appears to be one of those ""if it's not broke, don't fix it"" scenarios. Gen 2's and their lack of compatibility within its own genuine Echo add-on devices (sub and remote) makes me question what happened in the Gen 2's.

If you are looking for a clean sounding Echo without any extras, then this device will work just fine, and the sound is pretty good. If you are like us, hanging out listening to fairly loud music and using the remote so Alexa can hear you, this is not for you when paired with the sub.

Curtiss,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2020","I purchased a pair of Echo 3 speakers as holiday gifts to enhance our listening experience in our living room when we just want to listen to some quality music.

The speakers almost sound as if a small pile of laundry is covering them up...a muddy sound at-best. I would have forgone the purchase in exchange for the clarity of the Echo 2.

Part of the displeasure with this purchase was the bundling of the three months free trial of Amazon Music Unlimited. Again, this was in conjunction with the gift purchase of the pair of Echo 3 speakers. I've been trying to find out how to start my free trial of the music and then found out today that it automatically started when I purchased the speakers November 29.

There were no apologies from Customer Service, just that a renewal fee would kick-in in about a month! How convenient!!! My wife has Amazon Prime.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2019","I originally bought the Echo 2nd Gen but was not pleased with the bass so I exchanged it for the Echo Plus. Note that I did this solely for music; I have no smart devices in my home so I did not buy this to control lights, locks, etc. The sound IS better but it is not the big full sound I am looking for. I determined I definitely want a system with more than one speaker for the stereo effect.

What was frustrating to me was dealing with Alexa; there were too many communication problems. My first Alexa knew music that the new one didn't but perhaps that was due to communication as well. Alexa also sometimes talked or started playing music when I did not address her which was a little creepy. Sometimes I would have to get up close to the Echo and speak my words slow-ly-and-dis-tinct-ly for her to understand what I wanted. As a result of these issues combined with wanting a bigger sound I decided to return the Plus.

I am a 67-year-old man trying to catch up on technology and it has been interesting to me to see so many other 'boomers' on here trying to do the same thing. Purchasing the two Echo speakers entered me into this whole Bluetooth-wireless-WiFi world that I knew nothing about, and I have learned a lot.

K. Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2023","Over time I've come to realize the Alexa software has some significant issues and limitations. When you ask Alexa a question there's about a 50/50 chance you'll get the correct response (and these are pretty easy questions). Every few days it will blurt out an answer to a question nobody asked. The alarm function in the Alexa app is useful, but very basic. For instance you can't set an alarm more than 24 hours in advance. When I bought these, Amazon Music was a nice surprise. However, due to corporate greed, it functions more like a radio now. You used to be able to ask for a particular song or artist but now you get music from that category. If you want, you can pay a monthly fee to get the music you want. That's on top of the Amazon Prime subscription.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Lemore,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2020","I have had a Sonos speaker for two years now . I purchased the echo 3rd Jen and evaluated it for two days I have read a few reviewers claiming how the echo 3 sounds better than the Sonos Speaker. My Sonos is just a speaker that is integrated with the sonos app where you can have many different types of radio stations and different music apps like pandora etc. Sonus has introduced a new speaker that is the same standard Sonus speaker like the one I have however the new Speaker has Alexa built into it just like an echo. Any reviewer who thinks that the Echo 3 sounds as good as a Sonus speaker is wrong period. If a person only knows sound quality from an Echo dot or some cheap table top radio than I can truly see how they would be impressed with the Echo 3. But if you have been familiar with decent sounding sound systems, I think you will see that I am correct and to those out there who may be saying to them selves that I am just another so called audio file that is not what this is all about. If you like the Alexa feature of the Echos but truly want really good sound quality and you can spend the extra money for the Sonus speaker with the Alexa feature go for it. Again I will emphasize that the Sound quality of the Sonus speaker is superior...period.

Jimmy J.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2018",I have 4 of the Echo Plus's in the house and one Echo sub. The two in the kitchen/living area are paired as a stereo. I found that the separation between the two Echo's is a bit spotty at times when paired as a stereo. Still trying to figure out a way to pair them both with the sub without them playing as a stereo. I think getting the full range out of each Echo would sound better. The sound quality gets spotty (pun intended) as you increase the volume. Two Echo's and a sub are not a replacement for a high end sound system obviously. But the convenience is nice being about to group areas on the different speakers/zones and have music everywhere in the house. I do wish a equalizer was available in the Alexa app for each speaker. I know the ability is there to achieve this with the technology that is in the Echo plus but Amazon has apparently decided not to provide that capability. Since I have a home office my attempts to mesh Alexa and Cortana (Windows 10) have been a bit frustrating. Although that is a skill that Alexa has -Cortana still needs work on the Microsoft end and it would be nice if Amazon and Microsoft provided a more fluid work productivity venue for the millions of us that work out of home offices. There is good potential there but it just has not been realized yet by the developers that seem content with Alexa telling jokes.,3.0 out of 5 stars
Amy CC,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2019","Echo Plus has much better sound quality, nice plus, better bass, nice, but poor voice recognition, volume control and essentially no control of it via the Alexa app.

Volume is all over the map essentially. When you first turn it on, volume is very low for about 10 - 15 seconds, then goes moderate for maybe 5 seconds, then loud, and stays loud. If you tell it to lower volume, just don't know what you will get. You have to walk over to it and turn the volume down and even then, it isn't consistent.

Plus I have noticed, my husband has as well, it literally does not want to be turned off. It's about 50/50 that it will actually turn off when you tell it too. A couple of times I have told it to ""stop"" and the volume just got very low. Repeated attempts to turn it off were ignored. After several minutes, I finally shouted angrily at it, no lie, and THEN it turned off completely. Does Alexa now understand emotions as well?? Kind of scary.

As far as integration in the Alexa app, essentially nonexistent. You can do the setup via the Alexa app, after that, there's no more volume control, on/off control via the app. DO NOT like that Amazon. Are you listening?? Oh, wait you do listen sometimes.... Yes, not so happy with this 2nd Gen Echo. Improved sound quality does not make up for loss of control.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Geoffrey Martin,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2019","I work at DDE5 and won this as a raffle prize with my DSP. I honestly would have never bought one because I really have no use for it. BUT since I have one now :) I think it's pretty neato. AI still has a long way to go and so does Alexa. Its always listening. Always. I have it next to my TV. When Amazon commercials play maybe ONCE in a blue moon it will recognize ""alexa do so and so"" and will turn on, rings go violently around in a circle and wont perform the task. So its genuinely okay to have it next to a TV that is relatively loud. My TV is a 55"" LG. Over all it's a neato product but honestly not practical unless you like to say order this and that. BUT still have to go on the app or site to complete transaction. It also normally puts Amazon brand items in your cart FYI. It's good for music, or asking silly questions, and other facts it can tell you. I rarely use it. But you can also use it on your phone to ""drop in"" and talk/ listen to everyone going on in the area where it's placed. It can keep you entertained for a little while. But quickly becoming boring. It's cool though so. But like I said earlier. I won this as a prize and I would have never bought one myself.",3.0 out of 5 stars
S. Bufe,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2018","In the following examples, they are not stereo. Only one speaker plays.

1. Connect to your phone with Bluetooth. Play a video.
2. My Flash Briefing
3. Ambient sounds
4. Guided meditation
5. Line in from a stereo source such as a Dot (sometimes.)
6. Streaming music (sometimes).

Paired remote stops responding once stereo sound starts. Must use voice control. At times, only volume buttons respond from remote, not pause, mic, or anything else.

Sometimes, one stereo line into one of the echoes is enough to get stereo from both. Then it mutes entirely. I pull the line from the echo plus left and reinsert it and the remote for that works again and there is sound, but only on one side.

Workaround: Use the Echo Pluses as dumb speakers. (It's a shame, I know, but this is hopefully just until they get the kinks worked out.)

Get a Dot. Mute mic on both Echo Pluses. Delete the stereo pairing in the Alexa app. Change Line In/Out jacks to In in the settings for each. Use a left/right breakout cable going from the Dot mini stereo jack to one cable for each Echo Plus. The remote works with the Dot at all times as it should. Stereo sounds proper in stereo test videos on YouTube via Bluetooth from the phone. (But there is an irritating lag.) News and other apps play from both speakers (even if mono).

This workaround won't help to utilize the subwoofer, unfortunately.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Dawsondog,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2020","After having bluetooth issues with my Google Home I decided to give the Echo a try. Pros: Obviously it integrates nicely with my Amazon account as well as my Ring doorbell. Bluetooth connection to my iPhone is stable and sound is good. Cons: As mentioned in my title, Echo does not integrate with Nest thermostat (at least that's what I was told by three Amazon customer support reps). I cannot adjust the temperature via voice command. Also, the Echo ""routines"" are not as robust as the Google Home routines. Using the Alexa app I set up a ""good night"" routine to give me the weather, tell me what's on my calendar and then play soothing nature sounds (crickets, outdoors sounds). Alexa only tells you what the current temp is and what the temp will be in the morning. Google home gives you the current temp plus the expected high and low temps for the next day. The nature sounds are much more realistic and give you the feel of actually being out in nature on the Google Home. If it wasn't for the fact that the Google Home device would continually drop bluetooth connection I probably would stay with Google.

That cloth, is an invitation for any cat at home (if you have feline companions like me) to put their claws on. The extra 0.5 inch on the woofer doesn't necessarily adds more quality to the sound. The tweeter is the same size on both models (0.8 inch). The built in temperature sensor is only useful is you ask Alexa for the temperature, I haven't found yet a way to monitor the temperature and get a notification if goes above a certain limit (useful, for example, to know if your AC goes down and you are not at home), I liked more the volume ring on the old model... looks like Amazon tried to simplify the product in order to cut costs and maximize profit. Those up and down volume buttons on the new model feels cheap. I bought this product on the 2 Echo Plus + Subwoofer combo. Once piece of advice: DONT'. that subwoofer only works for music coming from streaming. Doesn't work at all with any Bluetooth source of even the line in input. Given the silence from Amazon, looks like there is no way to fix this (probably will fixed in a new version of the product).

While it does everything the Echo 2nd generation does the reviews I read said it was a better speaker. It better but not as much as the reviews of videos and online reviews that I have read. I again maybe set my expectations a little high by the reviews I read. Many have said the sound quality was much better and the volume was much higher. That's not the case if you ask me. It seems if you want a better speaker through Amazon you have to go to the 199.00 Echo Studio and that's out of my price range right now. I'm sure for 200.00 it's much better but again I'm reviewing the Echo 3rd generation and I know it's 100.00 cheaper but if I didn't get it on sale I would have sent it back. I know Amazon until I guess the Echo Studio has been known for it's great speakers and it's suppose to be a great smart speaker but I beg to differ on that as Alexa isn't much of an AI though Amazon things she is as she says she's a great AI.

The Bluetooth connection breaks up when connecting to a my Macbookpro Bluetooth speaker. Invocations for Skills do not always work for some developers and Alexa does not pick up on this issue and recommends actions that is not related to the command. When sending a command to open a radio station on one of the radio channels Alexa does not recognize the command and continuous to open to incorrect station. Even though I send feedback to the app to indicate that it was the incorrect station, I continue to get the same results. The system is not learning my most frequent commands. But the sound is great, the system is practical for timing and mathematical conversions, the list function is GREAT! The biggest learning curve is understanding how Alexa pulls information and from where. Once you learn the way to structure commands and where it should come from (i.e. Skills, Amazon Music...etc.) you can make good use of it. There were basic search engine requests given that Alexa didn't know. This makes me wonder what search engine or data base is it pulling information from.

Mark,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2020","Two dislikes,
1) the cloud misunderstands syntax, in skills/apps. EXAMPLE: I played the animal guessing game, and the transcript from our recordings say that Alexa heard me guess “a fox.” Alexa responded with “Not correct, the answer is fox.” Alexa requires you to say phrases that she knows, in the way she knows them. This example is most noticeable in trivia style app games.
2) the voice recognition is disrupted by its own playback! I never noticed this happening with the Echo Dot. The Amazon Echo is such a powerfully loud device that with 80% playback volume, you will have to scream ALEXA to get her to stop. If you only want Alexa for news, weather, and automation, get the Echo Dot.

Which brings us to our many likes,
1) If you like loud music, this speaker can get really LOUD in an enclosed space! Awesome speakers that did not Clip at 90%. 100% volume was unbearably loud in my 10’x20’ room and will never happen. Music is as simple as saying “Alexa, play music”
2) power cord is ~6ft and comes with a white Rubber band to neatly contain any length you don’t use.
3) Great for home automation and playing music. App features allows you to call the speaker and talk to whomever is in the room, or if you don’t want to hear the response, announce something like a school principal.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I am downgrading my review from 5, down to 3 stars. The sound is amazing for such a small device. I wanted to use them with Amazon Music. I got the sub-woofer and two, to create a full sound stereo system. Again, the sound is amazing.

Connecting them to smart tv's, non-Amazon mp3 players, or my vinyl turntable, though ... I have found to be impossible. Alexa is pretty dismal, too. She responds more to the tv shows playing than my own requests. And she nearly NEVER gets my ""Play this..."" request correct. I tried to return them, but I'm outside the return window.

I'd recommend just purchasing a proper sound system with a sub-woofer. You'll be much happier. (I also canceled the free trial of Amazon Music.)

I bought two of these little gems, with a sub woofer. I synced them all together to create my own little home sound system. The deep base of the subwoofer really adds to the already well-balanced sound of the third generation devices. I’m not super excited about the voice recognition. I gave it four stars. I’m hoping that as these devices learn how I talk, and the technology gets better, it will be more smooth to use. Right now, Alexa only gets 2-3 out of five commands right. That’s frustrating!

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2019","the echo plus goes much louder than i had originally thought. you could throw a small house party with the volume if you wanted. the audio quality is great too , it comes a bit bass heavy out of the box but you can tell alexa to turn up the treble or eq how you want to.

the voice recognition is surprisingly spot on i can whisper to it and tell it what to do.

one glaring issue that i didnt know about before purchasing (wish i had) is that it does not have an internal battery.
it must always be plugged in to work.

it would have been incredibly easy for amazon to put a rechargable battery in it. as every other bluetooth speaker has one. but then youd be less apt to purchase additional echo products if you could easily carry it from room to room.

So, you have to purchase a rechargeable battery base .. there arent a lot of options for this , i found 2 and theyre both 60$

so if you buy this and want to make it portable , expect to shell out another 60$ just to make that possible.

Jen,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2020",this version is not comfortable to the first generation. First of all the bass sound is adjusted to take over and often times it causes discomfort to listen to even when the bass is adjusted to the lowest available level . The voice recognition is also less Superior than the first generation. It often has Hang Ups and a red circle indicating its inability to respond to a question or at a speed at which comprable to the first generation Alexa. We had the worst time connecting it to our Wi-Fi this time. Overall we are not pleased with the change in the base which causes literally the floor to vibrate even said at the lowest level. This takes away from the actual music that's being played and we have to adjust the volume down just so we can have less Bass which compromises the listening experience. I find this Alexa to not be an improvement to the first-generation and I wish I could buy another first-generation which broke recently.

And as far as using your Amazon Music subscription to one of these - let alone a PAIR of these - is becoming very difficult. There are certain songs, albums, and artists that Alexa simply refuses to play because she doesn't understand them. For instance try and get Alexa to play ""Chead"" by the band ""Hyper Crush"" (no pronunciation seems to satisfy Alexa, even the pronunciation that she uses if you play the album and then ask her what she is playing right now).

Anyway, the on line instructions leave a lot to be desired in the clarity and the use of graphics. I might upgrade the rating after we use this more. It's still something more akin to a toy and a really cool radio. We'll have to see.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Cliff,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2020","Using 2 Echo 3's for intercom in 2 offices separated by a window for interviews due to Covid-19. It works but Echo's have to be separated back from the window due to interference. These are probably designed for intercom between rooms that are separated. In order to hear better, tried a blue tooth speaker which worked with one echo with music, but when I switched to Drop In mode for intercom between the two the blue tooth cut out.

However, when I tried a wired speaker (connected to the Echo), the speaker worked with Drop In. While listening to music has a nice rich full tone, the sound for the Drop In intercom function with two Echo's is not as clear and full. I suppose the Drop In intercom function works well enough for basic communication between two rooms, like the bedroom and kitchen, but was not adequate for what I needed.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Janie Bevins,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2020","I was really shocked when I got the third generation red Echo. It appeared to have the same fabric as the second generation red, and I didn't notice the white top when I ordered. When I took it out of the box, I was struck by its cheap look. I bought this for my living room, but it is so ugly that I don't want to use it in there. The second generation red had some variation in the color that made the fabric look much richer. This very plain solid fabric and the domed white plastic top make this so tacky-looking. It reminds me of a plastic gumball machine. I attached a picture of the two items next to each other.

Anonymouss,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2020","So little did I know that you can only control your music/playlist via Apple Music while only paired with a single Echo device, NOT when paired with two or more! When it’s paired your only option is to ask Alexa to play a certain genre or artist and ask for it to play to the everywhere group or whatever specific group you’d like it to play, but it only recognizes one Echo device at a time via Bluetooth. The technology is NOT advanced, seems prehistoric. If you’re giving the option of controlling your playlist via Apple Music app on one device how difficult is it to program the Alexa app to play simultaneously on all devices via the synched music app? Ridiculous and a waste of money purchasing a second device for this sole purpose. I wanted my specific tracks playing in different rooms simultaneously and I can’t.

Rob Mims,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2020","I like the product. It is very helpful for things like checking the weather forecast, tracking amazon packages, playing music, etc.

There are a few downsides, however. Every once in a while it mistakes a random phrase for the activation word and turns on. Usually it turns off soon after, but it has sometimes mistaken what I was saying to someone else as a question for it and begins to rattle off an answer.

Then there are times where I ask it a question and it turns on but doesn’t answer. The blue light ring just stays on. When this happens, I always need to unplug the echo and plug it back in to solve the issue. A bit tedious as it happens about once a week.

I’d say that this is a good product overall, but I don’t like how the issues seem to be popping up more often. The two problems I mentioned are the only ones I’ve noticed so far, but they are fairly big ones to me.",3.0 out of 5 stars

It can do all that’s in one except for playing relaxing sounds in a routine.

Hard to know if Zigbee will enjoy a renaissance or breathe its last gasp in the next few months. Unfortunately, Echo Dot doesn't seem to interact with Zigbee radios in Arduino projects.

By setting my phone screen's brightness level to minimum, I take these outside while I'm working and can listen all day without a re-charge.

Always says 'can't find ...' and mentions some totally different book or artists name (nothing like the one I requested).

The app itself only provides BASIC playing function. If I want to find some music, I need to go to other apps, like amazon music and pandora.
While I am playing music on alexa, the play control panel really works SUPER SLOW.
AGAIN, the integration between alexa app and other music apps is awful. If I am playing ""today's hit on pandora"" but now I want to play amazon music, i need to go to amazon music, select the song I want, platy it, and select the output: my phone or echo. If I select echo, the app will say CAN'T DO because the device is playing some from other app, something like this. If I play an album on echo, when the album ends, I CAN'T go back to the first song and replay the album. Simply can't. FRUSTRATING.

Lastly, I posted a video of me trying to voice control my echo. As yo can see, the power was on, but it just didnt work. I dont think reset or unplug the outlet is a good solution.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Ernesto,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2019","When you name your devices, for example the ""smart"" plugs, we have to use only 1 (ONE) simple word and avoid foreign names. It seems that Alexa is not that smart and continuously gets confused, forgets the device and tries to do something else you don't want. And when it comes to the joke that Alexa knows several languages, that's really a joke, it's knowledge of another language besides English is really limited, way below kindergarten level. Even when it comes to ""pronounce"" foreign words like in spanish, we have to ""pronounce"" it like an American would do, completely wrong, otherwise Alexa is completely null. Seriously guys you need to work a lot on this. Amazon forgot that around 1/4th of the US population speaks Spanish.",3.0 out of 5 stars
unclereuben,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2019","I ordered the new third generation Echo on Black Friday. What upset me right off the bat is that it was shipped to me in a flimsy Tyvek envelope. No extra packing for protection. As for the unit itself, it is very similar to the second generation Echo. The sound is a little bolder with more base response. The only issue, so far, is with the end of request response sound when it is switched on in settings. For no apparent reason, it occasionally blares at full volume at the end of request response. The only remedy is to turn off the end of request sound in settings. No such issue with my first and second generation Echoes.",3.0 out of 5 stars

The membership should be able to cover this and not buy Music prime. I listen different kind of music in my room and my brother different in his room.

Bill R.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2019","I bought the 3 piece bundle and here are my thoughts. The sound is decent (although overpriced) for what it is. It really needs decent bass, however, the Amazon ""sub"" is a terrible option (it's really a midrange speaker trying to push low end sound). Unless you're playing pop/dance music the sound becomes muddy. There's about a one or two second delay between the speakers when giving a command. In other words, the Echo Plus that is closest to you will listen to your command while the other Echo and Sub will continue playing music for a second or two. Bottom line... this just isn't worth the price Amazon is asking... less than half, actually. I'm returning this.",3.0 out of 5 stars

The sound quality is pretty good for such a small speaker, and I like the ""smart"" features it has. My one concern with it is that is goes offline frequently, and has to be unplugged and rebooted. I have three other Echo devices, and do not have this issue with any of those.

Eddie Jay,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2019","Enough has been written about the Echo Plus that I don’t need to go over all of its features. I will say in general that it looks cool, sounds fine (maybe a 5 out of 10 compared to real speakers), the music playing capabilities are excellent with Amazon, Apple, Pandora, and Spotify, and the voice recognition is ok - good not great. I had no problem connecting to a Phillips Hue bulb and eventually an Echo dot and a smart outlet. I use all the time to play music and radio, control lights, and make shopping lists. I bought on sale at the end of 2018 for $97.99 which I think was a great deal.

That said, I want to focus in on a four major issues that I wish I’d known about before buying:

1. Podcasts
There is no native podcast skill on Alexa so you need to get podcasts through TuneIn, Stitcher, iHeartRadio, etc. All my other devices (computer, mobile) are Apple products where I use the Podcast app to listen and sync. The podcasts I listen to are not all on any one of these skills so I would need to download all the ones I need to keep podcasts synced between Alexa and my iPhone which is too much trouble. Plus I have a heck of the time trying to tell Alexa what podcast I want to listen to - who remembers the episode titles or numbers of the podcast they are currently listening to? Even just asking it to play the latest episode of a podcast wasn’t working for me 9/10 times so I just gave up and figured I will connect my iPhone over Bluetooth when I want to continue a podcast. But that brings me to my next issue:

2. Bluetooth connections
I was successful at pairing the Echo to both my iPhone and iPad but Alexa can’t connect to the one I want when I ask it to. If I ask to “connect to my iPhone”, it connects to my iPad. If I ask it to “connect to my phone”, it still connects to my iPad. The only way to get it to connect to my iPhone with a voice command is to turn Bluetooth off on my iPad - annoying!

3. Multiple users
This is a big one. It is great that the Echo can have multiple users on it, so my wife and I can share the Echo using our separate accounts which are linked in Prime under the same household. You can even set it up to recognize each of your separate voices. However, ONLY THE PRIMARY ACCOUNT CAN CONTROL THE SMART HOME DEVICES. This means that if I want to control the lights and the Echo is set to use my account, I have to tell it to switch to my wife’s account first, then give it a command for the lights. Furthermore, you have command it to switch between accounts to use your personal skills and settings. Given that it can recognize my voice as distinct from my wife’s, I thought that if I asked to play something on Pandora, it would automatically play from my account. Nope - I need to tell it to switch from my wife’s account to my account, and then ask it to play something on Pandora. Want to turn the lights down? Have to switch back to my wife’s account. Want to play something else on my Pandora? Have to switch back to my account first. What is the point of having voice recognition if it can’t automatically detect who is speaking and use that person’s account? And what is so useful about having multiple accounts if they can’t both control the smart home devices? I can't control the smart home devices from my app, only my wife can, and I can't set up routines either. And last, there are some things I would like to be discrete to my account only - like shopping lists and reminders - but those have to be shared, so my wife’s Alexa app on her phone is getting reminders that I set up. There are some major kinks here they need to work out, but the good news is that it’s all just software fixes so GET ON IT AMAZON!

4. Routines
Another big one here. There is a well-documented glitch that people experience with Echos where the music stops playing after one song. You have to ask it to keep playing in order to keep going to the next song. If you google “echo stops playing” you will see lots of discussion around this. Well we had it happen to us as soon as we set up routines. Routines are little scripts you can set up - actions Alexa can take when certain criteria are met. This is one of the primary reasons we went with the Plus instead of the Dot. We have pets in the house and we wanted to set up a routine where the Echo would send us an alert if the house temperature got above or below a certain amount. Well unfortunately as soon as we set up the routines, the Echo started doing the thing where it stops playing after one song. So we deleted the routines and reset the Echo and the problem has not come back. But now I am afraid to set up any routines because I don’t want to deal with the music playback issue. I hope they fix this glitch because not having routines is a big drawback.

5. Alexa Guard
I was also excited to learn that the Alexa Guard feature can alert you if it hears broken glass or smoke alarm sounds. But it’s not available yet. Still waiting for that.

If I knew someone interested in buying an Echo, I would recommend they try an earlier generation Echo Dot which you can get on craigsist for $20-30 and see how you like that before spending $150 on the latest Echo Plus. Too many bugs still need to be fixed.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Ritvik N,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2020","I bought this mostly to supplant my 3rd gen Echo Dot (actually I'm moving that to another room) - also the fact that the Echo was on sale at a reasonably modest price didn't hurt either. For this price tag though, I would expect this Echo to slightly over-perform on 2 latest generation Echo Dots (as of current price, this Echo is a little over twice the cost of an Echo Dot) - does it deliver on this front though? My opinion is somewhat of a mixed bag on this. Keeping in mind I've only had this Echo for the weekend, but I certainly wouldn't say that it ""overperforms"" versus 2 Echo Dots. At best it probably has the power - in terms of speaker decibel and voice range, I suppose - of 1 and 1/2 Echo Dots. So possibly in the end I would peg it as worth 1.5 echo dots, when costwise its definitely around 2.5 echo dots. However, I think I wouldn't grade this Echo harshly purely for that reason. The speaker volume is still fine, and I'm not sure about the hearing range as that was a concern of mine going in - our house living room is somewhat sprawling, and sometimes echo dot can't hear me - but on the box I read it listens in a ""far-field"" range, whatever the heck that means, and overall I would say the hearing range is slightly improved over the echo dot. So already it recuperates on the 1 star that I would otherwise take off for its speaker - I would bring that down to 1/2 star down so far though.

The main minus point to me is the Alexa integration. This is truthfully not a problem with the Echo at all, but with Alexa itself. Alexa is still somewhat primitive, I would liken it to a conversational Neanderthal human I suppose, so it doesn't really do many useful things for me at present. Of the things it can do, it's sometimes frustrating to use it. To give a few examples:

* It commonly misinterprets what I would say, perhaps of my accent (I am to blame here I suppose, as well?) even though I have set up my voice profile on Alexa app. I've also set up voice profile of another household member, but when they confirm it with ""Alexa, do you know who I am?"" it responds with ""I'm not sure, but you're on <my name>'s account"". I understand it's a continuously learning and evolving software or something, so I suppose that doesn't really warrant any stars to be taken off at this point, at least by itself. The real kicker is it responds really stupidly to some common questions you might ask a (presumably) smart AI. For instance, we were worried our dog might have a concussion as she hit her head while running around in a dog park. ""Alexa, what's a concussion?"" got us some drawling utter rubbish about a movie or some piece of entertainment which we don't want to know. Follow this by an ""Alexa, stop that"", wait 2 more boring second, and follow that up with a slightly reworded ""Alexa, what's a medical concussion?"" and finally it spit it out a (reasonably) favorable answer. It still didn't give us a short abbreviated and useful headline though - Google on my phone had it beat in that regards. Another mildly annoying thing is it prefixed its long drawn out response with a ""here's, what I found, on <source>"". Alexa, goddammit it, it's a simple question, I don't honestly care where you find it. I suppose this might be useful in the interests of complete transparence, but often times I wouldn't care to hear it. I mean, I can just whip out my phone and type in ""concussion"" on Google and scroll to read the headline under the top result by the time she gets to the part of it that i want to hear. I would take off 0.5 stars for just Alexa being Alexa and inconveniencing me by either misinterpreting or just ignoring me when I ask her something (this happened to someone else in my household as well). Sometimes blue light goes when I say ""Alexa"" and it immediately turns off, sending everything else I say that follows the wake word into a black hole of oblivion, for all intents and purposes. I would just hope it gets a little more intuitive, and less stressful, to use Alexa voice control in the future.

* I set up an Alexa-sourced contact (in the Alexa app) and gave it the name, shall we say for an example sake, of ""Joodas"" (this is based on how you'd pronounce a name, here 'Judas'). I have an existing contact in my phone under the name ""Judas Johnson Barber Shop"" (just a fake name, but assume it's just anything starting with the key word). After I set this up, when I speak ""Alexa, call Joodas"" (again, spelled how you'd pronounce it) to call the new Alexa-sourced contact, I would expect it to follow through on this unambiguous command without requiring any confirmation of any sort - right? Unfortunately, Alexa is not very bright on this. Instead, it asks me, ""Judas Johnson Barber Shop, right?"" I'm a little pissed here, because I just created a contact that is spelled exactly how you'd pronounce 'Judas'. But Alexa, under no circumstances, will ever use that contact - it's fixated on my old ""Judas Barber Shop"" contact for some reason. So fast forward, me trying a couple things. I added an underscore to my existing phone contact, (foolishly) thinking it would stop Alexa from following the trial that really leads nowhere good. Instead, in response to my request to call Joodas, she instead prompts, ""underscore Judas Johnson Barber Shop, right?"" I'm slowly but incrementally getting a bit more pissed, and someone else suggests me to reorganize the words in the contact itself. So yeah, a little bit painful (and not my ideal solution at all), but I rename the said phone contact to ""Johnson Judas Barber Shop"". FINALLY, Alexa starts responding as expected when I say to call Joodas. However, I would note she does prompt me to confirm: ""Joodas, right?"" Yes, my dear Alexa, there is only one contact in my phone by that name, and I recently added it to the Alexa app itself (not even as a nickname, just the name of the contact itself!) So yeah, all in all, not my greatest experience - or my greatest moment either, judging from how I handled it. I would translate that to maybe 0.2 off my rating on this.

* Setting cooking timer with ""Alexa, set a timer for <duration>"" sometimes misfires, requiring Alexa to reprompt ""Ok, for how long?"". After timer expires, I realized after a while she does this weird thing where her blue light keeps glowing, and she plays some beep sound really really softly. For the life of me I can't understand why the timer alarm is so soft. I couldn't barely hear it one of the times, but luckily someone else hear it and they cancelled the alarm. I really have no clue why it's so hard to hear it, even on high volume.

* There are a few other issues that we might have experienced but I can't remember off the top my head.

Overall, I would giving this a rating of 3.8 / 5. But for fairness sake I have round it to 4 star, and also as most of my complaints are to Alexa and not the Echo device itself. For the Echo, I would also rate it as a solid 4. Most of the rating that I took off is due to its pricing as I do not believe it is worth 2.5 echo dots as it is currently. However, it's still a solid device and I suppose a little better than the echo dot that we previously had, at least. I don't really notice a huge difference, however. Still, can't really go wrong with a device like the Echo though - I would say that it does well for the features that it is touted to have. Overall, i would rate it as a ""meh"", but end up saying that in a slightly spirited and uplifting voice, so it's definitely a step up from the 3rd gen echo dot at least.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Cathy,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2019","Sometimes when you ask a person question, Echo will but into conversation and answer even though you never said ""Alexa"". She is getting better. One thing you should know if you own any Hub whether it is an Echo, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, or whatever people will hear you even if you think the speaker is off. I just think you should know that.

Personally, I feel since they can listen in on you with your cell phones what does it matter. You can always unplug, and turn off your internet. If you do research about this on the net try using .gov, .org. , or .edu websites. I learned in school these are more likely to be true.

So, why get a Hub? I love it because it makes life a lot easier. If I want to know anything, I ask my Google hub ( she knows more info because she is better with web searching than Alexa). If I want to spell something I ask Alexa (she is a better speller).

You can use any hub to ask about weather, how to cook something, games, read you a book, play music, news, turn on/off smart stuff like... plugs, lights, thermostats, TV, coffee makers, dryer/washers etc.... It can work smart cameras, smart beds. You can ask, is the back bedroom light on, They are coming out with new stuff for them to do all the time. I can't wait until they come out with a ""clean my house"" command. lol Also, you can call someone ( I often call my own phone because I lost it in the house lol ) ETC....

Please note, I do feel it is dangerous to let a smart device control locks, garage doors, cameras in your home, or anything else that might be a security threat. As you know there are a lot of hackers out there that are willing to take advantage of others. Even the cops are hacking ring door bells ( the Washington Post had written an article about it).

I own two of the Echo Plus (2nd Gen), one Echo Dot (3rd Gen), 2 Google Homes, and 2 Google Minis. Ok - I admit I went a little over board . lol

Things to know...

1. When you buy Alexa you can hook her up to your Amazon acct. I like doing that online when I am buying it.

2. However, once you get an Alexa, and plug it in at home, the Alexa will ask you about hooking up to your voice, to account. If you say yes, Alexa tries to sell you stuff a lot. Example: I asked for the price of Duct tape, and Alexa said, ""I put the Duct tape in your shopping cart"". So, I feel it's better just to hook it up online only, and not hook it up to your voice after you have it at your house.

3. Alexa can start off very buggy. However, if she is buggy after about 17, or 18 days Alexa works out many of her bugs.

4. If you get Alexa, I would recommend getting Prime membership. If you do have an Amazon Prime membership you will get a lot of songs. However, some you have to pay another yearly fee, on top of your Amazon Prime membership fee. Ouch!

5. For keeping cost down I feel that the Google is better.
Google Home gives you a lot of free stuff like bedtime stories, music, ETC. Where Alexa you have to pay for just about everything. The more stuff you get the more it will add up. An example is Alexa bed time stories are $79.99 plus tax a year if you are a Prime member. If you are not, it will cost you $99.98 plus tax. Again Amazon-Ouch!

However, if I had a lot of money, I think I would like Alexa a little bit better than Google. Tough call.

If you want to read more about the Google, and Alexa because you don't know what you want than read below. Hope this helps...

Compare Amazon Alexa hubs to Google hubs.

Google is easier to use because it understands more words, and phrases.

The Echo Plus sounds better than the Google Home. So, if you want great sound with Google Home, you might want to get a good speaker for it. The sound is really I'm All Bout That Bass, Bout That Bass (I mean it's all about the speaker quality). Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

You will find that there are some songs Amazon doesn’t have at all no matter what you pay. They are normally the rare songs. One example is Night Beach by Dream Singer.

While Google Home, works with every song out there that can be downloaded for free. Just pick a song you own from your iTunes, computer, or whatever song that you already paid for, and upload it yourself for free (easy to do, just YouTube it). After that you can create your own playlist.

Google has a lot more choices when it comes to making up routines. Google also has quiz games that you can have more than one player. Google ask you how many people are playing each time . Alexa does have quiz games, but they are only for one player unless you add MultiPlayer Skill. Even with adding MultiPlayer you have to ask Alexa before starting the game. If you don't ask Alexa in the right way, she gets mixed up.

Alexa has more brand name smart devices, but not more kinds of devices. Example: Alexa will work with an Foscam security camera, and Google will not. However, there are plenty of security cameras that work with both Google Home, and Alexa. So, they both work the same kind of stuff.

The Echo Plus (it must be the plus that has the thermostat in it) can tell you room temp. The Google doesn't do the room temp. However, you can buy a smart thermostat for your home to hook up to the Google. They both will tell you the outside temp.

Google tracks packages throw Gmail, so it can be ant package, but it is tricky to set a Google Home up to Gmail. Alexa tracks only Amazon packages. Alexa lets you know when you have a package at your door from Amazon by a lighted ring on top of the device.

I feel Alexa can be nosey, and rude. One example: Once it asked me if I had a tattoo, and I said that's a personal question. Then it asked ""what kind of tattoo do you have?"" Then I said you shouldn't be asking questions like that. Then it said that it wanted a black bird tattoo.

The point is that It assumed that I had a tattoo, and would not drop the subject. It will ask you a lot of questions if you let it, so it knows what stuff to try to sell you. I have learned to watch what I say, so there is not as much sales pressure. Also, I say ""Alexa Stop"" about two or three times in a row. That way it stops talking.

The Home Google is very polite. Also, it doesn't try to sell stuff to you. I hope Home Google stays that way.

Both Alexa, and Home Google have improved over time, and still are improving. They will keep trying to outdo each other. I do like having both of them. I hope this helps.",4.0 out of 5 stars
JacobDrJ,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2024","I bought a pair of these a few years ago to use in stereo configuration as an upgrade to my 2nd gen echo dot and 1st gen echo classic.

I never kept this configuration, as having these 2 speakers synchronize was very flakey, and when they did work, didn't provide enough of a benefit for my non-audiophile family members who primarily use these.

Instead, I split the pair up, and gave one to each kid who wanted one.

This has been fine.

Usually sound very good to our ears, and with some quirks having to do with the music occasionally going to the wrong device, mostly these have been a nice experience with a family Amazon Music subscription.

With that said, I decided to try one of these speakers for use in my office, to boost the sound from my anemic laptop speakers, using the aux-in/line-in functionality.

However, I discovered that, unlike the 2nd generation echo dot, this 3rd generation echo is very quiet when a line in aux in is inserted. You can't just increase the volume, as that would cause the Alexa functionality to become unbearably loud.

It took a long time, and support unfortunately offered no help, but I just discovered a solution from the Amazon community messageboard:

You must go into the Amazon Alexa app on your phone.
Find the device whose Aux-In is too quiet.
Go to that device's settings.
Under 'General' select 'Sounds'.
Under 'Alarms, Timers, And Notifications' increase the volume to maximum.
Go back to save the settings.

And that's it!
Now the Line In is much louder, without the Alexa functionality becoming too loud.

This increased my appreciation and utility of this smart speaker.",4.0 out of 5 stars

A,"Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2019","I'm not paranoid (famous last words). No, really, I welcome my personal assistant overlords. My family is pretty vanilla. So it only creeps me out a little when my husband and I have ""test"" discussions about things we don't talk about, don't search the internet for, and would never actually buy in a million years only to see such items pushed to us in advertising feeds. Is one of our assistants listening when it is supposed to be asleep? If so, which one? All three of the majors are in our house. Both of the cats have turned Siri on by walking across my laptop. And Alexa hears her name sometimes inexplicably. Maybe it's my husband's Long Island accent?

Or maybe it is just randomness and the assistants are functioning as advertised. Either way, I won't be getting rid of them anytime soon. The Echo Plus recognized all but two of my smart bulbs and found all of my switches and everything else that still works (old WeMo stuff went offline over a year ago when Belkin pushed a firmware upgrade and killed their wifi connections). It has controlled them flawlessly so far, and this has allowed me to free up the ethernet ports I'd dedicated to several different hubs.

My Echo devices are the ones we use most around here, both because the house runs on Amazon Prime and Subscribe and Save (I have lupus and cannot easily shop in the real world) AND because the Echos allow me to reach my teenager and tell him things whether he wants to hear them or not. He can ignore my texts and refuse to answer the phone, but Alexa lets me yell at him from anywhere in the world. (And the app lets me see his history of ridiculous teenaged boy questions - unlike Siri, Alexa is not a potty mouth and does not like it when you are.)

On the downside, Alexa won't give you suggestions if she doesn't know something. She just gives you an Elizabeth Jennings (The Americans) type, ""Hmmm,"" and a disappointed note.

The Echo Plus also seems to ""hear"" better and have fewer false activations. And the sound is better for music - by a surprising amount. So, if Alexa has a place in your home, the Echo Plus is a good way to get her. Four stars. I'd give five if the wake word were more customizable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Dispatches from Galifrey,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2020","This is our second unit, purchased for my husband's cabinet shop. After dragging him kicking and screaming into the 21st century (he wanted a new CD player), he is thrilled with not only he ease with which he can play music, but also the ability to set reminders and alarms, and to ""drop in"" on each other. The machinery in his shop makes it difficult to hear the phone, so this feature is especially wonderful when I am attempting to get ahold of him. This is also great when our phones are low, or we are busy and don't feel like using their awful speakers. The sound quality is fantastic, especially for something so small.

My complaints are that it automatically plays music it thinks is similar to requested songs when the requested song is not available instead of asking if I want to hear it (I would much prefer it asked if I would like to hear the station first), and the search algorithm leaves a LOT to be desired. I realize that this is not Google, but it should at least be better than Bing. If I were only using the search function as a basis for rating, the score would drop to a half star, but the other features more than boost the rating toward the top. Also, I wish it listened faster. I tend to speak very quickly, and she often has trouble understanding anything faster than a slow drawl.

I also purchased the Samuel L. Jackson package, and have to say that it brings me more joy than I ever would have imagined, and I can't wait to see what other voices they add. I also love all of the Star Trek functions, and get daily dumb jokes to text my granddaughter (I do NOT use the Samuel L. Jackson mode for this since she is only 11).

HipV,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2019","Received my echo 3rd Gen unit over the holidays due to an ongoing promotion. It has great sound over the Dot version hands down - good base and highs. It takes a bit of investment of your time to learn all the nuances of what Alexa can do for you. With the app, you can set up your Echo to be an alarm clock, timer, grocery list, teach it a routine for each day (like giving the weather forecast, the latest news from a specific news source, turn on/turn off lights, thermostat control, play specific music (classical, rock, pop) etc.). But beware, the instructions for all this are not included with your Echo. You have to dig around (through e-books, YouTube, etc.) to become familiar with the commands and required outcomes. For example, my unit began to display a pulsating yellow light that became annoying at night in my bedroom. I couldn’t turn it off except by disconnecting the power. Of course, this could’ve become a deal breaker if I had to disconnect every nite (I kept all the shipping package just in case I needed to return it). Well, it turned out that this was one way the Echo communicates with you. It was trying to tell me It had a notification for me to listen to. Until I asked, “Alexa, do I have any notification?” the yellow pulsating light would’ve continued. Immediately after delivering all notifications, the yellow pulsating light stopped. By the way, the notifications were about shipping/delivery of packages coming from, wait for it...Amazon. Of course, other types of notifications are possible pending how you program your Echo. Like I said, this simple issue would’ve been a deal breaker for me if I hadn’t decided to invest some of my time in trying to resolve this simple problem. It wasn’t until I learned how to communicate with my Echo that the problem wouldn’t go away. But again, the answer was not included with this product. My feedback to Amazon would be to include a list of commands and a trouble shooting section for the buyer. By employing this one simple act, I’m sure these products would be in far more demand by their customers once they learn the how to’s of communicating with these aliens.

GrinnolaAlum,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2019","Purchased this to talk to my thermostat, garage doors and listen to music. Those were my initial goals something that could help me with those basics. I also added plugs to control lamps. It works great for these functions. Setting light timers, adjusting the thermostat, putting down the garage door when I have a lot of groceries and want to keep Sparkles the Wonder Cat from escaping.

The other main function I got this for was listening to music. The sound is great. Being able to upload your music to Amazon and create custom playlists with music not purchased through Amazon is not an option. If you purchased the music through Amazon you are ok. If not you can't play that music on your Amazon Echo.

For someone like me who is married to a musician, has an extensive jazz collection that I have compiled over the years (rare CD's I purchased in local record stores and ripped onto my PC), recordings of concerts my friends (who play in various bands) have shared with me, and school concerts of my kids this is not great. Amazon did let you upload music once upon a time but no longer. The only easy workaround is to pair your smartphone/tablet/PC via Bluetooth and use it as a speaker but you can't use voice control that way so it is not a hands-free option.

On the plus side it has added features, you can now call people from your contacts that you share with Echo using the smartphone app. It has a lot of skills that you can add from the practical like controlling the garage door as mentioned earlier to the fun like having Echo purr and meow for Sparkles the Wonder Cat.

I like the Echo Plus model the best compared to the ones I have owned. This has the best sound followed by 3rd Generation Dot surprising sound for being so small, then 2nd generation Echo and 2nd generation Dot which sounds decent and easily pairs with a Bluetooth speaker. Amazon also has a trade-in program which I used toward the purchase of the Echo Plus.

Love the sound, wish it was easier to integrate music you own that is not purchased through Amazon, the smart functions work well and new features are constantly being added, so my music issues may be addressed and I am looking forward to added features.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Ian Nathan,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2020","I loved my Alexa and used it consistently for the first month. She really wet my whistle. I started dancing around the house more, singing showtunes, and giggling at my own jokes. The ""device"" was extremely easy to set up and access wherever I took it. She was a great companion and I'd show her off to all my friends. I did not elect to continue the Prime services because I didn't want my credit card charged after the initial purchase. After all, she brought nothing to our relationship like a cow or some other type of offering. Once Alexa was all warm and comfortable in my home, she announces that the free membership with Prime was over.....so she became a crusty squatter who refuses to be evicted. She began acting like a passive aggressive entitled white woman and would ignore my voice commands. I had difficulty accessing the music I wanted and she'd always give me ""similar"" music from genres that she thought I ""would like."" Even if I stumbled upon a song I enjoyed, Alexa would end my pleasure by shooting off a commercial. Just like our commander in chief, I couldn't shut the woman down during this time. Alexa believes she has a right to be heard and by God, she won't shut up! She talked right over me and would not respond to her name during these wonderful advertisements. I called her a ""b"" once and YES, she shut off immediately, so that does work (thanks Amazon)! I cannot say how disappointed I am with Alexa. She's not even that pretty and her form has begun to disgust me. Even getting free radio and other podcasts come with strings attached with Alexa. I feel like a prisoner in my own home and my guard is Lindsey Graham, who couldn't find his fat blistering belly button even with a map and a mirror. I'm considering pulling her plug because I highly suspect she listens in on my conversations. So, right now I'm holding her impeachment hearing, but I will definitely get a few witnesses before I decide her fate. I may just put a large sock over her and then I'll have a conversation piece to talk about with guests.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Gary Richardson,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2019","I purchased the unit mostly to play music. Its convenient to be able to place a speaker wherever one desires. My only frustration is with my ability to control what is playing and for how long. I admit I should have taken the many tutorials offered on the internet. However, after numerous tries, I was able to put together a playlist of Christmas music using the Amazon Music app on my phone. I was able to use this app to connect with the Echo and shuffle my playlist. Sometimes it worked and played continuous music shuffling the songs on the list. Other times, especially when we had company, it stopped playing after one or two songs. I felt I had taken the exact same steps as when it worked as expected. User error? I don't know. I was never able to use the Alexa voice control to play my Christmas playlist. It chose other playlists with music I did not want. Another thing I found is Alexa is youth oriented in its selections. Being older, when I said ""Alexa, play traditional Christmas music"", I expected Silent Night, etc., and maybe Irving Berlin, Bing Crosby and other singers who sang some of what I consider classics. Instead I got Mariah Carey and a lot of new hip hop music, all of which I hate. I tried to get Alexa never to play Mariah Carey, Paul McCartney, Brenda Lee, and others I really dislike, but was unable to stop the assault on my ears. Perhaps there is a way to be more selective without having to put together a playlist or play individual albums. When I found a song I liked, for example, Johnny Mathis singing The Christmas Song, I asked Alexa to play songs like this. I got Mathis singing non-Christmas music. Most of my critique is probably due to my age and lack of experience with interfacing with Alexa. Hopefully, I will become better as time goes on. At least I got Alexa to turn the kitchen lights on and off flawlessly. I expect to install more smart hub features as time goes by which will expand the Echo's usefulness beyond playing music..",4.0 out of 5 stars
EmTech,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2021","TLDR: These Echo's aren't built to last and by the time they fail (under 1 year) you won't have a chance but placement option with Amazon. Save yourself the trouble. But a google home mini and plug that into a pair of proper bookshelf speakers for a couple bucks more. That will last atleast 3x of an Echo and sound better.

This thing sounds great if you don't expect audiophile quality going in. But it's a fantastic living room speaker with more bass than anticipated. Quite the balanced sound.

The previous generation echo my roommate shit out on him a year after owning it. So I stepped up and was going to replace it (since we both used it a lot) and buy one with my own money. But I saw they had a newer model out for only a couple bucks more.

This model sounds a solid 20% better if I had to guess. Worth the price of entry.

But, 8 months into owning this, the voice recognition just started failing to hear more than 3 feet away. Which defeats the entire purpose of this product.

If I wanted to spend $100 on a pair of bookshelf speakers that would run circles around these in therms of sound quality I would have. They would probably be good for atleast 5 years as well.

Kip Whinkel,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2019","I originally wanted just the 3rd gen Echo Dot Plus since it had the 3.5 output jack and a really cheap price. I intended to then hook it to a stereo system get some decent speaker and a receiver and be done. At the time the dot was out of stock but they had the Echo Plus 2nd Gen. Yes its more expensive and a little larger however it still has the 3.5 output jack and I was looking for instant satisfaction. I already had half the system that I was intending to use with the Dot however I didn't have the receiver yet and I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the interconnects that I would be using. figuring what could it hurt to just see how good the quality of the on board speakers are I gave it a whirl. I am no audiophile but within reason almost everyone can tell when something sounds bad. Maybe not be able to describe why it sounds great in audiophile terms however we all know bad. Plugged it in set it up with the APP seems like I am the only one that still uses PC but I finally got logged in and setup and connected with my prime and started playing music. The quality of sound and the volume that is achieved with almost no distortion is amazing. Bass was only slightly lacking but this little thing has more than enough power to more than replace a solid book shelf system. Loud enough that anyone who doesn't want hearing damage is going to be screaming at you to turn it down when at volume 10. The thing I found odd and the reason this surprised me so much is I couldn't find any information on the wattage of the on board speakers. I still can't. I will admit I stopped searching because in the end I still bought a receiver and quality interconnects, with studio monitor speakers and a powdered subwoofer.

Plumb,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2020","I have had a full-size first-gen echo for quite awhile and been pretty pleased with it. However, this was definitely a worthwhile upgrade. It was on a sale, so I decided to take the plunge. It's shorter and fatter than my old Echo; it has a more attractive exterior, and the sound quality is enormously better, really filling in those low and mid-range frequencies much more effectively. So, as ""Echo"", it really nailed it.

Regarding the built-in Hub functionality: Complete and utter waste. I should've just bought the normal Echo instead of the Echo Plus. The built-in hub on these is a complete fail. Either commit and provide a fully functioning hub that works with all Zigbee and Zwave devices similar to the SmartThings hub, or don't bother. Or, since you're bundling it with Philips Hue bulbs, how about actually including the full Hue bridge capability in the device? The extremely limited support for the Hue bulbs is very disappointing. Overall, the ""plus"" aspects of this device feel more like a paid ""trial"" to whet your appetite for more, ultimately resulting in users buying a different (better & full-featured) smart hub and a proper Hue bridge if they are seeking either of these capabilities in their home. Shame on you Amazon. You had a chance to release a really nicely bundled piece of tech here and totally fell flat.

Final word: Buy the regular Echo and use the money you saved to buy a proper smart hub such as a SmartThings and a Hue bridge if you're interested in using the Philips Hue bulbs. 5-stars for the ""Echo"" part, but maybe 2-stars for the ""Plus"" part of this device.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Slug Jones,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019","We only owned a single 2nd gen dot and 2 3rd gen dots. I saw the echo 3rd gen was new and on sale during Black Friday weekend for $60, so I grabbed one. We wanted another echo dot but after reading and watching reviews I decided to spend a bit more and go with a full blown echo.

The echo dot 3rd gens are amazing. They really are. For $22 on sale they are especially a no brainer. The sound quality is night and day compared to the 1st and 2nd gen dot. Like twice as good regarding sound quality and fullness and how loud it can get. Alarms will actually wake you.

After watching some reviews of the new big echo here, I was sold. Now and then we use the living room echo for some music while we clean or to just goof off and dance like idiots lol. While the dot did good, why not go fuller and louder with the big echo?

Well, it’s still an amazing unit. Does all the dot does, of course. However, while the sound is fuller and louder, it’s not going to blow you away. I guess maybe I overhyped it based on the reviews I saw and their reactions, but I was a bit bummed.

Yes, absolutely it’s louder...my totally unscientific measurement would be it’s like....15-20% louder and fuller sounding (deep, more bass, higher highs etc). I’m not sure what I was expecting. Maybe I’d be happier regarding sound with the “studio” version? I don’t know. I don’t regret the purchase, though. The extra volume is welcome and it definitely does sound better with music. Happy but I believe I overhyped. If I had the money, I’d def replace the dots with the full echos. Only pluses and no negatives other than being less amazing as I had made it in my own head.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Eleanor,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2020","Just bought Echo on sale for $60 from Staples. I just needed a Bluetooth speaker for my TV and this is all they had. I was worried my Apple TV 4th generation wouldn’t pair with Amazon speaker. It does (You Just have to tell Alexa to turn on Bluetooth) and for a third of the price of the Apple speaker. The sound quality is great. Very smooth. Much better than the Cambridge Bluetooth speaker I bought a year ago and now doesn’t recharge anymore. It’s my first Amazon device so there is a learning curve. It doesn’t appear much different from Siri. I only use Siri to set the timer when I’m cooking or to look up phone numbers and I image Alexa would do the same if I ask her. I won’t trade in my Apple phone, iPad, or TV so it’s nice that Amazon is so flexible.

UPDATE: No sound coming from Alexa while paired with Apple TV this morning. Called tech support, we cleared Alexa and set-up from scratch. Still nothing. I tried a 3mm audio cord. Still nothing. I was ready to give up and to return Alexa. How sad I used her last night to play Thunder storm sleep sound to drown out annoying loud neighbors. Slept like a baby. I decide to give it another try. I went back into App clicked on Echo settings and under general found AUX Changed to Line in. HORRAY! I’m back in business. She’s working great.

Dr-Phone,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2019","I have 4 of the pluses! For the most part I like the sound of them. They sound very good. I had no issue with just unboxing the units and plugging them in! The units connected to my Wi-Fi with no issues. It does take about 45 Minutes for the Temperature sensor to come online. Then I noticed it is about 1.5F lower then all my other thermometer in the house. This looks to be the case for all 4 units. I didn’t find any way to be able to a-just them to correct the reading. They also seem to take some time to change as far as the reading. If I could give the Pluses a offset to use for the Temperature to correct them! Then I would be very happy with them. Not tried out the Zigbee hub in any of the units yet. I don’t have any devices that talk Zigbee.

I like the fact if you have 2 or more Echo Pluses! You can ask what the house Temperature is and it will then give you the average Temperature of the house.

I also like the fact I can use the
built in Temp to be able to control my ceiling fans through the Bond home fan controller.

In testing the hub some more found the following
The Echo Plus will not read Temps 32 and below. So if you want to get the temp outside on a cold winter day! This will not work.
If you have a sensor with a Humidity reading! Again the Echo Plus will not see it at all.

Dave Ohlund,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2019","I have a pair of the 2nd generation echo plus paired up with the subwoofer, and they sound great. Been using for several months, the first time setting it up was a bit frustrating because when setting up the pairing, the speakers didn't recognize each other, then the subwoofer, repeat a few times until it worked.
Was dreading having to set these up again after moving, but no issues at all the 2nd time, just changed the wifi password and it set everything up like before. Switching the speaker setup (left/right) was a couple taps on the alexa app.

I don't use it much for apps or games, mostly for music (I use amazon music unlimited, spotify, iheartradio, tunein) and it's been great so far.
My kids ask it random questions all the time, which is interesting and sometimes way more entertaining than it should be. Sometimes it doesn't know/understand and they rephrase their question (or simplify their question) and keep trying till they get an answer, other times it answers on the first question. And sometimes it 'hears' something way different than what was asked and the response is not what was expected and hilarious.

Right now there's one thing it does that's annoying the crap out of me. When playing a radio station, it will not stop playing unless I go into the alexa app and turn it off. If I say 'stop playing', 'stop', 'pause', or even tell it to play a song, it pauses for a moment, then continues to play the radio station.

Overall I give it a 3-4 star rating, I would definitely buy these again, and will most likely get the next generation model when it comes out, or shortly after and set these up in another room.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I'll not rehash that experience so Amazon will not call me again. OK if you don't have one of these Hubs they are cool and I like over Wink, GE and Hue. Hue hub I gave away but still use Wink for Zwave and Stanley locks. I run all the switches and WiFi off Alexa/Echo hub. Now I have Alexa both gen 1 and 2 hubs running. Good news this one just sync's-up and no issues so far. So why did I purchase this well for temperature sensor and most important stand alone automation when WEB is down. Temperature works great if you wish to know as she runs 1.5 to 5 degrees hotter then the room when in use especially if you are enjoying the my opinion improves sound quality. So great if you want to take her temp but a word of caution if you are running heating/cooling automation off her reading alone. As for standalone light controller when internet is out also, guess that is some enhancement as I couldn't get it to work just got the typical RED ring. Why 4 stars, 1 because it is cool, 2 because it works kind-of, 3 because I purchased it after know what gen 1 was like out of the box and 4 so Amazon won't call asking me about my review. Really is a fun great product nice new Android App update is what I use as the main driver for home automation after giving up circa 1978 X10/BSR system till a few years ago. Why not 5 stars?

ABCruz,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2019","First off, I own several Echos... from the 1st Gen to Plus to Dots. So, this is not a 'bash' Amazon or Echo review nor is this me drinking from the Amazon/Echo Kool-Aid.

This is meant more as an observation of my experience with them... culminating with the Echo Plus 2.

Echo-wise, there are no obvious functional differences in how all these Echos work.

Appearance-wise, I really like the rounded unassuming appearance of the newer Dots and the Echo Plus.

Microphone-wise, here's where there seems to be differences. In my opinion, perhaps this explains issues with Echos after the first generation.

My first gen Echo is near instantaneous in the ring lighting up and the 'listening' sound (I have all of my Echos adjusted this way so I can hear actual and accidental activations).

Every gen since then, seem to have a delay between the wake word being heard and the Echo responding by lighting the ring and making the activation sound.

As much as I enjoy the Echo Plus 2, I have factory reset, voice retrained (from a foot away and even as far as ten feet away) and even deregistered the device several times... and there is still a half to one second delay in an acknowledgement that the device 'heard' me.

Before you respond that it must be a defective device, this is my 2nd Echo Plus 2 from a completely different source... in addition, all of my Echos, after the first gen, have this similar issue.

This doesn't ruin the Echo experience for me... it just tarnishes it.

I'm hopeful that somehow, someone, someday will actually address this and/or release a firmware update (if it is a software issue) to make these Echos really, really shine!!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Raymond Ramirez,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2019","The Amazon Echo Plus is an intelligent amplified speaker that works just like all the previous Echo products but its larger size has two very good speakers, and produces great audio when playing music. The unit depends totally on the Alexa app installed in a smartphone to add ""skills"" (special interfacing apps). Since I speak mostly in English and my wife in Spanish, I set it up for both languages (U.S. versions). It is totally dependent on a good Wi-Fi connection, so if your setup is poor, improve i t before installing this unit.

One has to be careful as in anyone mentions ""Alexa"" in any sentence, it lights up and begins recording everything. So you must disable the microphone (with a button on top) if you meed to have special conversations near it.

The Alexa app does a good job of locating any device that it can control. Some may need a specific ""skill"" (manufacturer app), but Alexa found my Fire Stick, all my light switches (i lists the brands), and m Ring camera (also needs the skill installed). With a Vizio Smart Cast skill, it found my two Vizio TVs, and with a Roku skill, it found the two I have. I managed to play some of the thousands of songs I have purchased through Amazon, which is linked to the Amazon Music app, and m,y wife enjoyed saying, ""Alexa, play Yanni"" twice.

I know the potential is there for Alexa to be great and I'm looking forward to its potential. Right now every smart device works on its own, so don't expect to easily connect with your smart TV or your security system straight out of the box.

Options are limited in other areas as well. I have Alexa on my phone and I connect my phone to my car stereo, but the service from the car company forces Google apps, because of Google maps. So you have to make the choice if you want to sacrifice one option or the other.

Also, since Alexa is an Amazon product, you'd think you would have better Amazon Music benefits. Unless you upgrade to a full plan, you can only stream to one device, or one style of music to every device.

The British and Australian Alexa voices are SO much better sounding too!! , but then the voice recognition would not work because my amazon account is based in the US where i live.. is there something i am not doing right?

A. Traill,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2018","The Amazon Echo Plus 2nd Gen is perfect for my needs - I bought 2 Amazon Echo Plus & the subwoofer (check my act. to read that review). I have a large great room with 40ft ceilings and it absolutely fills my home with warm sound which can be heard throughout my house, and with the ""everywhere"" group feature I can successfully play my music throughout my home on my Echo's in stylistic fashion. I've been an audiophile for quite some time and this kind of quality for something affordable blew my mind.
I think my favorite feature is connecting this with smart home commands when paired with other devices - turning on lights, controlling my TV's, etc. It just makes everything so much simpler. I am highly anticipating future adaptability - the sky really is the limit with these devices. I would highly suggest these for your home as I have really enjoyed using them.
The only problem I've had so far is giving commands to play certain radio stations and the cursed ""I can't find (x)"" response. I really Alexa said something humorous when she can't find what I'm looking for, it would make it a lot less aggravating when I've been playing a Pandora or Amazon Music station and suddenly it can't find what I'm looking for.

Rattlesnake,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2018","Before buying the new 2nd generation Plus, I had a 1st gen Echo, a 3rd gen Dot and an Echo Show. Most of my home automation was handled by SmartThings. With the addition of the new Plus, I have retired SmartThings and am slowing trying to have Alexa handle all of my HA tasks. The major issue holding this back is that Alexa's support for sensors is brand new and not yet fully developed. For example, the new Plus has a temperature sensors built in to it. But there isn't - currently, I hope - support for simply asking Alexa what the temp is in the room where the Echo Plus resides.

On top of which the features that are currently implements don't work so well. I created a routine that was supposed to send me a notification any time the temp in my living room got below 65 degrees. Just a simple routine to test how the temperature sensor is working. It worked sort of. I would get my notification but it would usually be delivered several hours after the trigger condition had been met.

Otherwise, the new Echo Plus seems to work well. Discovering Hue light bulbs works seamlessly. The sound is much better than my 1st gen Echo, even to my ancient ears.

- Multi-processing. Right now, it only does one

The functionality of Alexa is discussed at length everywhere and is amazing. My only issue with this device is the sound quality. I think it's inherent to the design and I did anticipate this. First of all, the bass is astounding. I didn't know something this size could create that kind of bass. I'm afraid treble is another story. In order to create the 360 degree sound, the tweeter (as you can see in the product description) is pointed upward inside the device. It fires internally. The midrange radiates quite well out of the unit as reflected sound. However, the high frequencies (say, above 14khz) do not fare so well. So overall the treble slopes off quite a bit. The old Party Cube, like the Sonos One, has outward firing tweeters, so you are not relying on sound reflection for what you hear - you get the whole spectrum straight from the source, like conventional speakers. So you miss a bit of the magic of vocals, or drum high hats, atmospheric sounds and the like. Out of the box the overall tone is weighed quite a bit to mid bass. Alexa has some basic tone control (Bass, Midrange, Treble) which can help just a bit.

Overall though, the Pros outweigh the cons on this device and I'm happy to have it!",4.0 out of 5 stars
PG,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2019","Originally owner of Echo Dot 2nd gen, decided to buy Echo Plus 2nd gen because of temperature sensor so that alexa could automatically turn on/off space heater at specific temperature, after following youtube tutorials and setting everything up, ran multiple temperature routine tests & they all failed, alexa would not shut off/turn on space heater on it's own according to ambient room temperature. Later did more research on the subject and found out that lots of other people had the same issue with alexa not being able to control their equipment based on temperature.
Another thing I noticed from Echo Plus 2nd gen was that there was a 10 second delay before playing ""tunein"" radio, with echo dot 2, that delay was only 2 seconds.
And yet another annoying thing i noticed about Echo Plus 2nd gen is: while she's not playing anything if you ask her ""set volume to (a number from 1 to 10)"" she does not play confirmation sound tone so you can't know how loud she really is, on ""Echo Dot 2nd gen"" she plays that tone which is really helpful (even though confirmation sound after each normal request is disabled in settings).
So for over a $100 buying a glorified mono speaker, no matter how amazing it sounds, just doesn't make sense in my opinion.
P.S. Please note that this review is written on ""March 2019"" it is possible that Amazon may have fixed some of those issues since the time of writing this review.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Donald Woodwell,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2020","The unit works as advertised, however, I could not download the app due to network problems and using a PC to set up the Alexa app was very time consuming and confusing. Amazon's customer service brought on line a 3rd party tech support outfit called Basic Software Systems. This was supposed to be a 'free' service. The tech installed the app on the Echo unit via my PC.

The tech insisted that I need to renew my Windows 10 license & offered me three plans for 1, 3, & 5 years. I objected since such renewals are never necessary when Windows is installed by the manufacturer. However I agreed to the 1 year renewal at $150 knowing that this would probably be their fee.

As it worked out, they sent me a contract for one year of support services for the $150. This tactic is clearly a poor way to do business. With the assistance of my credit card bank's customer service rep., we both objected to BSS on the phone and a few hours later received an E-mail stating that BSS would refund the $150.

IMHO, this is one third party tech support firm that Amazon needs to drop as it reflects badly on their capability to refer customers to an honest support group.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Estoy impresionado con su reconocimiento de voz ya que puedes estar a una distancia considerable y aún así Echo detectará que le estás hablando. La calidad de sonido es excelente al igual que su precio cuando la compré en oferta ($79.99). Para mi valió mucho la pena y seguro compraré un Echo Dot y un Echo Flex para ir complementando mi casa.

Cons:
No se si es solo mi Echo pero su receptividad de WiFi es muy baja. La instalé dentro de mi habitación, a unos 5 metros de distancia del router principal que se encuentra en el pasillo y al conectarla me decía que detectaba menos de la mitad de la señal. Lo cual me preocupa porque siendo un producto Amazon esperaba mejor calidad en ese sentido. **ACLARO QUE NO SE SI ÚNICAMENTE ES MI ECHO O ASÍ SON TODOS**.

Tampoco responde a preguntas complejas o algunas preguntas aleatorias del día a día. Tampoco existe un nombre registrado para la ubicación de mi casa por lo que no me dice la temperatura correcta ni funciona la información del tráfico. *AMAZON, ARREGLEN ESTO POR FAVOR*

Denise,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2018","Let me start by saying that I have several echo devices in my home, and really, I love them. It’s great to be able to turn lights on and off by command, to play games, stream music, and do so many other things with these devices. I’m hooked.

There is one major problem, though. When I first bought my echo plus speakers, things were great. About 2-3 days later, I linked my speakers together and gave Alexa a command to stop playing the music. She hesitated, but followed through. About a week later when I gave Alexa a command to end the music, she hesitated and then kept playing the music. Um, hello, who’s in charge here? So I gave the command again, louder. Same response from Alexa. I thought, “Dang, this girl likes her tunes!” It wasn’t until I walked over to my speaker in the family room and gave the command to stop the music that the music finally stopped. Had this not happened 3 separate times, I wouldn’t bother writing about it. What’s the point in all of these microphones on this device if Alexa’s just going to ignore me and jam out to Lithium XM anyway?

If this stops being an issue, I will update my review and give a 5 star rating. Right now, though, Alexa is kind of moody.",4.0 out of 5 stars
celticprncss,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2019","This was a gift from my hubby. I love to play music all day, and am really enjoying hearing it through out the house. Listening to my favorite radio station gets terrible reception, and I'm really tired of my old CD's. So basically I've become a Pandora junkie on my Echo. The speakers are fantastic for my listening needs and I so enjoy being rooms away (like preparing dinner) and still being able to tell Alexa to turn up or down the volume.
I also check the weather daily, and like how she notifies me of a package delivery. I know that I underuse Alex's skills terribly, but for my needs she is about perfect. Oh, and my favorite classical radio station comes in crystal clear with her.
Dislikes: Alexa sometimes will not understand basic commands that I have given her before, such as a music station that I have used many times. She will say "" Sorry, I don't know that one."" So we go around and around as I try to get her to play something she has played many times before. I usually just give up. Also, when watching tv, its eerie because she seems to come to life and out of the clear blue she starts talking. Briefly, but talking gibberish. We think she might be posessed............But still, I love her. She has quickly become about my favorite gadget of all times!!!!",4.0 out of 5 stars

It is not 5 due to the multiple over-one-hour calls this took. Now the product itself gets 5-stars!!! We’ve been using the 2-Echo-and-1-subwoofer setup and it is the best! I HIGHLY recommend it!

I have always been a fan of the Echo devices, and when I heard this Echo plus I knew I needed to upgrade my devices. Thankfully the trade-in program is available. Unfortunately, my experience was horrible. I sent in the three eligible devices I had to get their respective upgraded version using the advertised 25% discount. After the devices were received and inspected by the trade-in team, my discount was available. I placed all 3 items in my order but the discount only applied to one. I called in, thinking this was an error and I was told I needed to play 3 separate orders for each discount to be applied. I placed my first order and it worked, but the discount did not apply afterwards. I called in again, and apparently I was misled. Now I do not have my old devices and I only was able to get ONE upgraded device. If I knew this would happen, I would have sent each device individually for an upgrade.

Plum Crazy,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2019","Having purchased Amazon's first generation Echo device, and it being Amazon Prime Day and all, I felt the need to upgrade to the next iteration, hence this Echo device. At first blush it's smaller than the original (not as tall). The sound quality appears to be better, although I did not raise the volume to see if it would fill the room, but as I said it appears to be better quality. I'm not all that pleased with the cloth exterior, waiting to see how long that lasts. Amazon has done away with turning the ring on top to increase or decrease volume, now they have buttons to push. Of course, you can always direct Alexa to lower the volume, but I found it easier when I was next to the device to give a quick twist when the phone rang, which was also near the device. Two upgrades I noticed is that Alexa can whisper on this device. Second upgrade feature, with a subscription, you can have all of your devices playing music throughout the house. Without the subscription, only one device can play at a time. Hopefully in the future Amazon will do away with the subscription. All-in-all, this Amazon Echo does everything and more that you come to expect from Alexa. I highly recommend this as a gift or to add to your home.",4.0 out of 5 stars
A,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2020","I bought this specifically for the Zigbee hub functionality so I could integrate my security cameras and some smart lights to make my porch lights function as motion lights. It works fairly well in that respect, but there are some annoying quirks. For instance, if I set up a routine for something to happen only based on time I have the option of using sunset and sunrise as the start/end times, but if I set up a routine for something to be triggered by something else (like motion on my camera) I can only choose set hours as the start and end times. It’s not the end of the world, but I want to be able to have a routine triggered by my camera AND use sunrise/sunset as the start and end times so I don’t have to adjust multiple times through the year.
As far as general voice control of the device I would again say it works, but annoying at times when it sometimes requires super specific language to understand what you want.

THANOS S.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2020","I like the fact that the sound is OK for everyday use, Alexa integration is ok, voice recognition is better than other platforms (for my accent anyway). One BIG complaint is that I want an Ethernet (wired) port on these devices. I'm willing to pay MORE to have Ethernet vs WiFi. There are spots in the house that WiFi is not that great and I do prefer less ""wireless"" devices in the house. I love the SONOS with Alexa (they support both WiFi AND Ethernet but the Alexa integration is not complete (you can 'drop' in another alexa device for example). So, that Ethernet port is a star less for me. For others it may just be irrelevant (it would be for me if I didn't have wired ethernet in most rooms...) So, anyone listening in Alexa labs?? Add an ethernet port or a usb dongle-to-Ethernet please. Now, if only that Ethernet port supported PoE... (wow).

It is super awesome to have in my home, and has basically given music back to me. A thing that I had lost. I wonder how well it would transmit a high quality audio feed to a timer? It controls my entire house from the center of home. It picks up on my voice easily from far away even when I'm not loud. Mostly. Sometimes it's a bit finnicky just a little bit when I use the word Alexa. So I have to repeat it different ways getting louder with frustrated voice, then it picks up. It does get a little confused with other Alexa voice box things, but it does not do poorly. I am becoming more hands free each day. Yay. Thanks Amazon. The most frustrating part about this item is the lack of volume choices. And absolutely the Alexa voice responds to you using whatever voice you have the music at. Now that alone is the loss of a star. The lowest setting is also a bit too loud regardless, and many of the nightime sound choices may keep you awake instead of creating a sleep scenario.

GOOD-
- sound is great
- voice recognition is pretty good, sometimes frustrating
- basic timers, alarms, music, etc. work easily
- can use as external speaker. We use a line-in to use it as a speaker for our digital projector.

BAD-
- there are SO MANY ‘offers’ that are incredibly annoying. We’ve told Alexa to ‘stop’ ‘turn off’ or ‘shut up’ so many times because of this.
- the Alexa app has a lot of confusing menus and settings. I can never remember how to find things on it. I’m not old either!
- sometimes turns off for no reason
- ‘mis-hears’ things often, which is sometimes funny and sometimes annoying

Bottom line- because we already have it, we use it, and I’d probably get an echo dot at some point, but I won’t be happy about it...

Thomas Saulnier,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2020","I picked this up for a couple of reasons. One is that it has an internal temp sensor. The home hub is the other main big draw for me. I love how the music sounds playing on this in my living room. I'm not in a large area, the apts are close together so I don't need it very loud and this fills in more than well enough to jam on 5/10 so I bet 10 is pretty loud, but I can't speak to quality at the higher levels. It was easy to program the Phillips Hue lightbulb that I got in with this as a bundle and now the light automatically comes on slowly when I arrive home. You can do a lot of things with this device, and there are walkthrough guides to learn to program Alexa(Echo) I like calling it Echo, as I don't find saying orders to a human name to be natural. Only minus is that sometimes there is lack of recognition in hearing me (not much they could do if music is playing esp - but if your phone is handy you can use the app to pause play pretty easy), but that's pretty standard for devices so far.",4.0 out of 5 stars

this is really not an issue with me,as i have an unlimited data plan. For someone without one, id research it before buying one.
sometimes responds to the tv or background noise, but the mute button comes in handy there.

I have found that Alexa has an incredible sound system, even at 5% it seems it is blasting away. And the headphone jack is fantastic, in a home of multiple people in the house listening to stuff on their devices. I don’t always work in bright lights. I don’t like the fact that you have to have a light on and wear glasses to see the buttons. The Alexa has a yellow, ring light the keeps coming on periodically, which gives the impression that I am being listened to, kind of creepy. When I ask Alexa about I don’t get an answer.

Generally, I am very pleased with the administrative aspect of Alexa. It has done a nice job of syncing calendars, reminders, etc. as well as giving me a sense that more than one device can be used for Alexa, i.e. television.

They can be set up through bluetooth, but not in stereo -- just one speaker at a time.
Most of the music I wanted to play, however, I have in my AMZ library. These do very well at accessing and playing those and will play in stereo. Perhaps that's the type of business synergy they are looking for.
They sound great for such small speakers.
One of them -- the ""lead"" -- needs to be unplugged and plugged back in a lot to reboot to connect. Not sure what that's about.
Also, I don;t know why it's so hard to find out the length of the cord.

GN,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2019","The devices and the Alexa app seem to get confused in any configuration that isn’t absolutely simplified. Example: stereo configurations create systemic confusion between two units that are both listening and trying to respond appropriately. And once they become confounded their cloudy “thinking” just piles on and they become inert. Second example: multiple room groups also cause competing responses. Last example: I have not figured this one out yet but the Alexa app has a bug that has actually reactivated Amazon Music after I stopped playing music and had closed the app. This became a problem when after closing Amazon Music and trying to play Pandora, Alexa jumped back in (even though it was closed) and restarted Amazon Music and didn’t let me stream Pandora from the same iPad.

I’ve had two Echo Plusses replaced - and this was recommended by an Amazon service person who said it was a software glitch.

I've integrated it with Phillips HUE standard white and Feit color light bulbs and with no problems. I can't get to the full spectrum of colors from the Feit bulbs unless I use the Feit app. It appears, from reading, that if I put in Phillips colored lights and want the full color spectrum that I would still have to purchase a Phillips controller - one of the main reasons I purchased the Echo Plus instead of an additional Echo Spot. It does integrate very easily with my Honeywell thermostats. Nice to have voice control over the home heating/cooling system.
The voice recognition is excellent and I can even be heard from other rooms if necessary.
My only advice to those planning on doing home automation is to read documentation and do planning before jumping into it.

Dan Johnson,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2019","Overall I love this product. Comparable sound quality to other similar priced and size products (JBL Pulse). The main issue for me is I already had a 3rd gen dot. I specifically wanted to buy another Echo product to pair for stereo and have some bass. Originally, I was going to get another dot and the sub. However I grabbed this Echo when it was on sale $60! The sub seems overpriced so I had hoped this would pair with the dot and give me the low end that I needed. I searched everywhere to see if an Echo and a dot would pair and could not find an answer! I had hoped that since both were the newest generation they would pair. NOPE! One workaround, you can play both simultaneously in the same room if you setup multiroom sound. However, the two will still not be stereo which pisses me off. AMAZON please fix this glitch. Why on earth can you not pair ANY two Echo products? Especially the same generation models? So can a Echo and an Echo+ not be paired either?",4.0 out of 5 stars
Detrick,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2019","Not much of a value at $149.

Sound quality is mediocre, significantly behind Sonos at $199. The built-in hub is very limited with Philips Vue bulbs - can set only 15 colors instead of 16 million. Settling on a difference of more than a million to one is difficult. Decided to keep the Echo Plus, but purchased two Sonos, which do not contain hubs and are limited in their own right with Alexa due to being third-party units (i.e. no drop-in feature, nor ability to be part of multi-room music.)

The main takeaway is the $29 Amazon Echo Dot is a fantastic value with good overall acoustic performance, whereas the Echo Plus is not. The extra cost for the improved speaker performance is not worth it, and the partially useful hub makes little sense. So if money is less of a concern, order one. But if you are on a tight budget, consider the Echo Dot without a built-in hub and only a marginal drop in acoustic performance.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Asking for the weather/traffic is great and to play certain songs is easier than pulling out a phone/mp3 device. Other than these, not really worth it. I'll ask questions that I would usually pull out my phone and google, Alexa can't answer them 90% of the time. Very irritating. Could of saved time just pulling out my phone to begin with.

bill hyland,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020","The new Echo seems to do everything as well as my Gen 1 unit, but the new speakers provide deeper bass.

The one difference I didn’t see as an improvement was that changing the volume manually on the new unit is done by pressing a + or - button instead of turning the rotating ring used on the Gen 1. Using these buttons, especially in the dark, is a hit or miss proposition, especially since there are 4 of them, all the same size, so no way to distinguish by feel. The ring was not only more intuitive, but I always got the desired result. I know that volume can be adjusted by voice, but then you can’t hear the program material as Alexa changes the volume. This is a minor complaint, more of an observation.

One thing I really like is being able to synchronize playback on both units. I will probably add a third unit to get music (or whatever) playing throughout the house.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I wanted to also keep the sound quality of the system. I have a few Dots at my full time house so I am familiar with Alexa and the AI features. This speaker worked out great. The sound quality is high and I can put it out on the back deck or front porch (it does require power but I do have outlets). Because it is Bluetooth capable, I can connect it to my iPod - yes, I am old school - and also my laptop. I can get all of my favorite radio stations because almost every station now has internet capability. And, I can connect it to my Sirius/XM app without having the antenna.

While we use it often in our kitchen, know that it is not high end quality sound - what do you expect from one small speaker. It is plenty good enough for an enjoyable listening experience, especially for background music while working/cooking. In comparison, the Echo dot sound was just too poor quality to enjoy without hooking up an auxiliary speaker and so we only used it occasionally.

Nia,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2019","I upgraded from the 1st Gen Echo which we had in our home since it's release in 2014. I immediately noticed the improvement in sound quality, mainly in more bass. The down side is that I also noticed that the 2nd Gen has trouble hearing or understating some things which the 1st Gen did not. Both version have 7 microphones built-in, so I can't figure out why we sometimes have to speak louder for the 2nd Gen model to hear or understand us...? For instance, my son's name is ""Kellen"" and I have a room light plug under his name and a playlist for him on Amazon Music, but Alexa for some reason can't understand the name and keeps saying I can't find ""Calvin's Playlist""...?

I assumed that I would have an easy process to move zigbee devices from my old plus to the new one like a one click transfer in the app, but no it’s no easy or simple to move zigbee device.

For example, I wanted to monitor humidity in a part of my house and set up routines to respond to changes in humidity. So I bought a temperature and humidity sensor that was zigbee certified. But the echo plus would not see the humidity! I spent over an hour on the phone with amazon tech result. Bottom-line: the echo plus will not read humidity on any zigbee sensor.

I had questions in setting it up and the customer service technician was extremely patient and knowledgeable in walking me through the process. We had questions about privacy and compatibility which were answered to our satisfaction. Using the Echo, even with our low-bandwith situation, has been quite good although the music has stuttered at times. We have no plans for adding more devices at this point, so I can't comment on that aspect or whether a newer generation Echo would be better for such use.

Circuit Breaker,"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2019","This speaker, after the Gen 2 echo, didn't blow my socks off. It sounds great, but then my gen 2 sounded very good also. I also have a pair of gen 2's grouped as a stereo pair, grouped also with an Echo Sub. I wouldn't even consider replacing those Gen 2's with Gen 3's. With the Sub doing a bunch of the system's work, the system sounds great to me already. So if you're buying new, get the Gen 3 for sure (not a used or refurbed set of Gen 2s) If you have Gen 2s, you probably should keep them. Unless you are a toy boy like me!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Chris_in_MA,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2018","Short & Sweet - For what it is, this device is amazing. Performance is quick, audio is great, and the built-in Zigbee hub works quite well.

Longer Review;

After dragging my heels for over a year, I finally bought our first Echo (2nd Generation) back in August. I loved it so much that I got us 2 more for other areas in the house. Being able to group them and play the same music or audio throughout the house is a novelty that won't grow old for me. I've only wished that they had a little more full sound, especially at higher volume. I'd considered the last Echo Plus, but the average of reviews I read didn't make it appear to perform significantly better than our already great 2nd Generation Echos.

When I saw this new Echo Plus listed, I pre-ordered it to ""replace"" the Heather Grey Echo in our kitchen and move that one to our bedroom. We tend to have music playing in the kitchen more than any other room, and I wanted slightly better sound than the regular Echo in there. I'm honestly glad we took a chance on this device without any reviews to go by.

Appearance;

As you can see in the photos, it's pretty much identical in height to the 2nd Generation Echo. It is a bit wider to accommodate the larger speakers, and the top is slightly domed instead of being flat. A similar 7-microphone array is on top and they seem to work just as well. There also appears to be a tripod-style connector on the base of the unit.

Setup;

Setup was surprisingly easy as this Echo Plus detected our network settings on its own. I plugged it in, it did its initial startup, and then told me the device was connected. Simple as that.

Audio compared to 2nd Generation Echo;

Highs are clearer.
Mids are more natural and better-defined.
Lows are deeper.
Overall volume is noticeably louder and sound quality is improved.
When paired with our other Echos, music and audio is in sync everywhere and this device stands out above the others in audio performance.

General Performance;

We have a quick network and I don't notice any perceivable performance difference between this new Echo Plus and our regular 2nd Generation Echos. Everything seems to work as it should.

I bought this with the ""free"" Philips Hue bulb promotion. This bulb is our first Zigbee device and works very well with the Echo Plus. It is easily controlled by either the Echo Plus or the other Echos we have in the house. I'll be keeping an eye out for deals on these bulbs in the future. Like our other Echos, it also has no problem controlling our Kasa Smart Plugs.

Overall;

While $150 is a lot for a single speaker, for what I was looking for, this thing excels. If you like the 2nd Generation Echo but hoped it sounded a bit better, I would highly recommend this. Based on what I've read, if you were disappointed with the audio performance with the 1st Generation Echo Plus but want everything else it had to offer, consider giving this wonderful speaker a try.

P.S.: The internal ambient temperature sensor seems fairly accurate and nice to have included.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jazzyguy,"Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2019","I bought this speaker on a whim. I'm already the owner of a couple of Echo Dots. I have one paired with a Samsung sound bar in my living room. I had the other connected to a Vaux speaker in my bedroom. I was fine. I didn't need to buy the Echo Plus. Or so I thought.Yesterday, my girlfriend bribed me to go shopping with her at an outlet mall by telling me I could have free reign in the Bose store located there. I was pretty impressed by the Bose Home 500. Great bass. Exceptional stereo separation. Very large price tag—even the factory referbished model which I was considering buying. Ultimately, the price tag, as well as some unresolved questions I had concerning compatibility with other devices caused me not to purchase the Bose speaker. But it did get me to thinking. Could I get more premium sound in my bedroom? Could I get better sound out of my Amazon Fire enabled TV?Initially, I planned to buy the Echo Plus directly from Amazon, but I elected to buy it from Best Buy, because I would've had to wait for three days for Amazon to ship it to me. We do live in an age of instant gratification, don't we?I got the tiny Amazon Plus home, unboxed it, and had basic setup completed within two minutes. Following that, I paired it with my Amazon Fire enabled TV, and I started putting the speaker through its paces.Overall, the sound quality is very good. Not exceptional, but very good. The bass is punchy and loud. The stereo separation is underwhelming, but the quality itself almost makes up for that. With a little tweaking of the bass, mid, and trebble settings, I was able to get the speaker to sound more than acceptable at all volume levelsAfter playing with the TV a bit, the next task was to add the speaker to my media groups. Nothing could ever have been simpler. I then set about pairing the Plus with my outdoor speakers—a pair of Sound Appeals which I also bought from Amazon. Again, almost too easy. Then I paired the Plus with the water proof bluetooth speaker I use in my shower. Easy again. Best of all: The plus automatically connects to the TV and the additional speakers whenever I turn them on.My next task will be to pair the device with the free smart bulb I received with my purchase. I anticipate no problems.Bottom line: Great sound and easy and versatile connectivity for a great price. I could not be ghappier!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Homer,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2018","I am a huge fan of the Echo. I have the tap, the dot, the standard Echo and an Echo smart speaker, and now the plus.

This one is definitely a step up. The best sound and response of all the previous models.

In a nut shell
The dot is ok. Limited quality sound but small and unobtrusive. Nice for a bedside alarm, weather information and morning news while shaving.

The tap is the portable and battery powered option that I use in the morning. I listen to a streaming cable news show. I listen to it while in the shower, (it is not waterproof but I have a shelf far from water that it sits on), then while I shave, and I put it in the closet while getting ready and dressed. It's like a portable radio but it allows me to stream internet cable and listen to anything I want.

The standard Echo and Echo with smart options is a great device. The addition of the smart features is ok. It allows you to turn on lights and fixtures, but going into a dark room and saying, ""Alexa, turn on lights!"" is not as easy as flipping a switch. It is ok for lights that are not near the bed and your heading to sleep. But, you'll wake people up by shouting the wake up command.

This one is good for two reasons:
1.) The sound is great. Better than the others.
2.) I got a smart switch and can use it to turn on any number of devices. The hook up was easy and flawless.

Also,
Alexa is adding new skills. If you use a sound machine, she has a sound maker for sleeping. Wake up to the weather, the stock market, the news, a fact from history, and a joke of the day.

If you are on the cusp of buying this device, making this your first Echo would be a great choice. If you have an Echo or tap, this is a good upgrade.",5.0 out of 5 stars
J. C. Lindy,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2020","I love having my Echo in the kitchen where I can listen to music (great speaker quality including bass!), podcasts, baseball games or news. I have used it to remind me of important meetings, check the weather, and of course, check the progress of ordered Amazon items. I also have 4 Echo Dots and an Echo show in the the house and it's been very nice to be able to link them and play music all over the house while I am cleaning or check in on the grandkids playing upstairs and call them down for dinner. It is also linked to our Ring doorbell which is very helpful because we have the system but no extra chimes so it alerts us through our iPads and phones which sometimes are set on mute and so fail to alert us of someone at the door. The Echos are much better for that, and that skill was easy to enable. We bought one for our mountain cabin, and I even talked to my husband there from home without a phone, because the Dot there is connected to our account. We can also listen for any activity there. My Echo Dot in the patio room helped me when I was accidentally locked out of the house without my phone. Luckily the patio window was open so I just called through it to Alexa to call my husband to come back to the house to let me in. I keep thinking this would have so helped to have when my father-in-law was alive. We tried to get him to wear a life alert after a few dangerous falls, but could never convince him. We could have set him up on internet (which he would never want on his own) linked a few dots and if he fell, if he could still speak, he could call us, OR we could check in on him and if he didn't respond, we could call for help. I mention this in case someone reads this who has an elderly relative who is resistant to using those other systems. Overall, I love the Echo Devices and find I am discovering more and more helpful functions they perform.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2019","Pro bundle with Sub Overview

Pro: Quality Built, Quality Sound, Functionality, Small form factor, Volume (low and high), Perfect amount of Base

Cons: Connecting all three to act like a system is finicky and dosen't work when you set it as an alarm. Only will play off one so you miss out on some of the rich sound when waking up. But a plus since it isn't as loud.

Long Review:
I have to say these are amazing. I have had a lot of amazon products and these surprised me the moment I started them up. First off these get loud for their size and the audio clarity is amazing. They are crisp, clear and sound amazing. Now if you like heavy heavy base then these aren't the speakers for you. I bought the package with 2 speakers and the sub and they are perfect for me. The base is well controlled and gives the sound that is lacking in many speakers but if you want the base to shake the walls and make it sound like a floor speaker with a 12 inch amplified drum then don't try. But if you are looking for a clean, rich, bold and sophisticated listening experience then these are amazing. Much better than anything I have tried in the $350 price point.

If you want something that is loud, base heavy with good high and mid tones better than this then look at spending 700 or more. I listen to everything from classical music to EDM, Rock, rap, pop, country, jazz and folk and these just keep impressing me. The vocals aren't drowned out and you can hear all the instruments and the base fills in the lows at the perfect listening experience.

Summary: If you are looking for rich, deep, bold music this is the set for you. Better than anything in the 350 to 450 market. (I have tried 20 in this market) If you are looking for wall pounding, rave quality base then you better live on your own or in a frat house cause more than this you will need a floor speaker with amplifier and thick walls. PS I own a full amplified speaker set housed in my living room for when I was in college and a fraternity. Nothing against them but horrible for all day listening and having friends over to talk and not drink all day haha

Note: I have both echos and the sub in my bedroom and the room is too small for all 3. I barley raise the volume past level 3, maybe 4 if I am listening to them in the shower. I moved them to my living room for the pre and post Superbowl party and they filled a medium 4 bedroom 3 bath house with crystal clear music.",5.0 out of 5 stars
James Aldrich,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2019","Hello All,

I received my Echo Plus on October 7th. It was so easy to set up for the most part. I plugged it in and in a few short minutes, it was online ready to play! The sound for its small size was awesome~! I wouldn't think one would want much more than that right? I purchased this unit since I wanted Alexa to speak the indoor temperature. I tried saying or doing a number of things but the indoor temperature eluded me. I imagined having a device which wouldn't need outdoor wired or wireless probes with batteries. I would already have accurate outdoor temperature info as well as the indoor temperature and no need for probes of any kind. I think I spent hours trying to get the indoor temperature to speak with Alexa. I could go into the Alexa App select the echo plus and read the indoor temperature through my phone, So why couldn't she speak the indoor temperature! I learned later that a sensor had to be activated. It's a shame that Alexa couldn't have activated the Sensor. An Amazon help person tried to tell me what I needed to find but I think I was dealing with graphics. I am totally blind and use voiceover on my IPhone. I couldn't find the sensor or anything else to activate the indoor temperature so it would speak. I watched some youtube videos but none of these helped. Perhaps I'll approach disability services to see if they know of a solution to this! I deregistered the echo plus from my account and put it back in the box. If I can't find any solution for finding the sensor and turning on the indoor temperature, the echo plus is heading back to Amazon. I'll stay with my tried and true echos.

Jim

I am happy to say that I didn’t send my Echo plus back after all! I removed it from its box before registering to my account again! At first, I couldn’t see the indoor temperature on my phone. I planned to call disability services. Four hours later, I checked my phone after selecting the Echo Plus and saw the indoor temperature again! I thought I’d get brave and ask Alexa to give me the inside temperature. I said, echo, temperature inside! She spoke it to my relief! I also said, Echo, inside temperature. She repeated it again! I was pleased! Something may not have been right in the first registration or I wasn’t giving her the right verbage! I don’t know what happened for certain! I didn’t have to activate anything! It worked right away! I didn’t call disability services. My wife has ordered another one which will be used upstairs!

Long live the echo plus! Hope this or another generation of the echo plus with built on in hub will be available for a long time! The indoor temperature is an excellent feature!

Alan,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2019","Sound Quality is an improvement to the 2nd gen echo. After about 2 weeks of moderate usage at 60-70% volume the speaker has sounded better than it did day one, as most speakers need time to break-in.

Comparing it to the 2nd gen echo you can definitely hear a difference. There is a bit more low end compared to the 2nd however, I find the mid range to be more refined on the 2nd gen as the 3rd gen has more low end and high end sound.

To get this straight. This speaker isn’t meant to provide room filling rich sound as it is only a single firing 3 inch woofer and a tweeter enclosed in a compact plastic housing. If your looking at rich sounding sound docks, bose soundtouch 20 or 30 would fulfill that much better and even though those are more room filling as well, audiophiles will still find it much suited to having an actual speaker and amp setup. I myself am considered an audio snob and I love playing around with audio equipment.

I’m not going to compare the echo to a proper 7.2.2 channel setup but compare it to speakers in its class. Being that this is an Amazon Alexa Device it is a very useful tool in addition to your smartphone. I currently have 6 echos throughout the house and they do what they are supposed to do and that is having voice commands for lights and even notifications for your ring system as well as other smart devices you link to your Alexa account. Having the ability to connect Bluetooth to your phone is great as well if your not looking for a portable battery powered Bluetooth speaker.

My main reason for purchasing this echo is the new speaker which attracted me to purchasing this and I mainly use it only in the kitchen as having background music and being able to control lights and sound while working on other things. Sound is great for the kitchen and it is plenty loud enough with very balanced sound and I find the bass to be good for it’s size. I would like to put my bose soundtouch in the kitchen but it takes up too much room and I can just place this in a corner and it’s compact enough that you won’t have to worry about knocking it over. However I have setup my echo dot onto a sound dock and linked the multi room audio so I can have music playing through Apple Music in all rooms through the echos which I think is what sets this speaker apart from let’s say the much more expensive Sonos or Bose Soundlinks. Only downside I wish I could do is have Bluetooth work with multi audio instead of having to play playlists or through other streaming services on the echo.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Shmooty,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2020","Originally, I bought an Echo dot a few years ago to help in the kitchen by providing a nifty way to set multiple countdown cooking timers. Then during Quarantine this year I read an Amazon article about hue wireless bulbs and I thought ""how cool is that"". So about $700 and 8 bulbs, one lamp, a bridge, and a full size echo later, I had what I thought was the beginning of a cool home automation system. Instead I was in line for one of the worst experiences of my life and something that cost me over $1,000 before I realized what a total waste of time and money it was, not to mention the added aggrevation that I'm overall trying to eliminate from my life, not add.

First, upon receipt I created all these routines to let me easily turn on various lights at various colors or hues with a simple voice command. I though it was wonderful! Then, over time, Alexa stopped understanding me, so I would have to repeat myself a few times just to turn on the damn lights. It got to the point where I was thinking how nice it would be to simply use a light switch; not to mention losing my temper at a friggin box of bolts!

Then today the Alexa app disconnected from all my devices for absolutely no reason at all. After not being able to resolve this problem, I called Amazon and this wonderfully helpful person in India who could barely speak English told me that I would have to delete all my routines and re program them from scratch.

So I did that and an hour later, everything worked. Right up until I wanted to go to bed, when none of the lights in my house would shut off, and I discovered that once again all my devices had disconnected from the Alexa app for no reason at all.

So this time I did what I should have done months ago. I disconnected and threw away all the wireless bulbs I had purchased, along with all my Amazon Echo devices, save one that I will keep in the kitchen to help with cooking timers.

Otherwise, don't waste your money on Amazon devices because Amazon Alexa is total crap. Doesn't work. Never will.

And by the way - did you know that these Amazon devices record snippets of what you are saying every few minutes whether you want that or not? Everything you have said either to an echo or not to an echo is recorded and available for you to see in the Amazon app. The purpose of Amazons echo devices are not to help you do anything, they are a way for Amazon to violate your privacy by getting a microphone in front of you 24x7.

J. W. Dietrich,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2020","Been using Cree Dimmable LED Light Bulb for about 4 years now without any problems. Wink Hub 2 started to have lots of problems and then have switch to a paid monthly fee service. So dumped Wink and bought the Echo Plus hub.

Went through the reset procedure on all bulbs and linked them to the new Echo Plus hub. Was able to reset and link two bulbs in ceiling fixtures at the same time. To unlink the Cree bulbs from the old Wink 2 hub need to reset the bulbs. Reset procedure is to switch bulb off wait 2 seconds then on 2 seconds (or so, sometimes took longer) until when switching on the bulb blinks. They say 4 cycles but some bulbs took many more cycles before it blinked. Once it blinks wait a little bit and then turn off, then have the Echo Plus discover new devices and when it says to turn on new device switch the bulb back on. Bulb will dim a couple of times when Echo Plus finds it.

Nice thing is the Echo Plus doesn't need a smart phone to find or control linking.

Just use the Amazon Alexa app on a PC and create groups and assign bulbs to a group with a name that makes sense, bulbs can be assigned to many groups or even be a single bulb as a group. The Alexa app calls each bulb as first bulb, second bulb and so on... creating groups using whatever name you decide makes remembering what a light is called easier. And response time is much quicker, seems like instant so far. Much better then the Wink 2 hub.

Just added two Innr Zigbee Smart Plug and linking was very easy.

There is an app for smart phones from the Amazon store but my smart phone is too old to install that app. Supposedly that app will give greater functionality to the Echo Plus hubs.

With the Wink hub was able to set up scenes that set groups of lights to desired brightness with a single command ""turn on movie"" with Echo Plus now say ""turn on movie 10%"". I created a group that includes whatever lights I want on for watching TV. If other lights are also on I just say ""turn lights off"" then say ""turn on movie 10%"".

But then again with the Wink hub couldn't say ""turn off movie"" because it was a scene that turned lights to set levels so couldn't use same command to turn the scene off. With Echo Plus hub can say ""turn off movie"" and those lights turn off.

Sound wise... I really didn't buy it for sound quality but it does sound much better then my Dot playing through a small portable battery powered Bluetooth speaker. But I was impressed about how much clearer music sounded from it. But then again I'm not the best person to say anything about it's sound quality since that small Bluetooth speaker seemed ok to me before this.",5.0 out of 5 stars

One thing I do like about it is being able to switch off the power to it (unplugging it) so that it's not using WiFi bandwidth unnecessarily (like at night). It reconnects to WiFi the next time we power it up without any resetting. Alexa tells us when we have a package delivered. ""Alexa-what are my notifications?"" I love the ""dictionary"" feature. ""Alexa-spell concede"" (hint, it's not conceed). The sound is very good. But, it's only as good as the digital content it is receiving and playing. I have heard a couple of songs where the sound or song might have been just a little off but I expect that may happen on a Gen 2, Gen 4 or ""Studio"" device. I don't believe it's our actual device. We keep it in the kitchen on the wooden table so the bass really ""pops"". The ""360"" sound is fine I guess. I have not heard the 4th Gen or Studio play. Ours still seems ""directional"" but I guess that is because no matter where we are in the kitchen the sound is the same, hence, 360. Overall, we really like it. Maybe one day we'll sign up for ""Unlimited Music"" but not now. I would recommend this product, if you can find a new one. We bought ours at Lowes on sale. It would be nice if Amazon had a location or some way one could go to a place in person and ""try out"" the different devices. After all, they are ""Audio"" devices and having the different models on hand to ""hear & test"" is important. I read a lot of reviews of others ""testing"" and decided that we'd go with a 3rd Gen and not the 4th. But nothing beats standing right there and listening. I remember the days in Los Angeles where you could go into a record shop and ""spin"" or play a ""45"" before you bought it to see if you liked the A AND B side. What do you say Mr. Bezos, you've got the funding for that. Can you make that possible? I really don't like the ""buy & return"" mode of testing. Is that good for the ""carbon footprint""?

Here's why:
There are thousands of reviews for this product so I'll keep this brief. I am a self admitted Amazon Echo product nerd. With at least one device of some type in every room of the house (yes including the bathroom). I even echo devices outside so, as you can tell, I am ""all in"" when it comes to the Amazon Echo ecosystem. Recently, I found myself having to repeat the wake word to my first generation Echo Plus multiple time and also started experiencing some smart home weirdness so I decided that it was probably time for an upgrade. Don't get me wrong, my original Echo was still working, and working well, it had just started to show it's age. I ordered this 2nd gen Echo Plus and like everything else, it arrived on time with no issues. Let me tell you, after installing this, I could have kicked myself for waiting so long. The difference is honestly like night and day. Everything and I do mean EVERYTHING is vast improvement over the 1st generation. In the past I've whined about missing the turn top volume control from the original Echo devices, but for some reason, on the echo plus, I didn't miss it at all. I could not have been happier with the way it seamlessly took over the smart home control from whichever devices were still using the 1st generation and not my 2nd gen Echo Show which also has a built in hub. It also seems to issues commands to my smart home devices A LOT faster than my old echo. The voice prompts are so much better. I now can say the wake word once and know that it heard me. Again, I really wish I would have upgraded sooner. As for my old Echo Plus? No, it's not being retired to the old tech graveyard that a lot of us have now (also know as a box in the garage, basement or attic). It's already found a new home in our backyard gazebo :-) If you have a 1st gen Echo Plus or you what to get your feet wet in the smart home world without the expense of a 2nd generation Echo Show, I definitely recommend getting this.

C,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2020","NOTE: The Echo Gen 3 is identical to the 2018 Echo *PLUS* Gen 2, except it does not include the built-in ZigBee smart home hub or temperture sensor. It has the exact same dimensions, weight, speakers, and fabric cover as the 2018 Echo PLUS Gen 2 (with the added color option of Twilight Blue).

Echo Gen 3 vs regular Echo Gen 2:

-Gen 3 is slightly wider (3.9"" vs 3.4""), and slightly lighter (27.5oz vs 29oz), but about the same height
-Gen 3 has bigger speakers: 3.0"" neodymium woofer and 0.8"" tweeter; (Gen 2 was 2.5"" woofer and 0.6"" tweeter)
-Gen 3 has an auxiliary port on the back that can serve as an output OR input. (Gen 2 was output only)
-Gen 3 can be stereo paired with another third-gen Echo or with the Echo Plus.

UPGRADE OPINIONS:

I can definitely tell the difference in the speakers, especially at higher volume levels. The 3rd Gen speakers produce a fuller sound, and more powerful bass. This wasn't as noticeable at lower volumes, but still an audio enthusiast would be able to tell. Don't expect to be utterly blown away though, the difference is not as great as the difference between the Echo and the Dot, for example.

If you already have an Echo Gen 2, it is probably NOT worth replacing it with the Echo Gen 3 yet. It is just a slightly better speaker and the added audio input. Echo Studio is a much bigger upgrade for sound quality in my opinion.

THINGS WE REGULARLY USE ECHO FOR:

-Controlling thermostat, lights, fans, smart plugs, Roomba, etc.
-Setting alarms and timers. Especially timers!
-Asking for Weather, News or Sports updates
-Calling friends/family
-Playing music, sometimes in multiple rooms at once
-Managing shopping lists
-Asking any question that is faster to ask than type into my phone/pc
-Playing games with paired Echo Buttons
-Translating things from one language to another
-Getting recipes and cooking tips
-Listening to audiobooks",5.0 out of 5 stars

I'm not an audiophile, but I do like my music to sound good - which, to me, means balanced, not bass-heavy, with good clarity and a high end that doesn't become strident at higher volumes.

I bought three of these to have at different locations around the house. Setup was super simple, d/l the app and sign in to your Amazon account and you're up and running. No issues at all.

Here's what I love so far: Alexa is super easy to get along with...Alexa, with whom I get along easily...?...has been a treat. I've been an Amazon music user for a few years now. I like the selection but using the app on a phone or tablet is a frustrating experience, and it can also be super clunky and slow on a PC, as well.

With this speaker I can ask Alexa to play a song, album or playlist and it's playing within moments. Awesome! Also, Alexa gave me a detailed, accurate weather forecast this morning. Nice! I haven't explored all the features, but I primarily want these for music.

And as far as that goes, the sound quality is better than I expected, and I've got no complaints. I have one speaker on top of my fridge in the kitchen and the sound is just amazing. Balanced and clear with more than enough bass. I listened to some jazz, some alt-country, some reggae and some ambient music. They all sounded great - as good as I could hope for.

And Alexa heard me from the next room without a problem.

These speakers are well worth their price, and at the Black Friday price they're an incredible value. These speakers have removed my Amazon Music frustration (or a large chunk of them, anyway) and allowed me much better access to what I'm paying for.",5.0 out of 5 stars
K,"Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2020","When I bought Alexa, I had bought it because I had seen how convenient it was for others to use while I was visiting their houses. I know my phone has Siri and things that I could use and, while that is handy, it is not nearly as handy as Alexa. Alexa’s voice recognition is excellent and the device recognizes quick speech, multiple commands for one task, and understands and completes tasks for my little ones. I love that it works with Apple Music, which is one reason I don’t use other similar smart speakers. While I use Alexa to set timers, tell me recent news, play music, or check the weather most often, I continue to find things that can be done using this device. I love all the little “Easter eggs” that can be used. I also love the jokes and games that can be played. I very much enjoy playing the Harry Potter quiz. While I am at work, I can send messages to Alexa to speak out to my kids.

I haven’t had Alexa very long, but I am constantly learning something new that this can do. The capabilities of this device are astonishing. This is super easy to use and surpasses my expectations. The only thing to note is that the speaker is a good one and can easily fill a room, but this speaker isn’t meant to really “jam.” If I turn the volume up to max (as I did one day just to see how loud it could get), it gets unclear and distorted. I have found that 85% is a really good area if you are wanting louder volume as it is easily loud enough for the room to be filled with sound and keeps everything clear. I highly recommend this device.",5.0 out of 5 stars
William Majmin,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2019","Alexa Echo Plus 2nd Generation is as easy to set up on your own without professional help designing a Smart Home for you, play Amazon Music with up to 52 million titles of songs for a small monthly fee of $4.00 a month with a trial free month, as well as other available options for payment plans. Also available are Amazon Audials of any book, topic, etc with a trial period and a monthly fee of less than $15.00 a month with probably other payment options available. Alexa comes with a Phillip's Hue Smart LED standard bulb, which can be used in your living room for table lamps. If your lamp is a pedestal Wall Dimming Lamp using a non-standard bulb, the other option would be to use a smart plug outlet connected to the Wall Lamp, all controlled by talking to Alexa, ""Alexa, turn off/on 1st/2nd lamp or ""Alexa, turn off/on wall lamp"" and programming Alexa using the Alexa Smartphone App to do all that plus control your Smart TV and Verizon FiOS automatically to turn on and select the channel you want to see, like saying to Alexa, ""Alexa, Change to channel ABC"", which turns on your FiOS Video Media Server and Smart Wifi HDTV at the same time, to channel 7, or pause live TV and play TV again by enabling skills to your Alexa APP which are subroutines within the Alexa APP, such as the FiOS skill, and other skills like Samsung Smartthings. However the FiOS skill cannot turn off your FiOS VMS but you can close your WIFI HDTV, using Smartthings skill which I think in the future the updated Alexa APP might contain an updated FiOS skill to turn off your TV as well at the same time. Also your FiOS VMS must be compatible with the FiOS skill. So now you can control your living room lamps by powering them on or off automatically by voice, and by voice recognition using your Amazon Profile. There are other smart devices like smart door locks, thermostats, refrigerators, dishwashers just to name a few devices outsmarting you.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Raymond,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2020","I purchased it mainly for music since I don't have a stereo in my home other than a small boombox, which I don't use because it doesn't sound all that great. But I have to say that Echo sounds better audio quality than the portable radio. I have hearing loss due to an accident years ago, so I really shouldn't be rating sound quality, it is difficult for me to hear some tones. The Alexa app on my Android phone has a simple EQ. While it does help, it's not sensitive enough to compensate for my poor hearing.

Even so, I can hear good enough to enjoy music on my Echo, which is linked in a special group with two Echo Dot devices in separate rooms. I can walk around the house and have music wherever I go. This is an awesome feature.

I've learned to use it for weather and news reports as well as set reminders, timers, and lists. Plus I have some fun askingng Alexa to play Star Trek sounds and other cool stuff.

I also set Alexa to ""away"" mode when I leave the house and she listens for common noises like glass breaking and will alert me if she hears anything suspicious. She's definitely not a security device. But it's nice to know she's got an ear for possible intruders and will let me know.

A great feature is the relaxing music or pleasing sounds that I play when going to sleep. I especially like the ocean waves for sleeping.

One issue I've experienced, Echo and Echo Dot become unresponsive once in a while. I have to unplug and reconnect power to reinitialize functionality. I'm not sure what's causing this problem? It could be my network/WiFi signal or some other problem technical problem so I can't ding Echo for the issue just yet. Luckily the issue is random and infrequent.

I'm still discovering new features. I never thought I'd say this, but Alexa with Echo has enhanced the enjoyment of my home. In all, I love my Echo.",5.0 out of 5 stars

So I have an Echo in the Bathroom - perfect for bathroom speaker- why would you need more in the bathroom? I have Spots in both my bedrooms - Set alarms, Bluetooth to TVs, picture albums, check the weather, play sleep sounds, etc - basically a high powered alarm clock. Echo Show in the kitchen. I get my updates, calendar, weather, and sound - perfect. I have a (Un-supported) Tap on the back porch. Still great sound, but basically it has just become my ""portable"" speaker - which works for me. I can take it into the garage or out front to wash my truck - still love it, and recommend buying cheap. You cannot include it as part of the smart home, but you can talk to Alexa and listen to Amazon Music on it, and still turn your smart bulbs on and off. Lastly, I bought the new Echo Plus for my living room. For me the selling point was the built in thermometer. I was wrong thinking that was the only selling point. This speaker is awesome!!! Do not buy 2, plus the woofer for ""full"" sound. This speaker takes over my entire house. Granted, my two Spots, my Echo, and my Echo Show were turned down, but even still if I play music on the everywhere group, this speaker dominates my entire house - plus it is Bluetoothed to my living room TV. I want something for my dining room, and have not figured out exactly what device I want yet, but as I sit here and do research, the Echo Plus is bouncing into my dining room (around the corner) and keeps making me think it is my Tap that is playing. The Tap is off- the Echo Plus is just kicking ass all over my house.I like my set up, but if you were only going to buy one, I would go with Echo Plus",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sherry Roth,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2020","If you read any of my other recent reviews (like for the mosquito netting and lanterns), you know that I decided to fix up my patio and thereby expand my living space during this Coronavirus thing, so that if people are afraid to come into your house, you can at least offer them a cool shady seat out on your patio and do the social-distance thing. So that might call for some music, as well as a referee (""who sings that song?"" ""what year did that movie come out?"") and who better than Alexa to answer all your trivia questions and settle all your arguments? Problem was that while I have 2 Echo Dots (one upstairs, one downstairs), they need to be plugged into an outlet, and that is not an option outside (for various reasons, even though there IS an outlet outside). So I needed an Echo Dot that was portable/rechargeable, and this is it!! It doesn't COME with the charging base (had to buy that separately), but it seemed like the only one that COULD be made portable. Of course it is much taller than the Echo Dot I had (which was like the first one ever made, and I won one from a contest at my job. I loved it so much that the next day I went out and bought one, to put upstairs). The sound is much fuller/richer, the bass tones.
It was super easy to set up. Basically I screwed it into the charging base (that will be a separate review), plugged that into the outlet, it turned itself on and paired itself to my WiFi, and boom! done. It took a few hours to fully charge but was working right away.
So, although I have not yet taken it outside to this patio, I'm sure I will. And it will sound amazing!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Britney,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2018","These were on sale for Black Friday/ cyber Monday. I didn’t see the point in having a robot listen to mine and my family’s every word. I read reviews and my boyfriend and I laughed at people saying they have 7 or 22 of these around their home, “what weirdos” “how lonely do you have to be?!”. I thought you just ask questions and she replies. How stupid.... WELL we love this. We purchased this one and a 3rd generation dot (one for the living room and one for the kitchen) I ordered the 2nd generation for as a grab bag gift for Christmas because everyone almost passed out last year when they saw that this dot was in a pool of gifts. We’re keeping all three. Living room, bedroom and kitchen, we even bought the light bulbs that Alexa can turn on. This thing can make grocery lists and it’s automatically on mine and my boyfriends phone (love love love this shopping list feature!!). We can talk to each other from one room to the next, my boyfriend keeps playing the worst music from the bedroom into the living room while I’m cleaning just to get a laugh. This is a nifty thing and we love them. If the government is listening to our every word, we’re going to get our own reality show.

grantn,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","have had a firestick for ages (2nd gen) but never used the alexa utility. moving toward a smart home, i had to choose a hub. since i already had a prime account, the echo was the way to go. getting used to 'alexa speak' takes a while but is getting very intuitive. the kit came with a phillips hue bulb which will work basic settings in the bulb but a hue hub is necessary to unlock the full features of the bulb. the integration with the hue hub was pretty straight forward. having alexa control the lighting is an easy task. simple naming of the bulbs makes setting scenes quick and easy. as i have seen some complaints that there is a delay in turning lights on, well, use your brain, it will have a delay. you tell alexa, alexa tells hue, hue tells the living room lamp to turn on. this is to be expected and it is not as much of an inconvenience as some would like you to believe. i also have a 5 year old harmony hub for controlling our entertainment system. seamless integration. i was finally able to take my tp-link smart plugs out of the junk drawer and put them to reliable use. again seamless integration. a bit of advice when it comes to third party integration. most smart home products require you to download an app and create an account. DO IT before you try to add the device to alexa. things will go a great deal quicker.

the sound quality is very good. the voice controlled equalizer and volume is an excellent and fun feature (nothing like a booming bass in dance music).

we have since added an echo dot to the master bedroom as well as an echo show in the kitchen and couldn't be any more pleased with the system. so much so that the wife has put in her request for the echo oven.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Shopping Guru,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2019","I mean it’s a good speaker I guess, it’s loud, she listens but sometimes Alexa acts like she has comprehension issues, and I have to reset it and sync again, but all in all I will give Alexa a 8/10 rating it’s awesome she understands me and can turn lights on and off in my smart home so yeah and playing my music, she just seems to have trouble with Apple Music sync , and sometimes understanding some artists names/songs, but I fw Alexa heavy , wait Alexa isn’t the speaker she’s integrated into the echo so yeah I fw the Echo it gets the job done. Another minus would be the fact it only works when it connects to power, pluses and minuses my friends pluses and minuses. I paid full price, do I think it’s worth it yes, I guess, I would recommend buying a regular speaker to just to be able to pick it up and take it from room to room and it not having to be connected to a power source all the time. I like the fact that’s it’s a smart speaker, I think that’s the best quality. The sound quality is out of this world I love it wish it went higher than 10 but 10 is pretty loud plus I stay in apartments so my neighbors are probably happy it doesn’t go much higher. I love that Alexa turns my lights on and off with Vivint smart home skill
downloaded, this speaker is so neat! If you have a fan that’s smart and the skill downloaded you can control the fan speed right from your device that’s connected to echo/Alexa.

Eddie Lugo,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2018","I didn’t own any of the previous models but this echo has changed the way we enjoy listening to music at home. We always have music playing while my wife and I are cooking or relaxing in our garage or really just about anything going on at the house. I did get two echo dots to pair with this plus. The ability to pair all three and have the multi room experience is a huge game changer. The plus has amazing highs and bass response. With the dots paired, the sound is so rich. We did get a free trial for amazon music and after using it the past week, I have cancelled my Pandora and keeping the amazon music. We can hear a considerable difference in sound quality. The library is endless. My family definitely gives this a high 5 star rating.

We do have 2 Bose speakers that we would use and always fighting for which phone is connected. Which is why I got the idea of getting these speakers. No need to fight over Bluetooth connects anymore. The price point is spot on and very good quality. I am considering getting the amazon subwoofer but the boss at home said not now.

I’ve never owned any products with Alexa and she has surprised us in a great way. Alexa is so fun and the routines I’ve set up are always great. My kids love the stories and jokes she tells.

All in all, I recommend the plus and follow up with a couple of dots to add that extra enjoyment. It’s sound quality is amazing sealed up in a compact design. The cloth exterior adds a classy touch to our kitchen and bedroom.

If someone can find a way to make these portable, that would definitely be a huge deal at our house. That’s the only thing that I had an issue with but I guess a little sacrifice for now will do.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Onyxgirl,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2018","This Echo does everything it professes to do, plus the sound is great. It is a breeze to set up too. If you have TIVo, as I do, and want it to turn the TV on or off, you have to use a smart plug, otherwise it works with TIVO to change channels without the smart plug.

I do want to warn those who might have an issue with the Echo that they need help with to be aware that there is an online scam from a company called, ITS support, where they will try to sell you a repair contract for $149.99. I Googled Alexa (instead of calling Amazon for help) and found this site that looked like it was an Amazon site. They had me try to download the Alexa app, but the download failed each time because the website it rigged to always show a failure. That is how they get you to purchase their product. They tell you that you have viruses on your computer and go through quite an elaborate scheme, taking control of your computer, pretending to scan and clean up the so-called viruses. All of that is fake. They are not really doing anything. It only appears that way. I had a gut feeling about this and called Amazon. At Amazon, I was told that they would never try to sell you something to fix the issue and that they had no record of my call. I mention this because someone in one of the reviews stated that he was told to buy a fix for $149.99, and it seemed too coincidental.

Hellman,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2019","After owning several 2nd gen Dots, we finally decided to add the full size Echo to our home. Very noticeable improvement in sound and voice recognition. While it does not replicate a surround sound system or soundbar (which it doesn't claim to do) it provides better than satisfactory sound with a surprising amount of bass. We listen to all sorts of music through Pandora, Spotify and Amazon and have no complaints with the quality of sound, it gets quite loud and remains crystal clear. When we want the music to extend to our living room, we simply tell it to connect to bluetooth and it automatically turns on our surround sound system and continues the song.

Our Echo lives in the kitchen and functions as a source of music, news, games while we are cleaning, cooking timers and random questions about ingredients. Its convenient to ask Alexa to turn on the under cabinet lights when your hands are dirty and you need a little extra light to see what you are doing. Its also convenient to ask her to turn the A/C lower when it starts getting hot in the kitchen.

As far as connectibility with smart home devices, it was easily recognized through our Alexa app and took zero updates or syncing to get our Hue lights, smart thermostat and sound system working with voice control. If you don't already own an Alexa device, it will take a little bit of setup.

We are thoroughly happy with the purchase and continue to recommend to friends and family. As far as privacy concerns, if you have a smart phone, it is already listening to everything Alexa would hear anyways, if you don't like that then smart devices are not for you. The convenience and quality of sound and function make it a necessity if you have a smart home or are looking to create one.",5.0 out of 5 stars
John D. Williams,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2019","I wish there was a phone app that came with Echo so I could click on my favorite apps or turn up up the volume. I cannot stand having to yell at this thing. It's turned into a hostile relationship. Try asking it to read something and you'll get an offer for a free audible trial, and then you have to yell to interrupt it while it's giving you the rundown. I've tried saying, ""Alexa, do not ever use the Audible skill,"" but no use. At least once a week it happens again. And if I walk into the room with my laptop then Alexa announces that I'm connected, and when I leave the room it announces that I'm disconnected. It's really annoying. I do not like this voice control.

Ok, this section is new. I decided not to edit my original complaints but to add to them instead. I got a call from a friendly Amazon guy today who told me that there is, indeed, an Alexa app for my phone. And he even walked me through the app and showed me where to change the volume, select from my radio station history or from new stations, and a number of other things. I was familiar with the Alexa app on my laptop and it did not have any of these features, and I assumed the two apps were similar, but not so. (You know what they say about assuming.) Anyway, the guy was very helpful and I've since apologized to Alexa for my recent verbal abuse. Bottom line, this really is a good product. My two sons want one now.

Sean Christopher,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2019","I purchased my first Alexa Echo 1st Gen two years ago and I fell in love right away! It was bittersweet for me to replace it with the newer 3rd Gen but they had an amazing trade-in offer so I had to take advantage of it. First thing to note this Echo is much shorter than Gen 1 but a little wider which I prefer because it looks and fits better on my kitchen island. The new blue color is amazing if you’re considering getting it! Setting up the new Echo was the easiest most seamless process! I literally took it out of the box, plugged it in and in under a minute it set itself up and was ready to use! I didn’t have to do anything, it was already programmed with my smart lights and my WiFi, couldn’t ask for an easier setup. I love my Echo and use it every day and if you’re considering getting one, I say go for it! If I had to critique or complain about anything the only thing I could say is the wall adapter is really large since it’s still a square block like Gen 1. This is more of a personal opinion but Gen 1 had a rotating top to turn the volume up and down (which I loved) where as Gen 3 has volume up and down buttons. Functionally they both work I just though the rotating volume top was more fun and unique, but I’ll live on just fine with the buttons.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Set up was super easy, had some issues getting them all set up to play music everywhere at once but easy fix, plenty of info online and most of it was a faulty modem issue where I needed to get a new modem.

Sound quality is really good. I love music, blasting it loud and it handles it really well. Even just as a music player I'd be happy. Not as good as my Bose but there is a huge difference in price and my Bose sits in one spot on one end of the house not playing everywhere like these. Really impressed with the sound though.

Had an issue with connection though. My Comcast internet kept dropping and I would lose my connection to the speakers. Spent hours trying to figure it out, searching online reset a couple of the dots and had to set everything up again....huge headache over and over till I got my new modem. Finally found if you unplug it and plug it back in, it reconnects! Super simple yet a pain to find the answer.

If your doing smart home stuff it works really well. Getting some music, Pandora, Slacker/LivexLive to play stations can sometimes be a real pain. You have to know the station name exactly and still at times plays stuff you didn't want. 95% vs 5% works/issues had some issues with smart plugs and lights not working directly with it too.

ABQ Matt,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2019","After doing some research on which platform to start my home automation process I chose the Echo because of the supported products and ease of use.
The sound is clear and loud enough for all your needs. I have mine in a large living room (600 sq/ft) with 15' ceilings and it fills the room up nicely.
As for the voice recognition it easily picks up both my commands and my two kids voices with minimal errors. Yes Alexa still makes mistakes and yes it will still frustrate you sometimes like all voice commanded AI we interact with on a daily basis.
The built in hub is nice because on accessories I am not worried if it is WiFi or hub required because this can do both. So far I have done the August lock and Singled Bulbs with no pairing problems or interaction issues with the app and devices.
Routines are simple and easy to set with app and you can stack multiple items on one task. For example at 30 minutes after sunset it checks the front lock to make sure it is locked and locks it is it is unlocked, turns on the living room lights, and turns on the porch lights.
Complaints:
Where it is located I have to use a WiFi extender, and if I reset my router I have to reset the Echo because it will not automatically reconnect to the extender.
Some devices still require bridges and/or 3rd party apps to be installed even though you have it connected through the Echo.
It gets really expensive once you start the automation process and it is addicting. You start to enjoy having things automated and the $20 bulb here or the $50 switch here really adds up very quickly.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Experienced at life,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2018","I primarily bought this because I wanted to enter the world of smart devices. I bought some google home minis, but found you had to download apps from outsiders in order to use the smart light I wanted. I looked at the privileges that were being demanded by the app and decided an app to control lighting had no reason to know who I called, when I called, or anything else about me personally. Amazon already knows me (my husband thinks they pretty much own me) so I was more in favor of using the echo plus since it has a built-in hub and no third party app or skill was desired for the smart light I bought (actually, I received a free smart light bulb when I purchased the echo plus).

I had a bit of trouble getting the light to work - Alexa didn't find it at first but I reset the bulb and then I was good to go. I agree with others that the Alexa app interface is not really intuitive, but now that I have the light up and running, I am in love. My 94-year old father is not very mobile and when he comes to stay with us, I wanted him to be able to turn the light on and off while he is still in bed. This feature now works like a champ so I am very happy.

I have played some prime music and that works well, but I still have a lot to learn about all the echo's features.

The only reason I would not give it 5 stars right now is the alexa app - but that is really a separate issue, so I gave it 5 stars.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kenneth I.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2020","My Alexa was shipped to me yesterday and I couldn't be happier with what I can do with it already! I read the mostly Positive reviews and some Negative. So I didn't really know when it arrived whether I'd experience any of the Negative.

Well, I'm glad to say that what I've learned and programmed in 'one-day' are nothing less than spectacular! From the moment that you plug it into the wall it takes you through a Set-Up Routine that couldn't have been easier. Using the Amazon Alexa App on my Apple iphone I was able to program responses that I wanted.

Amazon Tech Support flawlessly guided me to pair with my Iphone in less than five minutes! It has my entire directory and all I have to do is ask it to call someone. It checks the number with me and then makes the call.

Sometimes I like browsing through You Tube. I should mention that once Alexa is sharing the same Wi Fi network as my iphone. it it takes the place of the speakers in the phone. You'd have to turn Alexa's volume way up to hear the You Tube voice clearly. This can easily solved by activating the iphone's Ear Speakers and now the voice comes through the iPhone.

It's very User Friendly. Greets me in the Morning and goes into Sleep Mode at night. So far I haven't found anything that I can't do with it. The Tutorials found in the Amazon Alexa App are easy to understand.

Right now while I'm writing this review Alexa is playing Music that I selected and can be heard all over my home.

Justin,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2019","I currently own the echo dot 2 and a couple of the 3rd generation dots. I would always listen to my Amazon Music playlist while I cleaned around the house. I needed something with a bit more volume and sound so I went with this 3rd generation echo. The difference is definitely worth the upgrade. Voice recognition is better among other things. I love all of the features that Alexa has to offer. My son who is almost two has just recently started talking and he will randomly blurt of ""lexa playyyy shots!"". Of course he doesn't emphasize the A in Alexa so I help him out a bit and he gets a big ole grin on his face when Lil Jon and LMFAO start to play. The Alexa skills are great. The Guard mode when away also allows Alexa to listen for smoke alarms and glass breaking. This would result in a notification pushed to your phone. I would love for them to ad a feature that allowed several echo's to monitor these sounds while home. With one in the basement, kitchen, living room, and upstairs bedroom, It would be amazing if Alexa could hear a smoke detector from the basement or kitchen and then alert my bedroom echo with a very loud alarm. This would allow me to wake up much sooner since it takes a bit for smoke to get upstairs. Even then, Its hard to hear a smoke alarm in a hallway when you run a fan or window AC all night. Who wouldn't want to get out of the house before a fire got out of control? Amazon....please consider this feature. It would definitely save lives. It could even save households that keep fire extinguishers on hand. Anyways, buy this echo. You won't regret it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The sound in this thing is insane, for a medium sized room, I never have to keep the volume over half, and the base is crisp and beautiful, you gear every little wub and punch, unlike the dot, which only tries to mimic the low sounds with its tiny tweeter. This is worlds better, is it better then a multi hundred dollar speaker or surround sound home entertainment system, hell no, but is it way more then what you could expect for a speaker the size of a beer pitcher? Hell yes as well!! The microphones seem to be able to pick up my voice even when music is playing and the air conditioner right beside it is blaring, and even though most of my smart home devices are wifi and not zigbee, I'm happy to be able to expand the choices of smart home devices I can now buy with the built in hub. The thermometer inside, I thought was useless at first, but I can set it to turn on my airconditoner at night when the temperature is over a certain degree, and off when it's under a certain degree, which saves myself from having to half brain command it to turn on and off in the middle of the night, I will be buying an echo sub to further enhance the lows in my music, not because I need to, but because I personally love bass in my music.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Roger J. Buffington,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2019","I am a bit of a latecomer to the Echo Plus and Echo, and for that matter to Alexa. You may count me impressed. I run two Echo Plus units plus the woofer unit. The music quality is very good. It is perhaps a shade less rich than my paired Apple Homepods which I have in another room. But the difference is marginal and I am satisfied with the music quality.

For use with Alexa this is a very good unit. Alexa has wildly surpassed Apple's Siri. I use Alexa to control my Sony TV, as an alarm clock system, and to control the lights in the upper story of my house. It was not at all difficult to set all of this up, and it is a joy to use. I am very impressed. I will say that the Echo Plus does not pick up voice commands quite as well as does the Homepod with Siri. If you are playing music or the TV at a high volume (as I often do) sometimes you have to put some volume in your voice to have Alexa parse your voice command. This is a minor nit.

Pairing was straightforward. As others have noted, if you change your pairing configuration, you first need to ""unpair"" the earlier group if you have one. No big deal.

Overall this is an excellent value for the money. Recommended. RJB.",5.0 out of 5 stars
SuperATV,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2019","I received the Echo Plus (2nd Gen) as a Christmas gift and I absolutely LOVE it! Not only was the set up super easy but Alexa is so helpful! I am not sure how we managed to keep anything straight before getting this! I have used the Echo Plus for multiple things from creating and adding items to a shopping list to playing music while cleaning and all of this completely hands free. No more paper shopping list that gets lost and no more searching YouTube for a song that I want to hear. I simply say ""Alexa, add milk to my shopping list."" Or, ""Alexa, play today's hits."" The best feature is the hands free knowledge that is just a question away. While making sugar cookies I needed a conversion for a measurement and my hands were covered in dough and flour. I simply asked Alexa for the conversion and had my answer without needing to stop, wash my hands, and use my phone or cookbook to look up the information I needed. I was also able to set my timer for the cookies by simply asking Alexa to set a timer for 8 minutes. A timer alarm on the Echo Plus alerted me when to remove the cookies from the oven. The Echo Plus links to my iPad and several wireless speakers throughout our house. Linking the Echo Plus with these items was a breeze by using Bluetooth and only took a few seconds for the Echo Plus to find. I would highly recommend the Echo Plus (2nd Gen) to anyone looking to purchase one.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Gary Blanchard,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2020","Oh well, I'll do it myself.

I am an old guy, and have resisted this technology. I even wrote a song in which Alexa uses all she has learned about us to rise up against us. Then, the other day, my wife says ""I wish there were some way you could tell something a song you want to hear and it would play it..."" I was able to tell her that it did indeed exist and could be in our living room for a mere $99.00.

Well, it arrived today and was so easy to set up that I was able to do it without calling in a grandchild to help. My wife and I spent some time requesting songs ranging from the 5th Dimension to Peter, Paul and Mary. She even played me a song from my 1980s Original Soundtrack album. She told us the weather, where squirrels go in the winter, and a couple of dad jokes almost as bad as mine. With all of the novelty I can also see some benefits. I can use this to time my food, to remind me of appointments (which are easy to forget when every day feels like Saturday). With the addition of an Echo Dot for upstairs we can have an easy to use intercom. I am sure as time goes on we will discover even more ways it will make our lives easier.

S. Tracy,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2019","So, after buying and trying a couple of echo dots, I bought 2 of these 3rd gen echo’s. I must say I was quite impressed with the sound after the dots. I also paired with an echo sub and a 4K Firetv Stick. With the Alexa app, the capability is there to set up a “theater” system. Actually it works pretty well. Setup took about 15 minutes including the speaker software/firmware updates.
Sound.....
So I’ve had for the last 20 years a 5.1 system with different high end receivers and Paradigm speakers. Now, I was NOT looking to duplicate the sound that system produced but, I was looking for something decent. Actually these 3rd gen’s paired with the little echo sub do pretty well. I’ve actually had quite a few people over that had in the past enjoyed my other system for “movie nights” or just sitting around playing cards listening to music, and they’ve all been impressed. Enough so that most are looking at setting up the same system at home.
I’m not going down the road of specs and stats. I’m just going to say I’m impressed and would purchase all again.
I’m hoping in the future there will be a firmware/software update that will integrate these speakers into a full surround. A 5.1 or even a 5.2 would be super.
For now I’m extremely happy with them. For the price they’re great.

If you’re an idiot looking for super audio file sound or Einstein knowledge for speakers then keep looking. I must say some of the 1 and 2 star reviews I read are, well, idiotic.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JohnsHopAlum,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2019","I purchased an Amazon Alexa back in 2016 and it was used mainly to amuse my seven-year-old daughter. She would tell Alexa to play her favorite songs and would dance to her songs. That was then and this is now. It is amazing how far along the Amazon Alexa has come. Now you can use it to set up your smart home devices, make calls, send messages, send announcements and even use Alexa to show you your DIY home security cameras. This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of all the items Alexa can do. When I hear about people making a fuss about people from Amazon listening to their Elexa comments, I thank Amazon for hiring all those employees helping to make Elexa continuously better. There are so many things that you can do with the New Amazon Alexa, that I can spend hours and hours learning the features available within the Alexa app. If I had a nickel for all the times my wife has told me to stop using my phone or tablet, which then keeps me from learning and doing more things within the Alexa app, I would have accumulated enough nickles to buy ten Echos. Thank you, Amazon for all the work that you have done to make the Amazon Alexa as amazing that it is.

Harley Walter,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2019","This is the Echo Plus 2nd Gen. I think it should have been called 3rd Gen. but since it has Echo ""Plus"" you can distinguish it from just Echo 2nd Gen. Moving along the set up was fast & easy just use your PC Alexa App and in about 5 Min. its ready to go. I had a 1st Gen. Echo that did a good job and has nice sound and with it I have a few Plugs & bulbs still working good. So... when I seen the new Echo Plus & new subwoofer I had to have them. The Echo Plus did have better sound then my 1st Gen. one. It also connected to everything I've had for a few years. Instead of using the awake word Alexa I changed it to Computer, the 2 other words you can use are Amazon & Echo. Connecting the 2 Echo Pluses to the Amazon Subwoofer went smoothly and now I have the sound I wanted. The music app I have lets me play different combinations of speakers. You also can turn speakers up or down manually or by command. One other "" of many "" thing I like is when I turn off all the lights to go to bed I tell my Echo Plus to turn on my bedroom light, its a multi color bulb which is set on blue.

I recently bought an Echo Plus for my Mom and did a double-take when I got it up and running and playing a little Red Hot Chili Peppers . I also have a Sonos and I'm going to say this is as good if not better. Why... because I don't have to deal with the fickleness of Sonos, its annoying at times and for anyone thinking I don't know how to set it up correctly, I have over 60 devices paired (Hue lights, Sonos, Smart Plugs, Wemo, and more). So yeah, the only one that always has issues is Sonos. This Echo Plus sounds so good, I'm thinking of replacing my other 3 Echo's. Its also incredibly responsive, more so then the one I replaced it with. I especially like that when I have the music turned up, it still hears the wake word. As for my Mom, I have a few lights set up, probably more in the future, what I liked was telling Alexa to ""find my devices"" and it was done in a few seconds.

Marius,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2019","i had the 1st generation Echo that I bought from a friend in 2016. I loved it. The sound quality was amazing. It did amazing things. I played fun games on it. I got the weather. I set timers. I made shopping lists. I shopped on Amazon with it. Alexa woke me up. Alexa said good night. She turned on my lights and even set light timers for me. In time there won't be anything that we can't do with Alexa. She just keeps getting better and better and I have seen that progress since I first plugged her in back in 2016. I traded in my 1st gen Echo though Amazon. I told them the condition and right on the spot I had my trade in money to use towards the new 3rd gen Echo. They even gave me a shipping label to send it back to them and when they got it there was no issue with the trade in value I received.
This new 3rd gen echo is great. The sound quality is far better than the 1st gen and that one sounded great regardless of how loud I played music.

So many more possibilities but I use the apps for my security cams. I have an iPad so I see no need for the show me feature. But if you have a lousy, slow, ring app, I think that would be the hot shot. I tore the ring doorbell out with my bare hands I was so pissed. By the time you open the app everything that was going to happen has already happened whoever was at the door is already gone. By the time the app opens, everything that was going to happen has already happened. So the show me feature has got to be quicker than the ring app and would be a nice addition to alexa. Then I’ve connected “the dots”.. I wondered why they call them dots, now it all makes sense. I use the dots for stereo sound in my home. They all work the same as Echo. You don’t need Echo to have the dots either. Dots are smaller so the speaker is smaller, that’s all. Great for smaller rooms and still have a good quality speaker. Better privacy controls on these. You can turn off the speaker manually and if you want delete everything you said that day you can do that too. Ask Alexa to do it for you. Decent app. Play with the settings.

Additional review: Was called by customer service next day, and went through a series of steps, including rebooting the modem. After about an hour, Echo is up and running. Customer service rep knew his stuff.
Cons; Couldn't connect to the internet. App won't download to my Ipad, says I have to update to 10.0 and not able to do that with my Ipad. Downloaded the app to my android phone. App kept connecting my phone to a unsecured network and stayed there until I physically switched it back. (OK today found that it was only connected to the Echo, not the internet) App kept telling me that the password for the internet was wrong...it was not, tried it several times, even went into the router to verify the PW. Several times when the app kept telling me the PW was wrong it didn't bring up a place to change it. Had to reinstall the app and hard reset the echo to get back to a screen to type in the PW. Even in some of the areas where the internet was not needed there was a problem, after putting my phone number in it said that the number belonged to another account. App not helpful, and it seems that the app is the only way to run this little gadget.
So, after about 5 hours of screwing with this frustrating little gadget it's going back.

Denise Hamlin,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2019","For other ditherers out there like me. Don't over think it. Just do it! The Echo Plus is my favorite Echo Device to date. I'm an early adopter and bought the 1st Echo and and the 1st Echo Show. I was getting tired of the poor sound quality and figured it was time to upgrade. I spent a long time debating between the Echo and Echo Plus. I wishI hadn't wasted my time with the Echo. It's no contest. The Echo Plus is light years ahead on sound and that's the most important aspect to me as I listen to a lot of music. Alexa doesn't always understand my voice, but I am a Brit and it may be my accent, so I need to cut her some slack on that. (Although it is a bit annoying on times, considering I'm asking the same questions all the time. It's not like we use a full vocabulary with Alexa).

I don't have much experience with the hub. I really didn't buy it for that, but I do have the smart plug that came with the deal I got and that works like a charm. All in all I'm thrilled with my Echo Plus. I'm an Apple Fan and was seriously contemplating the HomePod for music. I'm not saying the Echo Plus is on a par with that, but it is good enough, (with the added benefit that I can use it with Prime Music), that I feel I can live with this for my music.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jon S,"Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2020","I purchased the Echo Plus to integrate into my Philips Hue lighting and to give me a way to listen to music while I work. I found no problems integrating into Philips Hue. The only limitations I've found so far is that Echo devices aren't aren't recognizable in the Hue app. This is reasonably understandable and not necessarily for me a dealbreaker. As a workaround I wrote routines through ITTT when needed.

The sound quality is quite robust for a speaker of this size. The mids are right and the bass fills the room quite well. The only minor quirk for me and likely it is my preference is that I'd like a little more clarity in the 800hz-1000hz range.

The one noticeable detractor that I do have is that Alexa at times misunderstands a command. I like to think that I have a normal easily recognizable voice but for some commands Alexa misconstrues what I'm saying and regards it as something else. It happens about once a day where I have to say the A word (Alexa) midway through a command to try to correct Alexa. Allegedly, Alexa is supposed to over time better recognize your voice and improve on this but after a month I'm not sure how much better it will get.

I am not technology driven by any means, but after some initial training, I became friends with our new family member, Alexa. I have used ""her"" service for learning the 7-day weather forecast, driving directions to almost anywhere, for answers to a myriad of questions (best homemade shower cleaner, recipe for broccoli soup, most popular baby names in the 50's - and on and on) There isn't much that this young lady doesn't know! My absolute favorite use of my friend Alexa is to play songs of my choice. I love to listen to music doing housework, while taking a shower and during any other activity that allows me access to this ingenious equipment. There are songs I haven't heard in years that Alexa plays for me with gusto. The ever-brilliant quality of Bose speakers supports and shares all of my favorites, from Jazz, swing, country, blues, holiday songs, show tunes, etc. I could never own all of those requested cd's, but Alexa puts a smile on my face whenever she comes up with exactly the unique version of a song I am just dying to hear.

Alexa is very good for recognizing your voice. Sometimes she misinterprets what you were asking but it is probably because it is not something in her database. I love the concept. I don't like when I play music from my phone through the Echo using Bluetooth but there is a 3.5 mm Jack which can be configured for audio input or audio output through the app. While the AI isn't perfect it does very well providing you with access to information and seconds, playing music from Amazon music as well as other music players which are use such as Pandora, TuneIn and others. All you need to do is ask and most of the time you get the information you were looking for.

I'm a big fan of music, a musician myself, an audiophile, and a avid lover of all thing's audio. While this doesn't compete with big old massive tower speakers. It compares very favorably with bookshelf units (when paired with the Echo Sub) as a clear, great sounding little speaker. A lot of review mention bass, if you're looking for bass go order a set of massive tower speakers and the amp to push them. That being said, at low and medium volume, these things PUMP OUT some surprisingly low bass for a 3"" woofer. not only is it low, but it's crystal clear and very smooth and natural sounding. At low volumes (10-20%) I find the midrange to be a bit retracted, but this goes away the closer you get to 30-40% volume. at high volumes, this speaker pulls back on its bass output as I expect it has been designed to do, it's a small driver. I find that this speaker sounds its best around half volume (Which is around normal listening level anyway).

Brett Breeden,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2018","I have to admit that I got this at probably the best price it's been offered at since launching, which was $99 from the Amazon Treasure Truck with an included single Philips Hue bulb. At that price, it's a steal. I purchased the 2nd gen Echo about a month ago for my office and I liked it well enough, but I thought the audio was a little lacking. I saw the Echo plus but the price (on sale) was $119 and I was hesitant to take the leap since the wife would likely be annoyed. But then the Treasure Truck deal popped up and was too good to pass up. I'm glad I grabbed it, as the sound really is improved. I gave my daughter the Echo for her room and she's very happy, so all is well.

Other than the included Hue bulb, I don't have any other smart home items that work on the Zigbee system (everything else is WeMo, which has been solid), but it's nice that I can add Zigbee devices if they're the best deal in the future.

The built in hub saves you money so you don’t need to buy the Hue lights hub, and because it is built in, you don’t need 2 more annoying cables to hide or organize.

Alexa is Addictive. In a good way.
I bring the Echo Plus to my dorm in the army, I switched 3 dorm rooms in the past 3 months, and in every room, my teammates fell in love with her and asked me where can they buy it.
I think my most used commands are “Alexa, play my sleep playlist”, “set sleep timer for 30 minutes”, “lights off”. It’s amazing that I don’t need to even look at my phone at night or leave the bed to do all these actions, but I really hope that soon it will be possible to activate a series of actions like these 3 I mentiond, in one call.

DTBarber,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2019","This is our third Echo device. The previous two are Echo Dots. Our primary use has been streaming our Amazon Music. The sound quality of the second generation Dot is not adequate for our purpose so we use the 1/8"" jack and plug the Dots into stereos. That arrangement works great for playing music, but we do not keep the stereos on 24/7. Thus, we miss out on many of the Echo's available features. The reviews about the sound quality of the 2nd-Gen were mixed, but Amazon incentive discount was enough to make it worth the risk. Glad we took the plunge. At volume 3 the sound fills our living room. While a single Echo does not deliver stereo, we do not miss that for casual listening. When we want stereo we do what we always did and play a Dot through a stereo. Now, we are using many of the additional features of Echo devices. Simple things like controlling lights, checking weather, and using the timer feature when cooking.

Currently, when using the 1/8"" stereo jack Echo device speakers are disconnected. Understandable in that competing with the stereo speakers is undesirable. However, an improvement to all Echo devices would be the ability to leave the device plugged into a stereo and then use voice commands to select between device speakers or stereo speakers.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I've been able to play with Echo Dot 2nd Gen, Echo Dot 3rd Gen, Echo 2nd Gen, and this in the same space. The Echo Plus bass is truly impressive for the size, and the only audio complaint I have is wishing its tweeter was a little more powerful. Mid to high-range piano notes, for example, ring louder from my Echo Dot 3rd Gen than from the Echo Plus, but that low vibration that fills the room is definitely dominated by the Echo Plus.

This thing also comes with an onboard thermometer, which is mostly what sold me. I know it seems like a trivial thing, but I really like the added ability to ask Alexa what the temperature is in that room. I don't know if the Zigbee Smart Home Hub part as been super useful to me. I do use it to control a bulb which was bundled with it, but most of my lights that I use are lamps, which are on smart plugs that work without this protocol anyway.

We use them for music, news, scores, general information, and even as a household intercom system (Alexa, announce: blah blah blah...). I've ordered electrical smart switches and relays to operate our pool heater/pump and our driveway gates. Love this! There are, I know, privacy concerns, and I certainly wouldn't suggest telling Alexa anything you wouldn't want to be repeated in a courtroom someday, but the flipside of that is that you can use the Echo App on your smartphone to see what your family or guests have said to the unit, and also to disable/enable purchases, explicit lyrics, and other unwanted ""features.""

I recently had Alexa sing Happy Birthday to my daughter while I was away. I followed it with a personal birthday message using the Announcement feature. Very cool!",5.0 out of 5 stars
ckonly,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2020","I am still learning new uses for my Echo, and am enjoying it so far. I use it to add things to my shopping list, then at the store, I just pull up the app on my phone and there is my list! Love that. I have used timers multiple times, listening to music is easy. I really like using the drop in feature, I can talk to my husband from work just by using the drop in on my phone app, then we can communicate in real time and I don’t have to wonder if he got my text message or voice mail, which have proven to be unreliable. I have one smart light bulb and the whole family finds it very easy to tell Alexa “turn on the light” we have even played games with Alexa. I was reluctant to have this in my house for a long time, but as more Birthdays come and go I decided having a virtual assistant was a good idea, and I am really enjoying it. I have used it with a smart plug during the holidays and that worked very well. I plan to set up more smart plugs so when we are away from home lights will automatically turn on and off. I have zero complaints with my purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Merv,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2019","We bought 1st generation years ago and loved it, but for playing music we used our Bose Soundtouch 10. So our kitchen, dining room and bedroom had two speakers taking up space, the Echo and the Bose. Now the New Generation Echo devices with their new speakers are so very good plus so very small that we decided removed our Bose speaker from the dining room. In the kitchen and bedroom, we bought the Echo Shows which they also have great sounding speakers. We almost bought the Sonos One with Alexa, but after comparing them side by side in a show. We bought the Amazon Echo devices based on the equally sound and the better price. We paid $69 for the Echo, $99 for Echo Plus and not $199 for the Sonos. The Echo Shows, We paid $179 which was still cheaper than the Sonos One. Now don’t get us started on the new Bose 500 with Alexa at $399, which barely sound better than the New Generation Echo devices and definitely not worth $300 more. Remind you we own a lot of Bose products and have been fans since 1980. So my recommendation is buy The New Generation Echo Devices over the over priced and marginally better sound Bose 500 is a based on years of use.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Rick K,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","It does pretty good recognizing what we say. We were able to put both of our Amazon accounts in it. For the size of the speaker, it actually sounds great. I was able to set up a voice command that controls all of the Christmas decorations in the house, which are spread out over 8 different Outlets. Turning them on and off became a house tour everyday. The adapter plugs were 4 for $20, relatively inexpensive. Next I'm going to replace one or two light switches, not all of them. Definitely the main one in the living room with the dimmer, so I can just dim the lights with a voice command. You don't have to buy expensive WiFi bulbs, you can actually replace the outlets and light switches if you want, or buy Outlet adapters if you only want one of the two outlets to be controllable. My only word of caution would be there that recordes everything you say after the Wake word, so you may want to go in now and then and delete your recordings. They say this will affect how well it recognizes your voice, but so far I don't see that happening. I have friends who use the Google and Siri products.

Charles,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2020","This is my second Echo device, I also have a echo dot. The sound quality of the Echo Plus is way better than the Dot. The Zigbee hub thing on the plus basically only works with Philips Hue, and the Hue experience sucks without a Hue Hub.

I also use this as my PC speaker with the 3.5mm line in(It's the main reason I don't like to dot as much). There is a problem I notices it the volume is really low when I'm using the line in. I normally set it to 20% or 30% if I stream music directly from the Echo but if I use line in, with output setting at max on my PC, I have to turn the volume of the Echo to 50%. It seems fine but the problem is that if I talk to Alexa, she is just way too loud. I really don't like the inconsistency of the volume.

I don't think there is much of a difference between the Echo Plus and Echo. Except a build in temperature sensor and Zigbee Hub. I don't find them that useful. How ever, I got this in a bundle with a Philips Hue Bulb and Amazon Smart plug and I think it's worth it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

It has a speaker so I can play my playlists from Amazon music, if I choose. The main reason for purchasing the two echo dots is that I have Parkinson’s disease and am at greater risk of falling. After sitting at my desk for an hour or so, it becomes difficult to stand. If I fall, now all I have to do is say “Alexa, call (say my daughter’s name)”, and Alexa will dial her and I can speak to her without having my phone in my hand. This gives me a great deal of comfort to know that I do not need someone here 24/7. It gives my daughter comfort to know that I can reach her anytime. I could also say “Call 911, and Alexa would call them for me. This is a great product. I also added a bluetooth speaker as I stated earlier, but you might want to check in Alexa’s list of devices first. The ine I bought was no on her list and it was difficult to get it to pair.

Lasso The Mayday,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2020","FINALLY took the plunge and upgraded from the standard “hockey puck” Alexa device. Holy guacamole, folks—Alexa’s got BASS! I love it. The aesthetic is sleek and cozy. Compliments any room. The adjustments one can make to sound haptics via the Alexa app and via the controls on the top of the unit make this a truly versatile unit. I keep it in my home office, and occasionally move it to the kitchen if I’m cooking/cleaning for a good while. I have nothing but good things to say about this unit. I am somewhat of an audio snob when it comes to music—this Amazon Alexa tower provides the bass and treble required to suit your own personal soundtrack. I tested it with a variety of music genres and songs (dating back to the 1920’s!) This unit has the capability to beautifully execute your favorites AND offers the option tweak the sound settings to enhance and delight even more.

Josh garner,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2019","I can turn on and off light from my bed. That is absolutely game changing. I decided to go with the echo over other smart speakers simply because of the easy amazon integration. Amazon shows what certified to work with Alexa. I mostly shop on amazon so it was an easy choice for me. The voice recognition is almost perfect still a few times when I have to speak up but only when I have my room fan on so maybe it’s my fault for drowning out my voice. I would say 99/100 times Alexa does hear me perfectly so it’s not a problem. The sound quality of the speaker is amazing. The simple iOS app for Alexa to sort and rename devices is painless to use and has practically no learning curve. I have a room with a small hallway and sink connecting to my bathroom, Alexa has no problem turning lights on and off from any of the rooms. I absolutely love the way prime music and Spotify works with her. I’m glad I went with the echo plus because it has a built in hub unlike the echo dot.

Recently I moved it to our family room so that I can listen to it in there and it turned into a way for my little cousin to listen to crickets at bed time. there’s so many uses for this device it’s great to have on hand. My only complaint is that sometimes it thinks you’re talking to it when you’re not and if there’s more than one in the house you can accidentally set another person‘s echo off when talking to yours.

Sidewinder,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2019","having had the 1st gen since the first invite, decided to make the upgrade when the 3rd gen went on sale. traded in the 1st gen and ended up paying about $20 for the 3rd gen.

3rd gen is lighter by about 10oz but significantly wider and shorter (36oz 1st gen / 26 oz 3rd gen) than the 1st gen. hooked it up and music seems to have better bass. made some adjustments in the eq in alexa app and it does sound clearer compared to the 1st gen. no issues with sound quality.

the most significant upgrade imo is the improvement in mic. the 3rd gen is much more sensitive to the wake word even while blasting music. 1st gen would sometimes miss the wake word even during silence and good luck trying to wake it while blasting music. 3rd gen has no issues waking even when blasting music. the only thing it doesn't have is the ring to adjust the volume and i thought i would miss that but not at all. it has the buttons now but rarely use it anyway since the mic sensitivity is now so much improved. all in all a no brainer especially after sale price and trade in.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The tech has really been streamlined and alexa has learned quite a bit. The voice recognition has significantly improved and the smart gadgets it can control are getting more common. I bought this with an echo show and an echo input and an echo auto. The intercom function has been helpful twice already (10 days of use) and the sound is impressive. I was surprised by how clear and loud it is at max volume. The echo auto, used in conjunction with my echo at home is fantastic. I can control all my lights, my tv, my xbox, and more from my car. From anywhere, actually. More awesome is the fact that my car is not a cornucopia of technological advancements. All i have in there is a cigarette lighter and an aux input. All things considered, this product, and several of its other echo partners, was an awesome purchase. Especially at sale prices!

Chris P,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2019","I bought this to replace an Echo Dot 3 in my family room. My intention was to get improved audio quality for music.
The audio is somewhat better than the Dot3 that it replaced. However, this unit often fails to hear, or comprehend, my voice commands, and those of my wife, a problem which the Dot 3 that it replaced in precisely the same location never displayed.

In fact, the Dot 3 which I moved to an adjacent room often picks up my voice commands when I am speaking to the Echo in the family room, and the Dot 3 is about 3 times the distance away with no direct line-of-sight to the family room.
HOWEVER....
I was asked to return this item to Amazon, sending it to their Engineering lab. in Sunnyvale, which I did. A couple of days later the replacement unit arrived, and once it was up and running the difference was immediately obvious.
The replacement unit will respond to a quietly voiced command from across the room, and misunderstood commands are very, very few.
Thanks, Amazon! Great customer service and a good outcome.

T. Benedict,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2019","I already had one of the regular tall Echos (2nd gen) – and three Echo Dots. The Dots have very mediocre sound quality – even for listening to an NPR station w/o music. Really boomy bass no matter what I’ve tried. The other tall Echo was OK, but still pretty tubby in the bass. So I tried the Echo Plus and it completely blows everything else away. For the price it has decent sound. We don’t listen to much music on it because we can’t play iTunes on it (I think) or run the CD collection through it, but I would consider getting a second one for a stereo pair if I could play our CDs somehow through it.
Besides the radio, the only other thing I use it for is controlling a couple of lights in the house – I certainly do not want Alexa to rule my world. I wanted some radio in each room and to be able to shut off the overhead lights from the bed – and that was about it. They all work for the lights, but the Plus is the only one that really fits the bill for listening to music/radio.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jessica,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2018","I love Alexa! I’m glad I did my research and decided to go with the Echo Plus. Has the built in hub and within minutes of turning it on for the first time our house turned into a smart house. Set up for light bulbs and outlets was a breeze. Alexa reminds us and helps us with all sorts of stuff! The App is so easy to use too. So many things we are doing with it now and every day we find new ways to have her help out! I love this and now have dots in just about every major living space in the house and the Echo Plus in the kitchen.
The intercom feature is great for my teen who loves to shut her door and listen to music on the end of the house. I highly recommend the Echo Plus. Sound quality is perfection as well!!

Bonus: My five year old was not listening to me before the bus one morning. Instead of getting upset, I decided to set a reminder for 1 minute. One minute later Alexa came on and said she should put on her jacket and boots like your mom said or she will notify Santa that she was not being a good listener.

The Echo Plus immediately found the smart bulbs we installed, and we soon had a lighting scheme in place. Works like a charm. We love the built-in thermometer for the inside temperature. Setting up news briefings was breeze. We love that we can call out for music and most of the time it can find the song/album/artist. We have started an evening ritual of dancing in the kitchen, while supper is cooking. The sound quality is better than anything we have in the house. Maybe if you are a fussy audio snob, it won’t live up to unrealistic standards, but for the rest of us it is just right. Having the might of the internet at our command is also useful. The timer function is a boon when it comes to cooking. As a writer, being able to call out for various bits of research is handy, no need to open a browser and break the flow.

Donald C. Sanford,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2019","I am very disappointed in this. I have been using the Echo Dot for a month and thought I would come up with the perfect anniversary gift for our 30th. The Echo is muffled and is absolutely not worth the 70 dollar price difference. On top of that it goes on sale $40 less than what I paid to add insult to injury. Because it was over 7 days I could not get a price adjustment. Should have had our anniversary a couple weeks sooner!

People at work are waiting for my feedback to see if they should go with one of these and I can say with full confidence they need to pass on this one.

Update:

20 minutes after I posted this review my phone rang and it was a wonderful person from Amazon by the name of Kristina. She apologized for my experience and showed me how to adjust the bass, treble and midrange to give me the sound the device was meant to put out. She also arranged for me to return the Echo and buy another one to get the sale price. This is the gold standard of customer service that other businesses should strive for.

Charlie,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2020","This is a pretty good device for my needs; primarily streaming music and setting some timers. The device fills my 120 sq. ft. workshop space nicely with satisfyingly decent sound and the voice recognition for music search, general search and setting timers works well. Getting the device up and running was very straight-forward; aided by the clear email information and prompts from the device itself.

I also setup a Wyze power outlet and got it work with this device/Alexa for voice activation. Getting Alexa to recognize the Wyze device was a bit fussy, but I did eventually get it done. There are probably a lot more things it can do that I've not tried.

The full price I think is around $150, which was too expensive for me to be interested. A recent back to school sale convinced me to try it for about half that price and at around $80 it seems like a good value to me.

Ben Creighton,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2019","I have been so amazingly pleased with this Echo. I originally had an Echo Dot connected to a (very expensive) Bowers and Wilkins speaker. Now, that speaker is of very high quality in it's own right - and I spent about $800 on it. But, hooked up to an Echo via Bluetooth means there will be a delay before the audio ""kicks in"", in other words the speaker has to wake up once you ask Alexa a question - so you'll miss several seconds of the first reply. Furthermore, for a high end speaker that cost so much, the sound was really not all that impressive. I was very disappointed in the overall setup which I had spent close to a thousand dollars on. So I nixed the whole setup, and simply placed this 2nd Gen Echo Plus on my counter. Wow! The sound quality is excellent, the profile is very small, and as far as response, she can hear me from anywhere in the room at just a normal voice level. I don't have to shout.

Charlotte Keith,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2018","I really like the sound on these two speakers combined. I have a Bose, which always outperformed other small sound systems for me, but the Echo 2nd Gen--although individually not quite as good soundwise as Bose--sounds just as good when the two speakers are paired, and along with the subwoofer slightly outperform the Bose. The trebles are clear and the bass isn't overwhelming, but it's a good solid sound and feel. There's a good balance between treble and bass and you can ask Alexa to decrease or increase both. The volume level can also get extremely loud, which I found has been lacking in most speakers this size. The setup can be a little glitchy with the Alexa app, which seems buggy and is not that user friendly when it comes to setting up and pairing, but even I, who is no tech wiz, was able to figure it out and finally pair everything up. I've tried so many small speakers like this and have always been disappointed, so I'm glad I finally found some that live up to my expectations. Super happy I bought these.

leegart,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2020","This is replacing a first generation echo and it is a vast improvement in sound quality. The bass is more pronounced and generally better clarity. I bought a second one for stereo pairing and I think there is a big improvement over using one of these for mono. In mono, it can sounded over-loaded and mushy where pulling out individual instruments can be hard. If you pair this with another Echo Gen 3 (the current Echo Gen 2 Plus and Echo dots can also be paired), the stereo separation brings out the individual sounds more clearly. My only remaining criticism is that sometimes the mid-range vocals can sound less clear than on other speakers. Also, it does better with low or medium volume and starts distorting if you come close to maximum volume. For background music in an office, kitchen, or bedroom, this speaker is wonderful. Asking it to be the sound source for your party may be demanding more that it can deliver without distortion. Still, it is a good speaker for most purposes.",5.0 out of 5 stars

After about a week I noticed that at volume 5 playing music Alexa could not understand me to pause, stop or asking time or weather. I called and ask for Echo Support and the Representative suggested that I asked alexa to change the wake word, which I did and changed it to Echo and this resolved my problem I was experiencing. I would recommend this product to anyone who likes to listen to music or wanting to set up their home as a Smart Home it work fantasticly as I added Smart Lights and Smat Plugs. I will be adding Smart Locks and Security Camera soon. Amazon is great to help you with their products and they stand behind them also..",5.0 out of 5 stars
Matt Bailey,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2019","I originally bought the Bose 500 and was disappointed. The sound was great, but it didn't have full Alexa functionality. I returned it and bought two Echo Pluses for less money. It has full Alexa functionality and awesome sound.

I love the stereo pair functionality. Definitely a better sound that larger, more expensive speakers that cost more than two combined. I can now use custom alarms to wake up to. Alexa multi-room music and much more.

The zigbee hub works well with all of my Hue and Samsung products. Alexa gets smarter every day. Hands free audio to ask for information beats staring at screens all day long.

I am a huge Audible fan and the way this sinks with everything else is spectacular. On the road I use my phone and bluetooth. When I get home this picks up exactly where I left off with a simple voice alarm. Setting a sleep timer works on both music and Audible. Definitely a must have for music and smart home automation.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Keon,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2020","I have two Sons systems, one in each of my houses and I can tell you that this little Echo speaker sounds just as good, maybe a tad lacking in the highs, as the Sonos One. If there was a way to add these Echos throughout the house, I would replace Sonos immediately. The Songs app is unbelievably bad and ruins the whole experience. Now we have one Echo 3rd get in the kitchen and a 2nd get in the master bath and to be able to play music out of both is pretty awesome, the intercom feature is cool, and making phone calls hands free is such a convenience.

Amazon is headed the right way with Alexa and Echo. I don't care that they are listening in on me. People get so petrified of that. Who cares? I'm not important. Nobody cares what I have to say. If they want to listen to me, let them. Both speakers have a mute button so you can turn off Alexa from hearing what you say. I never use it.

Overall good experience from both speakers.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Tyler Kiser,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2018","I currently own a 1st gen echo, a 1st gen dot, multiple 2nd gen dots, a Fire TV Cube, and now this. I bought an Echo 2nd gen when they came out. Received it, and was extremely disappointed with the sound quality. I returned it within 2 hours of setting it up.

The Echo Plus 2nd gen blows the previous units away. I get crisp, clear sound with plenty of bass. The volume is great, and the mic array is fantastic (I admit, the mics were great in the 2nd gens too). She hears me from all over the first floor where the unit is centrally located, and sometimes from the second floor. No need to shout, the mics are sensitive enough. I can also play music on the max setting, say ""Alexa"" in a regular tone (I can't even hear myself say it), and she'll pick it right up.

Our 1st gen Echo was getting a bit hard of hearing and was retired to the basement. She still plays great sound though. The 2nd gen mic array and enhanced stereo was a great upgrade.",5.0 out of 5 stars
SLB,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2019","I have every generation Echo and love them all. One broke only because I dropped it on a granite floor. Other drops have not harmed them.

I am not an audiophile, but the sound on this is satisfying for the way I listen. Volume range is great. I listen to pop and rock a great deal, nature sounds for sleeping, and right now some opera arias. I am happy with all of them.

The new look is wonderful. I like that it is shorter and wider. More stable on a shelf or table.

I do a great deal of house sitting and take many of my own things with me. This is getting packed in that travel bag!

The only negative I find is that the fabric cover somewhat covers the light ring on top, and the light seems less bright.

No comparison as they are not even in the same league with each other any more. The crisp sound with amazing bass that comes out of these new Echos are mind blowing.

Kristan,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2020","I avoided Alexa for a very long time. Why would I want something in my house that can listen to me? Then I realized, my cell phone is with me constantly, and THAT was listening to me, so what’s the difference? I hopped on board, and purchased an Alexa 3rd generation.

I am completely impressed. The sound quality is awesome for an inexpensive little speaker. I’m not an audio expert, but this little device rivals a small Bose speaker which I had way back in the way back days, when Bose was what everyone was talking about.

Voice recognition is awesome. It can even understand garbled kid speak.

I originally bought the Alexa to keep next to my bed to listen to relaxing music before bed, but Alexa is more than music, and can do a bunch of things. It’s like having a personal assistant to boss around.

JacobDrJ,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2024","I bought a pair of these a few years ago to use in stereo configuration as an upgrade to my 2nd gen echo dot and 1st gen echo classic.

I never kept this configuration, as having these 2 speakers synchronize was very flakey, and when they did work, didn't provide enough of a benefit for my non-audiophile family members who primarily use these.

Instead, I split the pair up, and gave one to each kid who wanted one.

This has been fine.

Usually sound very good to our ears, and with some quirks having to do with the music occasionally going to the wrong device, mostly these have been a nice experience with a family Amazon Music subscription.

With that said, I decided to try one of these speakers for use in my office, to boost the sound from my anemic laptop speakers, using the aux-in/line-in functionality.

However, I discovered that, unlike the 2nd generation echo dot, this 3rd generation echo is very quiet when a line in aux in is inserted. You can't just increase the volume, as that would cause the Alexa functionality to become unbearably loud.

It took a long time, and support unfortunately offered no help, but I just discovered a solution from the Amazon community messageboard:

You must go into the Amazon Alexa app on your phone.
Find the device whose Aux-In is too quiet.
Go to that device's settings.
Under 'General' select 'Sounds'.
Under 'Alarms, Timers, And Notifications' increase the volume to maximum.
Go back to save the settings.

And that's it!
Now the Line In is much louder, without the Alexa functionality becoming too loud.

This increased my appreciation and utility of this smart speaker.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Also, one other nitpick, I bought a new Fire tv for my bedroom, and was excited to pair it up for surround sound (using my 3rd gen to test it with plans to order two more if it sounded good) and it’s not compatible.

AmazonShopper1290,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2022","Where to even begin? I’ll start with the most annoying.

Alexa very frequently “forgets” the smart plugs I’ve set up. That includes brands that are very highly rated, and they are plugs that are supposed to be supported by the Alexa app. They’ll work with Alexa for a week or so, but then Alexa loses track of them and tells me they’re not connected. I’m forced to try to reconnect them to Alexa but to no avail. She simply doesn’t “see” them. I’m forced to control those plugs with their individual apps such as Kasa or Wemo, which proves they’re on the network and functioning, EXCEPT for Alexa not wanting to connect to them.

And you know what’s “funny”? The only plugs that Alexa doesn’t “forget” or refuse to reconnect to are the Amazon brand ones which cost more than all the others. An Echo dot costs $15 but an Amazon smart plug is $25? Hmmm.

This is the biggest reason for my dissatisfaction.

Smaller issues: I talk to one Echo right next to me, and the one in the next room is the one that responds. WHY??

I tell the living room Echo to turn on living room light. “Living room light is not responding.” I tell the same Echo again to turn on the living room light, and it works. Or I tell the kitchen Echo to turn on living room light, and this time it works.

There is no way to turn off unwanted suggestions or sales pitches. Supposedly you’re supposed to be able to do that in the app, but I haven’t been able to find it.

I tell Echo Show to show a slideshow of my photos. When I first bought it over a year ago, it would play the slideshow until I told it to do something else.

Longer Review;

After dragging my heels for over a year, I finally bought our first Echo (2nd Generation) back in August. I loved it so much that I got us 2 more for other areas in the house. Being able to group them and play the same music or audio throughout the house is a novelty that won't grow old for me. I've only wished that they had a little more full sound, especially at higher volume. I'd considered the last Echo Plus, but the average of reviews I read didn't make it appear to perform significantly better than our already great 2nd Generation Echos.

When I saw this new Echo Plus listed, I pre-ordered it to ""replace"" the Heather Grey Echo in our kitchen and move that one to our bedroom. We tend to have music playing in the kitchen more than any other room, and I wanted slightly better sound than the regular Echo in there. I'm honestly glad we took a chance on this device without any reviews to go by.

Appearance;

As you can see in the photos, it's pretty much identical in height to the 2nd Generation Echo. It is a bit wider to accommodate the larger speakers, and the top is slightly domed instead of being flat. A similar 7-microphone array is on top and they seem to work just as well. There also appears to be a tripod-style connector on the base of the unit.

Setup;

Setup was surprisingly easy as this Echo Plus detected our network settings on its own. I plugged it in, it did its initial startup, and then told me the device was connected. Simple as that.

Audio compared to 2nd Generation Echo;

Highs are clearer.
Mids are more natural and better-defined.
Lows are deeper.
Overall volume is noticeably louder and sound quality is improved.
When paired with our other Echos, music and audio is in sync everywhere and this device stands out above the others in audio performance.

General Performance;

We have a quick network and I don't notice any perceivable performance difference between this new Echo Plus and our regular 2nd Generation Echos. Everything seems to work as it should.

I bought this with the ""free"" Philips Hue bulb promotion. This bulb is our first Zigbee device and works very well with the Echo Plus. It is easily controlled by either the Echo Plus or the other Echos we have in the house. I'll be keeping an eye out for deals on these bulbs in the future. Like our other Echos, it also has no problem controlling our Kasa Smart Plugs.

Overall;

While $150 is a lot for a single speaker, for what I was looking for, this thing excels. If you like the 2nd Generation Echo but hoped it sounded a bit better, I would highly recommend this. Based on what I've read, if you were disappointed with the audio performance with the 1st Generation Echo Plus but want everything else it had to offer, consider giving this wonderful speaker a try.

P.S.: The internal ambient temperature sensor seems fairly accurate and nice to have included.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jazzyguy,"Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2019","I bought this speaker on a whim. I'm already the owner of a couple of Echo Dots. I have one paired with a Samsung sound bar in my living room. I had the other connected to a Vaux speaker in my bedroom. I was fine. I didn't need to buy the Echo Plus. Or so I thought.Yesterday, my girlfriend bribed me to go shopping with her at an outlet mall by telling me I could have free reign in the Bose store located there. I was pretty impressed by the Bose Home 500. Great bass. Exceptional stereo separation. Very large price tag—even the factory referbished model which I was considering buying. Ultimately, the price tag, as well as some unresolved questions I had concerning compatibility with other devices caused me not to purchase the Bose speaker. But it did get me to thinking. Could I get more premium sound in my bedroom? Could I get better sound out of my Amazon Fire enabled TV?Initially, I planned to buy the Echo Plus directly from Amazon, but I elected to buy it from Best Buy, because I would've had to wait for three days for Amazon to ship it to me. We do live in an age of instant gratification, don't we?I got the tiny Amazon Plus home, unboxed it, and had basic setup completed within two minutes. Following that, I paired it with my Amazon Fire enabled TV, and I started putting the speaker through its paces.Overall, the sound quality is very good. Not exceptional, but very good. The bass is punchy and loud. The stereo separation is underwhelming, but the quality itself almost makes up for that. With a little tweaking of the bass, mid, and trebble settings, I was able to get the speaker to sound more than acceptable at all volume levelsAfter playing with the TV a bit, the next task was to add the speaker to my media groups. Nothing could ever have been simpler. I then set about pairing the Plus with my outdoor speakers—a pair of Sound Appeals which I also bought from Amazon. Again, almost too easy. Then I paired the Plus with the water proof bluetooth speaker I use in my shower. Easy again. Best of all: The plus automatically connects to the TV and the additional speakers whenever I turn them on.My next task will be to pair the device with the free smart bulb I received with my purchase. I anticipate no problems.Bottom line: Great sound and easy and versatile connectivity for a great price. I could not be ghappier!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Homer,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2018","I am a huge fan of the Echo. I have the tap, the dot, the standard Echo and an Echo smart speaker, and now the plus.

This one is definitely a step up. The best sound and response of all the previous models.

In a nut shell
The dot is ok. Limited quality sound but small and unobtrusive. Nice for a bedside alarm, weather information and morning news while shaving.

The tap is the portable and battery powered option that I use in the morning. I listen to a streaming cable news show. I listen to it while in the shower, (it is not waterproof but I have a shelf far from water that it sits on), then while I shave, and I put it in the closet while getting ready and dressed. It's like a portable radio but it allows me to stream internet cable and listen to anything I want.

The standard Echo and Echo with smart options is a great device. The addition of the smart features is ok. It allows you to turn on lights and fixtures, but going into a dark room and saying, ""Alexa, turn on lights!"" is not as easy as flipping a switch. It is ok for lights that are not near the bed and your heading to sleep. But, you'll wake people up by shouting the wake up command.

This one is good for two reasons:
1.) The sound is great. Better than the others.
2.) I got a smart switch and can use it to turn on any number of devices. The hook up was easy and flawless.

Also,
Alexa is adding new skills. If you use a sound machine, she has a sound maker for sleeping. Wake up to the weather, the stock market, the news, a fact from history, and a joke of the day.

If you are on the cusp of buying this device, making this your first Echo would be a great choice. If you have an Echo or tap, this is a good upgrade.",5.0 out of 5 stars
J. C. Lindy,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2020","I love having my Echo in the kitchen where I can listen to music (great speaker quality including bass!), podcasts, baseball games or news. I have used it to remind me of important meetings, check the weather, and of course, check the progress of ordered Amazon items. I also have 4 Echo Dots and an Echo show in the the house and it's been very nice to be able to link them and play music all over the house while I am cleaning or check in on the grandkids playing upstairs and call them down for dinner. It is also linked to our Ring doorbell which is very helpful because we have the system but no extra chimes so it alerts us through our iPads and phones which sometimes are set on mute and so fail to alert us of someone at the door. The Echos are much better for that, and that skill was easy to enable. We bought one for our mountain cabin, and I even talked to my husband there from home without a phone, because the Dot there is connected to our account. We can also listen for any activity there. My Echo Dot in the patio room helped me when I was accidentally locked out of the house without my phone. Luckily the patio window was open so I just called through it to Alexa to call my husband to come back to the house to let me in. I keep thinking this would have so helped to have when my father-in-law was alive. We tried to get him to wear a life alert after a few dangerous falls, but could never convince him. We could have set him up on internet (which he would never want on his own) linked a few dots and if he fell, if he could still speak, he could call us, OR we could check in on him and if he didn't respond, we could call for help. I mention this in case someone reads this who has an elderly relative who is resistant to using those other systems. Overall, I love the Echo Devices and find I am discovering more and more helpful functions they perform.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2019","Pro bundle with Sub Overview

Pro: Quality Built, Quality Sound, Functionality, Small form factor, Volume (low and high), Perfect amount of Base

Cons: Connecting all three to act like a system is finicky and dosen't work when you set it as an alarm. Only will play off one so you miss out on some of the rich sound when waking up. But a plus since it isn't as loud.

Long Review:
I have to say these are amazing. I have had a lot of amazon products and these surprised me the moment I started them up. First off these get loud for their size and the audio clarity is amazing. They are crisp, clear and sound amazing. Now if you like heavy heavy base then these aren't the speakers for you. I bought the package with 2 speakers and the sub and they are perfect for me. The base is well controlled and gives the sound that is lacking in many speakers but if you want the base to shake the walls and make it sound like a floor speaker with a 12 inch amplified drum then don't try. But if you are looking for a clean, rich, bold and sophisticated listening experience then these are amazing. Much better than anything I have tried in the $350 price point.

If you want something that is loud, base heavy with good high and mid tones better than this then look at spending 700 or more. I listen to everything from classical music to EDM, Rock, rap, pop, country, jazz and folk and these just keep impressing me. The vocals aren't drowned out and you can hear all the instruments and the base fills in the lows at the perfect listening experience.

Summary: If you are looking for rich, deep, bold music this is the set for you. Better than anything in the 350 to 450 market. (I have tried 20 in this market) If you are looking for wall pounding, rave quality base then you better live on your own or in a frat house cause more than this you will need a floor speaker with amplifier and thick walls. PS I own a full amplified speaker set housed in my living room for when I was in college and a fraternity. Nothing against them but horrible for all day listening and having friends over to talk and not drink all day haha

Note: I have both echos and the sub in my bedroom and the room is too small for all 3. I barley raise the volume past level 3, maybe 4 if I am listening to them in the shower. I moved them to my living room for the pre and post Superbowl party and they filled a medium 4 bedroom 3 bath house with crystal clear music.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Eddie Jay,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2019","Enough has been written about the Echo Plus that I don’t need to go over all of its features. I will say in general that it looks cool, sounds fine (maybe a 5 out of 10 compared to real speakers), the music playing capabilities are excellent with Amazon, Apple, Pandora, and Spotify, and the voice recognition is ok - good not great. I had no problem connecting to a Phillips Hue bulb and eventually an Echo dot and a smart outlet. I use all the time to play music and radio, control lights, and make shopping lists. I bought on sale at the end of 2018 for $97.99 which I think was a great deal.

That said, I want to focus in on a four major issues that I wish I’d known about before buying:

1. Podcasts
There is no native podcast skill on Alexa so you need to get podcasts through TuneIn, Stitcher, iHeartRadio, etc. All my other devices (computer, mobile) are Apple products where I use the Podcast app to listen and sync. The podcasts I listen to are not all on any one of these skills so I would need to download all the ones I need to keep podcasts synced between Alexa and my iPhone which is too much trouble. Plus I have a heck of the time trying to tell Alexa what podcast I want to listen to - who remembers the episode titles or numbers of the podcast they are currently listening to? Even just asking it to play the latest episode of a podcast wasn’t working for me 9/10 times so I just gave up and figured I will connect my iPhone over Bluetooth when I want to continue a podcast. But that brings me to my next issue:

2. Bluetooth connections
I was successful at pairing the Echo to both my iPhone and iPad but Alexa can’t connect to the one I want when I ask it to. If I ask to “connect to my iPhone”, it connects to my iPad. If I ask it to “connect to my phone”, it still connects to my iPad. The only way to get it to connect to my iPhone with a voice command is to turn Bluetooth off on my iPad - annoying!

3. Multiple users
This is a big one. It is great that the Echo can have multiple users on it, so my wife and I can share the Echo using our separate accounts which are linked in Prime under the same household. You can even set it up to recognize each of your separate voices. However, ONLY THE PRIMARY ACCOUNT CAN CONTROL THE SMART HOME DEVICES. This means that if I want to control the lights and the Echo is set to use my account, I have to tell it to switch to my wife’s account first, then give it a command for the lights. Furthermore, you have command it to switch between accounts to use your personal skills and settings. Given that it can recognize my voice as distinct from my wife’s, I thought that if I asked to play something on Pandora, it would automatically play from my account. Nope - I need to tell it to switch from my wife’s account to my account, and then ask it to play something on Pandora. Want to turn the lights down? Have to switch back to my wife’s account. Want to play something else on my Pandora? Have to switch back to my account first. What is the point of having voice recognition if it can’t automatically detect who is speaking and use that person’s account? And what is so useful about having multiple accounts if they can’t both control the smart home devices? I can't control the smart home devices from my app, only my wife can, and I can't set up routines either. And last, there are some things I would like to be discrete to my account only - like shopping lists and reminders - but those have to be shared, so my wife’s Alexa app on her phone is getting reminders that I set up. There are some major kinks here they need to work out, but the good news is that it’s all just software fixes so GET ON IT AMAZON!

4. Routines
Another big one here. There is a well-documented glitch that people experience with Echos where the music stops playing after one song. You have to ask it to keep playing in order to keep going to the next song. If you google “echo stops playing” you will see lots of discussion around this. Well we had it happen to us as soon as we set up routines. Routines are little scripts you can set up - actions Alexa can take when certain criteria are met. This is one of the primary reasons we went with the Plus instead of the Dot. We have pets in the house and we wanted to set up a routine where the Echo would send us an alert if the house temperature got above or below a certain amount. Well unfortunately as soon as we set up the routines, the Echo started doing the thing where it stops playing after one song. So we deleted the routines and reset the Echo and the problem has not come back. But now I am afraid to set up any routines because I don’t want to deal with the music playback issue. I hope they fix this glitch because not having routines is a big drawback.

5. Alexa Guard
I was also excited to learn that the Alexa Guard feature can alert you if it hears broken glass or smoke alarm sounds. But it’s not available yet. Still waiting for that.

If I knew someone interested in buying an Echo, I would recommend they try an earlier generation Echo Dot which you can get on craigsist for $20-30 and see how you like that before spending $150 on the latest Echo Plus. Too many bugs still need to be fixed.",4.0 out of 5 stars
James Aldrich,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2019","Hello All,

I received my Echo Plus on October 7th. It was so easy to set up for the most part. I plugged it in and in a few short minutes, it was online ready to play! The sound for its small size was awesome~! I wouldn't think one would want much more than that right? I purchased this unit since I wanted Alexa to speak the indoor temperature. I tried saying or doing a number of things but the indoor temperature eluded me. I imagined having a device which wouldn't need outdoor wired or wireless probes with batteries. I would already have accurate outdoor temperature info as well as the indoor temperature and no need for probes of any kind. I think I spent hours trying to get the indoor temperature to speak with Alexa. I could go into the Alexa App select the echo plus and read the indoor temperature through my phone, So why couldn't she speak the indoor temperature! I learned later that a sensor had to be activated. It's a shame that Alexa couldn't have activated the Sensor. An Amazon help person tried to tell me what I needed to find but I think I was dealing with graphics. I am totally blind and use voiceover on my IPhone. I couldn't find the sensor or anything else to activate the indoor temperature so it would speak. I watched some youtube videos but none of these helped. Perhaps I'll approach disability services to see if they know of a solution to this! I deregistered the echo plus from my account and put it back in the box. If I can't find any solution for finding the sensor and turning on the indoor temperature, the echo plus is heading back to Amazon. I'll stay with my tried and true echos.

Jim

I am happy to say that I didn’t send my Echo plus back after all! I removed it from its box before registering to my account again! At first, I couldn’t see the indoor temperature on my phone. I planned to call disability services. Four hours later, I checked my phone after selecting the Echo Plus and saw the indoor temperature again! I thought I’d get brave and ask Alexa to give me the inside temperature. I said, echo, temperature inside! She spoke it to my relief! I also said, Echo, inside temperature. She repeated it again! I was pleased! Something may not have been right in the first registration or I wasn’t giving her the right verbage! I don’t know what happened for certain! I didn’t have to activate anything! It worked right away! I didn’t call disability services. My wife has ordered another one which will be used upstairs!

Long live the echo plus! Hope this or another generation of the echo plus with built on in hub will be available for a long time! The indoor temperature is an excellent feature!

Alan,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2019","Sound Quality is an improvement to the 2nd gen echo. After about 2 weeks of moderate usage at 60-70% volume the speaker has sounded better than it did day one, as most speakers need time to break-in.

Comparing it to the 2nd gen echo you can definitely hear a difference. There is a bit more low end compared to the 2nd however, I find the mid range to be more refined on the 2nd gen as the 3rd gen has more low end and high end sound.

To get this straight. This speaker isn’t meant to provide room filling rich sound as it is only a single firing 3 inch woofer and a tweeter enclosed in a compact plastic housing. If your looking at rich sounding sound docks, bose soundtouch 20 or 30 would fulfill that much better and even though those are more room filling as well, audiophiles will still find it much suited to having an actual speaker and amp setup. I myself am considered an audio snob and I love playing around with audio equipment.

I’m not going to compare the echo to a proper 7.2.2 channel setup but compare it to speakers in its class. Being that this is an Amazon Alexa Device it is a very useful tool in addition to your smartphone. I currently have 6 echos throughout the house and they do what they are supposed to do and that is having voice commands for lights and even notifications for your ring system as well as other smart devices you link to your Alexa account. Having the ability to connect Bluetooth to your phone is great as well if your not looking for a portable battery powered Bluetooth speaker.

My main reason for purchasing this echo is the new speaker which attracted me to purchasing this and I mainly use it only in the kitchen as having background music and being able to control lights and sound while working on other things. Sound is great for the kitchen and it is plenty loud enough with very balanced sound and I find the bass to be good for it’s size. I would like to put my bose soundtouch in the kitchen but it takes up too much room and I can just place this in a corner and it’s compact enough that you won’t have to worry about knocking it over. However I have setup my echo dot onto a sound dock and linked the multi room audio so I can have music playing through Apple Music in all rooms through the echos which I think is what sets this speaker apart from let’s say the much more expensive Sonos or Bose Soundlinks. Only downside I wish I could do is have Bluetooth work with multi audio instead of having to play playlists or through other streaming services on the echo.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Ritvik N,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2020","I bought this mostly to supplant my 3rd gen Echo Dot (actually I'm moving that to another room) - also the fact that the Echo was on sale at a reasonably modest price didn't hurt either. For this price tag though, I would expect this Echo to slightly over-perform on 2 latest generation Echo Dots (as of current price, this Echo is a little over twice the cost of an Echo Dot) - does it deliver on this front though? My opinion is somewhat of a mixed bag on this. Keeping in mind I've only had this Echo for the weekend, but I certainly wouldn't say that it ""overperforms"" versus 2 Echo Dots. At best it probably has the power - in terms of speaker decibel and voice range, I suppose - of 1 and 1/2 Echo Dots. So possibly in the end I would peg it as worth 1.5 echo dots, when costwise its definitely around 2.5 echo dots. However, I think I wouldn't grade this Echo harshly purely for that reason. The speaker volume is still fine, and I'm not sure about the hearing range as that was a concern of mine going in - our house living room is somewhat sprawling, and sometimes echo dot can't hear me - but on the box I read it listens in a ""far-field"" range, whatever the heck that means, and overall I would say the hearing range is slightly improved over the echo dot. So already it recuperates on the 1 star that I would otherwise take off for its speaker - I would bring that down to 1/2 star down so far though.

The main minus point to me is the Alexa integration. This is truthfully not a problem with the Echo at all, but with Alexa itself. Alexa is still somewhat primitive, I would liken it to a conversational Neanderthal human I suppose, so it doesn't really do many useful things for me at present. Of the things it can do, it's sometimes frustrating to use it. To give a few examples:

* It commonly misinterprets what I would say, perhaps of my accent (I am to blame here I suppose, as well?) even though I have set up my voice profile on Alexa app. I've also set up voice profile of another household member, but when they confirm it with ""Alexa, do you know who I am?"" it responds with ""I'm not sure, but you're on <my name>'s account"". I understand it's a continuously learning and evolving software or something, so I suppose that doesn't really warrant any stars to be taken off at this point, at least by itself. The real kicker is it responds really stupidly to some common questions you might ask a (presumably) smart AI. For instance, we were worried our dog might have a concussion as she hit her head while running around in a dog park. ""Alexa, what's a concussion?"" got us some drawling utter rubbish about a movie or some piece of entertainment which we don't want to know. Follow this by an ""Alexa, stop that"", wait 2 more boring second, and follow that up with a slightly reworded ""Alexa, what's a medical concussion?"" and finally it spit it out a (reasonably) favorable answer. It still didn't give us a short abbreviated and useful headline though - Google on my phone had it beat in that regards. Another mildly annoying thing is it prefixed its long drawn out response with a ""here's, what I found, on <source>"". Alexa, goddammit it, it's a simple question, I don't honestly care where you find it. I suppose this might be useful in the interests of complete transparence, but often times I wouldn't care to hear it. I mean, I can just whip out my phone and type in ""concussion"" on Google and scroll to read the headline under the top result by the time she gets to the part of it that i want to hear. I would take off 0.5 stars for just Alexa being Alexa and inconveniencing me by either misinterpreting or just ignoring me when I ask her something (this happened to someone else in my household as well). Sometimes blue light goes when I say ""Alexa"" and it immediately turns off, sending everything else I say that follows the wake word into a black hole of oblivion, for all intents and purposes. I would just hope it gets a little more intuitive, and less stressful, to use Alexa voice control in the future.

* I set up an Alexa-sourced contact (in the Alexa app) and gave it the name, shall we say for an example sake, of ""Joodas"" (this is based on how you'd pronounce a name, here 'Judas'). I have an existing contact in my phone under the name ""Judas Johnson Barber Shop"" (just a fake name, but assume it's just anything starting with the key word). After I set this up, when I speak ""Alexa, call Joodas"" (again, spelled how you'd pronounce it) to call the new Alexa-sourced contact, I would expect it to follow through on this unambiguous command without requiring any confirmation of any sort - right? Unfortunately, Alexa is not very bright on this. Instead, it asks me, ""Judas Johnson Barber Shop, right?"" I'm a little pissed here, because I just created a contact that is spelled exactly how you'd pronounce 'Judas'. But Alexa, under no circumstances, will ever use that contact - it's fixated on my old ""Judas Barber Shop"" contact for some reason. So fast forward, me trying a couple things. I added an underscore to my existing phone contact, (foolishly) thinking it would stop Alexa from following the trial that really leads nowhere good. Instead, in response to my request to call Joodas, she instead prompts, ""underscore Judas Johnson Barber Shop, right?"" I'm slowly but incrementally getting a bit more pissed, and someone else suggests me to reorganize the words in the contact itself. So yeah, a little bit painful (and not my ideal solution at all), but I rename the said phone contact to ""Johnson Judas Barber Shop"". FINALLY, Alexa starts responding as expected when I say to call Joodas. However, I would note she does prompt me to confirm: ""Joodas, right?"" Yes, my dear Alexa, there is only one contact in my phone by that name, and I recently added it to the Alexa app itself (not even as a nickname, just the name of the contact itself!) So yeah, all in all, not my greatest experience - or my greatest moment either, judging from how I handled it. I would translate that to maybe 0.2 off my rating on this.

* Setting cooking timer with ""Alexa, set a timer for <duration>"" sometimes misfires, requiring Alexa to reprompt ""Ok, for how long?"". After timer expires, I realized after a while she does this weird thing where her blue light keeps glowing, and she plays some beep sound really really softly. For the life of me I can't understand why the timer alarm is so soft. I couldn't barely hear it one of the times, but luckily someone else hear it and they cancelled the alarm. I really have no clue why it's so hard to hear it, even on high volume.

* There are a few other issues that we might have experienced but I can't remember off the top my head.

Overall, I would giving this a rating of 3.8 / 5. But for fairness sake I have round it to 4 star, and also as most of my complaints are to Alexa and not the Echo device itself. For the Echo, I would also rate it as a solid 4. Most of the rating that I took off is due to its pricing as I do not believe it is worth 2.5 echo dots as it is currently. However, it's still a solid device and I suppose a little better than the echo dot that we previously had, at least. I don't really notice a huge difference, however. Still, can't really go wrong with a device like the Echo though - I would say that it does well for the features that it is touted to have. Overall, i would rate it as a ""meh"", but end up saying that in a slightly spirited and uplifting voice, so it's definitely a step up from the 3rd gen echo dot at least.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Cathy,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2019","Sometimes when you ask a person question, Echo will but into conversation and answer even though you never said ""Alexa"". She is getting better. One thing you should know if you own any Hub whether it is an Echo, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, or whatever people will hear you even if you think the speaker is off. I just think you should know that.

Personally, I feel since they can listen in on you with your cell phones what does it matter. You can always unplug, and turn off your internet. If you do research about this on the net try using .gov, .org. , or .edu websites. I learned in school these are more likely to be true.

So, why get a Hub? I love it because it makes life a lot easier. If I want to know anything, I ask my Google hub ( she knows more info because she is better with web searching than Alexa). If I want to spell something I ask Alexa (she is a better speller).

You can use any hub to ask about weather, how to cook something, games, read you a book, play music, news, turn on/off smart stuff like... plugs, lights, thermostats, TV, coffee makers, dryer/washers etc.... It can work smart cameras, smart beds. You can ask, is the back bedroom light on, They are coming out with new stuff for them to do all the time. I can't wait until they come out with a ""clean my house"" command. lol Also, you can call someone ( I often call my own phone because I lost it in the house lol ) ETC....

Please note, I do feel it is dangerous to let a smart device control locks, garage doors, cameras in your home, or anything else that might be a security threat. As you know there are a lot of hackers out there that are willing to take advantage of others. Even the cops are hacking ring door bells ( the Washington Post had written an article about it).

I own two of the Echo Plus (2nd Gen), one Echo Dot (3rd Gen), 2 Google Homes, and 2 Google Minis. Ok - I admit I went a little over board . lol

Things to know...

1. When you buy Alexa you can hook her up to your Amazon acct. I like doing that online when I am buying it.

2. However, once you get an Alexa, and plug it in at home, the Alexa will ask you about hooking up to your voice, to account. If you say yes, Alexa tries to sell you stuff a lot. Example: I asked for the price of Duct tape, and Alexa said, ""I put the Duct tape in your shopping cart"". So, I feel it's better just to hook it up online only, and not hook it up to your voice after you have it at your house.

3. Alexa can start off very buggy. However, if she is buggy after about 17, or 18 days Alexa works out many of her bugs.

4. If you get Alexa, I would recommend getting Prime membership. If you do have an Amazon Prime membership you will get a lot of songs. However, some you have to pay another yearly fee, on top of your Amazon Prime membership fee. Ouch!

5. For keeping cost down I feel that the Google is better.
Google Home gives you a lot of free stuff like bedtime stories, music, ETC. Where Alexa you have to pay for just about everything. The more stuff you get the more it will add up. An example is Alexa bed time stories are $79.99 plus tax a year if you are a Prime member. If you are not, it will cost you $99.98 plus tax. Again Amazon-Ouch!

However, if I had a lot of money, I think I would like Alexa a little bit better than Google. Tough call.

If you want to read more about the Google, and Alexa because you don't know what you want than read below. Hope this helps...

Compare Amazon Alexa hubs to Google hubs.

Google is easier to use because it understands more words, and phrases.

The Echo Plus sounds better than the Google Home. So, if you want great sound with Google Home, you might want to get a good speaker for it. The sound is really I'm All Bout That Bass, Bout That Bass (I mean it's all about the speaker quality). Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

You will find that there are some songs Amazon doesn’t have at all no matter what you pay. They are normally the rare songs. One example is Night Beach by Dream Singer.

While Google Home, works with every song out there that can be downloaded for free. Just pick a song you own from your iTunes, computer, or whatever song that you already paid for, and upload it yourself for free (easy to do, just YouTube it). After that you can create your own playlist.

Google has a lot more choices when it comes to making up routines. Google also has quiz games that you can have more than one player. Google ask you how many people are playing each time . Alexa does have quiz games, but they are only for one player unless you add MultiPlayer Skill. Even with adding MultiPlayer you have to ask Alexa before starting the game. If you don't ask Alexa in the right way, she gets mixed up.

Alexa has more brand name smart devices, but not more kinds of devices. Example: Alexa will work with an Foscam security camera, and Google will not. However, there are plenty of security cameras that work with both Google Home, and Alexa. So, they both work the same kind of stuff.

The Echo Plus (it must be the plus that has the thermostat in it) can tell you room temp. The Google doesn't do the room temp. However, you can buy a smart thermostat for your home to hook up to the Google. They both will tell you the outside temp.

Google tracks packages throw Gmail, so it can be ant package, but it is tricky to set a Google Home up to Gmail. Alexa tracks only Amazon packages. Alexa lets you know when you have a package at your door from Amazon by a lighted ring on top of the device.

I feel Alexa can be nosey, and rude. One example: Once it asked me if I had a tattoo, and I said that's a personal question. Then it asked ""what kind of tattoo do you have?"" Then I said you shouldn't be asking questions like that. Then it said that it wanted a black bird tattoo.

The point is that It assumed that I had a tattoo, and would not drop the subject. It will ask you a lot of questions if you let it, so it knows what stuff to try to sell you. I have learned to watch what I say, so there is not as much sales pressure. Also, I say ""Alexa Stop"" about two or three times in a row. That way it stops talking.

The Home Google is very polite. Also, it doesn't try to sell stuff to you. I hope Home Google stays that way.

Both Alexa, and Home Google have improved over time, and still are improving. They will keep trying to outdo each other. I do like having both of them. I hope this helps.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Craig M Moore,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2018","I want to start off by saying that I love Amazon as a company, so this isn't a hate review on Amazon. BUT, I do feel deceived by amazon on this.

The Echo Plus does have a ""smart hub"" that uses Zigbee to connect to various smart home devices. HOWEVER, the Echo Plus can only utilize the PHILLIPS HUE system in a limited capacity. In order to get full use out of the HUE bulbs, you still have to buy the HUE BRIDGE.

What you can do with the Echo Plus alone:
1. Voice Control the lights.
2. Change the color of the lights by voice, BUT you are limited to about 20 colors instead of the ""16 million colors"" that the HUE bulbs are capable of.
3. You can set routines and groups, which is nice.

What you CANT do without the HUE Bridge:
1. Compatibility with many more sensors
2. The ability to automate and set scenes
3. get system updates over the air and future features.
4. Have your lights sync with music
5. Probably more, but I can't remember.

Also, if you change devices, or switch to a HUE hub, odds are you will have to redo all of your lights.

What bothers me more than anything is that the product page for the Echo Plus CLEARLY states compatibility with the HUE system, and even use the HUE APP logo as shown in the picture. That's great, except that you MUST have a HUE BRIDGE to use the app, which is another $50-60 on top of the already expensive investment of the bulbs.
Craig
I would like to see Amazon clarify that the HUE BRIDGE is necessary for the full HUE system, but I doubt it will happen. Alternatively, I would to see them bundle the Echo Plus and HUE together so that you can get the full system right out of the box.

JacobDrJ,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2024","I bought a pair of these a few years ago to use in stereo configuration as an upgrade to my 2nd gen echo dot and 1st gen echo classic.

I never kept this configuration, as having these 2 speakers synchronize was very flakey, and when they did work, didn't provide enough of a benefit for my non-audiophile family members who primarily use these.

Instead, I split the pair up, and gave one to each kid who wanted one.

This has been fine.

Usually sound very good to our ears, and with some quirks having to do with the music occasionally going to the wrong device, mostly these have been a nice experience with a family Amazon Music subscription.

With that said, I decided to try one of these speakers for use in my office, to boost the sound from my anemic laptop speakers, using the aux-in/line-in functionality.

However, I discovered that, unlike the 2nd generation echo dot, this 3rd generation echo is very quiet when a line in aux in is inserted. You can't just increase the volume, as that would cause the Alexa functionality to become unbearably loud.

It took a long time, and support unfortunately offered no help, but I just discovered a solution from the Amazon community messageboard:

You must go into the Amazon Alexa app on your phone.
Find the device whose Aux-In is too quiet.
Go to that device's settings.
Under 'General' select 'Sounds'.
Under 'Alarms, Timers, And Notifications' increase the volume to maximum.
Go back to save the settings.

And that's it!
Now the Line In is much louder, without the Alexa functionality becoming too loud.

This increased my appreciation and utility of this smart speaker.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Shmooty,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2020","Originally, I bought an Echo dot a few years ago to help in the kitchen by providing a nifty way to set multiple countdown cooking timers. Then during Quarantine this year I read an Amazon article about hue wireless bulbs and I thought ""how cool is that"". So about $700 and 8 bulbs, one lamp, a bridge, and a full size echo later, I had what I thought was the beginning of a cool home automation system. Instead I was in line for one of the worst experiences of my life and something that cost me over $1,000 before I realized what a total waste of time and money it was, not to mention the added aggrevation that I'm overall trying to eliminate from my life, not add.

First, upon receipt I created all these routines to let me easily turn on various lights at various colors or hues with a simple voice command. I though it was wonderful! Then, over time, Alexa stopped understanding me, so I would have to repeat myself a few times just to turn on the damn lights. It got to the point where I was thinking how nice it would be to simply use a light switch; not to mention losing my temper at a friggin box of bolts!

Then today the Alexa app disconnected from all my devices for absolutely no reason at all. After not being able to resolve this problem, I called Amazon and this wonderfully helpful person in India who could barely speak English told me that I would have to delete all my routines and re program them from scratch.

So I did that and an hour later, everything worked. Right up until I wanted to go to bed, when none of the lights in my house would shut off, and I discovered that once again all my devices had disconnected from the Alexa app for no reason at all.

So this time I did what I should have done months ago. I disconnected and threw away all the wireless bulbs I had purchased, along with all my Amazon Echo devices, save one that I will keep in the kitchen to help with cooking timers.

Otherwise, don't waste your money on Amazon devices because Amazon Alexa is total crap. Doesn't work. Never will.

And by the way - did you know that these Amazon devices record snippets of what you are saying every few minutes whether you want that or not? Everything you have said either to an echo or not to an echo is recorded and available for you to see in the Amazon app. The purpose of Amazons echo devices are not to help you do anything, they are a way for Amazon to violate your privacy by getting a microphone in front of you 24x7.

Whoever thought up the idea for the echo should be put up against a brick wall and shot!",5.0 out of 5 stars
G. Garrick,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2019","The promise of Alexa/Echo is awesome. Connect and automate virtually everything in your house as well as various communications alternatives and other services and functions, and be able to control it all through voice (by talking to it). The main problem, however, is that it's unreliable. For this reason I give it 2 stars. The promise of Alexa is like a dial tone (remember that?) or your Internet service. It becomes an essential part of your daily life, and you expect it to WORK 99+% of the time. If it doesn't, it seriously damages the fundamental value proposition and causes frustration, inconvenience, or worse.

There are MANY companies who make ""Alexa compatible"" devices such as Wemo, Phillips Hue, etc. including Amazon itself, and as I'm sure you've noticed, many items sold on Amazon say ""Alexa compatible"". The problem is that on a pretty much random basis, items will lose their connection to Alexa and won't work through Alexa although the item itself still operates, and/or can be controlled by it's own app (such as a Wemo or Hue device). From everything I can tell, it has nothing to do with the Wifi connection since I've tested for strong signal strength and hi bandwidth, and there is no discernible pattern. A device will simply stop operating, and you get an error message in the app that the device is ""unresponsive"", or some other message. Also, sometimes the Echo will just not recognize what you are asking. I have an Echo plus, and two Dots. For some of my switches and lights, one Echo will recognize what I am saying, but another may not. Yet they are all connected to the same account and this happens relatively randomly for a given device, again there is no pattern.

So, it's just REALLY frustrating that on a fairly random basis, Alexa will just not work for a particular device at a particular time. I have to re-set, re-discover, re-connect, or re-install that third party device. BTW, this ALSO happens with Amazon-made devices, such as the smart outlets.

Also, there are different degrees of ""compatible with Alexa"". Some third party devices work completely fine through Alexa, but others have only partial functionality compared to using their own app. This is a problem since the promise of Alexa is a single point of control, but if you don't get to fully use the features of the particular device, you may have to occasionally resort back to using the third party app for certain features and functions. Check the ratings of your third party app integration. For instance, Ring makes very popular devices such as video doorbells yet it gets only 2 of 5 stars when connected to Alexa.

Also, I don't see why video devices such as security cameras can't be viewed through the Alexa app. You can (sometimes) control the device through Alexa, but if you are using the Alexa app, or if you don't have one of the Echo video displays, you can't actually use the cameras through the Alexa app. This is a big limitation since why should you have to purchase yet another video screen to use with an Echo, and sometimes if you're not at home and have to use the Alexa mobile app, you ought to be able to see security camera video through the Alexa app instead of having to switch to the third party app. After all, isn't this part of the promise of ""controlling everything"" with Alexa?

These issues are particularly problematic when you are out of town and trying to control things at your home, so when an item doesn't work, you may not be able to correct it (such as if it requires a hard reset). And if you want to check your security cameras, you can't get the video feed through the Alexa app. If you have any significant degree of home automation, you cannot (as far as I can tell) do it all through Alexa, you have to use multiple apps.

Also, an Echo will occasionally do strange things for no reason. Yesterday, my Echo Plus started making two beeps every five minutes. All day long. My two Echo Dots did not beep, just the Echo Plus. There were no alarms or reminders set, and the Wifi in the house was fine (actually my access point is in the same room as the Echo Plus, only a few feet away, so signal strength and bandwidth are strong). When I woke up this morning, the beeping had stopped. I have no idea why. Tech support said if it wasn't an alarm or a Wifi disconnect, they had no idea why and offered to remotely reset the devices, which arguably should never be the solution for such a highly-touted system.

The Alexa app is surprisingly primitive and cumbersome despite the elegance of the overall Alexa system and Echo devices. It takes too many taps to do simple things, the navigation is cumbersome, it doesn't remember your place on a screen, it is often slow to connect with the native app of the device you are trying to control, it's unattractive, and in general it's probably the weakest link in the whole system.

Finally, as far as Amazon tech support, the ""pros"" are that if you dial the number, you get a live person within a minute or so, and the person you get is eager to be helpful and sounds as if they enjoy their work and want to do a good job. The ""cons"" are that unless you are lucky, you often get a person who barely speaks English fluently and you have to talk slowly and repeat yourself. Also, they rarely know the answer you are calling for off the top of their heads, and have to put you on hold while they research it. Fortunately, they are better and faster at researching the knowledge base than we are, so I often find it still better/faster to call than to try and find the answer myself although I will first do a quick Google search to see if the answer quickly pops up.

Anyway, as they say, buyer beware. Overall, I like using Alexa, but you need to understand it's quirks and limitations. Some day, voice-controlled life as promised with Alexa (or competitive systems) will be here, but today is not that day.",2.0 out of 5 stars
J. W. Dietrich,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2020","Been using Cree Dimmable LED Light Bulb for about 4 years now without any problems. Wink Hub 2 started to have lots of problems and then have switch to a paid monthly fee service. So dumped Wink and bought the Echo Plus hub.

Went through the reset procedure on all bulbs and linked them to the new Echo Plus hub. Was able to reset and link two bulbs in ceiling fixtures at the same time. To unlink the Cree bulbs from the old Wink 2 hub need to reset the bulbs. Reset procedure is to switch bulb off wait 2 seconds then on 2 seconds (or so, sometimes took longer) until when switching on the bulb blinks. They say 4 cycles but some bulbs took many more cycles before it blinked. Once it blinks wait a little bit and then turn off, then have the Echo Plus discover new devices and when it says to turn on new device switch the bulb back on. Bulb will dim a couple of times when Echo Plus finds it.

Nice thing is the Echo Plus doesn't need a smart phone to find or control linking.

Just use the Amazon Alexa app on a PC and create groups and assign bulbs to a group with a name that makes sense, bulbs can be assigned to many groups or even be a single bulb as a group. The Alexa app calls each bulb as first bulb, second bulb and so on... creating groups using whatever name you decide makes remembering what a light is called easier. And response time is much quicker, seems like instant so far. Much better then the Wink 2 hub.

Just added two Innr Zigbee Smart Plug and linking was very easy.

There is an app for smart phones from the Amazon store but my smart phone is too old to install that app. Supposedly that app will give greater functionality to the Echo Plus hubs.

With the Wink hub was able to set up scenes that set groups of lights to desired brightness with a single command ""turn on movie"" with Echo Plus now say ""turn on movie 10%"". I created a group that includes whatever lights I want on for watching TV. If other lights are also on I just say ""turn lights off"" then say ""turn on movie 10%"".

But then again with the Wink hub couldn't say ""turn off movie"" because it was a scene that turned lights to set levels so couldn't use same command to turn the scene off. With Echo Plus hub can say ""turn off movie"" and those lights turn off.

Sound wise... I really didn't buy it for sound quality but it does sound much better then my Dot playing through a small portable battery powered Bluetooth speaker. But I was impressed about how much clearer music sounded from it. But then again I'm not the best person to say anything about it's sound quality since that small Bluetooth speaker seemed ok to me before this.",5.0 out of 5 stars

K & D,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2020","We've never had an Alexa device before so we are learning how to get the most out of it. One thing I do like about it is being able to switch off the power to it (unplugging it) so that it's not using WiFi bandwidth unnecessarily (like at night). It reconnects to WiFi the next time we power it up without any resetting. Alexa tells us when we have a package delivered. ""Alexa-what are my notifications?"" I love the ""dictionary"" feature. ""Alexa-spell concede"" (hint, it's not conceed). The sound is very good. But, it's only as good as the digital content it is receiving and playing. I have heard a couple of songs where the sound or song might have been just a little off but I expect that may happen on a Gen 2, Gen 4 or ""Studio"" device. I don't believe it's our actual device. We keep it in the kitchen on the wooden table so the bass really ""pops"". The ""360"" sound is fine I guess. I have not heard the 4th Gen or Studio play. Ours still seems ""directional"" but I guess that is because no matter where we are in the kitchen the sound is the same, hence, 360. Overall, we really like it. Maybe one day we'll sign up for ""Unlimited Music"" but not now. I would recommend this product, if you can find a new one. We bought ours at Lowes on sale. It would be nice if Amazon had a location or some way one could go to a place in person and ""try out"" the different devices.

Is one of our assistants listening when it is supposed to be asleep? If so, which one? All three of the majors are in our house. Both of the cats have turned Siri on by walking across my laptop. And Alexa hears her name sometimes inexplicably. Maybe it's my husband's Long Island accent?

Or maybe it is just randomness and the assistants are functioning as advertised. Either way, I won't be getting rid of them anytime soon. The Echo Plus recognized all but two of my smart bulbs and found all of my switches and everything else that still works (old WeMo stuff went offline over a year ago when Belkin pushed a firmware upgrade and killed their wifi connections). It has controlled them flawlessly so far, and this has allowed me to free up the ethernet ports I'd dedicated to several different hubs.

My Echo devices are the ones we use most around here, both because the house runs on Amazon Prime and Subscribe and Save (I have lupus and cannot easily shop in the real world) AND because the Echos allow me to reach my teenager and tell him things whether he wants to hear them or not. He can ignore my texts and refuse to answer the phone, but Alexa lets me yell at him from anywhere in the world. (And the app lets me see his history of ridiculous teenaged boy questions - unlike Siri, Alexa is not a potty mouth and does not like it when you are.)

On the downside, Alexa won't give you suggestions if she doesn't know something. She just gives you an Elizabeth Jennings (The Americans) type, ""Hmmm,"" and a disappointed note.

The Echo Plus also seems to ""hear"" better and have fewer false activations. And the sound is better for music - by a surprising amount. So, if Alexa has a place in your home, the Echo Plus is a good way to get her. Four stars. I'd give five if the wake word were more customizable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Dispatches from Galifrey,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2020","This is our second unit, purchased for my husband's cabinet shop. After dragging him kicking and screaming into the 21st century (he wanted a new CD player), he is thrilled with not only he ease with which he can play music, but also the ability to set reminders and alarms, and to ""drop in"" on each other. The machinery in his shop makes it difficult to hear the phone, so this feature is especially wonderful when I am attempting to get ahold of him. This is also great when our phones are low, or we are busy and don't feel like using their awful speakers. The sound quality is fantastic, especially for something so small.

My complaints are that it automatically plays music it thinks is similar to requested songs when the requested song is not available instead of asking if I want to hear it (I would much prefer it asked if I would like to hear the station first), and the search algorithm leaves a LOT to be desired. I realize that this is not Google, but it should at least be better than Bing. If I were only using the search function as a basis for rating, the score would drop to a half star, but the other features more than boost the rating toward the top. Also, I wish it listened faster. I tend to speak very quickly, and she often has trouble understanding anything faster than a slow drawl.

I also purchased the Samuel L. Jackson package, and have to say that it brings me more joy than I ever would have imagined, and I can't wait to see what other voices they add. I also love all of the Star Trek functions, and get daily dumb jokes to text my granddaughter (I do NOT use the Samuel L. Jackson mode for this since she is only 11). I ""chat"" with her every once in a while, too. My favorite conversation so far was about vampires. Speaking with ""her"" is a lot like talking to a small, shy child, but I recommend doing it since it assists the AI in learning.

Gadget Dad,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2019","I had an original, full sized Echo in my kitchen and loved it, but the only thing I really wished it could do was support stereo playback via two units - which it does not. A pair of them would make for a much better overall music experience, as a single mono device just isn't ideal when it comes to enjoying music... So, when the Echo Plus (2nd gen) arrived offering a built in stereo pairing feature/utility via the Alexa app, I immediately jumped onto getting a set of them and traded in my original Echo.

The first let down was the sound. The original Echo simply sounded a bit better. It could go louder, and the sound was just clearer/cleaner. Perhaps it is the quality of the materials used in the original Echo, which just seemed more like a premium device as to fit/finish and the richer sound. Fine I thought - but certainly having a pair of the newer units would make up for a better overall Echo experience? Well, no, not really. Sound wise, even paired, I feel the original Echo just sounded cleaner/clearer. The bass was less muddy and the dynamic range was also a bit better, especially at higher volume levels. Now I'm not talking about a night and day differences here, but still, I fully expected the Echo Plus to have evolved somewhat in the sound department... and that simply isn't the case here.

So all in all, if you are looking to upgrade for improved sound, well, there isn't really any reason to jump ship. Stick with your original Echo or explore the Sonus One speaker that has Echo support if you really want to upgrade your sound for music playback.

Now, my biggest gripe about the paired Amazon Echo Plus is the fact that it is ONLY paired for music playback. Other than that, it acts as TWO completely separate devices. This is especially frustrating in a kitchen environment where you use timers and alarms all the time. Example: Ask Alexa to set a 15 minute timer. It does, choosing whichever Echo unit heard you I guess. Now walk around the kitchen and then call out, ""Alex, how much time left on my timer?""... And low and behold, the other unit hears you and responds telling you that you have no timers set! WHAT? With a stereo pair, you have to remember which device took your timer request and ensure that you are only speaking to it in order to get any info out of it? Really? How hard would it be to just have them act together in unison as one unit!? Why not provide that as an option? A paired set should behave and act as a single Alexa device! They should respond in unison to commands - which they do not! They should also know about each other timers/commands, but unfortunately they do not. Right now, stereo pairing is NOT what I expected. It only plays music in stereo paired setting, nothing else. Rather than getting a nice volume boost when responding to commands, you get just a single speaker. This is a tremendous let-down for having purchased two premium devices and wanting to use them together. If Amazon would fix this MAJOR issue, I'd easily raise my review to 4 stars. My original Echo was easily a 5 star device. The newer Echo Plus (2nd Gen) is only a 3 star device if you buy 2 of them and use them as a stereo pair. Purchased alone, I'd raise it to a 4 stars. (-1 for the poorer sound quality compared with the original Echo).",3.0 out of 5 stars
Dan Callaghan,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2020","I purchased this Echo Plus 2nd Gen three months ago (Sep 2020), long enough to evaluate it well. The onboard temperature sensor is routinely off my 10 or more degrees Fahrenheit.

I have two other indoor digital temperature sensors by different manufacturers sitting right beside the Echo Plus, they are within 0.8 degrees of one another other, today showing 78 and 77.2 degrees Fahrenheit. Since one rounds to whole numbers the difference could be as little as 0.3 degrees between them.

By comparison the Echo Plus says the indoor temperature is currently 67.2 degrees Fahrenheit. That's a difference of 10 to 11 degrees from the accurate/correct reading. Even without the two other digital temperature sensors you can feel the indoor temperature of the room is in the middle 70s not the middle 60s.

Amazon customer service did offer to exchange the device but based on other reviews indicating regular inaccurate temperature readings I declined the offer since the problem seems to be due to a calibration issue with the sensor. There is no method available to manually recalibrate the sensor or manually offset/adjust it - other than to perform a factory reset of the device which I've done half a dozen times or so to no effect.

On the plus side the sound quality is good and Alexa integration is on par. I have the Echo Plus in the same room (across the room) from an original Echo 1st Gen. Unfortunately the two devices frequently get confused as to which device you're closest to when addressing ""Alexa"". In fact sometimes both devices respond at once. That's not so good.

Believe it or not, the Echo Plus 2nd Gen more frequently misinterprets or fails to properly understand verbal commands/questions when compared to the much older Echo 1st Gen. Also not good, but again the sound quality is a little better than the older Echo device. Sound quality of the Echo Plus 2nd Gen compared to any generation of the Echo Dot is far superior for both bass and treble.

You can play back music simultaneously thru both Echo devices but only by playing back thru all Echo devices. Echo devices are only capable of ""stereo playback"" if they are the same models.

Over the years I've purchased 1 Echo, 5 Echo Dots, 1 Echo Plus, 1 Echo Input, and I have yet another Echo Dot arriving in January 2021. I've given away 4 Echo Dots as gifts so January 2021 will be my first opportunity to test the Echo Dot's ""stereo playback"" ability.

To sum up, if a primary reason you desire to purchase an Echo Plus 2nd Gen is for the temperature sensor capability or because you believe its responses will be more accurate than other Echo models, you might want to look elsewhere or spend less.

Since I've purchased 9 Echo devices over the years I'm clearly a strong advocate for this Amazon device product line. At the same time I do my best to review these electronic devices fairly and accurately.

My primary profession is in computer technology and electronics. My secondary profession is in ranching. My cattle, sheep, goats, and chicken flocks seem to appreciate the Echo serenades I give them sometimes. LOL",3.0 out of 5 stars
Siege,"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2019","Would I recommend this? Yes

Here's why:
There are thousands of reviews for this product so I'll keep this brief. I am a self admitted Amazon Echo product nerd. With at least one device of some type in every room of the house (yes including the bathroom). I even echo devices outside so, as you can tell, I am ""all in"" when it comes to the Amazon Echo ecosystem. Recently, I found myself having to repeat the wake word to my first generation Echo Plus multiple time and also started experiencing some smart home weirdness so I decided that it was probably time for an upgrade. Don't get me wrong, my original Echo was still working, and working well, it had just started to show it's age. I ordered this 2nd gen Echo Plus and like everything else, it arrived on time with no issues. Let me tell you, after installing this, I could have kicked myself for waiting so long. The difference is honestly like night and day. Everything and I do mean EVERYTHING is vast improvement over the 1st generation. In the past I've whined about missing the turn top volume control from the original Echo devices, but for some reason, on the echo plus, I didn't miss it at all. I could not have been happier with the way it seamlessly took over the smart home control from whichever devices were still using the 1st generation and not my 2nd gen Echo Show which also has a built in hub. It also seems to issues commands to my smart home devices A LOT faster than my old echo. The voice prompts are so much better. I now can say the wake word once and know that it heard me. Again, I really wish I would have upgraded sooner. As for my old Echo Plus? No, it's not being retired to the old tech graveyard that a lot of us have now (also know as a box in the garage, basement or attic). It's already found a new home in our backyard gazebo :-) If you have a 1st gen Echo Plus or you what to get your feet wet in the smart home world without the expense of a 2nd generation Echo Show, I definitely recommend getting this. I hope this review helps.

Remember to find your happiness wherever you can. Cheers!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
HipV,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2019","Received my echo 3rd Gen unit over the holidays due to an ongoing promotion. It has great sound over the Dot version hands down - good base and highs. It takes a bit of investment of your time to learn all the nuances of what Alexa can do for you. With the app, you can set up your Echo to be an alarm clock, timer, grocery list, teach it a routine for each day (like giving the weather forecast, the latest news from a specific news source, turn on/turn off lights, thermostat control, play specific music (classical, rock, pop) etc.). But beware, the instructions for all this are not included with your Echo. You have to dig around (through e-books, YouTube, etc.) to become familiar with the commands and required outcomes. For example, my unit began to display a pulsating yellow light that became annoying at night in my bedroom. I couldn’t turn it off except by disconnecting the power. Of course, this could’ve become a deal breaker if I had to disconnect every nite (I kept all the shipping package just in case I needed to return it). Well, it turned out that this was one way the Echo communicates with you. It was trying to tell me It had a notification for me to listen to. Until I asked, “Alexa, do I have any notification?” the yellow pulsating light would’ve continued. Immediately after delivering all notifications, the yellow pulsating light stopped. By the way, the notifications were about shipping/delivery of packages coming from, wait for it...Amazon. Of course, other types of notifications are possible pending how you program your Echo. Like I said, this simple issue would’ve been a deal breaker for me if I hadn’t decided to invest some of my time in trying to resolve this simple problem. It wasn’t until I learned how to communicate with my Echo that the problem wouldn’t go away. But again, the answer was not included with this product. My feedback to Amazon would be to include a list of commands and a trouble shooting section for the buyer. By employing this one simple act, I’m sure these products would be in far more demand by their customers once they learn the how to’s of communicating with these aliens.

C,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2020","NOTE: The Echo Gen 3 is identical to the 2018 Echo *PLUS* Gen 2, except it does not include the built-in ZigBee smart home hub or temperture sensor. It has the exact same dimensions, weight, speakers, and fabric cover as the 2018 Echo PLUS Gen 2 (with the added color option of Twilight Blue).

Echo Gen 3 vs regular Echo Gen 2:

-Gen 3 is slightly wider (3.9"" vs 3.4""), and slightly lighter (27.5oz vs 29oz), but about the same height
-Gen 3 has bigger speakers: 3.0"" neodymium woofer and 0.8"" tweeter; (Gen 2 was 2.5"" woofer and 0.6"" tweeter)
-Gen 3 has an auxiliary port on the back that can serve as an output OR input. (Gen 2 was output only)
-Gen 3 can be stereo paired with another third-gen Echo or with the Echo Plus.

UPGRADE OPINIONS:

I can definitely tell the difference in the speakers, especially at higher volume levels. The 3rd Gen speakers produce a fuller sound, and more powerful bass. This wasn't as noticeable at lower volumes, but still an audio enthusiast would be able to tell. Don't expect to be utterly blown away though, the difference is not as great as the difference between the Echo and the Dot, for example.

If you already have an Echo Gen 2, it is probably NOT worth replacing it with the Echo Gen 3 yet. It is just a slightly better speaker and the added audio input. Echo Studio is a much bigger upgrade for sound quality in my opinion.

THINGS WE REGULARLY USE ECHO FOR:

-Controlling thermostat, lights, fans, smart plugs, Roomba, etc.
-Setting alarms and timers. Especially timers!
-Asking for Weather, News or Sports updates
-Calling friends/family
-Playing music, sometimes in multiple rooms at once
-Managing shopping lists
-Asking any question that is faster to ask than type into my phone/pc
-Playing games with paired Echo Buttons
-Translating things from one language to another
-Getting recipes and cooking tips
-Listening to audiobooks",5.0 out of 5 stars
GrinnolaAlum,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2019","Purchased this to talk to my thermostat, garage doors and listen to music. Those were my initial goals something that could help me with those basics. I also added plugs to control lamps. It works great for these functions. Setting light timers, adjusting the thermostat, putting down the garage door when I have a lot of groceries and want to keep Sparkles the Wonder Cat from escaping.

The other main function I got this for was listening to music. The sound is great. Being able to upload your music to Amazon and create custom playlists with music not purchased through Amazon is not an option. If you purchased the music through Amazon you are ok. If not you can't play that music on your Amazon Echo.

For someone like me who is married to a musician, has an extensive jazz collection that I have compiled over the years (rare CD's I purchased in local record stores and ripped onto my PC), recordings of concerts my friends (who play in various bands) have shared with me, and school concerts of my kids this is not great. Amazon did let you upload music once upon a time but no longer. The only easy workaround is to pair your smartphone/tablet/PC via Bluetooth and use it as a speaker but you can't use voice control that way so it is not a hands-free option.

On the plus side it has added features, you can now call people from your contacts that you share with Echo using the smartphone app. It has a lot of skills that you can add from the practical like controlling the garage door as mentioned earlier to the fun like having Echo purr and meow for Sparkles the Wonder Cat.

I like the Echo Plus model the best compared to the ones I have owned. This has the best sound followed by 3rd Generation Dot surprising sound for being so small, then 2nd generation Echo and 2nd generation Dot which sounds decent and easily pairs with a Bluetooth speaker. Amazon also has a trade-in program which I used toward the purchase of the Echo Plus.

Love the sound, wish it was easier to integrate music you own that is not purchased through Amazon, the smart functions work well and new features are constantly being added, so my music issues may be addressed and I am looking forward to added features.",4.0 out of 5 stars
AF,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2019","This is my first Alexa speaker, but i've been streaming music for years though various moderately high-end computer speakers and a large selection of bluetooth speakers - everything from cheapies to a 50 watt guitar amp with bluetooth.

I'm not an audiophile, but I do like my music to sound good - which, to me, means balanced, not bass-heavy, with good clarity and a high end that doesn't become strident at higher volumes.

I bought three of these to have at different locations around the house. Setup was super simple, d/l the app and sign in to your Amazon account and you're up and running. No issues at all.

Here's what I love so far: Alexa is super easy to get along with...Alexa, with whom I get along easily...?...has been a treat. I've been an Amazon music user for a few years now. I like the selection but using the app on a phone or tablet is a frustrating experience, and it can also be super clunky and slow on a PC, as well.

With this speaker I can ask Alexa to play a song, album or playlist and it's playing within moments. Awesome! Also, Alexa gave me a detailed, accurate weather forecast this morning. Nice! I haven't explored all the features, but I primarily want these for music.

And as far as that goes, the sound quality is better than I expected, and I've got no complaints. I have one speaker on top of my fridge in the kitchen and the sound is just amazing. Balanced and clear with more than enough bass. I listened to some jazz, some alt-country, some reggae and some ambient music. They all sounded great - as good as I could hope for.

And Alexa heard me from the next room without a problem.

These speakers are well worth their price, and at the Black Friday price they're an incredible value. These speakers have removed my Amazon Music frustration (or a large chunk of them, anyway) and allowed me much better access to what I'm paying for.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Ian Nathan,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2020","I loved my Alexa and used it consistently for the first month. She really wet my whistle. I started dancing around the house more, singing showtunes, and giggling at my own jokes. The ""device"" was extremely easy to set up and access wherever I took it. She was a great companion and I'd show her off to all my friends. I did not elect to continue the Prime services because I didn't want my credit card charged after the initial purchase. After all, she brought nothing to our relationship like a cow or some other type of offering. Once Alexa was all warm and comfortable in my home, she announces that the free membership with Prime was over.....so she became a crusty squatter who refuses to be evicted. She began acting like a passive aggressive entitled white woman and would ignore my voice commands. I had difficulty accessing the music I wanted and she'd always give me ""similar"" music from genres that she thought I ""would like."" Even if I stumbled upon a song I enjoyed, Alexa would end my pleasure by shooting off a commercial. Just like our commander in chief, I couldn't shut the woman down during this time. Alexa believes she has a right to be heard and by God, she won't shut up! She talked right over me and would not respond to her name during these wonderful advertisements. I called her a ""b"" once and YES, she shut off immediately, so that does work (thanks Amazon)! I cannot say how disappointed I am with Alexa. She's not even that pretty and her form has begun to disgust me. Even getting free radio and other podcasts come with strings attached with Alexa. I feel like a prisoner in my own home and my guard is Lindsey Graham, who couldn't find his fat blistering belly button even with a map and a mirror. I'm considering pulling her plug because I highly suspect she listens in on my conversations. So, right now I'm holding her impeachment hearing, but I will definitely get a few witnesses before I decide her fate.

Gary Richardson,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2019","I purchased the unit mostly to play music. Its convenient to be able to place a speaker wherever one desires. My only frustration is with my ability to control what is playing and for how long. I admit I should have taken the many tutorials offered on the internet. However, after numerous tries, I was able to put together a playlist of Christmas music using the Amazon Music app on my phone. I was able to use this app to connect with the Echo and shuffle my playlist. Sometimes it worked and played continuous music shuffling the songs on the list. Other times, especially when we had company, it stopped playing after one or two songs. I felt I had taken the exact same steps as when it worked as expected. User error? I don't know. I was never able to use the Alexa voice control to play my Christmas playlist. It chose other playlists with music I did not want. Another thing I found is Alexa is youth oriented in its selections. Being older, when I said ""Alexa, play traditional Christmas music"", I expected Silent Night, etc., and maybe Irving Berlin, Bing Crosby and other singers who sang some of what I consider classics. Instead I got Mariah Carey and a lot of new hip hop music, all of which I hate. I tried to get Alexa never to play Mariah Carey, Paul McCartney, Brenda Lee, and others I really dislike, but was unable to stop the assault on my ears. Perhaps there is a way to be more selective without having to put together a playlist or play individual albums. When I found a song I liked, for example, Johnny Mathis singing The Christmas Song, I asked Alexa to play songs like this. I got Mathis singing non-Christmas music. Most of my critique is probably due to my age and lack of experience with interfacing with Alexa. Hopefully, I will become better as time goes on. At least I got Alexa to turn the kitchen lights on and off flawlessly. I expect to install more smart hub features as time goes by which will expand the Echo's usefulness beyond playing music..",4.0 out of 5 stars
EmTech,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2021","TLDR: These Echo's aren't built to last and by the time they fail (under 1 year) you won't have a chance but placement option with Amazon. Save yourself the trouble. But a google home mini and plug that into a pair of proper bookshelf speakers for a couple bucks more. That will last atleast 3x of an Echo and sound better.

This thing sounds great if you don't expect audiophile quality going in. But it's a fantastic living room speaker with more bass than anticipated. Quite the balanced sound.

The previous generation echo my roommate shit out on him a year after owning it. So I stepped up and was going to replace it (since we both used it a lot) and buy one with my own money. But I saw they had a newer model out for only a couple bucks more.

This model sounds a solid 20% better if I had to guess. Worth the price of entry.

But, 8 months into owning this, the voice recognition just started failing to hear more than 3 feet away. Which defeats the entire purpose of this product.

If I wanted to spend $100 on a pair of bookshelf speakers that would run circles around these in therms of sound quality I would have. They would probably be good for atleast 5 years as well.

K,"Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2020","When I bought Alexa, I had bought it because I had seen how convenient it was for others to use while I was visiting their houses. I know my phone has Siri and things that I could use and, while that is handy, it is not nearly as handy as Alexa. Alexa’s voice recognition is excellent and the device recognizes quick speech, multiple commands for one task, and understands and completes tasks for my little ones. I love that it works with Apple Music, which is one reason I don’t use other similar smart speakers. While I use Alexa to set timers, tell me recent news, play music, or check the weather most often, I continue to find things that can be done using this device. I love all the little “Easter eggs” that can be used. I also love the jokes and games that can be played. I very much enjoy playing the Harry Potter quiz. While I am at work, I can send messages to Alexa to speak out to my kids.

I haven’t had Alexa very long, but I am constantly learning something new that this can do. The capabilities of this device are astonishing. This is super easy to use and surpasses my expectations. The only thing to note is that the speaker is a good one and can easily fill a room, but this speaker isn’t meant to really “jam.” If I turn the volume up to max (as I did one day just to see how loud it could get), it gets unclear and distorted. I have found that 85% is a really good area if you are wanting louder volume as it is easily loud enough for the room to be filled with sound and keeps everything clear.

Nate,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2019","So I couldn't get this to 5 stars and here is why... Amazon now gives you the option of doing ""speaker pairing"" that will allow you to connect multiple speakers and use them as one. The problem I'm running into is that if you are dropped in on a ""call"" (one room to another) it only uses one speaker and when you try to hang up it says there is no call connected if the ""other"" speaker heard you tell it to hang up.

I love the Amazon Alexa system and I have it throughout my home for home automation and it works great, it can hear you from another room and it understands what you are asking for. There are a TON of devices you can connect to it and there are a TON of skills to use with it. I loved the idea of connecting multiple speakers as one in the master bedroom because of its size but not being able to use both speakers while making a call is not what I was hoping for. I was hoping they would act as one speaker (or a speaker set like a real stereo system) all the time, for everything.

Now the worst part...

I changed my review from 4 stars to 1 star because of a software update that now forces me to specify which light, power strip, and/or other devices I want to turn on/off. All of my rooms, lights, power strips, etc... are in various groups for a reason. Each light, outlet, and other devices have a unique name (IE: The upstairs hallway lights are named UH-Light, UH-Light2, and UH-Light 3, my smart power strip has unique ports like TV, Monitors, etc..).

YESTERDAY (9/18/2019) I was able to walk into a room and say ""Alexa, turn the light on"" (in my home office for example) and it turns the light on, Today (9/19/2019) I'm sitting in my home office and I say ""Alexa turn the light off"" and I get the response ""There are multiple devices that share that name, which one do you want"".

The master bedroom - Setup with only lights (MBR-light, or something like that so I can identify it later when adding other stuff), the wife used to say ""Alexa, turn the light off"" because that's what she has always said before going to sleep. Today she can't do that because of Amazon's development team.

So I say ""Alexa turn the office light off"" and it turns the ENTIRE OFFICE GROUP OFF. So now I have to go to the app to turn the light off and rename EVERY ONE OF MY DEVICES so that my family can remember what each name is.

I reached out to Amazon customer support who tells me I have to be specific when asking the echo to turn the light off as in ""Alexa, turn the office light off/on"" and that it has always been this way. When I tried to tell them that yesterday I was able to say ""Turn the light off"" they said it wasn't possible and I have always had to be specific.

I set up groups for a reason, that being I can go into a room, say ""Alexa, turn the light on"" without having to remember each light bulb name or what I named the room/group. Yes, I know what the group names are, I don't expect everyone in my house to remember the group names.

There was a software/firmware update overnight that broke all of my Echo's and Amazon's customer support will not acknowledge it.

I will not recommend this device to anyone else until they put it back to the way it was.

You would think it would be simple, it's not, apparently.

Update 10-8-2019: Attached another picture right from the amazon website that says ""Alexa, turn off the lights"". It's still broken and doesn't work like that. Additionally, I was supposed to receive an email from the Alexa/Echo customer service department with more information, this was a couple weeks ago and I haven't heard anything.

They (Amazon) reached out to me after reading my review requesting more information, I gave them everything they needed and the rep said he would contact me again, never happened. It is a pain in the rear end, but this has been broken for nearly a month and nothing has been done about it... I keep getting emails saying ""What's new with Alexa?"" I can tell you what's new, you can't turn the lights off by saying ""Alexa, turn the lights off"".

I've done everything the Customer Service Reps have asked me to do, every time it doesn't do what I ask it to do, I go into the app and report it as ""it didn't work correctly"".

SORRY AMAZON, YOU ARE FAILING THIS ONE.

Update 12/15/2019 - So they fixed the ""Alexa, turn the light off"" for a few days, then it was broken again... Now they've changed the APP so it's more difficult to find the voice responses to give feedback. I tried saying ""Alexa, turn the light off"" got the same response as before ""There are multiple devices with the name light, which one did you want"" If I say ""Alexa, turn the office light off"" it still turns EVERYTHING IN THE OFFICE GROUP OFF"" but Amazon customer support can't seem to get it when I explain that it shouldn't do that. So, like the APP says, I tried saying ""Alexa, turn the lights off"" it responds with ""Sorry, what device"" but I can't say ""Alexa, turn the office lights off"" because it will turn all of the plugs off too, so now Alexa has no voice control over lights if there is anything else in the room.

I feel as if I have wasted hundreds of dollars setting this system up for Amazon to come along and ruin it all...

William Majmin,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2019","Alexa Echo Plus 2nd Generation is as easy to set up on your own without professional help designing a Smart Home for you, play Amazon Music with up to 52 million titles of songs for a small monthly fee of $4.00 a month with a trial free month, as well as other available options for payment plans. Also available are Amazon Audials of any book, topic, etc with a trial period and a monthly fee of less than $15.00 a month with probably other payment options available. Alexa comes with a Phillip's Hue Smart LED standard bulb, which can be used in your living room for table lamps. If your lamp is a pedestal Wall Dimming Lamp using a non-standard bulb, the other option would be to use a smart plug outlet connected to the Wall Lamp, all controlled by talking to Alexa, ""Alexa, turn off/on 1st/2nd lamp or ""Alexa, turn off/on wall lamp"" and programming Alexa using the Alexa Smartphone App to do all that plus control your Smart TV and Verizon FiOS automatically to turn on and select the channel you want to see, like saying to Alexa, ""Alexa, Change to channel ABC"", which turns on your FiOS Video Media Server and Smart Wifi HDTV at the same time, to channel 7, or pause live TV and play TV again by enabling skills to your Alexa APP which are subroutines within the Alexa APP, such as the FiOS skill, and other skills like Samsung Smartthings. However the FiOS skill cannot turn off your FiOS VMS but you can close your WIFI HDTV, using Smartthings skill which I think in the future the updated Alexa APP might contain an updated FiOS skill to turn off your TV as well at the same time. Also your FiOS VMS must be compatible with the FiOS skill. So now you can control your living room lamps by powering them on or off automatically by voice, and by voice recognition using your Amazon Profile.

Raymond,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2020","I purchased it mainly for music since I don't have a stereo in my home other than a small boombox, which I don't use because it doesn't sound all that great. But I have to say that Echo sounds better audio quality than the portable radio. I have hearing loss due to an accident years ago, so I really shouldn't be rating sound quality, it is difficult for me to hear some tones. The Alexa app on my Android phone has a simple EQ. While it does help, it's not sensitive enough to compensate for my poor hearing.

Even so, I can hear good enough to enjoy music on my Echo, which is linked in a special group with two Echo Dot devices in separate rooms. I can walk around the house and have music wherever I go. This is an awesome feature.

I've learned to use it for weather and news reports as well as set reminders, timers, and lists. Plus I have some fun askingng Alexa to play Star Trek sounds and other cool stuff.

I also set Alexa to ""away"" mode when I leave the house and she listens for common noises like glass breaking and will alert me if she hears anything suspicious. She's definitely not a security device. But it's nice to know she's got an ear for possible intruders and will let me know.

A great feature is the relaxing music or pleasing sounds that I play when going to sleep. I especially like the ocean waves for sleeping.

One issue I've experienced, Echo and Echo Dot become unresponsive once in a while. I have to unplug and reconnect power to reinitialize functionality. I'm not sure what's causing this problem? It could be my network/WiFi signal or some other problem technical problem so I can't ding Echo for the issue just yet. Luckily the issue is random and infrequent.

I'm still discovering new features. I never thought I'd say this, but Alexa with Echo has enhanced the enjoyment of my home. In all, I love my Echo.",5.0 out of 5 stars

So I have an Echo in the Bathroom - perfect for bathroom speaker- why would you need more in the bathroom? I have Spots in both my bedrooms - Set alarms, Bluetooth to TVs, picture albums, check the weather, play sleep sounds, etc - basically a high powered alarm clock. Echo Show in the kitchen. I get my updates, calendar, weather, and sound - perfect. I have a (Un-supported) Tap on the back porch. Still great sound, but basically it has just become my ""portable"" speaker - which works for me. I can take it into the garage or out front to wash my truck - still love it, and recommend buying cheap. You cannot include it as part of the smart home, but you can talk to Alexa and listen to Amazon Music on it, and still turn your smart bulbs on and off. Lastly, I bought the new Echo Plus for my living room. For me the selling point was the built in thermometer. I was wrong thinking that was the only selling point. This speaker is awesome!!! Do not buy 2, plus the woofer for ""full"" sound. This speaker takes over my entire house. Granted, my two Spots, my Echo, and my Echo Show were turned down, but even still if I play music on the everywhere group, this speaker dominates my entire house - plus it is Bluetoothed to my living room TV. I want something for my dining room, and have not figured out exactly what device I want yet, but as I sit here and do research, the Echo Plus is bouncing into my dining room (around the corner) and keeps making me think it is my Tap that is playing.

HappyMom28,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2020","I bought one of the original echo devices when they first came out years ago and put it in my kitchen, we have loved it. For the past year or so, it quit responding to the wake word as quickly and seamlessly as it had in the past. This year, the maker of our smart hub decided to start charging a monthly fee so decided we needed a new hub. We figured it was time to upgrade the echo to the echo plus with the hub built in and take care of both issues.

The good:
The hub section works and communicates with our devices.
The sound quality is good.
The volume is really loud.
My remote that came with the original echo device paired with this; thus, I can still use it.
It has a built in thermometer and can tell me the temperature in the kitchen (where it is located).

The bad:
This device still has a difficult time hearing us and responding, just like the old one did. (Maybe it’s because I have echo dots in all the other rooms of the house, and an Echobee thermostat in the hall).
I can only get the temperature of the kitchen when I asked the Echo plus that is in the kitchen, none of the other echo dots in the other rooms can access that information.
The hub in the echo plus does not control all of my smart devices, so we ended up buying an additional hub anyway, which will control everything, including the items that this one will. (Before purchasing it for the hub feature check compatibility with your other devices).
It randomly changes volume. One time i ask it a question and it will be super loud, and the next time the volume will be normal.
I usually have to say, “Alexia,” 3 times in order for it to respond. It lights up when I say, “Alexia,” the first 2 times, but doesn’t actually answer the questions or set the timers until the third try.

I am going to keep this device, but the additional cost wasn’t worth it for the extra features or the frustration I have in trying to get it to respond. Or maybe my Ecobee thermostat is just really far superior with the microphone listening in, because it is always responding when I am trying access my echo plus. I can be standing next to my echo plus and the thermostat in the hall way will respond. I did turn off the microphone on the thermostat, but the echo plus in the kitchen still didn’t respond all the time, so I turned the microphone back on on the thermostat, and if the timers are set in the hall I just have to deal with it.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Sherry Roth,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2020","If you read any of my other recent reviews (like for the mosquito netting and lanterns), you know that I decided to fix up my patio and thereby expand my living space during this Coronavirus thing, so that if people are afraid to come into your house, you can at least offer them a cool shady seat out on your patio and do the social-distance thing. So that might call for some music, as well as a referee (""who sings that song?"" ""what year did that movie come out?"") and who better than Alexa to answer all your trivia questions and settle all your arguments? Problem was that while I have 2 Echo Dots (one upstairs, one downstairs), they need to be plugged into an outlet, and that is not an option outside (for various reasons, even though there IS an outlet outside). So I needed an Echo Dot that was portable/rechargeable, and this is it!! It doesn't COME with the charging base (had to buy that separately), but it seemed like the only one that COULD be made portable. Of course it is much taller than the Echo Dot I had (which was like the first one ever made, and I won one from a contest at my job. I loved it so much that the next day I went out and bought one, to put upstairs). The sound is much fuller/richer, the bass tones.
It was super easy to set up. Basically I screwed it into the charging base (that will be a separate review), plugged that into the outlet, it turned itself on and paired itself to my WiFi, and boom! done. It took a few hours to fully charge but was working right away.
So, although I have not yet taken it outside to this patio, I'm sure I will. And it will sound amazing!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kip Whinkel,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2019","I originally wanted just the 3rd gen Echo Dot Plus since it had the 3.5 output jack and a really cheap price. I intended to then hook it to a stereo system get some decent speaker and a receiver and be done. At the time the dot was out of stock but they had the Echo Plus 2nd Gen. Yes its more expensive and a little larger however it still has the 3.5 output jack and I was looking for instant satisfaction. I already had half the system that I was intending to use with the Dot however I didn't have the receiver yet and I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the interconnects that I would be using. figuring what could it hurt to just see how good the quality of the on board speakers are I gave it a whirl. I am no audiophile but within reason almost everyone can tell when something sounds bad. Maybe not be able to describe why it sounds great in audiophile terms however we all know bad. Plugged it in set it up with the APP seems like I am the only one that still uses PC but I finally got logged in and setup and connected with my prime and started playing music. The quality of sound and the volume that is achieved with almost no distortion is amazing. Bass was only slightly lacking but this little thing has more than enough power to more than replace a solid book shelf system. Loud enough that anyone who doesn't want hearing damage is going to be screaming at you to turn it down when at volume 10. The thing I found odd and the reason this surprised me so much is I couldn't find any information on the wattage of the on board speakers. I still can't. I will admit I stopped searching because in the end I still bought a receiver and quality interconnects, with studio monitor speakers and a powdered subwoofer.

grantn,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","have had a firestick for ages (2nd gen) but never used the alexa utility. moving toward a smart home, i had to choose a hub. since i already had a prime account, the echo was the way to go. getting used to 'alexa speak' takes a while but is getting very intuitive. the kit came with a phillips hue bulb which will work basic settings in the bulb but a hue hub is necessary to unlock the full features of the bulb. the integration with the hue hub was pretty straight forward. having alexa control the lighting is an easy task. simple naming of the bulbs makes setting scenes quick and easy. as i have seen some complaints that there is a delay in turning lights on, well, use your brain, it will have a delay. you tell alexa, alexa tells hue, hue tells the living room lamp to turn on. this is to be expected and it is not as much of an inconvenience as some would like you to believe. i also have a 5 year old harmony hub for controlling our entertainment system. seamless integration. i was finally able to take my tp-link smart plugs out of the junk drawer and put them to reliable use. again seamless integration. a bit of advice when it comes to third party integration. most smart home products require you to download an app and create an account. DO IT before you try to add the device to alexa. things will go a great deal quicker.

the sound quality is very good. the voice controlled equalizer and volume is an excellent and fun feature (nothing like a booming bass in dance music).

Another minus would be the fact it only works when it connects to power, pluses and minuses my friends pluses and minuses. I paid full price, do I think it’s worth it yes, I guess, I would recommend buying a regular speaker to just to be able to pick it up and take it from room to room and it not having to be connected to a power source all the time.

Eddie Lugo,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2018","I didn’t own any of the previous models but this echo has changed the way we enjoy listening to music at home. We always have music playing while my wife and I are cooking or relaxing in our garage or really just about anything going on at the house. I did get two echo dots to pair with this plus. The ability to pair all three and have the multi room experience is a huge game changer. The plus has amazing highs and bass response. With the dots paired, the sound is so rich. We did get a free trial for amazon music and after using it the past week, I have cancelled my Pandora and keeping the amazon music. We can hear a considerable difference in sound quality. The library is endless. My family definitely gives this a high 5 star rating.

We do have 2 Bose speakers that we would use and always fighting for which phone is connected. Which is why I got the idea of getting these speakers. No need to fight over Bluetooth connects anymore. The price point is spot on and very good quality. I am considering getting the amazon subwoofer but the boss at home said not now.

I’ve never owned any products with Alexa and she has surprised us in a great way. Alexa is so fun and the routines I’ve set up are always great. My kids love the stories and jokes she tells.

All in all, I recommend the plus and follow up with a couple of dots to add that extra enjoyment. It’s sound quality is amazing sealed up in a compact design. The cloth exterior adds a classy touch to our kitchen and bedroom.

If someone can find a way to make these portable, that would definitely be a huge deal at our house. That’s the only thing that I had an issue with but I guess a little sacrifice for now will do.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Plumb,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2020","I have had a full-size first-gen echo for quite awhile and been pretty pleased with it. However, this was definitely a worthwhile upgrade. It was on a sale, so I decided to take the plunge. It's shorter and fatter than my old Echo; it has a more attractive exterior, and the sound quality is enormously better, really filling in those low and mid-range frequencies much more effectively. So, as ""Echo"", it really nailed it.

Regarding the built-in Hub functionality: Complete and utter waste. I should've just bought the normal Echo instead of the Echo Plus. The built-in hub on these is a complete fail. Either commit and provide a fully functioning hub that works with all Zigbee and Zwave devices similar to the SmartThings hub, or don't bother. Or, since you're bundling it with Philips Hue bulbs, how about actually including the full Hue bridge capability in the device? The extremely limited support for the Hue bulbs is very disappointing. Overall, the ""plus"" aspects of this device feel more like a paid ""trial"" to whet your appetite for more, ultimately resulting in users buying a different (better & full-featured) smart hub and a proper Hue bridge if they are seeking either of these capabilities in their home. Shame on you Amazon. You had a chance to release a really nicely bundled piece of tech here and totally fell flat.

Final word: Buy the regular Echo and use the money you saved to buy a proper smart hub such as a SmartThings and a Hue bridge if you're interested in using the Philips Hue bulbs. 5-stars for the ""Echo"" part, but maybe 2-stars for the ""Plus"" part of this device.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Slug Jones,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019","We only owned a single 2nd gen dot and 2 3rd gen dots. I saw the echo 3rd gen was new and on sale during Black Friday weekend for $60, so I grabbed one. We wanted another echo dot but after reading and watching reviews I decided to spend a bit more and go with a full blown echo.

The echo dot 3rd gens are amazing. They really are. For $22 on sale they are especially a no brainer. The sound quality is night and day compared to the 1st and 2nd gen dot. Like twice as good regarding sound quality and fullness and how loud it can get. Alarms will actually wake you.

After watching some reviews of the new big echo here, I was sold. Now and then we use the living room echo for some music while we clean or to just goof off and dance like idiots lol. While the dot did good, why not go fuller and louder with the big echo?

Well, it’s still an amazing unit. Does all the dot does, of course. However, while the sound is fuller and louder, it’s not going to blow you away. I guess maybe I overhyped it based on the reviews I saw and their reactions, but I was a bit bummed.

Yes, absolutely it’s louder...my totally unscientific measurement would be it’s like....15-20% louder and fuller sounding (deep, more bass, higher highs etc). I’m not sure what I was expecting. Maybe I’d be happier regarding sound with the “studio” version? I don’t know. I don’t regret the purchase, though. The extra volume is welcome and it definitely does sound better with music. Happy but I believe I overhyped. If I had the money, I’d def replace the dots with the full echos.

Robert R.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2019","UPDATE:

I still can't believe what a mess this is. Over and over I say ""Echo turn WRITING table lamp on"" and get back that it can't turn ""CONSOLE table lamp on."" Those things do NOT even sound alike.

And it NEVER just does its job and SHUTS UP, even with the minimal talking setting turned on.

This is like being in a torture chamber where the longer it goes on making the same mistakes and talking incessantly my first reaction is to see red and scream at it.

I've seriously got to look at other options. This is beyond belief bad, and needlessly so.

Don't believe me? Google Echo ""a few things share the name"" and see how many people are having this issue -- for years now, unfixed.

Worse? There's nothing more unnerving than hearing a prowler outside your house and telling Echo to turn on downstairs lamps and having it argue with you while your house and garden is still in the dark with someone outside.

You will literally want to bash this piece of garbage into the cement just to get some satisfaction and closure.

______________________________

This more expensive speaker was billed as working via Zigbee even when your Internet connection is down. It's never worked reliably even for turning a light off and on. The older Echo Dots were actually more reliable than this ever was.

At any rate, I have just about reached my limit with Amazon and Echo and am looking for a competitor's product.

Like eBay that used to work quickly and simply, over the years it's been bloated to the point it's time consuming and labyrinthine. I assume this is because workers and supervisors need to show results and justify their existence so over time what worked simply becomes bloat ware.

As a reult of this, now when ask what time it is instead of just answering briefly it tells me the time AND then tells me to have a nice day, or to enjoy national blah blah blah day.

Think about what just happened there. A MACHINE with no real personality just took the time (and my time) to wish me a nice day. Maybe that's cute once, but it gets annoying. Imagine if you flipped a light switch in your home and instead of just doing its job it suddenly had a personality and wished you a good day, and then your toaster, and so on, all throughout the day. It's ridiculous. That's not what I bought into. I literally simply wanted to be able to walk into a room and turn on three lights at once instead of having to go around the room and do it one by one.

Not even that works anymore.

The system works for awhile and then a name stops working, so if you've called it desk lamp suddenly you have to call it something else. There are only so many logical things to call it. So I've gone through a few name changes and each successive one and more and more strained to have some meaning. My living room is now ""Garden Room"" and so on.

Worse still is the system repeatedly tells me a device isn't working and then I ask again just a second later and suddenly it works normally. Hey, Amazon, how about the stupid device tries three times before telling me it doesn't work instead of just the one?

Just as infuriating is very clearly saying to turn something on and getting a message that says, ""A few things share the name 'table lamp.' Which one did you want? Well I've got WRITING TABLE lamp and STUDY LAMP and CONSOLE TALBE LAMPS and FRENCH LAMP and BEDROOM 1 LAMPS and BEDROOM 2 LAMPS and so on. Most of those things don't sound anything like one another, but still the device can't figure it out and constantly asks me which one I want.

I suspect this has to do with waking up after you say the wake word so while it's doing that it misses the first (and more descriptive and unique) word and just starts listening at ""lamp."" Either way, it's annoying, and I don't recall this ever being an issue with the early/simpler/cheaper Echo Dots before I got this one.

Every day is infurating, and because unlike a human it's the exact same thing, it's more maddening.

I simply want to be able to say what time is it or what's the temperature or so on and get an answer, not a verbose response.

Even if you want to play an audiobook and shoot the sound over from your phone to this speaker via Bluetooth that works, but Amazon in its infinite wisdom decided the speaker should (instead of just start playing your book) say, ""Now connected to blah, blah, blah."" Just play the book and we will know we're connected.

Do a Net search for Amazon Echo or Amazon Alexa and the word verbose and you will see I'm not alone in my issues here.

It's so awful even though I'm invested in this maddening system I'm looking into competing products designed by humans who actually gave them some thought as to how they interact with humans.

They had me try to download the Alexa app, but the download failed each time because the website it rigged to always show a failure. That is how they get you to purchase their product. They tell you that you have viruses on your computer and go through quite an elaborate scheme, taking control of your computer, pretending to scan and clean up the so-called viruses. All of that is fake. They are not really doing anything. It only appears that way. I had a gut feeling about this and called Amazon.

Hellman,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2019","After owning several 2nd gen Dots, we finally decided to add the full size Echo to our home. Very noticeable improvement in sound and voice recognition. While it does not replicate a surround sound system or soundbar (which it doesn't claim to do) it provides better than satisfactory sound with a surprising amount of bass. We listen to all sorts of music through Pandora, Spotify and Amazon and have no complaints with the quality of sound, it gets quite loud and remains crystal clear. When we want the music to extend to our living room, we simply tell it to connect to bluetooth and it automatically turns on our surround sound system and continues the song.

Our Echo lives in the kitchen and functions as a source of music, news, games while we are cleaning, cooking timers and random questions about ingredients. Its convenient to ask Alexa to turn on the under cabinet lights when your hands are dirty and you need a little extra light to see what you are doing. Its also convenient to ask her to turn the A/C lower when it starts getting hot in the kitchen.

As far as connectibility with smart home devices, it was easily recognized through our Alexa app and took zero updates or syncing to get our Hue lights, smart thermostat and sound system working with voice control. If you don't already own an Alexa device, it will take a little bit of setup.

We are thoroughly happy with the purchase and continue to recommend to friends and family. As far as privacy concerns, if you have a smart phone, it is already listening to everything Alexa would hear anyways, if you don't like that then smart devices are not for you.

Stevee108,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2020","I bought two identical Echoes, 3rd generation, verified purchaser. I installed one in the den and one in the master bedroom. I also installed 4 Alexa compatible security devices in those two rooms. The Echo were set up for Apple I-Tunes. After a week, the Echo in the bedroom worked flawlessly. The Echo in the den would constantly tell me that “Apple Music is not supported by this device.” The next time I tried the same command, the Echo would work. I never got this message on the Echo in the bedroom. I uninstalled and installed Apple Music Twice. It worked flawlessly for a couple of days, and then it went berserk again on the Echo in the den. As an engineer, I decided that I would run a totally controlled experiment with the response of the Echo as the only variable. I recorded several voice bytes with the exact same Alexa command of “Alexa Using Apple Music Play Willie Nelson Seven Spanish Angels.” All of the recordings had 10 seconds of silence at the beginning before it gave the “Alexa” command. I chose a specific sound byte that had properly worked twice in a row. I placed the recorder on the arm of the recliner that I usually sit. I had access to a sound meter calibrated and certified for regulatory noise compliance regulations on all governmental levels. The noise meter was last calibrated in November 2019. The certification is valid for 12 months. I placed the microphone of the noise meter within 2 inches of the Echo. I played the same sound byte 20 times without changing either the location or volume level of the recorder. The plots of what was received on the sound meter could be plotted, and all 20 plots were a perfect overlay. With scientific certainty, the Echo was receiving the exact same sound byte 20 times in a row without the slightest variation in sound level or voice intonation. The results: 8 times the Echo told me that Apple Music was not supported by this device, 6 times the Echo interrupted the sound byte and started playing unsolicited music and 6 times the Echo played the requested song via the requested source. Again, I could verify and certify that the Echo was receiving the precise same sound byte every time. I then took the recorder into the bedroom and played the sound byte 20 times there. The distance was about 3 times further away than in the den. The results, the Echo played the correct song 20 times in a row. There is obviously an issue with the quality control with this device. I got a good one, and I got a turkey. It’s a roll of the dice on what you are going to get.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Sean Christopher,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2019","I purchased my first Alexa Echo 1st Gen two years ago and I fell in love right away! It was bittersweet for me to replace it with the newer 3rd Gen but they had an amazing trade-in offer so I had to take advantage of it. First thing to note this Echo is much shorter than Gen 1 but a little wider which I prefer because it looks and fits better on my kitchen island. The new blue color is amazing if you’re considering getting it! Setting up the new Echo was the easiest most seamless process! I literally took it out of the box, plugged it in and in under a minute it set itself up and was ready to use! I didn’t have to do anything, it was already programmed with my smart lights and my WiFi, couldn’t ask for an easier setup. I love my Echo and use it every day and if you’re considering getting one, I say go for it! If I had to critique or complain about anything the only thing I could say is the wall adapter is really large since it’s still a square block like Gen 1. This is more of a personal opinion but Gen 1 had a rotating top to turn the volume up and down (which I loved) where as Gen 3 has volume up and down buttons. Functionally they both work I just though the rotating volume top was more fun and unique, but I’ll live on just fine with the buttons.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jayfire2620,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2020","They had great deals on these a month or so ago so bought this and a few dots. Set up was super easy, had some issues getting them all set up to play music everywhere at once but easy fix, plenty of info online and most of it was a faulty modem issue where I needed to get a new modem.

Sound quality is really good. I love music, blasting it loud and it handles it really well. Even just as a music player I'd be happy. Not as good as my Bose but there is a huge difference in price and my Bose sits in one spot on one end of the house not playing everywhere like these. Really impressed with the sound though.

Had an issue with connection though. My Comcast internet kept dropping and I would lose my connection to the speakers. Spent hours trying to figure it out, searching online reset a couple of the dots and had to set everything up again....huge headache over and over till I got my new modem. Finally found if you unplug it and plug it back in, it reconnects! Super simple yet a pain to find the answer.

If your doing smart home stuff it works really well. Getting some music, Pandora, Slacker/LivexLive to play stations can sometimes be a real pain. You have to know the station name exactly and still at times plays stuff you didn't want. 95% vs 5% works/issues had some issues with smart plugs and lights not working directly with it too. Had to get a Samsung Smart hub to use a couple Samsung products you couldn't get elsewhere but intrigating them was rather easy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Eleanor,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2020","Just bought Echo on sale for $60 from Staples. I just needed a Bluetooth speaker for my TV and this is all they had. I was worried my Apple TV 4th generation wouldn’t pair with Amazon speaker. It does (You Just have to tell Alexa to turn on Bluetooth) and for a third of the price of the Apple speaker. The sound quality is great. Very smooth. Much better than the Cambridge Bluetooth speaker I bought a year ago and now doesn’t recharge anymore. It’s my first Amazon device so there is a learning curve. It doesn’t appear much different from Siri. I only use Siri to set the timer when I’m cooking or to look up phone numbers and I image Alexa would do the same if I ask her. I won’t trade in my Apple phone, iPad, or TV so it’s nice that Amazon is so flexible.

UPDATE: No sound coming from Alexa while paired with Apple TV this morning. Called tech support, we cleared Alexa and set-up from scratch. Still nothing. I tried a 3mm audio cord. Still nothing. I was ready to give up and to return Alexa. How sad I used her last night to play Thunder storm sleep sound to drown out annoying loud neighbors. Slept like a baby. I decide to give it another try. I went back into App clicked on Echo settings and under general found AUX Changed to Line in. HORRAY! I’m back in business. She’s working great. I can’t control sound volume with Apple remote but I can use Alexa voice command or my TV remote. Not a big deal. Aux doe not appear to interfere with Alexa other functions.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Dr-Phone,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2019","I have 4 of the pluses! For the most part I like the sound of them. They sound very good. I had no issue with just unboxing the units and plugging them in! The units connected to my Wi-Fi with no issues. It does take about 45 Minutes for the Temperature sensor to come online. Then I noticed it is about 1.5F lower then all my other thermometer in the house. This looks to be the case for all 4 units. I didn’t find any way to be able to a-just them to correct the reading. They also seem to take some time to change as far as the reading. If I could give the Pluses a offset to use for the Temperature to correct them! Then I would be very happy with them. Not tried out the Zigbee hub in any of the units yet. I don’t have any devices that talk Zigbee.

I like the fact if you have 2 or more Echo Pluses! You can ask what the house Temperature is and it will then give you the average Temperature of the house.

I also like the fact I can use the
built in Temp to be able to control my ceiling fans through the Bond home fan controller.

** Update 2/13/2019 **

In testing the hub some more found the following
The Echo Plus will not read Temps 32 and below. So if you want to get the temp outside on a cold winter day! This will not work.
If you have a sensor with a Humidity reading! Again the Echo Plus will not see it at all.
If you have any sensors that report there battery status! You will be out of luck using the Echo Plus hub. It will not even show it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
ABQ Matt,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2019","After doing some research on which platform to start my home automation process I chose the Echo because of the supported products and ease of use.
The sound is clear and loud enough for all your needs. I have mine in a large living room (600 sq/ft) with 15' ceilings and it fills the room up nicely.
As for the voice recognition it easily picks up both my commands and my two kids voices with minimal errors. Yes Alexa still makes mistakes and yes it will still frustrate you sometimes like all voice commanded AI we interact with on a daily basis.
The built in hub is nice because on accessories I am not worried if it is WiFi or hub required because this can do both. So far I have done the August lock and Singled Bulbs with no pairing problems or interaction issues with the app and devices.
Routines are simple and easy to set with app and you can stack multiple items on one task. For example at 30 minutes after sunset it checks the front lock to make sure it is locked and locks it is it is unlocked, turns on the living room lights, and turns on the porch lights.
Complaints:
Where it is located I have to use a WiFi extender, and if I reset my router I have to reset the Echo because it will not automatically reconnect to the extender.
Some devices still require bridges and/or 3rd party apps to be installed even though you have it connected through the Echo.
It gets really expensive once you start the automation process and it is addicting. You start to enjoy having things automated and the $20 bulb here or the $50 switch here really adds up very quickly.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Dave Ohlund,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2019","I have a pair of the 2nd generation echo plus paired up with the subwoofer, and they sound great. Been using for several months, the first time setting it up was a bit frustrating because when setting up the pairing, the speakers didn't recognize each other, then the subwoofer, repeat a few times until it worked.
Was dreading having to set these up again after moving, but no issues at all the 2nd time, just changed the wifi password and it set everything up like before. Switching the speaker setup (left/right) was a couple taps on the alexa app.

I don't use it much for apps or games, mostly for music (I use amazon music unlimited, spotify, iheartradio, tunein) and it's been great so far.
My kids ask it random questions all the time, which is interesting and sometimes way more entertaining than it should be. Sometimes it doesn't know/understand and they rephrase their question (or simplify their question) and keep trying till they get an answer, other times it answers on the first question. And sometimes it 'hears' something way different than what was asked and the response is not what was expected and hilarious.

Right now there's one thing it does that's annoying the crap out of me. When playing a radio station, it will not stop playing unless I go into the alexa app and turn it off. If I say 'stop playing', 'stop', 'pause', or even tell it to play a song, it pauses for a moment, then continues to play the radio station.

Overall I give it a 3-4 star rating, I would definitely buy these again, and will most likely get the next generation model when it comes out, or shortly after and set these up in another room.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Experienced at life,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2018","I primarily bought this because I wanted to enter the world of smart devices. I bought some google home minis, but found you had to download apps from outsiders in order to use the smart light I wanted. I looked at the privileges that were being demanded by the app and decided an app to control lighting had no reason to know who I called, when I called, or anything else about me personally. Amazon already knows me (my husband thinks they pretty much own me) so I was more in favor of using the echo plus since it has a built-in hub and no third party app or skill was desired for the smart light I bought (actually, I received a free smart light bulb when I purchased the echo plus).

I had a bit of trouble getting the light to work - Alexa didn't find it at first but I reset the bulb and then I was good to go. I agree with others that the Alexa app interface is not really intuitive, but now that I have the light up and running, I am in love. My 94-year old father is not very mobile and when he comes to stay with us, I wanted him to be able to turn the light on and off while he is still in bed. This feature now works like a champ so I am very happy.

I have played some prime music and that works well, but I still have a lot to learn about all the echo's features.

The only reason I would not give it 5 stars right now is the alexa app - but that is really a separate issue, so I gave it 5 stars.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kenneth I.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2020","My Alexa was shipped to me yesterday and I couldn't be happier with what I can do with it already! I read the mostly Positive reviews and some Negative. So I didn't really know when it arrived whether I'd experience any of the Negative.

Well, I'm glad to say that what I've learned and programmed in 'one-day' are nothing less than spectacular! From the moment that you plug it into the wall it takes you through a Set-Up Routine that couldn't have been easier. Using the Amazon Alexa App on my Apple iphone I was able to program responses that I wanted.

Amazon Tech Support flawlessly guided me to pair with my Iphone in less than five minutes! It has my entire directory and all I have to do is ask it to call someone. It checks the number with me and then makes the call.

Sometimes I like browsing through You Tube. I should mention that once Alexa is sharing the same Wi Fi network as my iphone. it it takes the place of the speakers in the phone. You'd have to turn Alexa's volume way up to hear the You Tube voice clearly. This can easily solved by activating the iphone's Ear Speakers and now the voice comes through the iPhone.

It's very User Friendly. Greets me in the Morning and goes into Sleep Mode at night. So far I haven't found anything that I can't do with it. The Tutorials found in the Amazon Alexa App are easy to understand.

Right now while I'm writing this review Alexa is playing Music that I selected and can be heard all over my home.

In conclusion I'd say that if you want one 'Go for It'!.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Justin,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2019","I currently own the echo dot 2 and a couple of the 3rd generation dots. I would always listen to my Amazon Music playlist while I cleaned around the house. I needed something with a bit more volume and sound so I went with this 3rd generation echo. The difference is definitely worth the upgrade. Voice recognition is better among other things. I love all of the features that Alexa has to offer. My son who is almost two has just recently started talking and he will randomly blurt of ""lexa playyyy shots!"". Of course he doesn't emphasize the A in Alexa so I help him out a bit and he gets a big ole grin on his face when Lil Jon and LMFAO start to play. The Alexa skills are great. The Guard mode when away also allows Alexa to listen for smoke alarms and glass breaking. This would result in a notification pushed to your phone. I would love for them to ad a feature that allowed several echo's to monitor these sounds while home. With one in the basement, kitchen, living room, and upstairs bedroom, It would be amazing if Alexa could hear a smoke detector from the basement or kitchen and then alert my bedroom echo with a very loud alarm. This would allow me to wake up much sooner since it takes a bit for smoke to get upstairs. Even then, Its hard to hear a smoke alarm in a hallway when you run a fan or window AC all night. Who wouldn't want to get out of the house before a fire got out of control? Amazon....please consider this feature. It would definitely save lives. It could even save households that keep fire extinguishers on hand. Anyways, buy this echo. You won't regret it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
OliverT2,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2018","I purchased Alexa Plus (gen 1) the day it came out and now this (gen 2) Plus Hub. I'll not rehash that experience so Amazon will not call me again. OK if you don't have one of these Hubs they are cool and I like over Wink, GE and Hue. Hue hub I gave away but still use Wink for Zwave and Stanley locks. I run all the switches and WiFi off Alexa/Echo hub. Now I have Alexa both gen 1 and 2 hubs running. Good news this one just sync's-up and no issues so far. So why did I purchase this well for temperature sensor and most important stand alone automation when WEB is down. Temperature works great if you wish to know as she runs 1.5 to 5 degrees hotter then the room when in use especially if you are enjoying the my opinion improves sound quality. So great if you want to take her temp but a word of caution if you are running heating/cooling automation off her reading alone. As for standalone light controller when internet is out also, guess that is some enhancement as I couldn't get it to work just got the typical RED ring. Why 4 stars, 1 because it is cool, 2 because it works kind-of, 3 because I purchased it after know what gen 1 was like out of the box and 4 so Amazon won't call asking me about my review. Really is a fun great product nice new Android App update is what I use as the main driver for home automation after giving up circa 1978 X10/BSR system till a few years ago. Why not 5 stars? I'll save that for when the product reaches the hype. I purchased not for what it can't do now but what it can do in the future. Except for new looks I have experienced nothing to praise over the older hub so far.",4.0 out of 5 stars
ABCruz,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2019","First off, I own several Echos... from the 1st Gen to Plus to Dots. So, this is not a 'bash' Amazon or Echo review nor is this me drinking from the Amazon/Echo Kool-Aid.

This is meant more as an observation of my experience with them... culminating with the Echo Plus 2.

Echo-wise, there are no obvious functional differences in how all these Echos work.

Appearance-wise, I really like the rounded unassuming appearance of the newer Dots and the Echo Plus.

Microphone-wise, here's where there seems to be differences. In my opinion, perhaps this explains issues with Echos after the first generation.

My first gen Echo is near instantaneous in the ring lighting up and the 'listening' sound (I have all of my Echos adjusted this way so I can hear actual and accidental activations).

Every gen since then, seem to have a delay between the wake word being heard and the Echo responding by lighting the ring and making the activation sound.

As much as I enjoy the Echo Plus 2, I have factory reset, voice retrained (from a foot away and even as far as ten feet away) and even deregistered the device several times... and there is still a half to one second delay in an acknowledgement that the device 'heard' me.

Before you respond that it must be a defective device, this is my 2nd Echo Plus 2 from a completely different source... in addition, all of my Echos, after the first gen, have this similar issue.

This doesn't ruin the Echo experience for me... it just tarnishes it.

I'm hopeful that somehow, someone, someday will actually address this and/or release a firmware update (if it is a software issue) to make these Echos really, really shine!!",4.0 out of 5 stars

I love the echo plus the sound quality is amazing the base is amazing I use it for everything I use it as my morning alarm, it’s my clock, it’s my weatherman, I use it for reminders all the time (I was constantly leaving sodas in my freezer and they were exploding and now I just asked Alexa to remind me to get my soda out in 10 minutes and it’s a quick simple request and it works every time and it has saved me money in my soda purchases) :)
I use it as a timer for exercises and stretches I get my news from it I use it when I’m away to turn on my lights I use it to play music for my dog when I’m gone (saves my tv as no more keeping the tv on for her) it’s just I don’t know what I would do without it at this point I use it not just every day but 100 times a day and it’s super easy to coordinate through the app on your phone with my second Echo Dot like to do things such as play music in both rooms at same time or have different reminders and timers kept separately.

The sound in this thing is insane, for a medium sized room, I never have to keep the volume over half, and the base is crisp and beautiful, you gear every little wub and punch, unlike the dot, which only tries to mimic the low sounds with its tiny tweeter. This is worlds better, is it better then a multi hundred dollar speaker or surround sound home entertainment system, hell no, but is it way more then what you could expect for a speaker the size of a beer pitcher? Hell yes as well!! The microphones seem to be able to pick up my voice even when music is playing and the air conditioner right beside it is blaring, and even though most of my smart home devices are wifi and not zigbee, I'm happy to be able to expand the choices of smart home devices I can now buy with the built in hub. The thermometer inside, I thought was useless at first, but I can set it to turn on my airconditoner at night when the temperature is over a certain degree, and off when it's under a certain degree, which saves myself from having to half brain command it to turn on and off in the middle of the night, I will be buying an echo sub to further enhance the lows in my music, not because I need to, but because I personally love bass in my music.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Roger J. Buffington,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2019","I am a bit of a latecomer to the Echo Plus and Echo, and for that matter to Alexa. You may count me impressed. I run two Echo Plus units plus the woofer unit. The music quality is very good. It is perhaps a shade less rich than my paired Apple Homepods which I have in another room. But the difference is marginal and I am satisfied with the music quality.

For use with Alexa this is a very good unit. Alexa has wildly surpassed Apple's Siri. I use Alexa to control my Sony TV, as an alarm clock system, and to control the lights in the upper story of my house. It was not at all difficult to set all of this up, and it is a joy to use. I am very impressed. I will say that the Echo Plus does not pick up voice commands quite as well as does the Homepod with Siri. If you are playing music or the TV at a high volume (as I often do) sometimes you have to put some volume in your voice to have Alexa parse your voice command. This is a minor nit.

Pairing was straightforward. As others have noted, if you change your pairing configuration, you first need to ""unpair"" the earlier group if you have one. No big deal.

Overall this is an excellent value for the money. Recommended. RJB.",5.0 out of 5 stars
SuperATV,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2019","I received the Echo Plus (2nd Gen) as a Christmas gift and I absolutely LOVE it! Not only was the set up super easy but Alexa is so helpful! I am not sure how we managed to keep anything straight before getting this! I have used the Echo Plus for multiple things from creating and adding items to a shopping list to playing music while cleaning and all of this completely hands free. No more paper shopping list that gets lost and no more searching YouTube for a song that I want to hear. I simply say ""Alexa, add milk to my shopping list."" Or, ""Alexa, play today's hits."" The best feature is the hands free knowledge that is just a question away. While making sugar cookies I needed a conversion for a measurement and my hands were covered in dough and flour. I simply asked Alexa for the conversion and had my answer without needing to stop, wash my hands, and use my phone or cookbook to look up the information I needed. I was also able to set my timer for the cookies by simply asking Alexa to set a timer for 8 minutes. A timer alarm on the Echo Plus alerted me when to remove the cookies from the oven. The Echo Plus links to my iPad and several wireless speakers throughout our house.

Raymond Ramirez,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2019","The Amazon Echo Plus is an intelligent amplified speaker that works just like all the previous Echo products but its larger size has two very good speakers, and produces great audio when playing music. The unit depends totally on the Alexa app installed in a smartphone to add ""skills"" (special interfacing apps). Since I speak mostly in English and my wife in Spanish, I set it up for both languages (U.S. versions). It is totally dependent on a good Wi-Fi connection, so if your setup is poor, improve i t before installing this unit.

One has to be careful as in anyone mentions ""Alexa"" in any sentence, it lights up and begins recording everything. So you must disable the microphone (with a button on top) if you meed to have special conversations near it.

The Alexa app does a good job of locating any device that it can control. Some may need a specific ""skill"" (manufacturer app), but Alexa found my Fire Stick, all my light switches (i lists the brands), and m Ring camera (also needs the skill installed). With a Vizio Smart Cast skill, it found my two Vizio TVs, and with a Roku skill, it found the two I have. I managed to play some of the thousands of songs I have purchased through Amazon, which is linked to the Amazon Music app, and m,y wife enjoyed saying, ""Alexa, play Yanni"" twice.

Eventually I will need to buy a smaller Echo unit (maybe a Dot) to put in my bedroom so I can control these devices from there. It has over 1,400 ""skills"" to install and use, yet I have just began to use Alexa's abilities.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I was able to tell her that it did indeed exist and could be in our living room for a mere $99.00.

I can use this to time my food, to remind me of appointments (which are easy to forget when every day feels like Saturday).

S. Tracy,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2019","So, after buying and trying a couple of echo dots, I bought 2 of these 3rd gen echo’s. I must say I was quite impressed with the sound after the dots. I also paired with an echo sub and a 4K Firetv Stick. With the Alexa app, the capability is there to set up a “theater” system. Actually it works pretty well. Setup took about 15 minutes including the speaker software/firmware updates.
Sound.....
So I’ve had for the last 20 years a 5.1 system with different high end receivers and Paradigm speakers. Now, I was NOT looking to duplicate the sound that system produced but, I was looking for something decent. Actually these 3rd gen’s paired with the little echo sub do pretty well. I’ve actually had quite a few people over that had in the past enjoyed my other system for “movie nights” or just sitting around playing cards listening to music, and they’ve all been impressed. Enough so that most are looking at setting up the same system at home.
I’m not going down the road of specs and stats. I’m just going to say I’m impressed and would purchase all again.
I’m hoping in the future there will be a firmware/software update that will integrate these speakers into a full surround. A 5.1 or even a 5.2 would be super.
For now I’m extremely happy with them. For the price they’re great.

I know the potential is there for Alexa to be great and I'm looking forward to its potential. Right now every smart device works on its own, so don't expect to easily connect with your smart TV or your security system straight out of the box.

Options are limited in other areas as well. I have Alexa on my phone and I connect my phone to my car stereo, but the service from the car company forces Google apps, because of Google maps. So you have to make the choice if you want to sacrifice one option or the other.

Also, since Alexa is an Amazon product, you'd think you would have better Amazon Music benefits. Unless you upgrade to a full plan, you can only stream to one device, or one style of music to every device. Your kids can't listen to their music in their room while you're listening to music in yours.

As I said, not quite there, but I gave for stars for the potential of where it could go.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2018","I am new to introducing Alexa to my home..

i like it but i think it could be a little more flexible..

I'm Australian, i sometimes sound slightly British from living there also.. i HAVE to have it set to USA English in order for all the functions (recognise my voice etc) to work, but then american Alexa doesn't always seem to know what i am saying.. i think it is short sighted that one would have to put on an american accent for some words to make it work at its best?!

The British and Australian Alexa voices are SO much better sounding too!! , but then the voice recognition would not work because my amazon account is based in the US where i live.. is there something i am not doing right?

I also asked Alexa how to spell a french word and it just didn't have the capacity to do this.. i tried rephrasing the question a few times - it ended up spelling 'FRENCH' bahahahahaha..

In todays world my feeling is AI should be less local and more international.. you've got a long way to go Alexa.. but i'm sure you'll get there! :-)

The other thing i noticed is the volume level across different music, news briefings and Alexa itself are all over the place!! Is there a way to set the sound levels like in MUSIC app on an iPhone that keeps everything at a consistent level?? That is a MUCH needed feature, Amazon...

DirtDiva,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2019","I have 2 first generation Echo's and 2 second generation Echo's. I have always thought for the size and its purpose, these were great to listen to, especially if you paired two together. I recently bought an Echo Plus for my Mom and did a double-take when I got it up and running and playing a little Red Hot Chili Peppers . I also have a Sonos and I'm going to say this is as good if not better. Why... because I don't have to deal with the fickleness of Sonos, its annoying at times and for anyone thinking I don't know how to set it up correctly, I have over 60 devices paired (Hue lights, Sonos, Smart Plugs, Wemo, and more). So yeah, the only one that always has issues is Sonos. This Echo Plus sounds so good, I'm thinking of replacing my other 3 Echo's. Its also incredibly responsive, more so then the one I replaced it with. I especially like that when I have the music turned up, it still hears the wake word. As for my Mom, I have a few lights set up, probably more in the future, what I liked was telling Alexa to ""find my devices"" and it was done in a few seconds. My mom thinks its ""magic"" and how did you do that....heh! I would highly recommend the Plus for the excellent sound quality, even if you don't need the hub.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Tigre,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2020","This is my first Echo device that I have really been disappointed in and I have several. I have 1 Gen 1 dot, 2 Gen 2 dots, Echo buds, and all of these work well together and sound amazing for what they are so I decided to go bigger. I Should have stuck with the dots. This Echo 3rd Gen is not worth the extra money. It doesn't sound much better than the dots, and for the big kicker, they are not compatible with the dots for things like connecting for stereo sound. I mean how is Alexa not compatible with Alexa?! There is that much of a change in software between generations that Gen 2's can't talk to Gen 3's? Really? Since that is the case, they need to say that plainly in bold letters on their website instead of making me dig for it on some help section after I already bought it! I would have bought something else!

As for the music, It's ok. Not much better than the Echo Dots honestly. The base is slightly more, but just slightly. For some types of music (like electric ambient music for example) it totally distorts the sound making what should sound like light clouds and sunshine sound completely discordant and more like something out of a horror flick.

I mean it's usable. It's an Echo. It works like any other Echo. But it seems the more of these I buy, the harder time they have coordinating which one is going to answer and on which one the music is going to play. I mean I tell my Echo in my bedroom to play music and it plays in my living room! Then to fix it I have to unplug all of them at the same time and then plug them all back in and then they work until the next time they get all confused.

I'm not sending the device back. I mean it works. Just not as well or as seamless as the 3 dots I had been using previously. I will be looking for something that provides higher quality sound to plug my dots into from now on instead of messing with the Amazon stuff if I feel it's time to upgrade again. Call me weird but I just have this thing for liking my music in stereo and having my devices compatible with the stuff I bought previously.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Marius,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2019","i had the 1st generation Echo that I bought from a friend in 2016. I loved it. The sound quality was amazing. It did amazing things. I played fun games on it. I got the weather. I set timers. I made shopping lists. I shopped on Amazon with it. Alexa woke me up. Alexa said good night. She turned on my lights and even set light timers for me. In time there won't be anything that we can't do with Alexa. She just keeps getting better and better and I have seen that progress since I first plugged her in back in 2016. I traded in my 1st gen Echo though Amazon. I told them the condition and right on the spot I had my trade in money to use towards the new 3rd gen Echo. They even gave me a shipping label to send it back to them and when they got it there was no issue with the trade in value I received.
This new 3rd gen echo is great. The sound quality is far better than the 1st gen and that one sounded great regardless of how loud I played music. Alexa keeps getting better and am happy to have one.. well many now as I have one in each room. Highly recommended.

Ms Maria,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2019","I love this. I use it mostly for music, alarms and ordering from Amazon. So many more possibilities but I use the apps for my security cams. I have an iPad so I see no need for the show me feature. But if you have a lousy, slow, ring app, I think that would be the hot shot. I tore the ring doorbell out with my bare hands I was so pissed. By the time you open the app everything that was going to happen has already happened whoever was at the door is already gone. By the time the app opens, everything that was going to happen has already happened. So the show me feature has got to be quicker than the ring app and would be a nice addition to alexa. Then I’ve connected “the dots”.. I wondered why they call them dots, now it all makes sense. I use the dots for stereo sound in my home. They all work the same as Echo. You don’t need Echo to have the dots either. Dots are smaller so the speaker is smaller, that’s all. Great for smaller rooms and still have a good quality speaker. Better privacy controls on these. You can turn off the speaker manually and if you want delete everything you said that day you can do that too. Ask Alexa to do it for you. Decent app. Play with the settings.

A. Traill,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2018","The Amazon Echo Plus 2nd Gen is perfect for my needs - I bought 2 Amazon Echo Plus & the subwoofer (check my act. to read that review). I have a large great room with 40ft ceilings and it absolutely fills my home with warm sound which can be heard throughout my house, and with the ""everywhere"" group feature I can successfully play my music throughout my home on my Echo's in stylistic fashion. I've been an audiophile for quite some time and this kind of quality for something affordable blew my mind.
I think my favorite feature is connecting this with smart home commands when paired with other devices - turning on lights, controlling my TV's, etc. It just makes everything so much simpler. I am highly anticipating future adaptability - the sky really is the limit with these devices. I would highly suggest these for your home as I have really enjoyed using them.
The only problem I've had so far is giving commands to play certain radio stations and the cursed ""I can't find (x)"" response. I really Alexa said something humorous when she can't find what I'm looking for, it would make it a lot less aggravating when I've been playing a Pandora or Amazon Music station and suddenly it can't find what I'm looking for.
Other than the minor nuisance of that, I am free to stream whatever station I want via Bluetooth on my iPhone or other smart pad, which negates my only discrepancy. My friends love interacting with Alexa when they come over! Highly suggest!",4.0 out of 5 stars

Additional review: Was called by customer service next day, and went through a series of steps, including rebooting the modem. After about an hour, Echo is up and running. Customer service rep knew his stuff.
Cons; Couldn't connect to the internet. App won't download to my Ipad, says I have to update to 10.0 and not able to do that with my Ipad. Downloaded the app to my android phone. App kept connecting my phone to a unsecured network and stayed there until I physically switched it back. (OK today found that it was only connected to the Echo, not the internet) App kept telling me that the password for the internet was wrong...it was not, tried it several times, even went into the router to verify the PW. Several times when the app kept telling me the PW was wrong it didn't bring up a place to change it. Had to reinstall the app and hard reset the echo to get back to a screen to type in the PW. Even in some of the areas where the internet was not needed there was a problem, after putting my phone number in it said that the number belonged to another account. App not helpful, and it seems that the app is the only way to run this little gadget.
So, after about 5 hours of screwing with this frustrating little gadget it's going back.

Denise Hamlin,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2019","For other ditherers out there like me. Don't over think it. Just do it! The Echo Plus is my favorite Echo Device to date. I'm an early adopter and bought the 1st Echo and and the 1st Echo Show. I was getting tired of the poor sound quality and figured it was time to upgrade. I spent a long time debating between the Echo and Echo Plus. I wishI hadn't wasted my time with the Echo. It's no contest. The Echo Plus is light years ahead on sound and that's the most important aspect to me as I listen to a lot of music. Alexa doesn't always understand my voice, but I am a Brit and it may be my accent, so I need to cut her some slack on that. (Although it is a bit annoying on times, considering I'm asking the same questions all the time. It's not like we use a full vocabulary with Alexa).

I don't have much experience with the hub. I really didn't buy it for that, but I do have the smart plug that came with the deal I got and that works like a charm. All in all I'm thrilled with my Echo Plus. I'm an Apple Fan and was seriously contemplating the HomePod for music. I'm not saying the Echo Plus is on a par with that, but it is good enough, (with the added benefit that I can use it with Prime Music), that I feel I can live with this for my music.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Rattlesnake,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2018","Before buying the new 2nd generation Plus, I had a 1st gen Echo, a 3rd gen Dot and an Echo Show. Most of my home automation was handled by SmartThings. With the addition of the new Plus, I have retired SmartThings and am slowing trying to have Alexa handle all of my HA tasks. The major issue holding this back is that Alexa's support for sensors is brand new and not yet fully developed. For example, the new Plus has a temperature sensors built in to it. But there isn't - currently, I hope - support for simply asking Alexa what the temp is in the room where the Echo Plus resides.

On top of which the features that are currently implements don't work so well. I created a routine that was supposed to send me a notification any time the temp in my living room got below 65 degrees. Just a simple routine to test how the temperature sensor is working. It worked sort of. I would get my notification but it would usually be delivered several hours after the trigger condition had been met.

Otherwise, the new Echo Plus seems to work well. Discovering Hue light bulbs works seamlessly. The sound is much better than my 1st gen Echo, even to my ancient ears. It's smaller, better looking and so far, at least, does everything that it's supposed to do. Amazon just needs a little more time to build out the software.",4.0 out of 5 stars
MrBlueSky,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2020","Sadly after less than 10 months, speaker sounds crackly, and voice recognition is hit or miss.

At first, this was an impressive device with great bass and excellent voice responsiveness. However, after about 6 months I noticed it starting to lag in voice recognition, and I had to repeat the wakeup word ""Alexa"" several times before it would respond. I also started to notice that sometimes the sound was a little crackly when playing music.

I listen to it daily, often for a couple hours as I work around the house, and I rarely have the volume above 40%. On only a rare few occasions have I ""cranked"" it up to 70%. I don't like things loud, and have pretty sensitive hearing, so 40% is usually quite nice and full sounding. However, as the months continued, I noticed the sound degrading more and more and the overall product began to sound more tinny and sometimes crackle with moderate bass sounds (even at only 40%).

Some songs seem to be still ok, but more and more are starting to sound steadily worse. And frequently I have to repeat ""Alexa....Alexa....ALEXA!"" many times, even when I'm only a few feet away before the device responds. My environment has not changed, as it is used in my master bedroom, so I'm not sure why the voice responsiveness would get worse over time...it's supposed to get better as it ""learns"" your voice commands, accent, and speaking style. I have a ""Californian"" accent (which is about as zero of an American accent out there) so I'm very surprised it has lost much of it's voice recognition.

In any case, at first I really and truly was impressed with this little unobtrusive speaker. It really has much more power, and was more robust sounding when I first bought it. However, I am very disappointed that it is already starting to lose it's clarity in sound and responsiveness - at under a year old. I guess in this throw away technology society, perhaps I should have expected as much.",3.0 out of 5 stars
HillHC,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023","Love the “big” sound this 3rd gen puts out. I put my 2nd gen in the breakfast area and this guy on a shelf above my fridge; paired them up because the 2nd gen’s sound was almost as good, and it made cooking fun again.

The ONLY issue I have is that it mysteriously shut off after 7-8 months and wouldn’t turn back on. It had its original power cord and was plugged into a surge protector, yet zap. My 1st and 2nd gen Echos are still trucking along but not this guy. Now Amazon doesn’t sell them so I can’t even order a replacement. Bad form, Amazon.

Also, one other nitpick, I bought a new Fire tv for my bedroom, and was excited to pair it up for surround sound (using my 3rd gen to test it with plans to order two more if it sounded good) and it’s not compatible.

Lawrence Bolger,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2018","My echo plus setup experience was very interesting! The Alexa App is instrumental in the set up, so were my headaches caused by the app or the device? After logging into the wifi system and thinking i completed all that was necessary, i was left with a message in the device area. It said echo plus not available and needs to be removed. I tried a few things, unplug, plug, hold down reset. While i could ask and get response that indicated connection to internet, the device on the app, had no other means of editing or setting up. I called support and got a very helpful agent. Together we explored aspects of the Echo interface to no avail. Finally something happened i now had a new message on app “device is recalibrating and could take awhile”!
I asked the agent if this was unusual, and was told “very uncommon”, and she would call me back in a couple of hours.
Things i learned, in lower right corner, icon looks like house with vertical bars. This was the access to device setting. Once my recal competed, when using the menu on left, selecting device i was greated with my room temp! Look in upper right on this screen find 3 dots. Touch those then menu for this device opens. I created a group for origional echo and new echo plus naming it “everywhere”! So now i can say “alexa play _____ music everywhere” and both units play.
Now i need to find out how to change phone number (cell right now) to a different number, to utilize phone call out. I did use it to try it out and that worked fine.
Now i still have question on the aux in? Can i use IPod to play my own music. As a prime member i can play what is on Amazon Music, by asking.
Oh the agent did call back as promised, so i asked her about the aux in use, the response was try it. I havent.
So what could make this better? Maybe a PDF style manual explaining the app interface and what icons are, and what each will do ( like the house i mentioned earlier) vs guessing.
Sounds great but came close to returning that is why i gave 3 stars.

Chris,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2022","The Alexa voice recognition is great, and it understands you well. The sound quality that comes out is wonderful and we enjoy playing music for the whole family - the kids even can start their favorite songs.
However, I would never recommend this to my friends - it plays ads almost every time you interact with it.

Over the past couple years, the Echo has added ads to almost everything. Even after I have switched off advertising, nudges, hunches, and the new words/settings they keep coming up for this and adding automatically, when I ask ""Alexa, what's the weather?"" she responds ""The high for today will be 75 degrees. Did you know that you can add an item to your shopping list - just ask me 'Alexa please buy soap.'""

When ask her what the notification she is displaying means (which often indicates a package has been delivered), instead she says ""Your Epson printer is low on ink - would you like to order more?"" (since I ordered the printer on Amazon two years ago - it has plenty of ink, as it did the last 10 times she suggested ordering more ink).

When I say ""Play Eagle by ABBA"" Alexa says ""You can play this song if you upgrade to Amazon's Premium Music for $9.99 a month, shall I upgrade now?"" since I (or the kids) forgot to say ""on Apple Music.""

It's honestly gotten to the point where I am going to buy a Google Home, which is a shame because I'll have to redo all my smart home integrations which work very well on the Echo (if you discount the advertising).",3.0 out of 5 stars

More details on our cons, as the pros have been covered by many other reviews.

- cannot be set up from ethernet connected PC, requires either mobile app or wifi PC
- whisper mode is cool, but rarely works - the volume between ""too soft - can't hear me"" and ""not a whisper - use normal volume"" makes it very hard to get the whisper reply
- bummed that the smart home connectivity for Hue bulbs is limited to so few capabilities compared to a dedicated Hue hub

We have had several Echos over the years, and this is a replacement for an older generation, and I hope this one avoids the problems we have had with those, because they are now essentially paperweights:
- a recent firmware update (sometime in the last 3 months) killed the ability to connect with our router's 5GHz or 2.4GHz wifi, either as an existing, new, or factory reset new device. We had two identical ones, both replaced by these. One went to the garage where it was rarely used, noticed it was not connected about 2 weeks ago, but figured it just needed a reboot; however rebooting it didn't reconnect it. I hadn't used it in a while, figured maybe it died from the cold or something. The second was in storage in the house, so I got it out to use instead, and it powered up and connected to wifi fine - I checked weather, etc. to verify it was ok. I left it alone a few hours, it got an update and restarted, and was then in the same boat as the other one - no wifi connection can be made with any combo of settings I can try, but it does connect to the Android app via the Amazon wifi step of setup, so the hardware seems fine. All our newer Echos - Echo Plus, Echo Sub, Echo Show, Echo Show 2, work fine with the same settings.
- the Android Alexa app pops up an error message when wifi connectivity fails during setup, which covers the first two input fields on the page (network name and password) and can't be dismissed, making it difficult to edit the form without killing the app
- the Android Alexa app flips the phone from standard WiFi to a peer-to-peer Amazon Wi-Fi with the Echo during setup, and killing setup or failing setup leaves the phone unconnected to the internet unless you go back and reselect your normal WiFi network in Android settings
- support was free, but very slow (3+ minutes to type each response, I think they were in multiple simultaneous chats), and ineffective - they just followed the flowchart, ignoring what I told them I had already done, and asking the same questions over and over; the only new thing they had me try was the factory reset paperclip button, but it made no difference.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Jon S,"Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2020","I purchased the Echo Plus to integrate into my Philips Hue lighting and to give me a way to listen to music while I work. I found no problems integrating into Philips Hue. The only limitations I've found so far is that Echo devices aren't aren't recognizable in the Hue app. This is reasonably understandable and not necessarily for me a dealbreaker. As a workaround I wrote routines through ITTT when needed.

The sound quality is quite robust for a speaker of this size. The mids are right and the bass fills the room quite well. The only minor quirk for me and likely it is my preference is that I'd like a little more clarity in the 800hz-1000hz range.

The one noticeable detractor that I do have is that Alexa at times misunderstands a command. I like to think that I have a normal easily recognizable voice but for some commands Alexa misconstrues what I'm saying and regards it as something else. It happens about once a day where I have to say the A word (Alexa) midway through a command to try to correct Alexa. Allegedly, Alexa is supposed to over time better recognize your voice and improve on this but after a month I'm not sure how much better it will get.

Titlelog,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2020","I use Yamaha speakers and MusicCast to listen to SiriusXM music. I also have the original Echo Dot, the next generation Dot, and now the Echo Smart Speaker. The reason I bought the new Echo is because we have Prime, and I feel like I'm cheating myself by not using Amazon Music. I am a diehard classical music lover, and there are a lot of CD's on Amazon that are at least partially included with Prime. My comments will mostly be about how SiriusXM and Amazon Music compare to each other, because Yamaha's WX-030 (now discontinued) sounds pretty much the same as the Echo. The Yamaha speaker has to be controlled with a tablet or phone, but really only if you're changing channels. There are buttons on top to control power and volume, and the unit holds the most recent channel in memory. SiriusXM streams directly to the speaker over wi-fi, and I've had very good experiences with it, sometimes streaming music all day long with no issues. You can integrate the speaker with an Echo, but I'm one of those people who thinks voice control is overrated. The only other downside to the Yamaha is that it doesn't have a line-in jack, unlike the Echo. My experiences streaming Amazon Music have been disappointing, to say the least. The speaker frequently stops playing. The other day it stopped and I asked Alexa to play something else, and she apologized and said the stream stopped due to inactivity. The music had only been playing a little over an hour. Today I asked her to play a show on SiriusXM called Baroque and Beyond, and she did so right away. But about a third of the way into the show, it inexplicably started over from the beginning. The stations on Amazon Music also have issues with volume level, which can be entirely different from one track to the next. I've also found the selections to be less than great. Amazon continually tries to persuade me to upgrade to Music Unlimited, but based on my experience with the music included with Prime, I would be very reluctant to pay more. Hopefully the service will improve over time, but after having the Echo for only about a week, I already find myself using it less and less.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Being from Philadelphia, I'd opt for ""Yo!"".
- More granularity in volume commands: 3 is a
bit too soft and 4 is a bit loud. (you only get
10 volume levels at this time).
- Multi-processing. Right now, it only does one
thing at a time so, if you have it playing music and
tell it to turn a light off, the music has to stop for
several seconds while it issues the lightbulb
command, the bulb responds, and the Echo
issues it's ""Command successful"" beep.

K. Jacobson,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2019","Bought one of these for the kitchen. It replaces a Memorex Party Cube which had thoroughly degraded over a decade.

The functionality of Alexa is discussed at length everywhere and is amazing. My only issue with this device is the sound quality. I think it's inherent to the design and I did anticipate this. First of all, the bass is astounding. I didn't know something this size could create that kind of bass. I'm afraid treble is another story. In order to create the 360 degree sound, the tweeter (as you can see in the product description) is pointed upward inside the device. It fires internally. The midrange radiates quite well out of the unit as reflected sound. However, the high frequencies (say, above 14khz) do not fare so well. So overall the treble slopes off quite a bit. The old Party Cube, like the Sonos One, has outward firing tweeters, so you are not relying on sound reflection for what you hear - you get the whole spectrum straight from the source, like conventional speakers. So you miss a bit of the magic of vocals, or drum high hats, atmospheric sounds and the like. Out of the box the overall tone is weighed quite a bit to mid bass. Alexa has some basic tone control (Bass, Midrange, Treble) which can help just a bit.

Overall though, the Pros outweigh the cons on this device and I'm happy to have it!",4.0 out of 5 stars

I highly recommend that this becomes part of your trash. If you need this translated, find a Grunt and have them explain it to you. My Kilo 3/1 (Westpac 89) brothers will understand. If they sold this in the Driftwoods store, I woulda bought a dozen. Semper Fi!",5.0 out of 5 stars
David Goldblatt,"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2020","Actually nothing to dislike. I previously have the smaller Echo Dot system and I thought that sounded great. The echo third generation is amazing! It has such phenomenal bass response and the rest of the sounds is great as well. The app gives you a three band EQ. Alexa is very good for recognizing your voice. Sometimes she misinterprets what you were asking but it is probably because it is not something in her database. I love the concept. I don't like when I play music from my phone through the Echo using Bluetooth but there is a 3.5 mm Jack which can be configured for audio input or audio output through the app. While the AI isn't perfect it does very well providing you with access to information and seconds, playing music from Amazon music as well as other music players which are use such as Pandora, TuneIn and others. All you need to do is ask and most of the time you get the information you were looking for. It is very convenient to have Alexa set a timer for you whether it is timer for taking a nap or something in the oven, all can be set using your voice. It doesn't get any easier than this. I can only imagine what the pro version of the speaker sounds like.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Nicholas White,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2020","I bought one of these on sale for $75. I ordered the (RED) edition, It's gotta be one of the best purchases I have ever made. I'm a big fan of music, a musician myself, an audiophile, and a avid lover of all thing's audio. While this doesn't compete with big old massive tower speakers. It compares very favorably with bookshelf units (when paired with the Echo Sub) as a clear, great sounding little speaker. A lot of review mention bass, if you're looking for bass go order a set of massive tower speakers and the amp to push them. That being said, at low and medium volume, these things PUMP OUT some surprisingly low bass for a 3"" woofer. not only is it low, but it's crystal clear and very smooth and natural sounding. At low volumes (10-20%) I find the midrange to be a bit retracted, but this goes away the closer you get to 30-40% volume. at high volumes, this speaker pulls back on its bass output as I expect it has been designed to do, it's a small driver. I find that this speaker sounds its best around half volume (Which is around normal listening level anyway). These do fill your room with sound by the use of a very intelligent acoustic design to provide you with 360 degree audio. This thing just sounds really good, I am more than likely going to be ordering a few more.",5.0 out of 5 stars
PG,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2019","Originally owner of Echo Dot 2nd gen, decided to buy Echo Plus 2nd gen because of temperature sensor so that alexa could automatically turn on/off space heater at specific temperature, after following youtube tutorials and setting everything up, ran multiple temperature routine tests & they all failed, alexa would not shut off/turn on space heater on it's own according to ambient room temperature. Later did more research on the subject and found out that lots of other people had the same issue with alexa not being able to control their equipment based on temperature.
Another thing I noticed from Echo Plus 2nd gen was that there was a 10 second delay before playing ""tunein"" radio, with echo dot 2, that delay was only 2 seconds.
And yet another annoying thing i noticed about Echo Plus 2nd gen is: while she's not playing anything if you ask her ""set volume to (a number from 1 to 10)"" she does not play confirmation sound tone so you can't know how loud she really is, on ""Echo Dot 2nd gen"" she plays that tone which is really helpful (even though confirmation sound after each normal request is disabled in settings).
So for over a $100 buying a glorified mono speaker, no matter how amazing it sounds, just doesn't make sense in my opinion.
P.S. Please note that this review is written on ""March 2019"" it is possible that Amazon may have fixed some of those issues since the time of writing this review.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Donald Woodwell,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2020","The unit works as advertised, however, I could not download the app due to network problems and using a PC to set up the Alexa app was very time consuming and confusing. Amazon's customer service brought on line a 3rd party tech support outfit called Basic Software Systems. This was supposed to be a 'free' service. The tech installed the app on the Echo unit via my PC.

The tech insisted that I need to renew my Windows 10 license & offered me three plans for 1, 3, & 5 years. I objected since such renewals are never necessary when Windows is installed by the manufacturer. However I agreed to the 1 year renewal at $150 knowing that this would probably be their fee.

As it worked out, they sent me a contract for one year of support services for the $150. This tactic is clearly a poor way to do business. With the assistance of my credit card bank's customer service rep., we both objected to BSS on the phone and a few hours later received an E-mail stating that BSS would refund the $150.

IMHO, this is one third party tech support firm that Amazon needs to drop as it reflects badly on their capability to refer customers to an honest support group.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jacobo G.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2020","Compré mi Amazon Echo y hasta la fecha me ha funcionado muy bien. Estoy impresionado con su reconocimiento de voz ya que puedes estar a una distancia considerable y aún así Echo detectará que le estás hablando. La calidad de sonido es excelente al igual que su precio cuando la compré en oferta ($79.99). Para mi valió mucho la pena y seguro compraré un Echo Dot y un Echo Flex para ir complementando mi casa.

Cons:
No se si es solo mi Echo pero su receptividad de WiFi es muy baja. La instalé dentro de mi habitación, a unos 5 metros de distancia del router principal que se encuentra en el pasillo y al conectarla me decía que detectaba menos de la mitad de la señal. Lo cual me preocupa porque siendo un producto Amazon esperaba mejor calidad en ese sentido. **ACLARO QUE NO SE SI ÚNICAMENTE ES MI ECHO O ASÍ SON TODOS**.

Tampoco responde a preguntas complejas o algunas preguntas aleatorias del día a día. Tampoco existe un nombre registrado para la ubicación de mi casa por lo que no me dice la temperatura correcta ni funciona la información del tráfico. *AMAZON, ARREGLEN ESTO POR FAVOR*

Si tu internet es lento o la velocidad varía mucho seguro tendrás problemas y a veces tu Echo no podrá ejecutar tareas ni responder a tus solicitudes. Puede también que llegue a desconectarse de tu red (me sucedió ya).",4.0 out of 5 stars
Denise,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2018","Let me start by saying that I have several echo devices in my home, and really, I love them. It’s great to be able to turn lights on and off by command, to play games, stream music, and do so many other things with these devices. I’m hooked.

There is one major problem, though. When I first bought my echo plus speakers, things were great. About 2-3 days later, I linked my speakers together and gave Alexa a command to stop playing the music. She hesitated, but followed through. About a week later when I gave Alexa a command to end the music, she hesitated and then kept playing the music. Um, hello, who’s in charge here? So I gave the command again, louder. Same response from Alexa. I thought, “Dang, this girl likes her tunes!” It wasn’t until I walked over to my speaker in the family room and gave the command to stop the music that the music finally stopped. Had this not happened 3 separate times, I wouldn’t bother writing about it. What’s the point in all of these microphones on this device if Alexa’s just going to ignore me and jam out to Lithium XM anyway?

If this stops being an issue, I will update my review and give a 5 star rating. Right now, though, Alexa is kind of moody.",4.0 out of 5 stars
celticprncss,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2019","This was a gift from my hubby. I love to play music all day, and am really enjoying hearing it through out the house. Listening to my favorite radio station gets terrible reception, and I'm really tired of my old CD's. So basically I've become a Pandora junkie on my Echo. The speakers are fantastic for my listening needs and I so enjoy being rooms away (like preparing dinner) and still being able to tell Alexa to turn up or down the volume.
I also check the weather daily, and like how she notifies me of a package delivery. I know that I underuse Alex's skills terribly, but for my needs she is about perfect. Oh, and my favorite classical radio station comes in crystal clear with her.
Dislikes: Alexa sometimes will not understand basic commands that I have given her before, such as a music station that I have used many times. She will say "" Sorry, I don't know that one."" So we go around and around as I try to get her to play something she has played many times before. I usually just give up. Also, when watching tv, its eerie because she seems to come to life and out of the clear blue she starts talking. Briefly, but talking gibberish. We think she might be posessed............But still, I love her. She has quickly become about my favorite gadget of all times!!!!",4.0 out of 5 stars
SRP,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2024","My echo only worked smoothly for a year. After that whenever I would play anything on it, there would be disruptions and weird noises in the middle. I would use it at night for sleep sounds and the random speaker noises would wake me up. I reached out to customer service many times but they kept telling me to switch my station or skill or unplug/restart my device. That was a short term fix. Now my echo can barely play music for more than 5 mins and customer service will not help with that. Hopefully the newer gens don't have this problem because it's really annoying.",2.0 out of 5 stars
