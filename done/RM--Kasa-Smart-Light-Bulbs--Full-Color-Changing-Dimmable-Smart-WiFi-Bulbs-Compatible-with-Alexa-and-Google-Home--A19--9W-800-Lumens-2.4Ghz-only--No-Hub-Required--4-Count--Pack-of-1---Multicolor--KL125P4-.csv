Kaidesa,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024","More and more I've been finding myself surprised by TP-Link and their smart-home offerings. This is no different. The lightbulbs are exceptionally easy to get going and to pair. And they don't flash weird colors prior to setup like every other smart bulb I've used.

Unlike most other smart bulbs, I just shoved this thing, set it up in my app, and was on my way. This thing was detected by Amazon in my Alexa app almost immediately, and voice control was rather effortless (minus the typical quirks with voice control) for the most part.
Colors as well as different white modes were easy to select, very easy to tell apart color-wise, and rather vibrant. Not as vibrant as some other brands, but the ease of use and ability to use with Home Assistant without needing to flash firmware or mess with anything more advanced easily make up for that, in my opinion.
Did I mention that it works with Home Assistant? Kind of a huge buying point for me these days. Control seems to be local despite me needing to have an account. As of the time of me writing this review, I currently have these on a VLAN in my network, unable to speak out, and they still work flawlessly.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kevin,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2024","Solid product. The colors are spot on. I especially like the different shades of white through the day if you set them to adjust with the time.
Tried other bulbs w Alexa and they either didn't work at all or had to be reconnected all the time. What a pain!
I definitely recommend these as smart bulbs for use with Alexa but...
The first several bulbs I purchased, I checked the box at checkout to link them to my Amazon/Alexa and bam! They setup immediately with Alexa. I didn't have to use the manufacturer's app.
However, I bought another set, checked the same box at checkout, and they did not connect using Alexa.
So I downloaded the manufacturer's app and set one up and it broke the connection with all the previous bulbs and Alexa. I couldn't even delete the original ones from the Alexa app.
So I...
-Disabled the skill from the manufacturer's app within Alexa
-Set up all the bulbs using the manufacturer's app
-Deleted the Alexa app from my phone and reinstalled it (don't worry, everything is still there once you log in)
-Re-enabled the skill in the Alexa app
All the lights showed up in the Alexa app again. Everything was good in the Alexa app as far as routines and everything else, except the lights. I had to re-add the lights to the existing routines.
So I would suggest setting up the bulbs in the manufacturer's app FIRST and enable the skill in the Alexa app.
I hope this is helpful :)",5.0 out of 5 stars
Austin,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2024","I have used several different brands of cheap smart home wifi direct products. TP-Link has hands down been the most reliable. Wemo-too many frequently required updates in-order to operate. Feit Electric- Wont stay connected to Wifi. Geeni- Wont stay connected to wifi. The only con I have had with TP-Link is occasionally I would have one that is difficult to setup in the first place. But once it is setup, I have very very rarely had any problems when trying to use them. MAYBE one issue in 6 months when trying to turn a bulb or plug on versus the previously mentioned competition averaging 3 issues PER MONTH. I am slowly transitioning to TP-Link only smart products.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Krish,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2024","I purchased this couple of months ago and 3 out of 4 bulbs started malfunctioning within 3 weeks or so. One challenge with these bulbs is that they work only on 2.4 ghz wifi and if your mobile is on 5 ghz, you will have challenges to operate. Kasa app shows these bulbs as offline if you are on 5 ghz. I had to change my mobile wifi settings to use only 2.4 ghz for this to work.
I contacted kasa warranty support and Natasha did understand the issue quickly and helped with replacement. I sent the malfunctioning bulbs back to their rma processing hub and awaiting to receive a new set of bulbs. Hope they work well. Just wanted to thank Natasha for all the help and support throughout this process. 5 star rating to the kasa warranty support team, especially Natasha.",4.0 out of 5 stars

With 1000 lumens of brightness, it’s as powerful as a 60W bulb but much more energy-efficient. Seamlessly control your lighting from anywhere using your smartphone.

LCS,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2024","The Kasa app for iPhone and Android works very well; getting used to never flicking the switch on the outlet is important; teaching older clients to not flick multiple times means a LOT as if you flick it on/off a set number of times in a row, it factory resets the device, something I'm not a huge fan of.
The integration with Alexa and Apple HomeKit is well done, and the integration with Android is far less so; one of the key components missing in the Google integration is that you're pretty bound to one user being able to use the voice to turn on/off devices, whereas on Alexa/Homekit, it is easy to have multiple users do so.
Color change options matter. There are some brightness settings, but even at full bright you are talking the equivalent of about a 45W LED, so don't have expectations of a bright bulb. The base of this bulb also runs hot in comparison to several non-smart LED, which I assume is to be expected; after purchasing more than 48 of these, this has been a constant so I can't say it is a ""one-off"" experience. Will it impact longevity? That's hard to say.
The wifi range of these devices is spectacular for what they are; in fact, I've managed full functionality on these devices via wifi where signal is not available for laptops/etc. Really impressed by whatever they are doing there.
In comparison to competitor products, I ended up using TP-Links because of cost and general implementation. I do wish they would tie reset to a button press/etc. on the bulb itself instead of ""flick your light switch 3 times fast"" which is too easy for an installed bulb to be accidentally reset after you equip a smart home. With that being my only real complaint, I'd recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Æx Yair Cortex,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2023","Ever wish you could create a specific mood or atmosphere in your home just by flipping a switch? Well, with a dimmable color-changing light bulb that works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, you can! These bulbs are the ultimate way to add style and function to any room in your home.
One of the most striking things about these bulbs is their ability to change color. They come in a wide range of different tones, from warm whites to cool blues, making it easy to find the perfect shade to match your home's decor. Want a cozy, relaxing atmosphere? Choose a warm white or amber tone. Looking for a more vibrant, energetic look? Try a cool white, purple or blue. With so many shades to choose from, you can easily switch up the look and feel of your room in an instant.
Another great thing about these bulbs is their ability to dim. With a simple twist of the switch, you can take your light from bright and vibrant to soothing and subdued. This is perfect for setting the perfect mood for a relaxing evening or reading in bed.
Perhaps the most exciting feature of these bulbs is their compatibility with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. With simple voice commands, you can control the lighting in your home without even lifting a finger. You can dim or brighten the lights, change the color, or even create a custom scene for a specific time of day. It's the perfect way to add a touch of sophistication and tech to any room in your house.
But it's not just about the technology, these bulbs are also designed to be energy efficient. With LED technology, they use up to 80% less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs, making them both cost effective and environmentally friendly. Plus, with a lifespan of up to 25,000 hours, these bulbs can last for years without needing to be replaced.
One of the best things about these bulbs is their ease of use. There's no need to hire an electrician or install cumbersome wiring, you can simply screw these bulbs into any normal light fixture and start enjoying the benefits immediately. This makes them perfect for those who want to add a touch of style to their home, without the hassle of a major home renovation project.
In addition to their ease of use, these bulbs are also designed to be incredibly durable. Made from high-quality materials, these bulbs are built to last for years without any risk of breaking.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Mark L.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024","I bought 6 Kasa KL125 bulbs on Prime Day. I knew that they would return to the last on state after power was removed then reapplied. I was hoping I could make that work. I called Kasa and discussed it with an agent and then got an e-mail for more info. Within two days Kasa released new firmware, 1.0.6 (Beta) for KL125, that added a feature that when selected causes the bulb to go to the state is was at when power was lost. If it was off, it is off after power returns. If it was on when power is lost, it will be on when power returns. Game changer. You can still control it by a wall switch with a different selection. They also added fade on and fade off with multiple time selections. Of course all the color selections, brightness, schedule and scenes are there and real easy to setup. For the price, I plan to buy more. This is some of the best customer service I have received in a long time.

Alexandria Velez,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2024","Love it! I got them yesterday and was able to install them in my bedroom and office. It was easy through the app instructions. I recommend installing one bulb and pairing it with the app at a time so there is no confusion and if one bulb doesn’t blink to go into pairing mode, you need to switch the light on and off five times, so I recommend installing one bulb at a time.

Larry H.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024","I have several Kasa products in my house (switches, plugs, and now light bulbs), and they are so easy to connect and program. I use the Kasa app to connect, and the Alexa app does all the programming. There is a bit of a learning curve (with both apps), but once you learn it, you’ll have no issues. Two of the lights are outside the garage, but as long as you have Internet connection, you’ll have no issues. I have tried other Alexa compatible products, and none work as well or as easily as Kasa. Plus, they are less expensive than the Alexa brand products.

Brion Bell,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","Do you like to set the 'mood' with lighting? I do. Now, for a 'senior' person, I'm pretty 'techie.' I have purchased at least 4 or 5 different brands of these 'smart' bulbs. But I always come back to the Kasa products. They are not crazy expensive, (as are some of the lesser-performing brands), but they are consistent. Best of all, they don't require a person to have some kind of technical engineering degree to set them up! My wife, who is DEFINITELY NOT A TECHNICAL PERSON, asked me if she could try to set one of these up. I told her, ""Ok, but I'm not going to help you. Let's see if you can do it!"" So, I gave her the bulb and the instructions, and off she went to the table lamp beside her sofa in the living room. She took less than two minutes to read the instructions before she screwed the bulb into the socket and got her Android phone in front of her. She downloaded and installed the Kasa app and began the process. I watched as she got the light to blink by turning the light switch on and off a few times, then poke her phone a few more. Then, it went off and came back blue, then green, the brighter, then dimmer. The whole process performed by a (defiantly) non-technical person took less than 8 minutes and with no words that would be unsuitable for your children's kindergarten class!
After that, she spoke to the Amazon 'Echo' device, ('Alexa'), to turn it on whenever she sat down in her favorite spot to read or watch TV.
Since then, she has asked me for more of these bulbs...

Elizabeth Baldwin,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2024","I have at least 26 Kasa/TP Link Devices and didn't have any problems until I ordered 8 bulbs and 4 plugs on a good sale in September 2023. My plan was to replace older bulbs from a different company so I only have one app to setup all my devices. I have only thrown away one out of four of the bulbs from the other company and I have had them all
The bulbs worked fine until January when they started to fail one by one in different ways. Of course, this was too long to get them replaced through Amazon. I now have 6 of 8 bulbs malfunctioning. After troubleshooting and trying to fix each one for a couple months I contacted support. Two different times they told me to try things I already had. I guess I finally said the magic words of ""replace them under warranty"" and we started the RMA process. Their warranty says they can also replace the bulbs with refurbished ones even if yours are practically new.
Here's where it gets strange. Somehow I ended up with some KL 130 bulbs even though I ordered KL 125. I assume that either Amazon sent me the wrong box OR someone had some messed up bulbs, ordered the KL 125 and switched them out with their broken KL 130. There's no way to know. Regardless, I somehow have these malfunctioning bulbs that Kasa will not replace because I don't have a proof of purchase or serial number for the bulbs. Kasa doesn't print the serial numbers on the bulbs themselves and I never dreamed I would need to keep the boxes given how many devices I own from this company. I even told them several times that the only colored bulbs I own from them were the two receipts I provided and it's not enough for them to stand by their product.
These products were also registered in the kasa app the day I got them, but they needed to be added to a different website to fix them via warranty. The process says I will choose shipping method but I haven't made it that far in the process yet. I will update whenever I get there.
The main reason I bought these bulbs was to use them in conjunction with wall switches; mainly, if someone forgot to turn out the lights and I saw them on from a different room I could still turn them off. I also use them in rooms where the furniture is far away from the light switch (such as a bedroom) so that I can turn off the lights without getting up. However, if the power goes out the lights will come on even though I have them set to remember their last state. I assume this means that the data for this setting is stored in the cloud and not in the hardware of the device. More than once I have been awakened because a power flicker turns the lights on while I'm sleeping and I either have to get up and turn them off at the switch or wait for the modem and router to connect to the internet so I can turn them off.
Also, these lights don't have customization effects like the light strips do. I can't set up a thunderstorm effect in a whole room; the effect will only work on the strips.
TL;DR: If they send you different bulbs than what you ordered you're screwed when they malfunction. Serial numbers aren't printed on the bulbs. All bulbs come on during a power flicker regardless of your setting. They don't allow you to use effects like Kasa's light strips do.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Sara,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2024","The Kasa Smart Light Bulbs offer a convenient and customizable lighting solution with their full color-changing and dimmable features, compatible with Alexa and Google Home. However, while they have their merits, their reliability in staying connected to the internet leaves something to be desired.
On the positive side, these bulbs provide a wide range of colors and brightness levels, allowing for personalized lighting to suit any mood or occasion. The integration with popular smart home assistants like Alexa and Google Home adds to their versatility, enabling convenient voice control for seamless operation.
That said, the inconsistency in maintaining a stable internet connection can be frustrating and impacts their overall usability. There are occasions when the bulbs fail to connect or become disconnected from the network, disrupting the intended lighting settings and requiring manual intervention to reestablish connectivity. Often just one will disconnect, meaning I can’t control them both at the same time. Other times, both disconnect.
While the lack of a required hub simplifies the setup process, it seems that the reliance solely on a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network may contribute to the connectivity issues experienced by some users. It's worth noting that in environments with multiple smart devices or interference, these issues may be exacerbated.
In conclusion, the Kasa Smart Light Bulbs offer a decent lighting solution with their color-changing and dimmable capabilities, enhanced by compatibility with popular smart home platforms. However, the inconsistency in internet connectivity detracts from their overall reliability and usability. For users seeking a seamless smart lighting experience, it may be worth exploring alternative options with more robust connectivity features.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Yuval,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2024","I purchased these bulbs to get my entire house on one system as previously we were using a hodgepodge of wifi bulbs my husband and I had each acquired before we met. So, there was nothing wrong with the bulbs I was previously using, I was just looking for something cohesive, which I think is relevant to my review.
I will say, setting up the bulbs is very easy, easier than other bulbs I have used. However, I quickly ran into several issues that are more annoyances than anything else:
1. The same brightness/color settings on two different bulbs do not look the same. I have 2 matching lamps in my living room and when I chose the same brightness and color for each, they looked totally different. One was yellow and one was white. I couldn’t get them to look the same no matter what I did. This is extremely frustrating - as the same product, they should look the same. If you do not have 2 lamps in the same room that need to match, this probably won’t be an issue for you. I played around with all the bulbs in the package and finally found 2 that matched when set to the same settings.
2. One of my bulbs lags so slowly behind the app. When I turn it on it is ok, but when I click off it takes often ~2 minutes to shut off. This is frustrating because you never know if it will work or not, and if you click off again (because the app is slow), it finally catches up and clicks on and off several times. However, I plan to use these on a timer 99% of the time so this isn’t a huge issue at this moment.
3. As above, app is very slow.
4. Groups cannot have a set schedule - so what is the point of groups? I finally figured out the non-matching bulb colors, and realized I could group the two bulbs in the same room together to have one control. Awesome! I deleted the schedule from each individual bulb and went to create the schedule for the group…except you cannot create a schedule for a group. Huge flaw on Kasa’s part. Again, I only plan on using the bulbs on a schedule so I can set each bulb to the same schedule individually. Not that big of a deal at this time, but still annoying. What is the point of a group without a group schedule? I would also like to note that the lagging bulb mentioned above lags even when you click on/off for the group.
5. The mentioned bulb that lags behind the rest was having an issue where it would never turn back on to the last setting, it would always turn on to some random setting I never used. I want to say maybe this is a defective bulb. However, it now perfectly matches its counterpart in the same room whereas the bulb I previously tried to match it with does not match. So, are they all defective? I may never know.
I will say I uninstalled/reinstalled this bulb in the app and while it still lags behind the others, it now turns on to the last setting as it should.
Overall, I do like the range of colors and brightness on these bulbs and will stick with them because Kasa has a wide range of products I may want to add to my home in the future. I have found workarounds for the issues mentioned here. However, I definitely expected more out of this product.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Pros:
1. **Easy-Breezy Setup:** Setting up the Kasa Smart Bulb was smoother than butter on a hot biscuit. It practically installed itself, making me feel like a tech wizard without the hassle of incantations and spellbooks.
2. **Technicolor Dream Light:** This bulb isn't your average Joe. It boasts a whole spectrum of colors, turning your room into a disco, a tropical paradise, or a cozy cave—all at the command of your fingertips. It's like having a mood ring for your living space.
3. **Lazy-Person Approved:** The ability to control this bulb with your voice is the epitome of laziness achievement unlocked. I can now command my lights without lifting a finger, literally. ""Hey, Kasa, make it cozy,"" and boom, I'm bathed in warm, ambient light.
Cons:
1. **App-ocalypse:** While the app works, it feels like it's auditioning for a role in a horror movie—slow, clunky, and occasionally possessed. Trying to change settings can be as frustrating as getting that last drop of ketchup out of the bottle.
2. **Dim as a Teenager's Mood:** The brightness of this bulb can be a bit underwhelming. It's like trying to read a map by firefly light. If you're looking to illuminate the room like the surface of the sun, you might need more than one of these bulbs.
3. **Wi-Fi Dependency:** This bulb depends on Wi-Fi like I depend on caffeine. If your Wi-Fi goes on strike, so does your smart lighting dream. It's like having a high-tech lantern during a power outage—looks cool until you realize it's just a fancy paperweight.
In the grand scheme of illuminating decisions, the Kasa Smart Bulb walks the tightrope between convenience and occasional frustrations. If you can overlook the app quirks and the fact that it won't blind you with its brilliance, it's a nifty addition to your smart home arsenal. Just don't expect it to solve world peace or fold your laundry.",4.0 out of 5 stars

C Joseph,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2024","Using these on fixtures so I can put them on timer. I like the fact that you can program these in to turn on/off at various times or using sunset/sunrise (offsets permitted). I use one in my upstairs hall and never have to worry about making sure the light is on at night, especially if I'm getting home late. I wish they had a connection to the weather so if it's overcast and dark, they'd turn on automatically if programmed to do so.
The application is a little clunky, and clearly designed by engineers who have no idea of UX preferences of real world users, but I guess it technically does what it was designed to do. One major issue is the various devices/groups on the profile gradually appear on the app. I've gone to click a light to turn it on/off only to have another device appear at the last moment and I hit the wrong one by mistake. It's frustrating having to wait several seconds for everything to load especially considering the devices are exactly the same each time. I haven't added or removed anything since I've set it up. Hopefully KASA will see this and address the UX issues in a future upgrade.",4.0 out of 5 stars
ZehKaiser,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2024","I bought these to light up my office with the option to have a dance party if the mood struck. Setup went as expected using the Kasa app. They're also quite bright, even when in color modes.
I started to have trouble as soon as I restricted them from the internet. The app advertises that you have to enable remote control, but that option never shows up in the app, and they're always on the internet. As with all Kasa devices, they phone home to TP-Link servers. Cutting them off from the internet causes these devices to reboot every few minutes. This means that they go offline and you can't access them for a full minute while this happens. Not very convenient when you try to turn them on/off as you enter/leave a room.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Lynda Rutherford,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2024","I use Alexa to turn on and off lights all over the house. It’s for security and it saves money. But the really fun part with these bulbs is how they can change colors. I’m amazed how much better an area looks when the light blends with the furnishings. I’m sure I’ll be experimenting with other ideas relating to this product in the future but for now I’m just thrilled with what it’s already doing. They are easy to install and add to Alexa’s devices…. I work that girl so hard. lol. Living to my 60s has some real perks. These fun, useful tech gadgets are cool. “De light” is now a delight. lol.

Bryan,"Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2023","Title says all. Added the bulbs to my Wi-Fi network via the TP Link Kasa app, installed TP Link Kasa integration into Home Assistant and after a few minutes the bulbs were detected no problem. After that you are off to the races! Use Home Assistant to configure the bulbs to power on with automations/timers, or use the Kasa software.. your choice.
Been using for a couple of weeks and no major issues thus far. The real bummer is that after a power outage, when the power returns the Kasa light bulbs turn back on… even if the bulbs had been OFF before the power went off. I looked in TP Link forums and other folks have complained about this too. It is a known issue that will probably never be fixed (TP Link doesn’t have the best software update reputation). To work around this I applied a preset of “1% brightness” for the power-on state. That way if power goes out and comes back on, the bulbs are only on at 1% and don’t waste as much electricity.
Power outages are rare, so this is a minor annoyance. The software seems to have a setting to account for this, but the setting isn’t fully built out. Not sure why TP Link never finished that option. I guess another workaround could be to hook the lamps with the bulbs up to a UPS, but that seems like overkill for this!
Other than that the bulbs work great and the colors are awesome. I wish I could use these bulbs in “fully enclosed luminaries” but I cannot. I didn’t realize that until AFTER purchase. But it seems there is no LED smart bulb that can be used in a fully enclosed luminary. I intended to install these in fully enclosed ceiling lights, but after reading that warning decided to place them in some reading lamps instead.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Kynan,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024","Update - After fighting with the Kasa app quite a bit, I was finally able to get it to work (had to reset password multiple times to get it to send a confirmation email that actually worked).
The light does what it says - allows color choices, works with Alexa, etc.
2 downsides:
* The small downside - only 2.4 Ghz WiFi compatibility. This could cause problems with some newer home routers. My ancient (by tech standards) ASUS RTN66U has been a shockingly reliable workhorse for many years so this one is no big deal to me.
* The bulb gets hot. Really hot. The base of the bulb, where all the electronics are was scalding hot after 10 minutes of being on. This was in a downward facing glass light fixture -- no heat could escape vertically. When I later put the bulb in torchiere lamp where the top is totally open, it did not have the same heating problem. BUT, that heat is still being produced. It's just escaping up away from the bulb. I would never put this bulb somewhere enclosed and I assume that so much heat production is a significant waste of electricity compared to a normal LED bulb. I had never really considered this factor before - received this light free with an Alexa Echo Pop. After thinking about it I'd bet that most smart bulbs (and smart devices in general) have this same basic problem. They do more stuff; they must consume more power to do it; not sure I'm in favor of that trend.
ORIGINAL Review: Junk so far
1) Requires use of the Kasa app which pretty much gives the developer rights to everything on my phone. Not excited about that.
2) Grudgingly, I downloaded the app. When creating an account from the app, I receive a success message yet cannot log in. I tried creating an account from their website. Also says successful but I cannot log in either on app on site.
Will give it another try in a bit - maybe there servers are having problems - but, after that, will consider it a waste of my time.",3.0 out of 5 stars
GadgetLover67,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2023","To start, this type of product is one I would recommend buying new vs used via a Warehouse Deals deal. The first used set I bought had only two of the four operable, perhaps because the two that didn’t fully work were tied to someone else’s account - gave me a “cloud error”. The second set someone had swapped non-smart bulbs into the Kasa box and returned those. So for just a couple bucks more, you can get ones that haven’t been messed with.
The new ones I received set up quickly and without issue.
It’s nice to be able to set color temperature, but I’d prefer to be able to enter the number directly as a number in K versus trying to fine tune with a slider bar where it’s hard to get to an exact value without over or undershooting. Also, the option to automatically set the color temp and brightness level based in time of day doesn’t always work as expected, sometimes being whiter than it should be when it’s later in the evening.
I do have it connected to Alexa and can use voice commands to turn lights on and off, but it can be a little laggy and somewhere there should be a list of allowable commands. I tried to ask Alexa to change the color temperature to 3000K, but it couldn’t do that.
So these fundamentally work, but the operation could still be more intuitive and the UI of the app could be improved.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Kadir Berkhan AKALIN,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2023","I recently incorporated the Kasa Smart Bulb (KL135) into my smart home setup, and it has quickly become a standout performer, earning a solid 5-star rating. This smart bulb combines a range of impressive features, seamless integration with voice assistants, and user-friendly design, making it an exceptional addition to any smart home.
First and foremost, the setup process was a breeze. The fact that it connects directly to 2.4GHz Wi-Fi without the need for a hub simplifies the installation, making it accessible to users of all technical levels. I had the Kasa Smart Bulb up and running within minutes, thanks to the straightforward and intuitive setup instructions.
The compatibility with both Alexa and Google Home is a game-changer. I can effortlessly control the lighting in my home using voice commands, creating a truly hands-free and convenient experience. The responsiveness to voice commands is impressive, adding a layer of efficiency to my daily routine.
The dimmable color-changing feature is a highlight. With a wide spectrum of colors and the ability to adjust brightness levels, the Kasa Smart Bulb allows me to set the perfect ambiance for any occasion. Whether it's a vibrant setting for a social gathering or a relaxing warm glow for winding down, this bulb delivers with precision.
The 1000 lumens brightness, equivalent to a 60W traditional bulb, ensures that the room is well-lit. The combination of brightness and color options makes this smart bulb versatile for various applications throughout my home.
The 2-year warranty is a testament to the confidence that Kasa has in the durability and reliability of its product. It provides peace of mind, knowing that the manufacturer stands behind the quality of the smart bulb.
In conclusion, the Kasa Smart Bulb (KL135) is a fantastic addition to any smart home. Its easy setup, compatibility with popular voice assistants, versatile color-changing options, and warranty make it a top-tier choice for smart lighting. I wholeheartedly recommend the Kasa Smart Bulb, and it has certainly earned its well-deserved 5-star rating!",5.0 out of 5 stars

While I'm not likely to spend $22 on a light bulb, even if it does feature smart functions, I was excited that they were packaged with my new Echo Pops.
The bulbs can be controlled -without a separate hub- via wifi using Alexa, Google Voice, or through the free Kara Smart app. The 60W LED bulbs provide 1000 lumens of light (these should really be rated at 75W), are dimmable, and both the quality and color of light can be changed, quickly and simply.
The Kasa Smart Bulb is a versatile, multi- function, easy to use and control, energy saving bulb. The Bulb in general is certainly 5 star; I have it 4 stars because of its regular price.

Jim R.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2024","I have a lot of Kasa products in my house, I recently completed a project with various models of Wifi light switches (rewiring each from standard flip-style light switches), and have really enjoyed having my house automated and Alexa-aware. I added these light bulbs so that our night table and back porch would have some personality with different color choices. I was hopeful and excited to get a 4-pack of the 800 Lumens bulbs.
The bulbs were easy to connect, and I haven't had any problems with connectivity, they work well-WHEN THEY WORK. Alexa turns them on and off, dims them and changes the color. However, so far I have had 2 out of the 4 pack fail, and I mean fail DEAD. There is a reset process you do by turning on and off the light bulb a certain number of times at certain intervals (on-off-on in 1 second intervals), but that doesn't do anything. The bulb is dead in another working lamp (the bulb in a different lamp works fine in the one where the bad bulb failed). We have had no power outages or blinks/brownouts/etc. The bulb is just dead.
In addition to the failed bulb, I expected TPLink support to be more responsive. Support was a disappointment. You have to register the bulbs with the SN (serial number?) on the box, so DO NOT THROW THE BOX AWAY. Support will want a receipt, and a photo of the box's SN. WHO KEEPS A BOX?!?! The communication exchange with tech support both times has taken several days minimum, by the time you answer the basic questions they have, then they send you an RMA link (the second time, I tried to tell them the answers to the questions ahead of time-they don't read/listen to your email comments). When they approve the RMA, YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPLACEMENT BULB *AND* THE SHIPPING. Then, if they receive the bad bulb back, they refund you the cost of the replacement bulb.
Honestly, I'm considering other manufacturers for colored bulbs, based on the poor level of tech/RMA support. I have other TPLink Kasa products that work just fine, including network switches, light switches, plugs, etc. But my advice is to stay away from these bulbs.",2.0 out of 5 stars

s,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2023","Absolutely absurd. It' s just like another pair of smart bulbs I purchased, they are so hard to set up. I have a room, I want to install 4 in one room. My phone neither android nor iOS will connect to their wifi it keeps timing out, or it will say not allowed to connect. I have a degree in computer science and have many smart devices I've set up. These bulbs are always so glitchy.
Question for the manufacture. Why don't you just on reset of the bulb, identify the bulb in the app and configure them You can either use bluetooth for the setup if the wifi is so hard or figure out a way to make the wifi just stay online. The issue I run into in this case is the wifi is always going offline during the initialization phase. I have very little confidence when I'm setting up a product and I see different issues in each attempt. Sometimes the bulbs are identified but it won't connect to wifi from your own app, sometimes they aren't but I see the wifi, some time the wifi doesn't show .I can never connect in any of these cases.
I mean these are lightbulbs who is going to mess around with this crap. The other product I bought I had the same sort of issue. I got them working but eventually they stopped working because they had this elaborate bluetooth mesh thing. I figured ok wifi how hard can this be it's got to work right. Wrong. It doesn't work. For got sake all you really need to do is keep them in open mode on the initial setup phase and have the app take you though them one by one passing off your real wifi password. Why are you so incompetent.
I write plenty of positive reviews about products. But smart bulbs are so stupid. I mean they re a smart idea, but the implementation is ABSOLUTE crap. LEARN how to write software.

Victorious,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2024","I've purchased 20 of these bulbs since April 2023, with 14 currently in use. Unfortunately, these bulbs have been nothing but trouble. They start buzzing after a while, the colors shift to an unsightly yellow, and they can't hold the daylight setting anymore. Even worse, some bulbs randomly turn on in the middle of the night, waking everyone up. A few even get worryingly hot, which feels unsafe.
The worst part? These bulbs seemed like a good deal at around $6 each, but with all the issues, I now realize I should have spent more on a reliable brand like Philips Hue. The sunk cost of having 14 bulbs tied to my Alexa makes it hard to switch, but if I had the chance, I'd pay extra for something that actually works as advertised.

EKraft,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2023","UPDATE
Over time we ended up with 4 sets of these, so 15 bulbs in total (16 minus the nonfunctional one, along with 6 of the Kasa smart outlets). All but the one worked initially and for a while they seemed great! Lots of functionality in the app and links easily to the Google app.
LATELY THOUGH they have all been inconsistent with connectivity. 85% of the time when I ask Google to change any setting on them it says not available and even in the Kasa app they show as offline. It’s not an internet issue as other brands of devices, plugs, tvs, computers, etc.. are NOT having this issue. Just the Kasa bulbs and plugs.
I intended to continue buying these to replace all of the bulbs in my home but until this is resolved I definitely won’t be buying anymore at all.
Easy to set up, connect to Google home, and use. 3 out of 4 of the bulbs work correctly 99% of the time but one of them goes “offline” repeatedly which then causes it to reconnect randomly and turn on randomly after switching it off.
Over and OVER.
I bought these for in my kids’ room so having a light come on repeatedly after being turned off is obviously extremely inconvenient when you have a baby or kid that you are trying to get/stay asleep.
Switched it between several fixtures/rooms. Reset it in the Kasa app, the Google app, removed it completely and readded it several times. Firmware is up to date. Theoretically it should be working and the others do but the one is definitely unusable as is.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Kyle Dolch,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2023","[Update 9/2023]:
Out of four bulbs, two have gone bad. I had those two bulbs replaced via RMA. And now, two months later, one of them has frequent connection issues, and turns itself on at random frequencies. I've submitted another complaint/RMA; however, I will not be paying for shipping their (repeatedly) defective bulb back to them. At this point, it is more cost effective to buy new bulbs from a different brand than to keep spending money to ship them back for (another set) of defective bulbs.
[Update 7/2023]:
These bulbs continue to be the worst smart bulbs I've ever dealt with. I initiated an RMA request for the previous bulb that had an issue. Support will replace it but you need to pay for shipping or pay them for a shipping label (seriously?). I never sent the previous RMA bulb out but I don't think I will as another bulb from the set of four has now gone bad. I'm about to throw them out and buy a different brand. DO NOT buy these bulbs unless you want continual frustration.
These bulbs are the worst smart bulbs I’ve ever worked with. They frequently lose connection in the app, randomly won’t respond, or decide to turn themselves on the in the middle of the night for no reason.

When I first received them, I was easily able to set them up, link them to my Google Home and they worked, a day later, they wouldn't connect in both the Kasa app or the Google Home app, the lights still worked, but I couldn't control via app/voice or change the color; they basically became overpriced light bulbs.
I chatted with customer support online for an hour, they had me remove the light bulbs from the Kasa app and reset them, but I wasn't able to connect them back to my home WiFi, it would just get stuck on the ""this will take a few minutes to connect page"" and nothing happened.
Of course customer support was trying to indirectly imply it was an issue on my end with my phone and WiFi network, even though I did a full power cycle on my WiFi, restarted my phone and even uninstalled and reinstalled the Kasa app, but still no success.

- after hard switch off, bulb could restore it's ""state"" (fixed setting) or ""Circadian"" mode. But it doesn't recall the off value.

The website offers exactly the same steps I just listed that I have already taken. And I have waited beyond 24 hours for any response from their customer service team. It stinks because this was a set of four and I don’t want to return all four bulbs because of one problem bulb. But if the manufacturer isn’t going to give me the ability to communicate with them to RMA this problem bulb then I guess I’m just gonna have to take up my case with Amazon and return the set.

Dave,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023","I really wanted to like these bulbs (1000 lumen). The price was right and my experience with the Kasa line of smart plugs has been very positive. I didn't need anything fancy, just some simple color-changing / adjustable white lights. And technically speaking, they meet that goal. You can change the colors and you can adjust the white temperature.
But there are problems.
First, the color: yes, you can adjust the color. Instead of tapping a name like ""blue"" or being able to enter an RGB value, you tap your desired color on a full-spectrum color wheel. This gives you a wide range of colors but makes it very difficult to select a basic color like ""blue"" or ""red"". And it makes it impossible to synchronize multiple lights to the same color. If you want to turn an entire room red, for example, each bulb will be a slightly different shade of red because you're not going to tap the exact same spot on the wheel four times. It's impossible. Kasa does have presets, but since each bulb gets its own presets, you can't use this to synchronize colors either.
Second, the white temperature has a similar problem. You can adjust using a slider that goes between 2700 and 9000K. But since the slider only takes up about a third of your screen, getting any kind of precision is almost impossible. If you want a specific temperature setting, like 3000K, you're either going to have to accept somewhere between 2900K - 3100K or spend 15 minutes trying to randomly land on 3000K exactly. Again, this isn't really a huge deal for a single lamp, but if you want to use multiple bulbs in a room somewhere (like using these for your main living room lighting), you're going to get multiple shades of white. This looks awful.
Third, the app is glitchy. Sometimes it just backs out of a bulb configuration screen. That's a lot of fun when you've finally almost got the exact color or temperature you want dialed in and it suddenly cancels your selection.
Fourth, network connectivity is just bad. All of my bulbs are within 30 feet of the wifi AP, and half of them are direct line of sight with no obstruction whatsoever. All of them randomly fail to connect. No rhyme or reason, they simply decide they won't do what the app tells them to do.
There are some good sides. This is the first smart bulb I've encountered that actually cranks out 1000 lumens (about as bright as an 11W LED, or slightly brighter than an old 60W incandescent). Unlike many cheap smart bulbs, these have no annoying whine or flicker. The Kasa app can be good; it works great with my smart plugs.
But there are just too many faults to recommend these. I'd say either go with a more established brand, or wait for TP-Link to fix all the faults.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Hunter Rutz,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2024","Before you read this, I should preface by saying I'm very picky about color temperature and white accuracy. I'm a photographer, lighting designer, and graphic designer. I'm very picky about color.
All that said, these were unbearably bad. Even my wife noticed, and she's not nearly as color sensitive as me. The ""white"" had a very strong green cast. It was so bad I had to remove the bulbs immediately and switch back to my old GE CYNC smart bulbs.
Additionally, these bulbs had the same brightness rating as my GE bulbs (800 Lumens), but they were noticeably dimmer. Like I had set my GE bulbs to 50%.
If you don't think those things will bother you, then by all means, give them a try. They are very easy to install and setup with the Kasa app. Of course if you're already integrated into the Kasa ecosystem, you don't need any introduction to just how simple it is to add devices.

I will say that the color modes are brighter on this product than the other bulb I tested, but I primarily use white and would only use the colors for mood lighting on occasion.
Brightness is inconsistent through the white range: Warm white is noticeably brighter than any other color temperature. Color rendering also seems poor, as there is a greenish tint on the cooler whites.

CheCarlos,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2021","I have been using Kasa ""smart"" bulbs for some years now. Their older models (such as the white LB120) are absolutely great. I have some of those still in my apartment and they work perfectly. These newer models (color KL125) work alright except for the annoying fact that they disconnect from Wi-Fi randomly, especially when the light is turned off but the bulb still powered on (the light switch is on, but the bulb's light is off) . Seriously. Every single one of the four bulbs in this pack disconnects overnight, yet none of the older LB120 ones do. It's not my router, either: they're connected to a TP-Link router, after all.
These disconnects don't render the bulbs useless, but they're certainly not ""smart"" enough: to reconnect them, you have to flip their switch off and on again, which is not a terrible inconvenience, but it does sort of defeat the purpose of having smart bulbs in the first place.
I've also noticed these newer models don't always respond correctly to Alexa commands. For example, you'll ask for a color and Alexa will sometimes turn them white. I have an older color Kasa bulb as well (KL130) which also randomly disconnects (though not every day), but that one at least seems to always respond correctly to Alexa commands.
In short, Kasa bulbs started off great some years ago. The no-hub bulb was and is still an especially attractive feature, and they worked great some years ago. Today, however, it seems Kasa bulbs' quality has seriously deteriorated to the point where not even the no-hub feature can compensate for it.
I won't be returning these simply because it's too much of a hassle to dismount every single one of them again, pack them up, and ship them and then having to once again reconfigure my whole Kasa set-up. Also, like I said earlier, the bulbs are not exactly useless, just not ""smart"" enough. But I will be considering migrating from Kasa to some other system, unless TP-Link ships some firmware that fixes these issues.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2023","I was ready to return these after an hour of the app crashing, the lights disconnecting, wifi dropping and nothing working. I tried countless times to get them to connect and nearly every time something went wrong and the app would seize up and I was left with no explanation. Finally at the last moment I grabbed my iPad pro I use for work and it was like night and day. Everything worked first try and I set up 3 bulbs in less than 10 min. Clearly Kasa or TPlink have 0 care for Android users. Brand new pixel, not even a non Google phone and their app was complete trash. It still won't see the lights on my network correctly.
Honestly if you have an android avoid these lights and this company. But if you have an iOS device you're good to go.
Works perfectly with Google home once it's setup. No fuss at all, even the colors work flawlessly with Google home. Just their asinine Kasa app that doesn't play nice.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Matt,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2022","I've been using Kasa Smart devices for years now. Between light switches and smart plugs we have around 20 Kasa devices running in our house and we've been really happy with their performance.
Fast forward to last week: I purchased several of these smart bulbs and I'm experiencing the same issues others have reported.
1. I was able to add the devices to my account just fine, but since then the Wi-Fi connectivity has been very problematic. My light fixtures are literally line-of-sight from the router, in the same room. The day after I installed these, one shows ""disconnected"" and refuses to reconnect no matter how many times I cycle the light switch (which by the way is a Kasa switch). It powers up! There's light! No Wi-Fi now, though.
2. Last night I had the Kasa app pulled up and I noticed that the switch that's running these lights kept cutting out in the app. It would just show like it was cycling off/on on its own, over and over. The lights stayed on but, this switch starting going nuts in the app. This never happened with this switch before I installed the new bulbs. I did some testing and it seems like this only works when the lights are significantly dimmed (using the app).
I don't know if the issues lie with software bugs, router incompatibility, or if you simply can't have more than one of these running on the same switch or something? Regardless it seems these aren't going to work for me.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Norton B.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2024","At first I got two 4-sets. One box all bulbs worked perfectly, while on the other two were defective. So from 8 bulbs 6 worked. No biggie, decided to get a replacement for one of the sets. The new set the color temperatures did not match with the old ones, and since they were grouped because my fixture takes 5 bulbs, to make them alike would be necessary to set the group to the desired color and then individually adjust that one lamp from the new set every time there’s a color change. Returned it and tried to get another from Amazon Warehouse on the hopes I would get the older model, because first I wanted all of them to match and second, the old set was more responsive and did not turn blue when turned off through the wall switch. But now, all of them come the same wrong-color-laggy-turn-blue model. So, I will keep the original set that was the old model that worked perfectly to use around the house, and return the rest, while getting another set from a different brand for the dining room.
Overall, the setup is easy, the app is good, but I won’t be getting any more of this brand since they are so inconsistent on their quality.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I wait 30 seconds, get annoyed and go into each individual bulb and set the brightness and temperature I want, and then 2 minutes later it'll load some scene I tried to activate literally an hour ago, so now I have to go back and set the bulbs manually again.
I got these specifically so I could turn them up for meetings, then back down for quiet working, and have another very dim setting for evening gaming. I wanted to be able to switch them multiple times a day, sometimes 20 minutes apart.

William S Rodriguez,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2023","I love these bulbs for the most part. They work fairly well, the app works well enough, and they integrate smoothly into Google Assistant, which is the primary way I interact with them. The only thing that I don't like about them is that when they're on, they emit a high pitched electrical noise sound. It's not very loud, but it drives me nuts to the extent that I can only have them on if I'm playing music on my speakers or have my headphones on. I have other kasa smart bulbs (warm white) and they don't make any noise at all, so I don't know why these do. I've seen other reviewers report the same thing. I'm thinking of replacing them with a newer model, or maybe a different manufacturer.

Carlson,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2023","While this came free with and Echo Pop and the Pop was already on sale, I feel I should warn everyone that setup with Alexa was not easy. Terrible instructions and you are forced to use the Kasa app that makes you give them personal info I’m sure they are selling. I am no novice to Smart device setup and I have 6+ Echo devices. Here’s what happened with this bulb: the second it was powered up it changed color from warm white to cool white and flashed once to show it was in setup mode. Before I even opened the Kasa app, it bulb popped up in the Alexa app with a generic smart bulb 1 name. I was instantly able to power on/off and change colors with Alexa. Then it suddenly stopped working and disappeared from the Alexa app. I had to open the Kasa app and reset the bulb per Kasa app instructions. Only then could I reconfigure in the Kasa app. For that point forward there was no way I could find to make Alexa see the bulb again. It took a call to Amazon support to get it to work. This required disabling the Kasa app that magically installed itself into the Alexa app. Then enabling it again and deleting and reinstalling the bulb in the Kasa app. Once it started working with Alexa, the next Kasa bulb installed easily. But this was too much of a time suck to get a free bulb to work. Come on Amazon… tech support was well aware of the problems with this bulb before I called.

If I return it, I will change my Alexa app password too. Maybe ill pick up a few on a prime day or something. The app does make it easy to set up times & days for your light to go on & off. Which is nice u I f you are out of town. Also you will to set each light with a different wake word. If you set 3 bulbs with Echo, turn (my light on) all 3 will turn on from any room. You need… My light, My bulb or Bedroom light & so on.. I took 1 Star away because of the linking. Was thinking about 2 stars tho….. Update it has been a few weeks. We noticed that sometimes the color being ask doesn’t come up as that color. The biggest thing we noticed is that our Amazon Cube & dots wouldn’t respond when its name was called quite often. Might be the TP-link? The handyness of the light were kind cool. Like if you were watching TV & didn’t want to get up. The blue light was nice playing video games.

Drew,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2022","These are pretty decent bulbs, at least when they're on sale.
SETUP: Connecting the bulbs to wifi for the first time takes a little bit of fussing around and having the phone almost right next to the bulb during setup, after that it's smooth sailing. If you have the bulbs connected to separate network than your phone and other equipment (since it only supports 2.4 GHz), then the app will seamlessly switch your phone to the network the bulbs are on during app use and back to your original network when you're finished, which I appreciate.
These bulbs do NOT support bluetooth, zigbee, or 5GHz connections, so look elsewhere if any of that is a dealbreaker for you.
CUSTOMIZATION: This is where the price point of these bulbs starts to become apparent (in a bad way). The Kasa Smart app leaves quite a bit to be desired in comparison to Hue. The major pain point for me being that bulbs can't be synchronized with each other - meaning if you want them all to be a very specific shade of vivid sky blue, expect each bulb to be ever so slightly off enough to drive your OCD up a wall unless you're willing to fuss with it for a long time.
Each bulb can save up to 4 preset favorite colors but there's no way to share or synchronize those between bulbs; and with no way to enter a specific RGB or Hex code, so you'll be stuck fiddling with trying to match each bulb exactly on the color wheel.
Scenes work okay but configuration is a little tedious in comparison to Hue, as you have to manually add and configure each bulb to each scene.
Colors seem to misbehave at low brightness levels (less than 10%) and will either dull to an off-white or change to the nearest primary color.
Pretty much all of my issues could be fixed with software and firmware updates, but they're serviceable for the price - at least while on sale in my opinion. Until then, it doesn't seem like anything is going to dethrone Philips Hue.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Too bad, because we really like the kasa interface. All other functions were good (connectivity, ease of use, color output). Only the brightness is our complaint.

Rob,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2023","I really like the Kasa platform, but it could be better.
I would really like to see a Hex/RGB type color mixer for repeatable colors. It makes no sense why two bulbs in a group would be showing slightly different colors, but you literally select a color on a picker wheel with no values displayed, so bulb to bulb matching is basically impossible unless you select a pre-made color. This means you can’t match colors to things like sports team colors.
I also like the lighting effects Kasa has on their strip lights, but those aren’t offered for these. No color changing glowing/fading effects. While I don’t expect multiple colors from a single bulb, the ability to gently fade colors would be excellent and was a feature I had on my previous smart bulbs.
I do have occasional connectivity issues with these fixtures. Usually a power cycle at the actual light switch resolves this, but won’t resolve any automation that did/didn’t trigger because this requires cloud connectivity. Not sure if the connectivity issue is a me/ISP issue or an issue with the bulbs.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Johnny Ringo,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2023","These were easy to setup but I have three complaints:
1. These setup very easy but the process is cumbersome ... Connect to bulb, back to app, connect to wireless, back to app, setup ... This gets a bit tiring as you switch back and forth separately between the bulb and your wireless for EVERY bulb you setup. It would be much nicer and less effort to connect all bulbs to the app first, one by one, then switch to wireless and then set them all up at once.
2. Two of my bulbs keep dropping. Even after multiple resets. Even more annoying is that one of the bulbs that keeps dropping is part of a two bulb fixture that requires a ladder to reach so a reset via the switch resets both the working AND non-working bulbs.
3. There is no yellow. The best I can get is a greenish yellowish. C'mon Kasa ... yellow is one of the most basic light colors there is. So much so, that ""Bug Light"" should actually be a predefined color in the app.
Edit April 2024 - Thunderstorms took our power out around 0100 hours for 15 minutes. When it came back on, all bulbs went to full brightness, as programmed to do after a switch off and on. One problem ... it's 0509 hours and ONLY ONE light (the outside porch) in the entire house connected back in the Kasa App. After 4 hours these bulbs don't auto reconnect?",3.0 out of 5 stars
Vic,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2023","Ok i love these things, especially that they managed to not choose horrible colour tones. You get nice shades out of them.
Also it seems to have true white led's (one warm on daylight) so you have good light when needed.
My issue..and this is a flaw with the whole kasa brand. They didnt put a relay at the emitter. So to change any settings you have to turn it on,. Set it, turn it off.
Scenario: you go to bed with your soft mood light, when you wake up in the morning and turn the light on..thetes no light..because its still on last nights setting.
Workaround: at 6:30am i have to have the light scheduled to turn on for a few seconds so it can change itself to full brightness and then turn off. Far from ideal being blasted by light every morning.
No i can understand having it completely off for wnergy efficiency, but it really needs to be redisgned so you can change setting while its in its off state. It makes the whole house into a circus where you have to pull the app out everytime you want toturn a light on.
So..Please tp-link kasa dont be so cheap and make the setting adjustable while powered off. Out a stanby low power mode.
I guess that will be another brand (i see tplink company have several brands of near identical items).
Not looking forward to replacing all these items just to fix that flaw. :/

Ruben,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2023","I recently purchased the Kasa Smart Wifi Light Bulb 4-pack and I am somehow satisfied with my purchase. Here is why: the bulbs were easy to set up and connect to my wifi network. I love being able to control the lights with my phone or voice commands using Google Assistant. The multicolor feature is also a huge plus, it adds a fun element to my home and it also allows me to set different scenes or ambiance depending on the occasion. However, here are some pros and cons for getting Kasa Light Bulbs..
- These lightbulbs are very reasonably priced.
- The Kasa Smart ecosystem and accompanying app are excellent for controlling the bulbs.
- The installation process is easy and straightforward, thanks to the well-designed walkthrough instructions.
- The multi-color options are a great feature, adding more versatility and fun to your lighting.
- The brightness is not very high, particularly when using color modes. The 6500K setting, for example, feels like it's the equivalent of a 30W traditional bulb.
- I recently noticed that the base of the lightbulb becomes quite warm after being in use for an hour. I am not sure if this will cause any problems, I will have to wait and see.
- One drawback of these bulbs is that they do not have Bluetooth or the ability to synchronize with music like some other options on the market.
- The process of setting up scenes and scheduling them to switch colors at certain events ( like sunrise / sunsets ) can be a bit complex.
FINAL THOUGHTS:
My thoughts on this hardware are mixed. On one hand, they are relatively inexpensive and they do function as intended. On the other hand, the issue with them getting warm and the limited functionality compared to other options make me hesitant to keep them. I am currently considering whether to keep them or return them.",3.0 out of 5 stars

John Thorpe,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2021","I have 9 TP Link/Kasa Smart Plugs and 8 TP Link/Kasa Smart Bulbs installed... the smart plugs I've had no issue with, however the smart bulbs have been a headache. The bulbs become unresponsive and have to be power cycled sometimes daily for them to work with the Kasa app, Alexa, Google Home. It's not an issue with Wi-Fi signal strength as I also have TP Link/Kasa smart plugs installed in the same location for other items and those have no issues at all, as well as one of the bulbs that consistently becomes ""unresponsive"" is at most 5 feet away from the router.
Another issue with the bulbs is that after a power outage the lights come on ... they do come on at the same brightness and color they were before they were shut off ... but they still come on ... not a good thing if your power comes back on at 2:30 AM while you're asleep. These shouldn't be an issue as the smart plugs (by the same company) has no connectivity issues (with 2 of them being further away from the router than the others and the bulbs), plus the smart plugs remember the state they were in the event of a power outage (i.e. if the smart plugs were off prior to a power outage, then they remain off after the power is restored, and vice versa) ... also most of the time after the power is restored after a power outage and the light comes on, it needs to be turned off via the Kasa app, Alexa or Google in order for it to follow Alexa routines.
So I wouldn't recommend these... unless it's in an area you don't mind the light being on after a power outage and wonder if the smart switches have the same issues.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2021",This is my first time buying smart bulbs. I have light switches and outlets. I wanted to give it a try verse installing a switch and I like the option to change color and dim the bulbs (using them as a night light for my kids bathroom). The problem I have with the bulbs is the bulbs lose connection with Kasa app when you turn off the light switch to the lights. This is no good for me. Can not turn on the bulbs from my phone if the switch is in the off position. The only plus for me...I can turn off the light from my phone if the kids leave the light on. I did test to see if you can turn the light back on if you turn the light off from your phone. You have to put the switch back to off then back on and the light will turn back on.

Tia maxwell,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2021","These bulbs are easy to set up. The colors are neat. I haven't seen them drop wifi connections yet.
Of the 4, 3 are plugged into a fixture together. The other is alone as an over head light.
The issues are they keep ignoring their schedule and settings. I like my bulbs to turn on if someone flips the switch manually, as i assume most do. By default the setting is ""last on state"" well that could mean off apparently. So i set it to be preset on instead. Some times it works and turns on, other times they just stay off.
They also ignore the schedule. I have 3 times events. Turn on at a kids bathtime. Change to colors when bath time done. Turn off when child is asleep usually. Sometimes it follows the schedule fine. Other times it doesn't.
Each time these issues come up, i can open the app or have Alexa change them with no issue. So they arnt disconnected.

The most troublesome aspect of these lights is set up. If your wifi connection gets disrupted (like with a power outage) or you change your wifi router, they’re really annoying to reconnect. They’re also named a random wifi name that you have to keep track of if you’re installing more than one in a short timeframe so you don’t accidentally rewrite over one you’ve just set up. There should be some sort of central home connection that they can connect to and easily reconnect to in the app. 2 of the bulbs in the pack I couldn’t get to reconnect to my new wifi essentially making them back into normal light bulbs.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Changing colors and intensity are easy through the app or voice command to your home assistant.
However, I wanted to use those lights in quiet environments, like my bedroom, and this is where they failed me. When turned to white mode (any color temperature), they emit an annoyingly loud buzzing sound, like you also get from cheap dimmer switches (some inadequately glued down solenoids start to vibrate and you hear that). The sound is louder at some light intensities than others, but it's always there. The only setting where the lamps work quietly is when choosing a primary color (red/green/blue) at full intensity. However, that isn't my use case. I eventually had to return them since they aren't useful for me in quiet environments.",3.0 out of 5 stars

For the most part, they worked OK with the Kasa app and Alexa, but I kept having to cycle power to have them reconnect to WiFi. However, they didn't work very well with my Hubitat setup.
I use several switches from Kasa using a custom driver written by the Hubitat community and was hoping that these bulbs would integrate into my setup as well as the switches do. I'm sad to say that they didn't. They didn't work well with the built-in Hubitat scenes and Rule Machine apps or with Webcore. It seems that there's no way to programmatically set the color reliably when in RGB mode or color temperature when in CT mode.
At the price point, I might have kept them for the Alexa integration, but the frustrating WiFi issues were the final deal breaker.

App is clean, does not support Geo-fencing or scripting like most other apps do. When app was installed on more than one device the bulbs began to flicker rapidly when automatically turning off with the scheduled configuration for a group.
Grouping within the app was easy, but bulbs do not always turn on or off simultaneously. Dimming feature is nice and extremely granular. Auto temp feature works great, but you get a stepping effect instead of a smooth gradual gradient.

To get them working again, I had to add each one back to the app individually and recreate all of my scheduled on/off items and scenes. This is incredibly time-consuming.

Dennis M,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2021","I used to use bulbs manufactured by a company called LIFX. The problem with those bulbs were they constantly lost connectivity and could not be controlled from the app. I checked, did research
and decided to try the Kasa bulbs. The app is more user friendly and I found it easy to set up. Even setting tirmrd went smoothly. Okay, so I’ve said positive things about the bulbs but what not give it a full 5 stars? The negative was the bulbs are not quite bright enough. The LED bulbs put out the equivalent of a 60 watt filament bulb. I’ve found that while the brightness is okay, but not quite enough for my needs. If you compare these to LIFX bulbs, allow me to detail some comparative facts:
Kasa bulb are not as brigh as LIFX bulbs but are less expensive,
The KASA app is easier to use than the LIFX app which sometimes gets confusing,
KASA bulbs are less expensive than LIFX bulbs.
When I used the LIFX bulbs, I found setup of the KASA bulbs was more user friendly.
The main difference between KASA and LIFX is the all important wi-fi connectivity. LIFX bulbs were constantly dropping their connections whereas the KASA bulbs have never dropped a wi-fi connection whereas the LIFX bulbs constantly needed a reboot to join them back to my network.
Finally, I’ve found that the KASA bulbs are more sensitive, (in a good way !) I placed LIFX bulbs in high hats, or recessed lights, whatever you call them, and they were unable to receive any signal, I have placed the KASA bulbs in recessed lights and find they work perfectly.

Wally,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2021","There are SO many smart bulbs on the market these days, there are literally multiple youtube channels only about smart bulbs. Unfortunately, a lot of these bulbs are pretty pricey. My house is average size, and has over 40 lightbulbs in it. The cost can add up pretty quickly! I was pleased to find these Kasa bulbs for about $8 per bulb. It's a really good value for what you get.
These bulbs have 2 main advantages: (1) no hub is required. Many smart lighting systems require you to purchase a central hub that controls everything. Kasa's bulbs are independent devices that communicate over wifi and no hub is required. (2) Alexa compatibility. It's nice to incorporate setting lights an Alexa routine or control them on-demand via voice command. These bulbs offer a number of other advantages but these two are the biggest in my opinion.
However, the great price does come with a couple drawbacks. (1) low brightness. These are only 800 lumens. In areas with only one lightbulb, such as a windowless interior hallway, this can be pretty dim. (2) no animations. A lot of smart bulbs have settings that can flash the light in different colors and patterns. Even some of Kasa's other lights do this. But these bulbs do not. I hope this feature comes in a future software update.
So far, I have bought 12 of these bulbs, which covers the hallway, living room, and dining room. If I buy more smart bulbs I will probably buy more of the same to keep things consistent.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Julie Walker,"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2022","I was excited to get these bulbs to put in the three fixtures hanging over my kitchen island. I already have six Kasa outlets, so I have the Kasa app. The first two bulbs of my four-pack connected easily. Then number three .......... I tried over and over and it would not connect to my wifi. I tried switching to bulb four in the pack and moving the bulb to a lamp right next to my router. Still no connectivity.
So, leaving the bulb in the lamp by my router, I went to my Wifi Settings on my iPhone and turned off both Private Wi-Fi Address and Limit IP Address Tracking, and started the process over. It worked! I've moved the bulb to the kitchen fixture and changed the two settings back on the phone, and all is still working.
I hope this helps someone like me who does not know what all these settings actually do. And before they spend hours trying to get the bulb to connect. 🙄",4.0 out of 5 stars

The reason I am giving it 4 starts and not 5 is because they are pretty limited on the features. There are no cycle, strobe or any other options other than solid colors. The brightness it great. Not what you would get from a regular white LED bulb but it was good for my setup. Also, as other people have mentioned, they produce a buzzing noise. I only experienced this on the white and day standard colors (more so at 100% brightness). You don't noise it unless your up next to it, like if you were going to change it out.

Alexa (voice or app) doesn't know everything the bulb can do -- it notably can't set the lights to Auto brightness; but you can set it in the native app and it stays through power off/on.

Stephen C,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2023","If you have never used smart bulbs, then you are missing out. They simply replace an existing light bulb in the fixture and utilize a smart-phone app to control them. Set up is easy using the KASA app, and they simplify so many things in your home. The bulb itself can be adjusted to have a different temperature of light, intensity, and color. Even better, you are able to set a timer/schedule on the lights for specific days, and times. I have these throughout my home, and have one in my bedroom that I set to come on with my morning alarm.
To use these you will have to have Wi-Fi in your home and a smart phone as well. These can be controlled from anywhere using the app. It is an adjustment to not use the light switch on the wall or lamp, but that wears off fast. The only complaint I have with them is that the app can be slow to respond at times. Everyone that has seen them in action has gotten a set. KASA has additional items that can be grouped such as doorbells, cameras, plugs, switches, thermostats, hubs, etc. If you are thinking about getting these take the leap and go for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Rob,"Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2024","Decided, as we finally add smart home automation, to standardize on this brand. Installed some plugs before Christmas to coordinate all our lights. It went so well using their app, I decided to add some lights bulbs recently.
In the meantime, I added the plugs to Alexa and started building out that set up. My intention was to add the bulbs to the Kasa app, and figure out Alexa later.
Well… no need for that, because Alexa saw them immediately and set them up. I added them to groups based on location, and it was done. No need to use the proprietary app at all. I can address individual lamps/fixtures by name, or I can address groups, or even make system wide demands like turning off all lights. It couldn’t be much easier!
I do seem to have less control over specific colors than the Kasa app, but that doesn’t matter to me.

While I have to admit I really have no real need for a smart light I may use it for the red light while watching TV or lighting the room up for the midnight hours as a night light feature.
The real question about these lights or any smart lights is longevity of the product. Because if I paid $20 or more for them I would hope that 2 years use would be more like 5 years or more.

Just Doug,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2023","I love these Kasa lights. Wi-Fi is so much easier than Bluetooth or ZigBee. The connection and setup with the Kasa app is simple on my iPhone. The Alexa app almost immediately recognizes them once they are configured in Kasa. My two favorite uses are for night lights on each side of the bed, and outside lights.
For nightlights, I really like how I can set a soft color and low light intensity or turn brighter and whiter if we are reading. We also incorporate specific settings in a couple Alexa scenes along with other devices.
We replaced all the lights on the front and back porch with these lights and change them to suit our mood. I grouped them in Alexa as front and back porch separately, and then put both subgroups in an overall group of outside lights. Allows for easy changes all at once, or each porch separately. Since we put echo devices on both porches, it's easy to change the brightness or color (or both) at any time. Is it lazy to change your lights without getting up? Yes! And I don't mind at all!
We also like the ability to turn on the outside lights from anywhere at any time. Sometimes if we are traveling, we get a movement notification from our Eufy cameras. If it's a person and not deer (the most common), I just turn on the outside lights to max white with the iPhone app.

Nina K,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2022","I bought these programmable smart bulbs so that I could have lights turn on and off while I was away on trips. I have one that lights up my front porch every night, programmed to be on from dusk to dawn while the other three are in lamps around the house. They were very easy to set up (unlike the brand I got at Costco that could only use 2G wi-fi and just would not connect).
For these Kasa smart bulbs, you do need wi-fi and to download the software onto a smartphone. (I don't know if there are other options since I didn't use them.) They also connected to my Alexa but I like the Kasa app better. I can program each bulb to turn on and off at different times each day - a nice feature to make it seem like someone's home when they're not. I can also check if the lights are on or off while I'm away and make adjustments if necessary via the app.
I particularly liked that I could change the color of the bulbs. I'm not using solid colors like red or green but instead getting the perfect warm white for each room. I also like that I can adjust the brightness of the bulbs and the app lets me know how much I'm saving when dimmed to, for instance, 60% instead of 100% brightness.
I also use the Kasa plugs with my Alexa to turn on and off appliances like a fan I like to sleep with when it's hot but that Alexa will turn off an hour after I'm asleep. I highly recommend smart devices like these for elderly or disabled people who have ambulatory problems.

I love the Kasa bulbs! There are a lot of color options available, adjustable brightness, and it works great with Alexa. Kids turn the lights off more when leaving a room just by talking to Alexa. The setup for the lights in the Kasa app and on Alexa is easy. Being able to control lights when away on vacation is a bonus too. These lights are fantastic and a must have for a smart home.",5.0 out of 5 stars
