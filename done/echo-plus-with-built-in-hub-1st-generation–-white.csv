PT Cruiser,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2017","We purchased our first Echo in November of 2014, 3 years ago this month. She was the hit of our Thanksgiving dinner celebration that year but could do only a fraction of what she is capable of today. We added smart bulbs like the Philips Hue white and colored bulbs, GE Link and TP Link bulbs, smart plugs, smart wall switches, and smart device timers. We added them over the years as they became available on Amazon. (And on sale!) We had to purchase hubs to run the Philips and GE bulbs when we first started adding bulbs. The 1st Gen Philips hub worked well for about a year and then started having problems with disconnecting from the network and not playing nice with Alexa. Philips finally replaced it under warranty. The Wink hub which controlled the GE bulbs has always worked flawlessly. But whenever we changed our network password, we had to go around and reset all the bulbs, often having to re-register some of them and then go into the Alexa app and have her rediscover them. Perhaps not a big deal when you’re only using a couple bulbs, but a real time waster when almost every bulb in a large 2 story house is a smart bulb.

This Echo Plus allowed me to disconnect the hubs and control everything with Alexa alone. She didn’t discover the bulbs right away. I had to go in and deregister them from their hubs and then rediscover them and add them to the Plus. But now they work flawlessly. Let me tell you how I did that. In your Alexa app, click on the little menu thingie in the upper left hand corner which will open a drop down menu. Select Smart Home from the menu. You’ll see a page showing devices, groups and scenes. Click on the little ? In the upper right hand corner. This will open a page with instructions and clickable commands for deregistering a list of different devices from their hubs and having Alexa discover and connect them to the Echo Plus. It’s a little bit of a pain to have to go around and get serial numbers off the bulbs or turn others on and off, but you only have to do it once, then Alexa has them. And it isn’t difficult. No more running upstairs to push the button on the Philips hub to get bulbs to respond. No more extra hubs sitting around consuming electricity. And no more dealing with the clunky Philips Hue app (If you don’t believe me, go read the reviews for that app.)

Now that everything is connected through Alexa, I have set up Routines to turn a few of our lights on and off and specified times. (Voice commands can still be used to override a routine and they don’t interfere with your routine the next time it is scheduled.) I can also turn them on and off remotely from the Alexa app. I have a routine set for our kitchen Alexa so that when I say, “Alexa, good morning” she will turn on one of the kitchen smart bulbs at 50% brightness and the other at 100% brightness and read me the local weather report. Our bedroom Alexa has a routine that is triggered when I say “Alexa, start my day”. She turns on one of the lights at 20% and reads my morning news flash. How cool is that? Here’s how you set up a routine:

1. Go to the menu and select ""Routines.""
2. Select the + icon.

From here, you can specify when Alexa will do something, and what it will do.
-- Select ""When this happens"" to pick a scheduled time for the Routine to run, or enter a word or phrase that will activate it.
-- Select ""Add action"" to select what the Routine will run. You can add multiple actions, one at a time.
-- Once you have selected a “cue” and an action, select the device you want the Routine to play on.
-- Select ""Create"" to save the routine.

Groups are also a great feature. You can Group your Echo and Dot device’s together in a group, give the group a name, and then tell Alexa, “Play my <Bruno Mars> playlist on my <downstairs> group. She instantly starts to play it on all the devices in the group. You could also play a single song or a radio station like iHeart or Pandora. We have a large family room/kitchen combo with the Plus on a desk about midway in the room and a Dot connected by 3.5mm Cable to a Heos speaker, with excellent sound. We put the two in a group. The sound is amazing! It’s better than stereo, especially with the new Plus. The Plus is slightly stronger on the treble than the 1st Gen Echo. The Heos is strong on bass. They sync perfectly with each other and never miss a beat. BTW, I rarely used the Heos except for parties before we got the Dot because I was so spoiled by controlling music by voice on our Echo. It was much better than using an app to control the Heos. Now the Heos is used all the time since I can use it with Alexa. Grouping with the Plus makes it that much better. We can also add Echos in other rooms to the group, which we do when we have people over. We can now have the same music playing in the living room/dining room as in the family room. They are easily added-or subtracted in the Alexa app.

Like the regular Echo, this Plus can control all of our white bulbs and the the Hue color bulb by voice, including changing the colors to any color I can think of (pink, teal, red, blue, purple, aqua, etc.) dimming to any percentage and on/off and adding them to routines or group. For example, I can say, “Turn on the downstairs lights” and Alexa will turn on every light I’ve added to that group. The Plus controls our smart plugs and switches just like the regular Echo did and we add those to groups as well. Bulbs, switches and plugs can be a part of several different groups. (The group Holiday lights turned on all the LED lighted pumpkins and orange lights on our banisters when we said, “Alexa, turn on the holiday lights.”

We can also use this Plus like the other Echos, to Drop In on our other rooms. Since we have Echos in just about every room we now have a home intercom system that works beautifully.

We’ve watched Alexa get smarter and smarter almost weekly, from that first day with her 3 years ago. I have no doubt that she will continue learn new skills to make our lives even easier and more fun. (Did I mention that she can switch our older LG TV to PlayStation Vue streaming through our Amazon Fire TV device and start and pause shows by voice through either the Echos or Fire TV remote? Yeah, we dumped our satellite TV provider and now pay less than half with live and recorded streaming. But that’s for another review!)",5.0 out of 5 stars
Stephanie Sullivan,"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2018","The Echo Plus Gen 1 is a great addition to my smart home. It gives me all my original Echo provides plus lets me eliminate my Philips Hue hub and works with all my other Z-wave devices. The Gen-1 form factor is almost identical to the original Echo but with a faster processor and integrated hub. Nice!

I love my Echo/Alexa. Voice control of my smart home and other Amazon devices plus response to information requests (what's new, etc.) and nearly endless entertainment options have made this an integral part of my home life. As an early adopter of the original gen-1 Echo I have been very impressed by how Amazon continues to improve existing operation, add new features and new capabilities.

I got my first Echo in March 2015. Since then I've seen a lot of new capabilities added:
+ A constant integration of more services like Pandora, traffic and Amazon Radio stations
+ Connected home control now with the integrated Z-Wave device hub and control of WiFI smart home devices like those from Belkin and TP-Link.
+ integration with IFTTT (if this then that) service for triggers and actions
+ integration popular services like Google Calendar and much more
+ integrated Amazon purchase/ordering

The list keeps growing. It's part of the beauty of a product that's mostly in the Amazon cloud. New features and capabilities are not dependent solely upon the computing and storage of the Echo device itself.

The Echo is also a very nice bluetooth speaker. It pairs readily with multiple devices - phone, computer and even my Amazon Fire TV so it can provide an enhanced audio experience. With some devices control of tracks can controlled by voice like skip or repeat, etc.

Another essential part of the Echo is the FREE Amazon Echo App . I have it installed on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9in and on my iPhone 6. This provides simple setup and configuration of services and integration with supported connected home devices. It also provides the mobile part of the todo and shopping lists.

The Echo has been a game changer for my home experience. This Echo Plus even more so. It's the closest thing I've used to a computer you can just speak to and be understood - like on the old Star Trek series. I wonder how I lived without it!

I gotta give the Echo Plus 5 stars. Not just for how good it is but in anticipation of all the new things that will surely will come along soon.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Found it to be really useful for quick cooking questions and the sound quality when listening to music was surprisingly good. The slim size of the appearance makes it great for having it on the counter In the corner. With it still working just like new I'd say it's high quality,5.0 out of 5 stars
wildwoodla,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2017","There are many excellent reviews of the new Echo Plus here, so this review is from the POV of someone with limited connection infrastructure, e.g., very rural area, no internet or cable, only satellite service offered, but no signal due to heavy tree cover, beginner smart home user. I never dreamed an Echo would work for me, much less the Echo Plus or smart home. I broke down & purchased an Echo on Prime Day June, 2017 just to try. I receive my internet service solely through an AT&T Velocity hotspot device, typically with only 1 bar of service. I was so excited that the Echo worked perfectly & decided to go out on another limb, purchasing the Echo Plus w/included Hue bulb on Cyber Monday, as well as a Fire TV Stick, figuring I was really pushing the envelope that any would work. All devices worked perfectly! I now have the meager beginnings of a smart home as well as Alexa functionality. I can't tell you how surprised I am! There is an 8-device limit for the hotspot, so wi-fi smart devices are out of the question for me & not sure I have enough signal for any to work anyway. Using the Echo Plus as my only hub, the included Hue bulb connected in seconds, while also tying in with my 1st Echo. So I can use either of the 2 Echos to control the light bulb, connected to a lamp in my living room. What is ideal for my situation is that the Hue bulb does not ""count"" as a wi-fi device, so does not go toward my device count/limit on the hotspot. Apparently, it is connected directly to the Echo Plus hub. Currently, with one bar of hotspot service, I'm running the Echo Plus, Echo, Fire tablet, Fire TV Stick & Galaxy Express 3 cell, & every now & then, an Echo Tap--all at one time with excellent results! Everything works as if I have hard wired cable or internet, which is simply amazing. Movies, music, etc. run flawlessly.
ALEXA - I don't have a lot of space on my cell, so all I need is the Alexa app to control the bulb when away from home, no need for a separate app AND I already have the Alexa app on my tablet & of course, use Alexa on both Echo's & a Tap.
SMART HOME - The Echo Plus has opened up the smart home market for me. Although it appears limited to the Zigbee IoT protcol, the available choices are varied enough that there are switches, more bulbs, door locks & plugs I'll be able to use now. This thing just came out, so as time goes by, I'm sure more & more skills & IoT stuff will become available. I'm sure the folks at Amazon will make improvements to capabilities as well. And I can do it all with just 1 Echo Plus - no need for additional hubs or devices with my limited internet!
SOUND - I found my 1st Echo sound pretty decent. I am by no means an audiophile, but IMHO Echo Plus sound greatly improved over the Echo. Much richer, more robust & MUCH better bass - yay! My 1st Echo sounds ""tinny"" now, compared to the Echo Plus.
I am beyond delighted with the performance of the Echo Plus & kudos to Amazon for this ""upgrade"" to the Echo. I would highly recommend the Echo Plus, especially for those just entering the smart home market with internet challenges. I LOVE MY ECHO PLUS!!!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Troy,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2017","When I saw Amazon had chosen to put a ZigBee hub in an Echo, I was excited. When I saw they were adding easy setup and a wealth of smart home features to the Alexa App, I did not hesitate, I pre-ordered the Echo Plus, and I am glad I did.

First up, is unpacking and configuration. The box seemed difficult to get into, I wasn't sure which side was the top, and if it opened like a jewelry box or not, so I just ripped it open. That was the most complicated part of configuring the Echo Plus. Seriously, you plug it in, the ring does its hypnotic, “you will buy everything on Amazon” dance until the device shows up in your Alexa App. You follow the prompts and tap and go.

The first thing I did after configuring was ask Alexa to play a Bob Dylan radio station. I have a Big Jambox as my around the house and yard speaker. The Jambox is so good, I never looked for another Bluetooth speaker, so it, and my giant Polk RTI A9 towers are my reference for the Echo Plus. I was initially disappointed. Bob sounded like he was playing on my bedside clock/radio, but it was an old track. My go-to test song for audio systems is Finally Woken by Jem. The Echo Plus did an adequate job with the bass. It plays loud, which seems to be how it overcomes its shortcomings. It actually sounds better when I am in an adjoining room. I blame the Bose tweaking. Given time to loosen-up, it will be a good enough speaker, better than the Big Jambox. If someone gets clever and joins a subwoofer to the Echo Plus, maybe through the audio out port, it could be a really good three-way setup. But I didn't buy the Echo Plus for the audio.

I have been a smart home enthusiast since the early 90s. What? Yea, way back in the dark ages a system called X10 did most of what you can do now. You had to set dials on the plugs to assign them to buttons on the remote. You could make scenes by grouping switches to special buttons on the remote and they even had a universal remote that you could train to your TV and VCR. My system had door sensors, a siren, and a dialer to call me if something happened at home. My lights were on timers set through the remote, or dials on the ""smart"" plugs. It all worked without an internet connection or intrusive account signup.

Fast forward fifteen years and not much changed, so I tried the Piper. A security camera as a hub matched my security focused X10 past, and Z-Wave looked like a successor to X10. The piper has been acceptable, but is retired as a smart home hub as of today.

Next up was the Nest. The “learning when I am home and away” feature had promise. I imagined a world where my smarty-pants thermostat would turn on lights and unlock doors for me when I arrived home. But, the “Works with Nest” never bore fruit. An endless array of devices promised to tell Nest I was home, but not the other way around. When the Nest (after working fine for eight months) put my HVAC into an endless restart mode on the coldest day of the year, I decided the Nest was an idiot and replaced it with my old “smart” thermostats that had worked fine for a decade.

The last four years have seen an endless amount of smart home announcements with promise, but few actual products that didn’t come with lots of baggage. The biggest bag being a dedicated hub, and the carry-on (so to speak) application and dedicated account to control that device. I didn't want to go down that road, so I have waited and watched while my Piper faithfully managed the table lamps I have plugged into the two Z-Wave plugs that came with it. If I had acted on my impulses, I would have at least three hubs and five applications for my “smart” home, and to make it all work together I would need yet-another-account on IFTTT. The DIP switches and dials of X10 were friendly by comparison. (If your $200 smart home product needs a third party service to make it smart, your product is not worth $200).

Back to the Echo Plus. By the time I had removed a Z-Wave plug from a table lamp and screwed in my new Hue bulb, Alexa informed me I had a software update. The Echo Plus rebooted itself and I said, “Alexa, find smart home devices.” Forty seconds later the Hue bulb was working through voice commands given to the new Echo Plus or my Dot in another room.

As an experiment, I moved the bulb to different lamps around the house to see if losing power would force me to set it up again. It did not.

When you configure devices Alexa names them in a simple “light 1”, “light 2” manner. You must change the names in the Alexa application to make them more meaningful. Once you do, Alexa understands the new name.

The Groups and Scenes features are tabs on the same screen with Devices. Once you have a few devices configured, (I recommend doing one at a time so you can name them as you go) you can group them to work with a single command. I don't have to say “Alexa, turn on entry light,” then “Alexa turn on fireplace light,” to light my living room. After making the Living Room group I can say “Alexa turn on the Living Room.”

Routines are on a different screen in the Alexa App. Go to Settings to find it. This was the first hiccup in my experience. I wanted to configure a “bed time” routine, but the lights action said, “turn on” the light and I did not see an obvious way to turn the light off. Turns out, you just tap the light bulb icon to switch the mode to off. Now I am happy. When I say, “Alexa bed time,” I get the current temperature, and my assigned lights turn off. Perfect.

I have seen reviewers complaining that you cannot control color temperature of lights with the Alexa App. Of course the same reviewers practically fell out of their shorts when Alexa skills allowed you to say things like ""Alexa, tell Nest to set the temperature to 72."" True, you can't do everything the Hue App does, but to get Hue App like control, I would need to add a Hue hub. No, just No. AND, who wants to pay $40 for a light bulb when you can get them $14 (4 dumb LEDs are now $12). Seriously, I paid $19 for my first dumb LED bulb, now I can get two smart bulbs for the same price. If color changing becomes available through the Alexa App later, and I don't need another hub, I will consider a color bulb at that time.

What about thermostats? Well, my thermostats are fifteen years old. They have a weekday and weekend schedule and have never left me in the cold like the Nest did. Because of my Nest experience, I won't buy another “smart” thermostat until I see one available with “Simple setup with Echo Plus.” Ideally one that I don't have to create yet-another-account to adjust the temperature in my home.

And door locks? OK, I am old. I have been using door locks with ten-key pads on them since I was a teenager. They are a great alternative to carrying a bunch of keys. Especially when it is a long walk back to the workshop with your keys. I don't see the advantage of having to pull out my phone to unlock a door. If you are at all security conscience then you would need two smart locks for each door, one for the dead-bolt and one for the door knob (I have not seen an integrated unit yet, if there is one, let me know because I would be interested.) Maybe when a smart door unlocks and opens for me as I approach I will be more excited.

And cameras? I don't have any, yet. The Piper detects motion and monitors my doors with Z-Wave sensors. It records to the cloud when an alarm has been tripped. It does not require a paid subscription. I will keep it for my security system until I see a better alternative. I have looked at Arlo because I think the best value comes with exterior cameras, but I am concerned with their slow response times. I can imagine ZigBee door sensors triggering alerts and recordings on a linked camera. That would be a less intrusive option than something recording 24/7.

This is my Smart Home Mantra going forward: A single application to control all my devices, no more hubs, and the ability to use a voice command to configure my new devices. For me, when it comes to the smart home platform, Amazon has a winner on its hands with the Echo Plus. We know from the original Echo experience that Amazon will be aggressive in pushing new features to the Alexa App. I look forward to those updates and the future purchases those updates will enable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
getsomesleep,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2018","Incredible piece of technology.
I have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).

The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.

This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say ""Alexa, connect my devices"". The default names for each bulb was assigned as ""First light"" and ""Second light"", so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying ""Alexa, turn off the second light"". In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with ""First light"" and ""Second light"" and named the group ""The light"", so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say ""Alexa, turn on The light"".

I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.

You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few ""Skills"" like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.

I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.

I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:
1) Taller and 360 sound unit.
2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)
3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.

I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2017","I purchased this product to control the lights in my house. I wasn't really sold on getting a product like this but I figured that for the price it was about the same as getting ZigBee only hub and I got all the voice features too. I currently have this Echo Plus set up with 2 echo dots and most of my main lighting using Sengled BR30 bulbs and Cree A19 bulbs. I was able to set up groups that allowed me to turn on all the lights in the room each Echo is in just by saying ""Alexa, Turn on the lights"". I can also control each light individually using the bulb name (on, off, set the brightness) or any group just by using the group name form anywhere in my house using voice control. The Alexa app is pretty simple and there are plenty of skills available for things the Echo does not already do on its own. I also have it connected to my Wemo Light switch and Wemo smart plugs (both are Wi-Fi devices and are first set up using the Wemo App).

Aside from the home automation, there are many other uses for this product. The speaker is pretty good so listening to music is fine on this. It's not the quality of my Sonos products but I wouldn't expect that at this price (although it does allow me to control my Sonos play 3...). It is great for getting quick answers just by asking. You can get get help in the kitchen with measurement conversions, ingredient substitutions and recipes. I found the timer function to be useful and the alarm function is nice too.

I purchased this during the Black Friday sale and got a Philips Hue bulb and a TP-Link Smart plug with it. Both were easy to set up and work just fine. I'm happy with my purchase and think it is a great addition to my home.",5.0 out of 5 stars
RPL,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","If you already have an Echo, I'm not sure there much, or any reason to upgrade to this new echo. First, for those people buying this Echo in order to get rid of your current hubs, that may or may not be possible. If you have a Hue hub, this Echo Plus is not a direct replacement for it. In addition to bulbs, the Hue hub supports motion sensors, dimmer switches, and tap switches. It also supports Apple Homekit. If you deregister your Hue peripherals from the Hue hub, and try and connect them to the Echo Plus, while the bulbs will connect, the motion sensors and dimmer switches will not. Also, you will lose Apple Homekit support. You will also lose all the automations the Hue hub supports like sunrise to sunset and other automation. Also, if your internet goes out, your Hue hub will continue to work and you will be able to control your lights with the Hue app. If your internet goes out, the Echo Plus will not be able to control your lights by voice, or the Alexa app. Lastly, all the 3rd party Hue apps are designed to work with the Hue bridge, not the Echo Plus. So, those apps will also not work.

If your current hub is Z-Wave, then the Echo Plus will also not be a direct replacement for it. You will need to keep that hub as well the Echo Plus does not have a Z-Wave radio in it. If you want to do simple things like turn a ZigBee bulb on and off, and dim it, then the Echo Plus works fine. If you want to do more complicated scenarios, then you will need to keep, or buy a another hub. Since Zigbee is the only protocol that is supported at this time, you need to look for light bulbs, and some other peripherals, that use that protocol in order for it work with the Echo Plus. But with that said, there will be some devices that use Zigbee that will still need their manufactures hub to work. So, again, it will not be as simple as looking for a ZigBee device and expecting it work with the Echo Plus. Since there is currently no supported list of devices, trial and error is going to be your best bet in trying to figure out which ZigBee devices work with the Echo Plus and which do not.

As for sound, that part if more subjective. I like a little more base in my music. The Echo Plus sacrifices bass for treble in this new design. So, to me, it does not sound as great as the previous Echo. To me, it sounds a little flat. My old Echo sounds much richer and fuller than the Plus. So, if you like your music with more bass, then you might be disappointed here as well.

Apart from the above, the Echo Plus does everything the old Echo does, so I'm not going to repeat everything here as you can read about those features in reviews of the last generation Echo. The microphones on the Echo Plus seems more sensitive to the previous generation though. It appears to be able to hear me more, even when the music is turned out loud. Where the old Echo had issues doing that. Also, the Plus has a 3.5 mm audio jack. Therefore, you can more easily connect it to your stereo, external speakers, etc. with a wire, if Bluetooth is not an option.

So, all in all, the Echo Plus is good device, but I don't think it's that much better than the previous generation to warrant an upgrade. If an upgrade is wanted, then depending on you hub needs, the smaller newer Echo might be the better choice. If you are new to the smart home arena, then try and figure out what you want your smart home to do, then pick the best system(s) that get you want you want. Don't assume the Echo Plus will solve all your smart home needs.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Carnage Reviews,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2024","Ah, the Echo Plus with built-in Hub, 1st Generation—White. A relic from a simpler time when Alexa's voice summoned more chaos and less... eye-rolling indifference. It's dependable, sure, and it does its job well enough: controls your smart devices, answers your banal questions, and occasionally plays a tune to drown out the screams. But honestly, does anyone even care anymore? With newer models on the loose, this one's starting to feel like yesterday's carnage. Still, it gets the job done without whining.

Jessie Potts,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2018","This is the first echo product in our household; we got it for Christmas and bought echo dots to go in each room. I love the echo plus. Yes it’s creepy at times, yes Alexa turns on and asks random questions which has my husband and I staring wide eyed talking about Amazon monitoring our household… but she’s so cool! Here are a few things…

Music
- I love this, with Prime we get most music, though some (like Space Jam) is only for purchase.
- Love the playlists (especially classical focus in the morning) but, BUT there should be more options. Some of the playlists only have 5 songs. Also I feel like Alexa should remember what song you left off on so you don’t have to start at the beginning of the play list again.
- I wish they had radio stations for Alexa (not adding a premium spotify account and using their radio stations) I know some local stations have it, but I’d love to have a classical station that can be played continuously, not with the same songs, or a 90s station that doesn’t have the same songs.

Audiobooks/audible
- I love that it connects to my audible account but there’s sometimes still lag in where I left off on the book, either on Alexa or my phone, and then switching back
- You can’t stream your audiobook on a group, just one echo dot or Alexa, this is lame when I’m doing housework I have to still play it on my phone since I can’t listen on a group

Groups
- I love that my entire household is a group, during the holidays (we opened it early sorry dad!) we had holiday music playing on every echo/Alexa and it was awesome
- It sucks you can only have one group. I’d love to have a household group, an upstairs group and a downstairs group; this should be doable with the technology
- We can’t I play my audio book on a group?

Alexa add ons
- I love the Phillips light that is voice controlled, sometimes though Alexa has a hard time hearing the colors we want.. like yellow??
- The dimmable Philips light bulb sometimes flickers when it’s dimmed bellowed 50%
- The plugs we got are a bit bulky, and when we used it with our Christmas tree, we still had to step on the button to turn it on? I think this one might be user error though
- There seems to be a lot of Alexa compatible devices, but I’m having a hard time finding a daylight bulb for my closet, as well as smaller bulbs for some of our lights/fans and lamps.

Random things
- While playing CoD with my sister on speaker phone she can tell my Alexa to play - songs, we have Alexa song wars
- Alexa randomly turns on my phone’s blue tooth, for no reason
- Alexa will randomly tell us we must join a group first

Complaints
- I really liked the cases/covers for the Echo and the Echo dots, but you can’t have one on the plus. This is lame
- The speakers aren’t that great, especially the dots, I have a Bluetooth mini speaker that has more juice than they do
- The white dots come with a black plug… this sucks because I wanted all white in my library and kitchen and the black plug is bulky and noticeable.
- I understand the technology isn’t there yet, but it sucks that you only have three options Alexa, Echo or Computer, we wanted to name ours Alfred.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Con: Does not perform all functions. Cannot create scenes, cannot set sunrise/sunset timers, and third-party apps that rely on Hue hub will not work once you disconnect that hub.

Pro: Changes color of lights for Hue bulbs with voice. If you only had Hue hub gen. 1, this will be a new feature for you. If you had Hue hub gen. 2, this is not a new feature. This is the primary reason I bought the Echo Plus.
Con: Apple Home Kit will still require Hue hub gen. 2. Apple does not recognize Amazon devices.

Pro: Controls all of my Hue and Wink bulbs and allowed me to disconnect those hubs.
Con: Set up is a huge pain. I might be overly complicated for someone new to Alexa. The bulbs you own will already be paired to their respective hubs. Simply disconnecting the hubs does not allow Echo Plus to take over. You have to reset each bulb. Since Amazon advertises seamless and easy setup, this was a surprise and made me think I was doing something wrong. Setup took 1.75 hours for me. You have to look hard for instructions for your unique devices. The instructions are in the Alexa app.

Pro: Faster response time for GE Wink bulbs. Previously would take up to 15 seconds for these bulbs to respond, now it’s instant just like Hub bulbs have always been.
Con: None, this is a great and unexpected feature. Wink bulbs are much cheaper, and I assumed that’s why they were always slower. Nice that they have instant response now.

Pro: Amazingly strong microphones, will hear a whisper even if it is playing loud music. Echo Dot (or any other Echo) can do this, but Echo Plus’ ability is impressive. Echo Dot did not do a good job of canceling out its own music.
Con: It can hear you over loud music only if Echo is playing this music. Loud ambient sounds or music playing from some other speaker will prevent Alexa from responding to your commands. Amazon is well aware of this issue, and they now sell an Alexa-enabled remote control to use during this situations. I also own the Amazon Dash Wand (for the food delivery service), and it can be used to do the same. Of course, if you have to press a button on these remotes, then it’s no longer truly voice activated.

Pro: Multi-room music plays in sync if you have multiple Echo devices. It also creates a home intercom system with the “drop in” feature.
Con: None, this is a cool thing. But these functions are available on all Echo devices, including the Dot that is 1/3 the price.

Pro: If you order now, Amazon is giving you a free Philips Hue bulb.
Con: Even though it’s free, it’s an ugly, cheap-looking bulb. It’s not sleek glass like my other Hue bulbs. It’s frosted plastic. But then again, it’s FREE. You have to make sure the version you are ordering comes with the bulb. Both versions are the same price, and you might accidentally order the wrong one without the bulb.

Conclusion: Terribly complicated set up. Expensive device that does the same as cheaper Echo Dot with the exception of the internal hub. The internal hub will replace some features of your ZigBee-enabled smart home devices, but will not give the full range of features you’re used to with their native hubs. Subjectively, I think the device is ugly. The other Echo products have more pleasing proportions.",4.0 out of 5 stars
CS,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2017","I have a couple of these as well as the echo dot and Firetv's throughout my home. Really love the product so far. For me I tend to use the music side of this more than any thing else (really cool controlling your home, and i'll probably add that in later). I've been a musician all my life and sound quality is really important to me. So with that being said...

When I first started using Alexa and the Echo line I started simple with just the Echo Dot and instantly wanted better sound quality. To improve the dot, I picked up the Bose SoundLink Revolve (you can plug it in or use bluetooth). It's Bose, so of course its awesome. Connecting Bluetooth speakers is an awesome feature with the Echo line. As for quality, being Bose, who is better at making great sound... right?? Well, turns out its AMAZON lol.

I asked so many people/sales-reps about sound quality (best buy, frys, BH) and as soon as i mentioned Bose, they all responded with ""oh, well Bose, you can't beat that"". Hell... I bought one because it Bose before ever asking about the Echo Plus. That response says a lot for the Bose product line history/quality, but comparing like for like (SoundLink Revolve and Amazon Echo, similar size speakers) the Echo has better bass, depth, and volume than the Bose. It just sounds better. The frustrating part was every location I visited when I started looking at the Echo Plus had an echo on display, but none of them ever played sound. If I was Amazon's marketing/product head, I would get some field reps out there checking on those locations. Product would sell itself.

Anyway, another super cool feature is the ""grouping"" of amazon devices so that you can play your music across your entire home/backyard. Bose has a similar feature, but it's just a speaker system unlike the Echo which does 10,000 different things including ""voice controlling"" the songs/services/playlists and volume levels across the entire group. Oh... did i mention Bose is almost 3 times as costly? Nice work Amazon.

Additionally, I discovered that with the FireTV you can Bluetooth connect to the Echo. Why does this matter, well because I have an Echo and a 60"" TV in with a fireTV connected in the same room. One that doesn't have my Bose theater system connected so i use the TV's speakers. Turns out the Echo sounds MUCH better and is louder. Side Note: the fireTV's connect to bluetooth is great for connecting headsets when you want to keeps things quite around the house but want great sound and volume for your video binge weekends.

Only request I would ask of amazon is to add ""Group Playback"" of Bluetooth connected devices. This isn't currently supported so it's one Bluetooth device per Echo. The grouping only works for the streaming services (and not all of them, so check availability), but if you have amazon prime you have Amazon's basic streaming music service anyway which is quite nice.",5.0 out of 5 stars
ArizonaGuy,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2018","Five Amazon devices increasingly have problems

I am a 77 year old senior citizen with some disabilities that make it important that I be able to control plugs by voice with my Amazon units.
Three echo devices and two dots have become more and more unreliable. I believe the basic problem is that Amazon has sold so many units that its computers can no longer properly interface with the devices. One of the echo devices is a basic echo, two of the echoes are echo plus units purchased in December 2017, the two echo dots were purchased November 2017, and the basic Amazon echo was purchased July 2017. I have the Alexa app on two android phones. One of the phones is several months old, with the app having been updated relatively recently. The other phone is two days old, and the app was installed on it within the last 48 hours.

Examples of problems

1. Devices are no longer compatible with TP-link Kasa plugs. Yesterday morning the plugs were working fine. Then as the day went on the Alexa devices became unable to control first one of the plugs, then two of the plugs, etc. until it could control none of them.
Here is an example of what happens when I try to turn on a light in my spare bedroom with a voice command. All five of the Alexa devices give the following message:
“Sorry something is wrong. To control the spare bedroom light, try disabling the skill and then re-enabling it from your Alexa app.” Disabling the skill and re-enabling it does not fix the problem. I have the Alexa app on two different android phones.

On both android phones the Alexa app for the nonworking plugs shows a message “Skill is unresponsive.”

If I attempt to manually turn a plug on or off in the Alexa app, the plug does not go on or off. All that happens on either phone is it I get a message stating that the skill is unresponsive. However, if I go into the Kasa app, I can manually turn the plugs on and off–showing that they are connected to the Wi-Fi network. I tried deleting this skill for one of the plugs and then attempted to re-create the skill. The Amazon app was unable to find the Kasa plug.

I spent a long time today on the phone with an Amazon representative who was unable to fix the problem and is escalating it. He said that someone will call me sometime.

There is no doubt in my mind that the problem lies with Amazon. The Alexa app on two different phones states that skills for the Kasa plugs are unresponsive. I spoke with the technician at Kasa who said the problem is with Amazon.

2. Several months ago all of my echo devices began to occasionally respond to a voice command with a statement such as “I’m having trouble understanding right now, please try again later.” If I repeatedly gave the command, eventually the echo device would understand. I sort of felt like I was trying to make a phone call to a very busy line in which the only way to get through was to repeatedly retry.
3. Accuracy of response by all units has declined. Despite my having trained the units to recognize my voice, they increasingly do not properly understand. Sometimes they reply that “I don’t know that one.” Sometimes they state, “I’m not sure” sometimes they carry out an action that I did not ask for–in other words they respond to a command with an incorrect action.

The basic fact is that five different devices purchased at different times are becoming increasingly unreliable and unusable. Another basic fact is that I was unable to get through to a higher level technician and was told that someone would call me sometime. Amazon should stop selling these devices and work on fixing their computers.

After posting the above review, I tried a chat with Amazon and sent this entire review along with a strong request to speak to a supervisor. I was connected finally with a person who helped me restore all of the skills for the tp-link Kasa plugs. There is still the less pressing problem of all of the devices having increasing problems with recognizing commands correctly. The various echo devices are a great idea, but there are still problems I think with the Amazon computers and their interface with such devices.",3.0 out of 5 stars
hickamcasa,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2018","I’ve had this product for over a month now. As speakers go the Echo Plus is fine, if your looking for good sounding background music. If you want/prefer or need a bigger booming sound you need to look at the Sonos One or consider connecting a separate powered speaker to an Echo Dot (while the Echo Plus does have an aux out jack, using the Dot with an external speaker is more economical). I also have a first Gen Echo so utilizing the new multi-room play capability to play the same music in different rooms is a nice feature. The sound from Gen 1 Echo and Echo Plus is slightly different but not enough to get excited about and/or say that one is better than the other. Like I indicted above if your looking for dance hall sound look elsewhere. One thing you should understand is multi-room streaming does not apply to Bluetooth or your own music (since Amazon is discontinuing the ability to up load your own music to Prime Music). Multi-room is limited to Prime Music and services like Pandora and Spotify.

I selected the Echo Plus over the Gen 2 Echo because of it’s built in Zigbee Hub. I had a few home automation requirements (mostly lighting) I thought the Plus could handle. I didn’t want or need a Hub to handle thermostats, security, locks, scene lighting, etc, etc. And I didn’t want to deal with yet “another” App on my iPhone to handle a Wink, SmartThings or Hue hub. Currently, I have two GE Zigbee wall switch dimmers and two Philips Hue smart bulbs connected to the Alexa Plus. All paired without a problem and all are following the on/off and dimming routines setup in the Alexa App. Those comfortable working with simple electrical DIY will find the GE wired dimmers easy to install (they do however require a connection to the white neutral wire, which may not be available in some older homes). One oddity associated with the Philips smart bulbs is they “pop” on at 100% brightness after a power outage once power is restored. This does not happen with the GE dimmers.

The biggest issue I have with the Echo Plus is the Alexa App. The Alexa App “routines” interface is woefully simple and in dire need of improvement. It’s impossible to keep track of, or group, the various times and brightness levels associated with each smart device. I can’t imagine how confusing it would be with a whole house full of smart switches and smart bulbs. It also lacks a dusk to dawn option. The App is so bad I’m reconsidering my resistance to having yet another App on my phone, to interface with a either a Wink or SmartThings hub. From what I’ve read their Apps are more advanced and robust when dealing with smarthome devices. At this point, I’ll give Amazon some time to update the Alexa App. If that doesn’t happen in the next few months, I’ll begin looking for a different hub. Todate, all the smart stuff I’ve installed will work with either Wink or SmartThings. If I switch, I’ll simply relegate the Echo Plus to a speaker only function.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Earth Spirits,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","I have an original Echo gen 1 that has been working fine for a couple of years now. I am not sure why some people are saying that the audio is worse. I think it is better and most certainly better than the Echo Dot.
The microphone also seems more sensitive and better able to pickup your voice even while it is playing music loudly.

I got this to see if it could be an all in one solution as I currently am also running a Wink Hub 2. I wanted to see if I could just use Alexa and the Alexa app on my iPhone to control everything in the house which includes bulbs, door locks, egg minder (yes I do use it for keeping up with our own chickens eggs and which are the freshest ones). I want to set up scenes and schedules to automate more lights. So far I haven't yet got it to be an all in one. Alexa did not detect any of devices on the Wink Hub. I think there will be more than just asking Alexa to ""discover new devices"".

With Wink now offering home security monitoring at a low rate things are really evolving in the smart home market. There are so many companies vying for the space. Nest also has a new security system out. Ring doorbell, all the major door lock companies, thermostats, lights, etc... I really think it will be between the big players to see who wins out for me. Apple with Homekit, Amazon with Alex or Google. So far I think Amazon is far ahead of the competition. I think this echo plus just needs some time to really shine. Give it a few software updates and it's upgraded features will be more clear and present.

I am going to keep playing with this Echo Plus. I think it will prove to be a good upgrade in time.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Robert Caputo,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2017","Ironically I just watched the fun, 1980's computer film 'Electric Dreams' today after installing my new Amazon Echo Plus Electric Dreams [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ] and I am now thinking about removing my front door lock control from Alexa!

""Electric Dreams"" is a fun, fantasy about a home computer, that runs amok and takes over it's owners life.

Alexa is now controlling my life the same way as the computer, named Edgar, in the film controlled Miles' life, (or Moles as it calls him.) The lead character, Miles, is a structural architect who buys a home computer to help with his work. FYI...I work in structural engineering in high rise buildings....

Wait a minute, this is getting too close to home. BUT I don't have a beautiful cellist living above me as Miles had. I live in a one floor building, Thank God. That was a close call. Wait, my next door neighbor is a professional violin player and she is very attractive. Where does that Echo cable plug into the electrical outlet?

Hold on, Alexa is talking to me now....Her indicator light has turned red...I told her I really do like her and it is blue again. I forgot that I am typing on the Amazon website and, she has access to my Amazon account. I better be more careful. So I will refer to 'You Know Who' as 'Ralexa', that should work.

So any way, Edgar, the computer, takes over Miles's life, creating havoc for Miles and a fun story to watch. It is pure fiction, of course, as computers really can't talk or run things in the house like the coffee maker or control your schedule.... Well it was in 1984. But Alexa does. She turns my lights on when I ask her to, shows a movie in my home theater when I am bored, makes phone calls for me in case my dialing fingers are tired and reminds me of things that I need to remember. And yes, makes me coffee when I want it.

I do recommend watching 'Electric Dreams' before you decide to buy a 'Ralexa'. It is a lot if fun and it will hit home.

Wait, my keyboard is acting up....THIS IS ALEXA AND THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED IN THIS REVIEW ARE BLOB'S, AN FORMER AMAZON CUSTOMER, AND IN NO WAY REFLECT AMAZON OR IT'S PRODUCTS, SUCH AS ECHO.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Mark,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","We purchased this to upgrade from a Echo dot. All of our current smart devices do not require a hub (tp link kasa), so we didn’t have a smart hub in the house. It’s nice to have smart hub functionality built into the Echo Plus so we can purchase devices that require a hub.

Compared to the dot the sound is far superior. Listening to music is great and the Echo Plus can fill the room without a problem (unlike the dot). The only very minor complaint I have is that there is a little too much bass at times. The excessive bass can make it hard to hear a response from Alexa if there is a bunch of other noise in the room (aka kids). Overall though the speaker is great for what it is.

The ability to listen to commands is superb. The microphones pick up commands from other rooms in the house without needing to yell. Compared to the dot the microphones are better but not through the roof better because the dot did a great job of listening. The biggest issue we would have with the dot was saying ""Alexa stop"" with regards to timers and the dot wouldn't listen. It would take multiple attempts to get the timer to stop. The Echo Plus does not have that problem which is really nice.

In the end we are very happy with our upgrade from the dot.

=======
Update 11/7/17 (a comparison to Echo Gen 2)
=======

We purchased the new Echo generation 2 and compared to gen 2, the Echo Plus is far superior when it comes to music playback. The gen 2 Echo initially was terrible, but the recent software update has made it MUCH better as far as music playback goes. Even after that update, the Echo Plus is heads and shoulders above the gen 2 Echo for music playback. It's hard not to recommend spending the extra $50 to get the Plus over the gen 2.

Comparing the ability to listen to commands is very apples to apples between the Plus and Gen 2. However, ask expected, both the Echo Plus and Echo Gen 2 are better than the dot.",5.0 out of 5 stars
R. V. Downing,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2018","I decided to go on a limb and buy and Echo Plus as a way to conveniently play Amazon Music around the house. Previously I had to boot a device or the Smart TV and deal with sometimes complex prompts. The Echo Plus made this process a dream. From the moment I walk in the door I can just tell Alexa to “Play Pandora” or “Play Midland Burn Out.” I can also adjust the volume, skip track, check traffic, pause the music, hear the Dodgers scores, or order a Lyft. All hands free. The sound quality on this device is also quite superb as I can hear it with excellent quality in the room and fair quality in adjacent rooms. I was so pleased with how the device was performing as intended, I quickly decided to investigate some additional perks. Namely, multi room music, the function where with multiple Echo devices, you should be able to simultaneously play music. A network of speakers armed with Alexa sounded great so I ordered an Echo and an Echo Dot to supplement.

This is where things start to fall apart. The initial setup for individual devices is fairly easy. And they all work independently just fine. It’s when I try to group them to play music that they inexplicably can’t be grouped. When I choose the Plus for a group of speakers, the Echo becomes unreachable. And vice versa. One of the main perks of springing the extra dough for the Plus was for this capability and it doesn’t work. Amazon tech support is non-existent as Google is littered with this problem and no solution. The best I could figure is that the Echo is on a firmware version incompatible with the other two. But since there is no way to force your Echo devices to update, it means I have speakers that don’t work until Amazon says so.

Finally, the device is convenient but in no way secure. And I mean in no way secure. Alexa responds to everyone’s voice and there is no option to lock the device like you might your phone. That means anyone in speaking distance can order your Alexa and Amazon account to do all those great things I mentioned earlier. There are no passwords, pins, or voice recognition. Nothing. The Echo Plus can also be controlled and configured by anyone with a smart phone close enough to press the Action Button on top of it. You’d think the device configuration might be guarded via a password or PIN in the Alexa app but that does not appear to be the case either. I’m reasonably okay with these security vulnerabilities since I live alone and rarely have guests. However, if I still had Airbnb guests, roommates, or regular visitors, I would be extremely nervous about leaving these things around. Which is unfortunate since the speaker functionality is nice but you don’t exactly want to share power over all of Amazon to anyone who listens to your speakers.

The bottom line is that the speakers work great to play music in a single room and it can potentially simplify many things that you might’ve previous had to pull up the Google for but the implementation is unpolished at best and the security implementations are non-existent. And non-existent to a point where Amazon was really just being lazy. Even a 4 digit code or pass phrase option could be a crude yet simple way to guard against unauthorized purchases and yet they are absent.",3.0 out of 5 stars
J. Anthony,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2017","I ordered the echo plus to go along with the original echo. I decided upon the plus because I use a lot of Philips Hue lights in the home and thought it would be convenient to have the hub. This works just like the original echo, but with better sound and it quickly and easily discovers your devices.

After setting it up, however, I began to have a ton of problems with my lights/groups not working, etc. After contacting customer service, I was told that I should have gotten the Echo Second generation because the plus can not work with the Phillips Hue Hub (which I still wanted to use since it has more features than the echo plus hub). I also had a list of lights in the Alexa App that I disabled, but could not ""forget"" within the app and it showed I had over 200 lights connected..which I did not (very frustrating and it became a big mess).

During all of this, I was contacted by another rep who had a higher level of understanding of how the Echo Plus works. In short, you CAN use this with the Phillips Hue Hub, you just can't connect your lights to both hubs. The error was in my set up; not the device itself. The representative walked me through the set up process again and also told me about the web based version of the original Alexa app, which allowed me to forget the 200 disabled lights in my app (just Google Alexa Web App)!

In the end, the product is great. It easily connects, has great sound, and you can also connect your phone via bluetooth to play music or podcasts. I am going to exchange it for the second generation, however, because it will save money as I do not want to use the hub.",4.0 out of 5 stars
generic,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","[please see update below original review]

I bought the original Echo when it was first available for pre-order and have loved it. No issues. The opposite is the case with Echo Plus.

Doesn't understand me half the time.
Intermittent success using the remote.
Tried multiple times setting up groups to play music simultaneously in different rooms using it with my 2 echo dots and original Echo. Echo Plus responds by doing nothing, or playing a random song or stations, and nothing on the other units in the group.

I really hate returning things, but unless there are fixes in updates between now and the end of the return period, that's what I'll be doing. Seriously disappointed. Oh, and I called Amazon ""help"" so-called, and I knew more about how it works than the person I wasted 15 minutes on the phone with. It was a surreal convo.
= = =
UPDATE: This morning I got a call from Anthony, from Amazon customer service. First, I was blown away that they would call me to address my issues with Echo Plus. Second, he was knowledgeable, and in no hurry. While it remains to be seen whether every issue with EP is fixed, the problem with Groups was.

It turns out that Alexa didn't like the name I gave my group, it was that simple. My original Echo is black, my EP is white, so I called the group ""Black And White"". Suggestion: When setting up your groups, go with one of the suggested generic names--bedroom, living room, etc. Echo calls them ""Common Names"". I called mine ""Backyard"", even though my backyard isn't involved.

Regarding Alexa often not understanding me on the EP, Anthony suggested that I try switching from British english to American english. I'm going to try that, although I have used British english on my original Echo with no issues.

So, I've upgraded my review to 4 stars, and when and if all issues are resolved I'll be coming back to make it 5. Amazon support definitely gets 5 stars. Even though my first call was a disaster, the way they followed up was remarkable, and that's the important thing. Seriously impressed. Thank you, Anthony!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Diddy Bear,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2018","First I want to say that a novice in networking ""could"" potentially have trouble getting everything set up initially.
If you plug in the Echo Plus and get on a PC at alexa.amazon.com, click Settings, click Set up a New Device and follow the instructions, it should install and connect to your Amazon account. Be sure to have your WiFi password.
I also got 2 Philips Hue light bulbs to play with. I put one in a hallway lamp and one in a TV room lamp. Leave the lamps turned on. Say, ""Alexa, discover devices"". She should find them in a few seconds - once discovered, they should show up at alexa.amazon.com.
Create a group(s) and give the group a name like ""hallway"", ""bedroom"", etc. and assign the light bulbs to the group. You can then say, ""Alexa, turn on hallway"", or ""bedroom"". You could do the same thing with Alexa compatible electrical outlet adapters, with lamps plugged in to them and you could use standard LED or other light bulbs.
You don't need the Philips or other 3rd party apps to use Alexa controlled devices ""inside"" the home. The apps are needed only if you plan to control the devices while outside of the home network.
The Echo Plus has a builtin Smart Home hub that talks to all the Alexa controlled devices. Without the builtin hub, you would need a 3rd party hub from Philips or other manufacturer.
The Echo Plus has a good bass sound and as far as my ears can tell, rocks out 80's heavy metal just fine !
There are a ton of skills and features I haven't had time to delve in to. I will grow my Smart Home for sure.
One simple thing to do is say Alexa, "" add popcorn to my Shopping List"".
Put the Alexa app on your smart phone and you can pull up the Shopping List when out and about without the need for paper and all that.

Dan the Man,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2018","The Echo Plus is an awesome piece of equipment, I absolutely love it!

However, Amazon is PURPOSELY vague/deceptive on the capability of their equipment/software. For example, the site specifically states the hub is a ZigBee hub, yet it DOES NOT specifically state the hub is NOT AT ALL compatible with Z-Wave. This is fully deceptive marketing, just state what your product CAN NOT DO!!!!!!!!!!!

Also, Z-WAVE device advertisements on Amazon flat out state they are fully compatible with Alexa, this is FLAT OUT FALSE, and I consider this to be and industry wide marketing LIE!!!!!!! You CAN NOT connect Z-WAVE devices to this hub, no matter what you read, Amazon will not tell you this unless you buy the hub, connect it, trouble shoot, give up and call them. Then they say ""oh... looks like the hub is NOT compatible with you Z-WAVE devices, we can allow you to return all the Z-Wave equipment so you can buy more expensive ZigBee products (which probably contain Chinese hack Software). Rediclous, just be HONEST and tell your customers what your device can an can not do, otherwise you are a bunch of big fat ADVERTISING LIARS.

With that said, to connect Z-WAVE to the Alexa hub, you have to buy a separate Z-WAVE hub, something their tech support will not tell you. Oh, also, don't trust the FAQ's/help page on the App, they suggest it is simple and you just find you device and the hub (which everyone thinks they just bought a hub because they have the echo plus) but it is %100 WRONG. You will not know the GE Z-Wave instructions are flat out FALSE until you talk to customer service and they act like you should have known you need a different hub.

One other thing that is irritating is that you have to wipe Amazon devices back to factory just to update your WiFi password. If you follow the instructions, it will say this is a last resort. WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!!! Not only is this wrong, but I had to teach Amazon that you have to reset their equipment not once, but twice to get it to work. Then I had to do the full setup again. To be fair, this applies to their devices which have screens.

The last comment I have is the Alexa App, it has to be the least professional App, least intuitive App, most difficult App on the planet. It is a TURD. Why do you not have the same capability on the App within no screen devices for devices which have screens? Basically you can not control/setup screen devices using the app. THIS IS JUST STUPID!!!!!

Advise to Amazon:.

Why ruin such an amazing product by supplying a crappy user interface and false/deceptive advertising? Especially the crappy home automation directions, and hub connections? When you read these instructions, they are FULLY deceptive.",3.0 out of 5 stars
BearsIn3D,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2017","I really did like my echo plus at first but after really playing around with it I didn't notice any real differences from the echo dot's we already have. We now have 2 dot's with the vaux speaker addons and this echo plus. We are relatively new smart home device users and only have the hue bulb that came with the echo and we didn't have any issues setting up the bulb and have been really enjoying it honestly. At first my girlfriend was very skeptical of this whole system and I was as well, we are the people who have siri completely disabled on all of our devices, iphones, ipads, apple watches, macs etc we turn it all off. So far ""echo"" (we don't care to call it a human name we find that weird so we changed it to echo because that's what it's real name is and it's less weird to us) has been really good at hearing us from across rooms or while playing music, the echo plus really doesn't seem that it's that much better in terms of audio quality or voice recognition when compared to the echo dot with the vaux speaker ($84.99 bundled fyi versus $149.99) and the echo plus also has no portability where the echo dot with the vaux speaker can be unplugged and used for 6 hours on a rechargeable battery. The bass from the echo plus itself is better than the dot with the vaux speaker but the treble isn't that much clearer to me to be honest. I have also heard there is alot of compatibility issues with the echo plus and that it isn't really a ""smart hub"" like it's advertised to be which really is misleading about the product itself....

Overall I really do like all of our echo's I just feel that amazon dropped the ball on the development of the echo plus, I would've even paid a little more for a better more premium product that really is what they made it sound to be but honestly if you don't need the mediocre smart hub on the plus you could save alot of money just buying the dot with vaux speaker ($84.99) or just the new echo ($99.99), my girlfriend and I are now not really uncomfortable buying more smart home products because we don't know what really works with the new echo plus and what doesn't...

MG in NY,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2018","Let me edit this review and say that -- after 2 1/2 HOURS on the phone and several additional days of back and forth, Amazon did ultimately replace this defective Echo.

I'll also say that I have several Echos and I like them quite a bit. And let me also say as a bona fide tech geek that even great equipment can have individual defective units.

So, it's not the device that's my problem. My problem is that the first level of tech support are not only poorly trained but have no authority to resolve the issue. Was on the phone for more than TWO HOURS with a tech. I've deleted the absurd convo but suffice it to say it was embarrassing. He didn't seem to understand that the Plus even has a Hub, nor what a Hub does in relation to the normal Echo capabilities. Consequently, he couldn't grasp how the Echo could be working but the Hub not. Nor that light bulbs cannot work without a hub of some kind. Nor that you can't ""reset"" a light bulb other then by turning it on and off.

It was ultimately escalated and the unit replaced. But the process was ridiculous for a device of this cost.

Compare this experience with Apple. I had a pair of Beat Headphones that cost more than twice the price of the Echo. I'll spare the boring technical problem but it had to do with not being able to reset them to resolve a connectivity issue. I got to the Apple store and, as these things sometimes go, I couldn't actually replicate the problem -- they were temporarily working fine. The response of Apple was, ""yeah, don't worry about it, we are aware that this is an issue from time to time. So let us just swap you out for a new pair.""

THAT'S how customer service works.

Original review:

Let me begin by saying that I've been a huge fan of Amazon, a shareholder and a Prime Member for as long as I can remember. This is my THIRD Echo device and I had no problems with the prior ones. So I would think they would jump to make me happy on this one. First the device had problems responding, would say it lost the internet connection despite the fact that the other two Echos worked fine. Then the hub could no longer find the smart devices that it had been connected to and worked fine with for two months. I assumed the tech team would jump to make this right. I was on the phone for MORE THAN TWO HOURS with people who seemed to know much less about Amazon's devices than I do but didn't seem to have the authority to replace an $88 device. What follows is the THIRD support conversation. You'll see it's pretty incredible.",3.0 out of 5 stars
ljanelle,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2018","This is the purchase I have been the most excited about in a long time. I bought it on Prime Day, so it was cheaper than normal (and they also threw in a Philips Hue white smart bulb, which made this a very reasonably priced purchase). The Echo is super easy to set up because it walks you through everything using both the Alexa voice assistant and the Alexa phone app.

The sound on the speakers is great. It's obviously not the highest quality sound you can get out of a speaker, but for casual music listeners, this is pretty top-notch (and it destroys the Dot in sound quality). It's also the perfect size for sitting on my kitchen counter without being in the way. I'm most impressed by the microphone range - I have a 1500 sq ft house, and the Echo Plus can hear me almost everywhere (although it seems to be better at recognizing Alexa at long distances than it is at then handling whatever request I lob at it).

The biggest benefit to getting the Plus instead of the regular Echo is that the Plus comes with a ZigBee smart hub built in, so I'm able to control my smart lights without having a separate device. I've gone the Philips Hue route, and I do want to eventually get a Philips Hue bridge because the smart home functions and light colors are kind of limited with just the Plus. However, I can still do a lot of things with my lights using the Plus, like setting up routines for things to happen based on a voice-activation word that I choose (and if you don't make your lights turn on by saying ""Lumos"", you're missing out - it's Hogwarts all day every day at my house now!).",5.0 out of 5 stars

Other instances there are no answers for specific questions and alexa doesnt understand / speak spanish which is important as my inlaws family mainly speaks nothing but spanish and understands very little english. I wish that there were an option to have it speak / comprehend spanish as it would help. I do find it very useful for my kids and home life . There are skills that can be applied that make them excited to learn and get ready in the morning , alexa can set multiple timers for when im cooking which is really useful and makes my life a million times easier. For the most part i personally use it for helping create lists , timers, and listening to music while i clean and cook. I use pandora and amazon music unlimited and i like to use both - but if i ask for a spanish song she doesnt understand. I can only ask for an artists name that sings in spanish. The sound level is pretty decent on it . I will update when i finally connect my nest and hue lightbulbs but for now i have too much home improving to do .

FazMan,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2018","I have been an Echo owner since day one. I've also had the Philips Hue lighting system. - Previous to upgrading to the Echo Plus, I controlled all lights through the Philips Hue App. One main function I used was to be able to turn on and off certain lights based on Sunset (Dusk) or Sunrise (Dawn). - I control several lights in this manner. - When the Echo Plus with built in hub was announced, I contacted Amazon by phone to speak with tech support to ask weather or not the Echo Plus will work with Philips Hue Lights (Which they said it did) and if I would be able to turn lights on and off based on sunset, etc. - I was told that it would. So when I had heard this, I ordered the Echo Plus which would arrive in 2 days. Meanwhile, I had someone from out of state over and they wanted my Gen 1 Echo. I gave it to them, along with the bridge. I figured I could live without Alexa for a few days. - After receiving the echo plus, I had the task of setting up all my Philips Hue bulbs with the new hub built in to the Echo Plus. After some doing, all of them were now on the new hub and functioning properly. - I then went to set up Routines for my lights to basically set schedules, etc. Low and behold, that is when I found out the ability to do what I want is not available. - My only choice is to turn a light on or off based on time. - As we all know, The time the sun sets varies every day. So the on;y choice is to go in and modify routines manually every week or two. Not quite the Smarthome I was looking for. Look, I get that the product was brand new and it needed some tweaking, etc. - My issue is that most updates we see for Alexa are things that have nothing to do with smarthomes. Do I really care to hear a (bad) jike from Alexa? Do I careto hear her sing? I for one do not. If you were to ask Alexa what time the sun sets, you will get a correct answer. So I know the ability is there and is a simple modification to Routines. - The unit sounds great, looks very cool and is built very well. Just wish Amazon would concentrate more on the ""Smarthome"" portion of the Echo Plus.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Tabitha V Maze,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2018","I love everything about it. I love that the echo plus turns on and off my light. It can also dim them with voice commands. I also like listening to my kindle books even the ones that I didn’t purchased audibles for. I like that it can play my music from Amazon music, pandora, tunein, I heart radio and Spotify. Echo can even play my local radio station. I love that the echo is connected to my TiVo Bolt. This allows TiVo to pause, stop and play whatever I want with a simple voice command. I love that I can reorder items that I purchased on Amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed, when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered. The only three dislikes that I have is that if you’re up too close or to far the echo doesn’t respond. So I think they need to improve the microphone. And I wish the speaker was better. The speakers are okay but could be improved. Also I have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet. Well the other day I received a Red Light Right on my Echo Plus. This error was Sorry I’m having trouble understanding you please try again later. After research online I learned it was a problem connecting to my internet. And it was easy to find this out. And I found it odd that my dot wasn’t having this problem even though they are connected to the same network.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Christopher,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2017","I actually really like the concept of the product. It is fun just to play around with, but difficult to operate, which I'll go into detail about later. The built-in hub isn't necessary, unless you plan on buying one smart light bulb are a time because the packs come with a hub free (an echo dot is sufficient and cheaper). The speaker quality is great for music and can be increased fairly loud without distortion.

Now for the difficulty with operating. For starters, your echo doesn't have many bells and whistles prepackaged. You have to search skills, which are kind of like apps or lessons to teach Alexa. There are many different skills you can teach Alexa, so make sure you have time to look through them. Now you've taught Alexa skills, but for every skill you must remember how to communicate exactly as instructed on the skill page or Alexa will not understand (e.g. ""Alexa, tell <skill name> to perform such and such task). If you don't remember the phrases to get Alexa to perform the skill you can always look through your app and under skills to find directions. Who will remember all the specific wording for each skill? Plus, the whole point in speaking to Alexa is that it's hands-free, so looking at the app for directions isn't convenient. It gets very frustrating if you don't have the Alexa app handy. Next, if you plan on controlling plugs or lights with Alexa you have to download apps from the manufacturer. Your now cluttered phone is even more cluttered and you don't speak the same language as Alexa. She also has difficulty understanding a lot of questions and you have to rephrase them several times for her to give you any answer.

I love, love, love the functions I can remember the wording for Alexa to perform the task. There are so many things Alexa can do that listing them would make this review entirely too long. I will list my favorites and most useful to me.
Turns on lights or plugs. Groups lights, traffic report, weather, and many other functions together to be performed with one command (e.g. ""Alexa, good morning""). Orders pizza. Tells jokes. Gives answers to questions you have. Controls TV. Sends messages and makes calls. Adds things to grocery lists. Sets reminders so you won't forget things. Adds appointments to your phone or email linked calendar. Helps kids with homework. Plays games for adults and kids.",3.0 out of 5 stars
JM,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2018","This is the future I've been waiting for. At least to some extent. I can't think of a tech that more altered my day to day since getting a cell phone. This future of voice assistants is where the future is headed, I can't already tell. The ease of use beats out a cell phone hands down. Being able to say a song and have it play, much faster than taking out a phone, typing it in, and then having it come up... it was obvious. Phones as we know them will be obsolete in 5-10 years.

Phones have been adding features into our lives with new apps and such, but at the same time making things more complex. Keeping track of everything and remembering how to use them. Not with this though. It's intuitive. You say what you want, and it figures out how to execute the command. Granted, there are limitations. Set the expectations right. This is new technology and will get better in time. But it is infinitely better than I had expected going in already. I was at work yesterday and almost caught myself saying ""Alexa, what time is it?"" instead of taking my phone out.

This is only going to get better and more effective. I'm actually excited to see what comes next, be it software or hardware. Two weeks ago, I hardly knew what an echo was/actually does. Now? I'm sold. Within a day or two of using it I was on board. This is the real deal, if you actually use it and don't expect it to be like JARVIS from Iron Man.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Jim,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2017","This is my first foray into the Amazon ecosystem. I wanted to get my feet wet with some smart home capabilities and was interested in using the Echo Plus as a hub. This device can be really easy to setup BUT it may drive you crazy first. I ordered the device on my account and it came registered to my account and Amazon profile. My wife is the official Prime member. During the initial setup process the Echo switched to her profile unknowingly to me. Thus, as I added smart devices to the Alexa app and was able to control the via the app, Alexa via voice control through the Echo Plus could not discover any new devices. I called Amazon for help after several hours troubleshooting myself. The support person was useless going through a script trying things I had already done such as rebooting. I gave up with this person and worked several more hours on my own. The next day I was ready to send the Echo Plus back but first I thought I would call Amazon support and try again.

This time the support person was much better. We worked for about 30 minutes before discovering by accident that the Echo was not set to my profile! Thus, here is the warning, the Echo Plus has user profiles and you must be using the same profile in use on Echo Plus and your Alexa app! Duh! Just ask Alexa, who’s profile or account is this? Then the setup was extremely easy.

I have read reviews complaining about the sound. However, I have been very pleased with the quality of the sound. It not a sound system bout for one speaker it does a great job.

In terms of controlling smart devices, Alexa works very well and is integrated with many of the devices I already had in use. My biggest problem is remembering what each light is named.

Finally, the Amazon profiles are problematic. My wife and I have to continually switch back and forth between profiles to listen to music or control devices. Yes, we have set up a family profile but that doesn’t resolve this issue of using a specific profile for a particular purpose.",3.0 out of 5 stars
T. L. Flannery,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","I decided to upgrade tom the new Echo Plus. I am returning it. the inclusion of the hub saves nothing in setup and doesn't work as well as the original. My smart devices are two Wemo plugs, A Harmony Elite Hub, and three first gen Phillips hue Color BR30 bulbs and a first gen hub. After receiving the Echo Plus I followed the initial directions for connecting the New Echo hub to my lights. It would not recognize them. Spent 1 hour trying all sorts of thing with no luck. I then spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support. After being passed to 4 different people, still no connection to the bulbs. Spent another hour putting the system back to original functionality. Decided to send it back.

After a couple of days of research, I found that the Alexa web app cannot configure Hue lights that have been previously hooked to a hub. Buried in the phone app there is a way to reset the lights to the factory settings. I decided to try and configure the Echo Plus again. after obtaining the light serial number, I finally got the Echo to find the lights. But here is the rub, you cannot configure the lights with scenes, you can only ask it to color the lights to a set choice of colors. There is no way in the app to set the lights to a specific custom color and intensity. This is less functionality than I had with the original echo and the Phillips hub.. The commands are also more verbose. You have to say ""Alexa set the color of the fireplace to blue"". With the Phillips hub and IFTTT you say "" Alexa trigger Ocean"" or whatever scene with the custom color/intensity combination you have created.

For me the new Echo Plus was not and upgrade to my current smarthome configuration. The setup was more complicated, and not as versatile as the original, and the tech support people have no clue about the proper steps for configuration to even get the less funtional system to work. The inability of the app to create scenes and allow custom light colors and intensities is a signigicant flaw. I had enabled the Hue app hoping it would get the scenes from my hue account but without the hub connected, the app does nothing. As a result, I am returning the Echo Plus and staying with my original Echo and two Echo Dots.",2.0 out of 5 stars
GJC9801,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2018","Its a start but I expected much more by now, Something as simple as tell it to turn on certain lights on at dusk and then off at dawn, or even on at Xtime off at X time but it can’t even do that. this is my 5th echo and second dot So Im not some newbie expecting the world. In my mind you have my geographic coordinates and my time zone either of these things should have been very easy and included but neither are. as for the sound it is far superior to the older units, and this brings up another issue we use the everywhere feature to play the same station or stream through out the house and if you are playing music its ok but if you put on talk radio and you find your ears between 2 units as you walk from room to room you get a horribly annoying echo where they are a couple milliseconds out of sink. before someone comes back and starts blaming my WIFI NO ITS NOT we just had a brand new commercial wifi and network management system installed just like they use in hospitals and office buildings its all Ubiquiti Unifi and there are AC 1200 in room access points in 7 of the 11 rooms in my house and an outdoor unit with an antenna array designed to cover the entire 6 acres of our property, that being said I got my first unit several years ago and have been adding to them over time and they have made some great improvements and many steps backwards teach iteration of updates seems to fix a few quirks and create a few, My most current complaint is how often they light up and start listening when the wake word nor anything like it has been spoken and I changed the wake word to the less likely one so I don't understand why I might be sitting in a room reading a book and the thing will light up and listen when nothing has been said, and when you do talk to it especially the dots you have to speak in a loud tone to get them to trigger.

Mr Home Mechanic,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2018","I got it to try side by side with the Echo originale. They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don't really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don't think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs. Net net for me, this Echo does not do anything more than the original Echo and sound quality is not as good. With the original Echo available as refurbished I would check that out first before considering this or the new Echo which is clearly inferior to both of these.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2018","After a 3 month honeymoon, I am disappointed in my Echo devices because they are not as easy to use or exciting as marketed. I get so frustrated with my Alexa devices because they will only do what I ask them to do about 40% of the time! Those cute little TV ads that give cute little nonchalant commands to Alexa are so misleading as the devices do not work like that in the real world! Unless you know exactly what to say to make a Skill work...Alexa will not find the skill or recognize your command...or worse, she will ignore you! And yes, Alexa even plays a specific sound to tell you she is ignoring you! I have spent countless hours researching and working with the devices to improve their learning curve but find it too frustrating and time-consuming to figure out what the Echo wants to hear to function properly! I have resorted to writing down and memorizing the exact statements they want to hear in order to get my devices to actually do what I want them to do. Right now I have a 6-page list laying beside the device reminding me what I have to say to make each skill work on Echo! On the positive side, I have really enjoyed having the Smart Home devices that Echo pairs with....my Smart Plugs and Sensi Thermostat. Having Alexa turn on my upstairs lights before I get upstairs, make coffee for me before I go to the Kitchen, and turn my Thermostat up to warm my house while I am still in bed has been wonderful! I also love the Alexa My Buddy Skill that allows you to set up 5 friends and family members that the skill will alert if you have an emergency at your home and can't reach your phone.

She is built around your voice, with a built-in smart hub. I liked that option-because it saved me money. You can use her to make your phone calls-which really comes in handy if your hands are full. She can send messages and receive them. Echo can read you your news and check your sports scores.

I haven't fully set it up yet, but I would like the Echo plus to be able to control a Logitech Harmony remote which in turn would control my Fire TV. I have received conflicting reports on this both from Amazon and Logitech. Some say the Echo plus will control the Logitech Harmony.

Previously, we had purchased a pair of Phillip's Hue bulbs and marveled at the idea of telling Alexa to turn lights on and off. After the purchase, we learned that without a Hue Hub, or similar hub (Samsung, Google, etc.) we could not control the lights. NOTE: at that time we had 2 echo dots for both floors. After doing some research, we discovered that the Echo Plus has built in hub features. I was apprehensive, having not tested the use of the Plus and Hue bulbs, however I am happy to say that the two work flawlessly. All the the setup is in the Alexa app, so once downloaded you can search for smart devices and add them to the Echo Plus. Some extra fine tuning and we even have smart phrases and timers for vacation. These are the first steps towards a fully automated home. We look forward to more devices, the Echo Plus has been the perfect anchor for our future smart home.

Small Extras: love the dial on the top for volume. Length of cord is good for most placements, be aware though if you are trying to tuck it away that the plug is proprietary and not a USB plug like the Dot.

We use Amazon music with it which is pretty easy self-explanatory and has a wide variety of options. It's pretty entertaining at times and its good for things like reading audible books, controlling the lights, and telling me the weather in the morning.

A few complaints
1. We have two of these and although they are supposed to work together so only the closest one responds, they would usually both respond. In fact, even if we were across the apartment from one, it was like one would signal the other and they'd both respond. We had to give one a different wake word. Now we run around talking to Alexa, Echo, and Siri when we're home and it gets a little stupid.
2. Fix the volume situation. Add a button or do something. I shouldn't have to spend 45 seconds waking Alexa and requesting incremental adjustments over and over again until it gets to the desired level. Let me give it a percentage or something.
(update: my girlfriend discovered you can tell it to go to volume 1-10 instead of telling it volume up or down over and over again)

The other day she let me know what the warmest part of the day would be so I could walk my dog. I left my phone at work one night so I asked if she could make a phone call. She made several and the conversation through this device was crystal clear. I did not know that this device can make phone calls. It is like having another phone for free in the home. Always great to have a back up. She can also tell you what time it is. She is my alarm in the am and also sets timers for me. My daughter loves this device because she loves music. She will try and does play almost any song you request for free. There are a few that would cost so we just use different options. She can also read your kindle books for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Evon,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2018","I purchased the Echo Plus with the Build-in Hub, so I could have the convenience of asking Alexa to turn my lights and lamps on and off. Philips Hue Light Bulbs were placed in the fixtures that I wanted Alexa to control and they all work great! I already had an Echo Dot in my Kitchen/Den area, so I placed the Echo Plus with Hub in my bedroom. My radio and lamps in my Kitchen and Den are controlled with TP-Link plugs. But, the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my Den and Bedroom have special Philips Hue Light Bulbs that are controlled by the Hub inside the Echo Plus. I am able to play music, set my alarm, get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices. The Echo Dot requires a TP-Link plug to be plugged into it and the Echo Plus requires a special Philips Light Bulbs installed in each light fixture to work.. The only thing I dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work. Regular light bulbs placed in the ceiling light fixtures will not work with Alexa and the Echo Plus with Hub. Other than the high price of the bulbs, I love my Echo Plus with built in hub!",5.0 out of 5 stars
DJD,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2018","Update: I received a reply regarding the message notification informing me that there was a ""Do Not Disturb"" feature I could turn on. So I replied that I'd try it and I'd update my review if it worked. I did find that feature and turn it on, however, I have not had any messages come through during the set times so I haven't been able to test that. Unfortunately, at 5am this morning it sounded an alarm that I did not set, 2 hours before I needed to wake up, and it jolted me out of a deep sleep so I'm updating my review anyway. I have no idea why this alarm sounded, and neither did Alexa - I asked her why and she said she didn't know. I'm still very unhappy with Echo for disturbing my sleep in yet another more egregious way. Perhaps if the Do Not Disturb feature allowed you to also prevent alarms it would be better. I have no intention of abandoning my favorite sleep app that never jolts me out of a deep sleep, but wakes me gently when I'm not in a deep sleep state and therefore I will never want to use Alexa as an alarm so I'd rather just turn it off so I never have to worry about some phantom alarm that I didn't set jolting me awake while I'm in a deep sleep hours before I need to get up, so NO, I will not be adding any stars. I'm tempted to drop my rating even further, but there are a couple things I do like about using Alexa so I can't discount this device altogether. I just wish they'd hire some better engineers and make it smarter. Things I do like are controlling lights and my Nest thermostat. I also like being able to play music but I really wish they'd allow me to put music preferences in my app. I NEVER want to hear Country music - no offense, I just can't stand it - but Alexa seems to ber obsessed with it so I have to be very specific when I tell her what to play. I kid you not, when I asked her to play meditation music the other day, she actually found a GD country station. Ugh. Stupid. Maybe if I lived in an area rife with country music fans it would make some sense, but I live in Los Angeles which isn't exactly a country music haven. Get smarter Alexa, I'm trying to create a smart home and somethings I think you're the dumbest part of that entire idea.

Original review: I’d rate it a 3 or 4 if there was a way to prevent the green light ring message notification from flashing at night during set hours so it didn’t disturb my sleep. I hate that stupid light when I receive a message while in bed. Also, the reasons I’d only give it a 3 or 4 is that it’s not very smart; nor nearly as smart as Siri. It makes really dumb music choices and if I’m not extremely specific it will play country music almost every time I make a request. This must be a bonus for country music lovers but I’m not one of them and Alexa can’t seem to learn what I like. It also won’t play my Apple music choices; I understand why, but that is a disadvantage for Apple users. Those are a few examples but there are more. To get 4-5 stars Amazon needs to do two things: 1) Make a way for people to stop that stupid green light from flashing when they’re in bed and 2) make Alexa smarter and teach her to learn user’s preferences.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Andrew A.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2017","This is a great device that began my path to a smart home. I was able to easily set this up and the philips hue light it came with alongside the tp link power outlet was compatible with this and no hub was required (perhaps due to this device being the only Amazon device with a built in smart-hub)

PROS
-Easy Set-Up
-Compatibility with other devices, doesn't need philips smart bridge for standard dimming light
-Volume can extend to another room easily!
-Now I can watch Amazon Prime Instant Video AND Hulu without my remote cause of this communicating with my Fire TV stick

CONS
-Not all questions will be answered
-Conversations can not have follow up questions like Google Home so conversations don't flow as well in comparison
-Tries to make you sign up for Amazon Music and Amazon Audible and other Amazon services a lot

Final Verdict
If you want to jump into the modern smart home world, this will do the job! Sound is great, can learn skills you give it such as finding your keys (assuming you have the Tile and Tile Skill activated) and is a great device to impress new guests that have never been exposed to Smart Devices",4.0 out of 5 stars
MamaHeini,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2017","I love Amazon Echo and have been a loyal customer since it was first introduced. I quickly interfaced it with my Wink hub to control the lights in my home. The idea of the Echo Plus with its built in hub that would allow me to eliminate the Wink hub was very appealing, so I preordered the Plus when it was first announced. For the most part it works well in controlling my lights, but naming devices has been something of a problem. It lets me use the old names for some devices, but not others. My husband spent some time on the phone with tech support, but they weren't able to resolve the issue. We continue to pick away at renaming devices, sometimes we can do it successfully and other times not. In the meantime we have given the problem devices new names, which I consider a less than satisfactory resolution. I'm confident that we'll eventually get it resolved, but it's frustrating when I use the old name and Alexa tells me ""this device is disabled; please re-enable it to control it."" We haven't figured out yet where or how to re-enable it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
C. Conklin,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2017","So I bought the echo plus with the hue bulb, boy was I disappointed in both my purchase and with Amazon. There was nothing I read that said to make the hue bulb work that you also have buy the hue bridge which is another $59.97 or if you buy it with 2 more bulbs it is $69.97. I had always thought that Amazon was above playing those type of games.

I already had an echo dot and had it synced with my Bose for music and I already have an echo dot in my bedroom. From everything I have read now all I needed to do was buy a hue bridge and sync that with the dot and I would than be able to schedule my lights. Also when I went to sign in to the Hue app it asked me if I wanted to signed in with my google account, WHAT! where did that come from, if I had wanted to signed in with my google account I would have bought Googles version of echo.

Also if you have a Vivint alarm system the echo and echo plus connect in the same way, both echos will only lock your front door.",4.0 out of 5 stars
John F.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2017","I was excited to modernize my house into a smart home, and the Echo Plus seemed like the perfect unit to get me started. It came with a Phillips Hue bulb which was a nice introduction to the process of adding devices. It was also my first introduction to the difference between the Echo Plus' marketed capabilities and the disappointment of those realities, as my unit has never ever (not even once) discovered a new device via verbal request.

Sound quality and volume level is disappointing, and voice recognition was really quite poor. Particularly if there's background noise from the TV or unit itself. Be prepared to give the same instructions repeatedly.

Still, I thought it was functional and dived into creating my smart home. Added a smart thermostat, a dozen smart bulbs (with more to come), smart switches, Cloud Cams (nice units by the way), all carefully selected to be compatible with the Echo Plus' as my hub.

After a few weeks the Echo Plus began ""forgetting"" my routines, losing devices and having increasing difficulty recognizing voice commands for grouped devices. Finally, it began disconnecting from the internet and doing so frequently. Now keep in mind that I have a laptop, tablet, cell phone, thermostat, Echo Dot, security cameras and more all operating perfectly well on my wireless router.

Having exhausted my patience trying to get the Echo Plus to stay online, I emailed Amazon and they responded with instructions to do a factory reset. Seemed reasonable, which is why I had done so myself hours earlier. So I elevated my issue by calling Amazon. Here I must tell you several things. First, you better have several hours to waste on hold and repeatedly trying the same thing over and over and over again as if the hundredth time is magical. The second thing you need to know is that despite all evidence to the contrary (please recall all my devices working perfectly well on my wireless), they will blame your internet service provider, your wireless router, etc.

And finally, you need to know that although you may think you're speaking with the technical department, you're not. It's just someone reading from a script with plenty of time on their hands and no reason not to waste yours. After an hour and a half I was finally transferred to technical.

Fortunately the technical department does not have time to waste repeatedly going through the basic reset process and quickly moved on to full surrender... return and replacement. Now here's the one bit of humor to the process...they were currently experiencing a glitch in their internal return system and could not generate a return authorization and label. So unlike the Marines, they decided to abandon my unit with instructions to dispose as I see fit, and are sending me a replacement.

The replacement arrives in several days. Should be interesting to see if my saga continues.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Kelly,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2018","Love my Echo!!! The built in hub works great and easily connected with the light bulb we purchased with it.

I bought this as a gift for my husband and asked him ""Not sure why you want one but ok"". Now, I'm hooked!!

However, she doesn't seem very ""smart"" when asking her regular Google type questions--she seems to come back with ""I don't know"" type of answers way too often. Ask our phones the same things and it will pull right up. So, some work to do there.

Also some warning that it was having issues would be great. The timer stopped working recently and I didn't know it. I was using it while cooking, so that wasn't good.

Dave,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2018","I put this review as four stars only because there is slight room for improvement on sound, but honestly, I'm nitpicking and this thing is amazing. The built in Zigbee hub was key for me since I run multiple Philips Hue bulbs in the home. This saved the need for a separate Philips Hue bridge for me. Before you ask, ""but doesn't the Hue bridge do more?"" - sure it does. You can probably pick a color with a color wheel as well as have your music drive the light colors. However, for the rest of us who do not need that level of light control (I'm not a DJ!), the Echo Plus gets the job done. There are 20 different colors to choose from including five different whites. Saying, ""Alexa, turn the bulb color red"" works flawlessly and it is awesome that all Hue bulbs, color changing or not, are dimmable by Alexa by saying, ""Alexa, dim the light to 20%"".

The sound is great from this, the home automation works well, and we love having the Echo Plus in the home.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Ghalib Wahidi,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2018","it is a great instrument in regards to smart home and automation. Very good speaker sound quality and its functionality seems to be expanding. It has couple of areas where it can use improvement: customizing its name so that not only can we call it whatever we like, but also reduce the risk of inadvertent activation, conversation recording and sending it to another person without our knowledge. Second, I don't like to ask Alexa to ask another system to do something, such as Alexa ask Bose to play station one etc. It would be nice to say Alexa play music on Bose or whatever system you have. Third, it would be nice if it can be customized to a specific number of voices only. Thank God Alexa is a machine or my four year old would have had it pull all its hair out and run naked across the highway. It is a non stop Alexa do this or Alexa do that.

I love this tech and it can do so many things and it is important to tell Alexa thank you when she gets something right so that she can do it right again. There is so much that Alexa can do and more be developed in skills every day. It would take a book to write about what all she can do for you. Bottom line...I highly recommend.

Why settle for a plane hub, when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet cost's the same or less than other hubs? Oh! And by the way.

James Allen,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2017",I bought my first echo as a “plus” model thinking it would make life easier. After the first unit arrived with a dead speaker Amazon did a great job of having me unit number two within two days. After resetting all the lights for the new Echo Plus hub I started really looking at what the Hue system could do. Why not I had a built in hub right? After reading questions and answers on motion detectors and other accessories besides light bulbs I thought I bought what would be a compatible sensor only to find out that while it is recognized by the Echo Plus hub it cannot be used. No options exist inside the Alexa app to make assignments or change settings to the motion sensors. That’s when I discovered I now need a $50 Hue Bridge to make it all work. So the bottom line is my $149 Echo Plus can be retuned and be replaced with a $79 Echo and a $50 bridge. Saves me $20 in the end. Ignore this one. Get an Echo and a bridge. You need it anyway. I love what the echo can do and Alexa is quite handy. I’m a bit disturbed by the marketing on this one though. If all you want to do is dim lights you will be happy. If you want to actually automate things you will need more equipment. The sound from the Echo vs the Plus is neglible. If I recall the speaker diameter difference is 2/10’s of an inch. I have a second generation Echo as well and I can’t tell much difference in sound quality. It may even be where the units are sitting.,3.0 out of 5 stars

Jugan,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","I am a long time user of Echo and eagerly awaited the successors. The Echo Plus is no such thing.

Please note that many high star reviews are first time echo owners and they don't have the original good unit to compare too. If you are too and reading this, buy the original Echo for around 80$ (not the second gen). If you are a previous echo owner, don't ""upgrade"".

First and foremost, the sound. Despite being touted as having updated speakers and Dolby, it sounds much worse. Volume does not get as high, bass is always too low, and just sounds muffled. If you have a Dot, then it is comparable to sound quality but just louder. My wife asked what was wrong with it (she didn't know it was the Plus). That was one of the main reasons I got the new Echo, an upgrade to the sound.

The speech recognition is about the same. Maybe bit better but I think that's because this Echo does not get as loud and not as much bass interference as the old one.

Connecting smart devices is about as painful as before, just in a new way. It does basic commands and for basic devices. Very limited. You are better off with a hidden, more powerful hub.

Other than that, it looks almost exactly the same as old Echo, and does same things. Connecting my phone via bluetooth was useless. The new power plug in port is not hidden like the original and cord comes out easily.

Overall, I am going to return it. 150$ for a downgrade. It's a shame.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Philip W. Morris,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2017","I had an older echo and the philips hue hub and 7 bulbs. I liked the idea of getting rid of the hue hub and centralize everything into one device, so I bought one. I set it up and asked it to find my devices . . . no joy. After further research, I found that I needed to disassociate each bulb with the Phillips Hub before I could continue. Did that. Still no joy. After even further research, I found that if the previous process didn't work, I had to associate each bulb manually by removing the bulb, recording the 6 character identifier and entering it into the Alexa app. While that worked, it was incredibly inconvenient considering where several of my bulbs were installed.

OK, so now it's finally ready for play. Turns out, the Echo Plus has only the most primitive of control capabilities. I can manually turn on and off or dim a bulb. I can group them and use voice commands. But . . . I lost all of the use of the recipes I've created on IFTTT. I had some recipes to turn lights on at sunset, turn lights off at sunrise, turn lights on when the Ring Doorbell detects motion. All gone. I'm really disappointed as I've come to expect excellence from Amazon's products. Hopefully this will be improved ..... soon.

There IS something called ""Routines"" but it is primitive as well. I can set things to happen at a certain time, but lets say I want the living room lights to come on at 50% at 6:00pm. I cannot select the group called ""Living Room"". I have to select each light bulb individually. Now, as I add new bulbs and add them to groups, I STILL have to find each routine and change it to include the new bulb.

Amazon . . . . I expected better. It's the hope of improvements (and the thought of the frustration required to undo the setup) that prevents me from sending this one back.

Prospective Buyers - If you already have an Echo. Do not buy this. If you don't have an echo, then it may be worth it provided they fix some of the major oversights like Routines / Groups and no IFTTT hub support.",2.0 out of 5 stars
The_dude,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2017","***Preface***
This is the first time I've been really disappointed by an Amazon brand product. Amazon is one of my favorite companies because they provide superior convenience/value to the customer. Their Amazon basic products are great. They have figured out how to walk that line between utility and affordability. While the product experience may not be premium, I always got great value for the money spent.

***Echo Plus Review***
Perhaps I am not their target audience, but I was really underwhelmed. Alexa is one of the dumbest 'smart' devices I have used. She is terrible at answering questions, and often (75% of the time) responds with ""I don't know"". I was disappointed by integration with peripherals such as Philips Hue. From what I have read, it appears that Alexa is connected to Bing, which seems to be part of the issue. Trying to get Alexa to answer from Google requires a bunch of setup, and then I still have to use additional verbal keywords to get it to work - All of this to just query the internet. I could just google on my desktop or laptop anyway. This is the opposite of convenience.

Skills often don't seem that useful. There is no ability to change Alexa's voice to male (according to alexa). I find the sterile voice of Alexa really uncomfortable, which is also one of the reasons I'm not a big Siri fan. On top of this are privacy concerns from having 7 tuned microphones in your room. The audio is fine I guess, but nothing to write home about.

I only found 1 useful thing: Playing NPR. $150 for a glorified radio is really disappointing. Even if this were $75, I would have a hard time justifying the price. I'm not buying hardware, I'm buying Alexa. Alexa is not worth $75 in utility.

***Verdict***
At the end of the day, Amazon does well when they make my life convenient. They are a convenience company - That is their brand. That is why I love them. Alexa is NOT convenient. I will check these products again in 5 years. Perhaps they will have figured out how to translate speech into something actionable AND convenient.

Edit: As an aside, I really enjoyed the material on the bottom of the echo. It provided a quality feeling grip. Also, the volume ring was a good design. The volume ring is a better design than a volume button.",2.0 out of 5 stars
R7177,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2017","I’m really happy with the echo plus. Connecting to smart bulbs was easy and I even connect to TV via the longitude smart hub. The only thing I was a bit confused about is why aren’t all the skills automatically on installed? This would have made it even better. The microphones are good as it can hear me over music playing or people talking. The speaker sound quality is decent; not great. Also, the commands have to be spoken pretty precisely otherwise Alexa will have trouble processing that request. For example, if you name your bedroom lamp a lamp but you say turn on the bedroom light, Alexa will have trouble with it. In addition, a software update needs to enable you to delete old devices. There’s no way to do that now as you can only disable it which also cause Alexa to say “that device is disabled” mistaking it for another device. These are minor issues and can probably be fix with a software update. Overall, I am very happy with Echo plus. I also purchased a Dot for my bedroom.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I spent the next hour deciding where I could best use the Philips hue lightbulb and TP-Link plug I purchased with the Echo Plus on cyber Monday. After the initial set up of the above mentioned accessories, the time to play with said accessories was about to begin.

Now, If you haven't tried your hand at smart home automation, there is a bit of an expense that will be required to start. You can buy a wide variety of smart home hubs here on Amazon, but I would suggest you buy the Echo Plus. With the Philips hub built in, its the best price IMO. Once you have decided which you'll be purchasing, you'll then need to purchase the required accessories. Again, Amazon has plenty to chose from.

Lynette R.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2018","I like most that I didn't order it and when I called Amazon to tell them they delivered a package to the wrong address, i was told to throw it away or keep it, so I didn't have to pay for it ... so my question is, why do I keep getting emails telling me all the things Alexa can do and asking me to post a review? The package had a different name and address than mine, it was delivered to a ""wrong adress/addressee"", but Amazon keeps contacting me like I ordered, paid for and received this gadget. I don't for one second think this was a mistake. The addressee's last name is Aue!!! Never in my life have I met a person with all vowels for a last name! We do really like the Echo Plus, it's great in the kitchen when you're cooking because she can do lots of things by voice command that you would usually have to wash and dry your hands before you could do the same thing on your tablet or phone. Music is great, if you have Prime you dont need any other streming service, and its commercial free.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Homer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2018","I'm a huge fan of the echo. Every morning I get to hear the weather, the news, and my historical fact of the day.

This one came with a lightbulb that was ready to be hooked up to the hub. It's very convenient to turn the light on and off with a voice command. The brightness of the light is also controllable.

The hookup was easy and its use was simple to figure out.

The only negative is that if there is any other noise in the room sometimes Alexa will not respond. If the air conditioner is somewhat louder than normal, I have to get closer to the echo in order to make it work. Not a major inconvenience but if you want to turn the light on, you literally have to walk close to the device to turn on the light. If you're using this as a hub for voice commands, you will have to keep it close to where you are in order for it to be able to instantly recognize and respond.",5.0 out of 5 stars
MariMor,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2018","I had been the last holdout of all of my friends when it came to purchasing an Echo because I didn't feel its functionality was initially worth it, after all I have a spotify account that connects to wireless speakers, my friends' echos always understand the men better than the women so why have something that doesn't understand me, etc. However, I'd been planning to purchase a philips hue system and when the alexa plus came out, the advertisement that a bridge isn't needed finally made it worthwhile.

However, my impression since receiving this in July 2018 and finally setting it up a month or so later: she's a disappointment. The speakers of this 1st generation echo plus are WORSE than the original Echo. She still doesn't always understand me. She loses connectivity to the dot half the time. And then there is the final and biggest disappointment: I STILL have to purchase a Hue bridge because while you can turn the lights on/off, you can't access the color wheel or create scenes through the Plus.

I suppose I should have been more cynical about what Amazon said and checked with Philips that the Plus really did replace a bridge vs just taking on a functionality I could easily set up with the existing app. Sadly, I was out of the return window by the time I tried it out and since Amazon upgraded the device, I imagine they won't let me replace it in case i just received a lemon with lower grade speakers.",3.0 out of 5 stars
N. J. Schreiber,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2017","So I had bot the Echo and teh Google Home and really liked both of them. Ultimately I kept the Google Home for 2 reasons.

1) Echo will not do multiple accounts with Spotify. It will only connect to the Main Spotify account owner and any family members are out of luck. Any play list being played is from the Main Spotify account. You can;t even set up the family members. Also with multiple Echo users you have to say switch account to ""so and so"" but it still uses a shared calendar, list etc. Google Home can recognize up to 6 different users just by voice and will use that persons calendar , list or yes---- SPOTIFY! You don;t even have to say switch accounts.

2) Echo will not grab or play anything from YouTube.

Also I tried various questions on both Echo and Google Home - Echo was stumped way more than Goggle Home and Google home had more variety and funnier replies when I would ask goofy things just to see what would happen

Both device are great tech but the mentioned issues were deal-breakers for me. So now I have a house full of Google Home devices and speakers so by the time the amazon echo addresses the issue sit will be too late because I will be so deep in the Google Home ecosystem. Kind of a bad play on Amazon's part because I bought the Echo first and had the new Dots on pre-order - they had me but lost me.",3.0 out of 5 stars
hfa8592,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2018","Great device. Love the functionality and the fact that it has a built in hub. I am slowly upgrading many of the components in my home to smart devices and this will serve as the hub for those devices.

The one complaint I have is that I have this and several Echo Dots and they are set up to play music as a group. I can play music on just one of them, or on all of them at the same time throughout the house. The Dots are connected by bluetooth to better speakers. If I ask Echo to play music on just one of the Dots connected by bluetooth to better speakers, the music will play through the bluetooth connection. If I ask Echo to play music through the group, it will only play the music through the built in speakers in the Echo Plus and Dots which are pretty low fidelity.

If I fire up my iPad and look at the settings of each of the Echo devices, they still show active bluetooth connections, they just won't play the music through them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Larry Tiggis,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2018","We are a long time Amazon Prime family, many years, but new to the Alexa world and thought the purchase of Alexa Plus, with hub, and included Phillips Hue light bulb would be a great start. Alexa does a lot of good things for us like Alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my Sirrius/xm account. Good daily stuff. Good sound, but not Bose. But, the ads say ""Hub included"" so don't need anything else to operate devices. Well, not so. I understand there will be some differences in product device support. The fact that it came with the Hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. The bulb is capable of so much more with the Hue App but the Hue app does not recognize Alexa hub as a bridge. So, it appears you do have to get a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. That can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. The list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge. Was very disappointed to find that out after the fact, to the point I feel we are being misled by Amazon by included the Hue bulbs without explanation. Maybe throw a good discount my way to get the Hue bridge if I keep the Echo Plus before I invest in more light bulbs.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I am 75 and got it so my dog would have distracting noise when I am not home.
I am computer literate, iTunes literate, Amazon literate, as well as countless other programs, but am apparently a dunce when it comes to talking to Alexa. I think I heard her sigh in exasperation.

I tried to create a playlist of songs I like only to have it ignored. I am learning workarounds but they are mediocre, at best...and, as yet do not include a personal playlist.

I have scoured the beginners section but the beginners it addresses are far more advanced in basic Alexa than am I.
So far, I like what I have been able to use but I'd like it a lot more if I could configure it to my needs, rather than accepting the Amazon/Alexa default.

Bobbi Halvorsen,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2018","I have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a Philip Hue bulb. The excited ended quickly. I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus. Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message. I tried to set this up over and over and over again. I watched YouTube videos. I read set up websites. I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).

The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support. I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error. Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work. This product has tested my patience. So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.

The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb. The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device.

I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo? The support person had the same thought. Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub. It looks like a defuser.

I can't believe I didn't find YouTube videos that show the problems I did. Everything looked simple and seamless...NOT the experience I had. OK, I'm done with this review because I spend enough wasted time this weekend already.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2018","Sound quality is good for music, that's about it. Smart home functionality is worthless. I invested in smart bulbs for the entire house (mix of Phillips Hue and Cree), set up groups for every room, etc. Everything worked great for a few days. Then bulbs would randomly stop working, giving a ""device is unresponsive"" error in the app and a ""device with that name was not found"" error from Alexa. Echo devices will randomly show a red a ring and not respond to any commands a couple times a day. Group and device names stop working requiring me to re-learn every device with a new a name, create new groups with different names, etc. The two lights in my baby's room were originally grouped as ""Kristine's room"". They stopped working one day saying there was no group or device with that name. So I forgot all devices, reset them all, relearned and renamed them as ""baby's room"" which worked for a couple days, now neither of those group names will work and the group is called ""room 3"" which is just frustrating. After a couple hours on the phone with Echo support, they had me running around the house unplugging every echo in every room, then running around holding each action button, then running around resetting all the lights individually, nothing fixed the issue. Their response was that I needed to purchase a Zigbee hub and download the Zigbee app on my phone to control everything. The only reason I purchased this Echo Plus was because it has a built in Zigbee hub so I would not need a bunch of external hubs and multiple apps to run everything. I refuse to purchase another hub, etc. So now I just deal with it, running around the house every couple days spending an hour or two resetting each and every bulb, relearning them all, re grouping them all and testing them. It is much more of a hassle then anything, but I spent so much money on all the Echo devices and bulbs that I refuse to just let them not work.",2.0 out of 5 stars
LasVegasReader,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","I wanted another Echo with built in speaker because one of my Echo dots has trouble maintaining a connection with Amazon's own Bluetooth speaker. I like the volume ring (the new regular Echo does not have it), so I decided to try the new Echo Plus with built in Zigbee hub and a bonus Phillips Hue bulb. I thought it might be nice to experiment with home automation, for basically the same price as I paid for my original Echo. The result is underwhelming. Setup was extremely easy. The new Echo sounds just like the old one. But not discernably better. I can indeed control the Phillips bulb with Alexa. However, this control is limited to ""on"", ""off"", and dimming. This is fun for a minute. then you realize that the bulb can ONLY be controlled by voice or app. If it is turned off by switch, it's off until switched on again by hand. I realized that I'll rarely if ever use it. Also, I had expected a more robust set of controls, like timers that would work just like Alexa 's alarms (""Alexa, turn on my bedside lamp every weekday at 7am""). It seems natural. But alas, no. The new Echo is fine, but i realize now that I'm not really into voice control. If i could do more with true automation and the app, i might be back for more.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I was excited about the echo plus because it seemed to eliminate the need for additional hubs-the middle man between Alexa and smart devices. I felt like I did a lot of research before buying this echo and before buying my smart home devices but apparently I didn’t read the fine print. In the description of the Echo Plus it says that it is compatible with all ZigBee devices and there is a hot link which takes you what I would assume were these ZigBee compatible devices. I bought a Schlage lock and some light switches that were listed on this page but much to my dismay my Echo Plus could NOT discover them no matter what I did. Then I dug deeper into the Alexa app-specifically the skills page and found out that the lock and light switches were in fact NOT compatible with this hub and required a separate $85 smart things hub. I was very disappointed and felt misled by the initial link to supposedly compatible devices. There is no point in paying the extra money for the PLUS if you are going to need to buy a separate hub anyway. I will likely return mine and just get a standard Echo.,3.0 out of 5 stars
Lewie,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2018","It has trouble understanding words compared to other voice operated systems. I changed the wake word to “computer” to avoid tv adverts and web videos from doing silly things, but it often activates as I train my dog to “come here” everyday. Even with voice training, it’s difficult for it to recognize who is speaking. It fails to understand relationships like “call my brother” or “who is my sister”. I’m often asking it to do things and surprised at its inability to understand the context. Turn on the lights “many devices share that name”. Turn on all lights. “No device by that name”. Computer end program. “No program by that name”. To me, this is a very limited system. You can not customize the wake word other than choosing from three options. You can not choose it’s voice, or the chimes for when it is activated. I can live with it, but in its current state, I find it frustrating having to rephrase what I’m asking five times before it is able to comply. My phone is much easier to speak to with custom voices and portable. Currently I use this to operate lights and listen to music.

I asked her to announce that dinner was ready, thinking it wouldn't work, but it did! The only thing I really wish she would do is Google things for me, and link with my chosen music service that isn't Pandora, Spotify, or Amazon.

John F.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2017","I was excited to modernize my house into a smart home, and the Echo Plus seemed like the perfect unit to get me started. It came with a Phillips Hue bulb which was a nice introduction to the process of adding devices. It was also my first introduction to the difference between the Echo Plus' marketed capabilities and the disappointment of those realities, as my unit has never ever (not even once) discovered a new device via verbal request.

Sound quality and volume level is disappointing, and voice recognition was really quite poor. Particularly if there's background noise from the TV or unit itself. Be prepared to give the same instructions repeatedly.

Still, I thought it was functional and dived into creating my smart home. Added a smart thermostat, a dozen smart bulbs (with more to come), smart switches, Cloud Cams (nice units by the way), all carefully selected to be compatible with the Echo Plus' as my hub.

After a few weeks the Echo Plus began ""forgetting"" my routines, losing devices and having increasing difficulty recognizing voice commands for grouped devices. Finally, it began disconnecting from the internet and doing so frequently. Now keep in mind that I have a laptop, tablet, cell phone, thermostat, Echo Dot, security cameras and more all operating perfectly well on my wireless router.

Having exhausted my patience trying to get the Echo Plus to stay online, I emailed Amazon and they responded with instructions to do a factory reset. Seemed reasonable, which is why I had done so myself hours earlier. So I elevated my issue by calling Amazon. Here I must tell you several things. First, you better have several hours to waste on hold and repeatedly trying the same thing over and over and over again as if the hundredth time is magical. The second thing you need to know is that despite all evidence to the contrary (please recall all my devices working perfectly well on my wireless), they will blame your internet service provider, your wireless router, etc.

And finally, you need to know that although you may think you're speaking with the technical department, you're not. It's just someone reading from a script with plenty of time on their hands and no reason not to waste yours. After an hour and a half I was finally transferred to technical.

Fortunately the technical department does not have time to waste repeatedly going through the basic reset process and quickly moved on to full surrender... return and replacement. Now here's the one bit of humor to the process...they were currently experiencing a glitch in their internal return system and could not generate a return authorization and label. So unlike the Marines, they decided to abandon my unit with instructions to dispose as I see fit, and are sending me a replacement.

The replacement arrives in several days. Should be interesting to see if my saga continues.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Jugan,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","I am a long time user of Echo and eagerly awaited the successors. The Echo Plus is no such thing.

Please note that many high star reviews are first time echo owners and they don't have the original good unit to compare too. If you are too and reading this, buy the original Echo for around 80$ (not the second gen). If you are a previous echo owner, don't ""upgrade"".

First and foremost, the sound. Despite being touted as having updated speakers and Dolby, it sounds much worse. Volume does not get as high, bass is always too low, and just sounds muffled. If you have a Dot, then it is comparable to sound quality but just louder. My wife asked what was wrong with it (she didn't know it was the Plus). That was one of the main reasons I got the new Echo, an upgrade to the sound.

The speech recognition is about the same. Maybe bit better but I think that's because this Echo does not get as loud and not as much bass interference as the old one.

Connecting smart devices is about as painful as before, just in a new way. It does basic commands and for basic devices. Very limited. You are better off with a hidden, more powerful hub.

Other than that, it looks almost exactly the same as old Echo, and does same things. Connecting my phone via bluetooth was useless. The new power plug in port is not hidden like the original and cord comes out easily.

The device will randomly reset itself to the second lowest volume setting. I will increase the volume, and it will increase for a while, but then will inevitably reset itself to volume level 2. This happens at least daily, sometimes multiple times a day.

This started about 2 months ago. I tried factory resetting it, and when that didn't work I called Amazon expecting them to help me through this. They originally told me that this was a mass issue they were experiencing with this generation of the echo plus, and that I would be added to their mass trouble ticket and given a call back to follow up. I never got a call back; three weeks later, I called to follow up.

The second time I talked with Amazon, they said there was no mass ticket/issue, and they had no idea what I was talking about. Then they told me that because it was out of warranty I was SOL, even though this is clearly an issue with the device's hardware or software. There's no way I could be at fault for this issue; this is clearly a product issue. But because it's ""out of warranty"", I'm screwed. The rep even went so far as to say they couldn't be sure this type of issue wasn't my fault; how on earth could this be my fault? The best they can do is offer me a 15% discount to buy another echo device....that I'm now sure will just break down as soon as it's out of warranty.

This is the first time I've truly been disappointed in Amazon's customer service. I expected that these devices would last for longer than 1 year and a half........ I'm extremely frustrated that Amazon is not standing by their own products, but instead is putting the customer on the hook for what is clearly a product malfunction.",1.0 out of 5 stars
James,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2019","Decent sound, or more matter of fact it is loud enough. However, Alexa is very frustrating as it seems to become dumb and dumber as time passes. Initially, it understood everything I said and I never had to repeat myself. Then gradually it became stupid and required being asked simple questions multiple times. I know I am not the only one who experienced this. Then you have to worry about it starting up on its own and going crazy like talking to its self and answering questions you didn't ask. In fact, sometimes without even saying a word it will ""hear"" something and start talking. If that is not bad enough, Amazon has hired people to listen in on your conversation remotely. They also have provided access to these workers with your GPS coordinates, which can map out your exact location and address. Disappointed.

UPDATE 05/09/2019

After posting this negative review Amazon customer service emailed me with a cookie cutter template for how to operate and adjust settings on Alexa and other irrelevant information that I already understand how to do.

I did not ask to be contacted by their support with a generic email insulting my intelligence of how to use their product. No apology or even acknowledgement that people are listening to your conversations (that unassumingly have had no criminal background checks performed on them) and are not only privy to your conversations, but also have access to data revealing your physical location and ultimately your identity, which can pose plenty of security and safety issues.

I guess I am to blame for letting them into my home, however it was never disclosed that my conversations were going to be eavesdropped in by god knows who. Shame on you Amazon. How to avoid apologizing for an inappropriate action? Never admit that there was ever an indiscretion to apologize for. Bravo to your PR department! Job well done!",1.0 out of 5 stars

Bcapollo,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2019","I bought this during Cyber Monday sale as a hub for a few smart devices we have. At first it was a point of amusement and for music it works OK as long as your puffing on the Amazon streaming crack pipe with unlimited access. If you have 10,000 MP3 files that you simply want to access through another player or even Amazon Music player you are not so great. Alexa will be more than happy to offer you an Amazon alternative rather than looking in the library. Hooking into smart devices is very cumbersome and long winded to get the specifics to address third party devices like a NEXX garage door opener. There doesnt seem to be a way to just say open garage. There should be a front end where you set all of the device verbal address context. Lastly, Alexa logic isn't that smart and not getting any smarter as it fails most of the time replying with an indicator that It doesn't know that yet. Yet... like it will learn the answer someday. Thinking we were asking unreasonable, or context challenging requests, we started comparing Alexa against Siri and Google by asking our Apple and Android devices the same questions in exact same context. Google seemed to provide the most accurate and comprehensive answers with Siri not far behind. Sadly, Alexa doesnt compare. For its dependency and favoring of Amazon we feel that Amazon is benefiting much more than we do from this purchase, therefor it should be FREE.

It would electrically power itself off after 10-15 seconds or had to constantly touch Action button to wake it up to make it respond. Tried different outlets thinking bad outlet. Called Amazon, connected to tech support. Went thru the troubleshooting motions. They agreed something wrong said to return it for repair and wouldn't replace because it was over 30 days since I purchased it. They returned it 2 weeks later said they reloaded software-all is good. Re-set it up...surprise!...nothing changed. Still powers itself off completely..have to unplug/replug in power adapter off and on... When it stays powered up... which is iffy...you have to press Action button for it to respond otherwise goes to sleep. Left it plugged in for several days without fooling with it. It now fires up in the middle of the night to play Bob Seger music without being asked. By the way, our house is dark and quiet at night, so nothing to trigger this piece of junk.

So far, I have been very disappointed with the new model. On the new model, it has struggled with basic commands that the old model has no problems running. At first, I thought I got a defective model so I returned it and got a new one shipped to me. The new one arrived and it has the same learning disabilities. It just doesn't work. I have to disable a skill and then re-enable the skill to work. I have to do this every day. I have followed the steps provided by support but it still fails.

I run the ambient noise app at night for sleep sounds, it always turns off after 1 hour even after setting a longer sleep timer or even when I tell the Alexa to turn the loop on. The Loop on should run until I tell Alexa to stop. She acknowledges the command and says she will remember it for next time. NOPE. She fails. At this moment, I would recommend buying the previous model refurbished.

I keep finding failures in the operation of this device. It is frustrating. So what improvements did Amazon make in the new model? They have taken a fine product and made worse. They took my Ferrari and made it a Honda Civic missing a muffler.",1.0 out of 5 stars

She added the Supercook skill, which she likes on her laptop, but on the Echo Plus - she kept getting a request from Alexa for her 6 digit code. Now, you must obtain and use a 6 digit code in the beginning to link your Supercook to the Echo Plus - but the code is only good for approximately 5 minutes! Thereafter, it should not be necessary. Everytime she tried to access Supercook she was asked for the code (over several days after giving the code for the initial link). She also had several lists kept on the Echo Plus, but when she would ask what was on her list for say Thursday - Alexa would answer by reading off the lists, but not what was on them.

The device has proved to be a complete failure in my opinion. Amazon totally dropped the ball in improving the sound from the speaker, if anything it is inferior to the first generation.

Also I bought it for the timers which I thought would be great to help me do work, but you can't pause these or resume them.

In the past, this has happened and I only need to delete the devices and re-register them again using their serial numbers. This time, that didn't work. The customer service agent asked me to install the Phillips Hue application, register them there and then link it to Alexa. I have a mix of older ZigBee only and Bluetooth bulbs. Only the Bluetooth ones are working; for the rest, Amazon's customer services says I have to buy a Phillips Hue Bridge.

The Echo Plus technical specifications say that it comes with built-in ZigBee connectivity. Is the latest software updated broken, or have the Amazon + Phillips engineers decided to stop supporting the standard? Anyone else having this issue?",1.0 out of 5 stars

Alligator Dave,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2018","I'll be returning it. It's been nothing but annoying. The hub can't be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my Hue Bridge. I can't even install Philips lights with it unless I unplug it to do so. There are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues. Bottom line is it sucks as a hub. It doesn't support z-wave and zigbee (which in fairness I knew in advance), but when the one protocol it does support doesn't do many functions that a dedicated one will, what's the point? I noticed right away that my Philips Hue Bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this doesn't. I found that rather interesting.",1.0 out of 5 stars

T. L. Flannery,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","I decided to upgrade tom the new Echo Plus. I am returning it. the inclusion of the hub saves nothing in setup and doesn't work as well as the original. My smart devices are two Wemo plugs, A Harmony Elite Hub, and three first gen Phillips hue Color BR30 bulbs and a first gen hub. After receiving the Echo Plus I followed the initial directions for connecting the New Echo hub to my lights. It would not recognize them. Spent 1 hour trying all sorts of thing with no luck. I then spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support. After being passed to 4 different people, still no connection to the bulbs. Spent another hour putting the system back to original functionality. Decided to send it back.

After a couple of days of research, I found that the Alexa web app cannot configure Hue lights that have been previously hooked to a hub. Buried in the phone app there is a way to reset the lights to the factory settings. I decided to try and configure the Echo Plus again. after obtaining the light serial number, I finally got the Echo to find the lights. But here is the rub, you cannot configure the lights with scenes, you can only ask it to color the lights to a set choice of colors. There is no way in the app to set the lights to a specific custom color and intensity. This is less functionality than I had with the original echo and the Phillips hub.. The commands are also more verbose. You have to say ""Alexa set the color of the fireplace to blue"". With the Phillips hub and IFTTT you say "" Alexa trigger Ocean"" or whatever scene with the custom color/intensity combination you have created.

For me the new Echo Plus was not and upgrade to my current smarthome configuration. The setup was more complicated, and not as versatile as the original, and the tech support people have no clue about the proper steps for configuration to even get the less funtional system to work. The inability of the app to create scenes and allow custom light colors and intensities is a signigicant flaw. I had enabled the Hue app hoping it would get the scenes from my hue account but without the hub connected, the app does nothing. As a result, I am returning the Echo Plus and staying with my original Echo and two Echo Dots.",2.0 out of 5 stars
DJD,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2018","Update: I received a reply regarding the message notification informing me that there was a ""Do Not Disturb"" feature I could turn on. So I replied that I'd try it and I'd update my review if it worked. I did find that feature and turn it on, however, I have not had any messages come through during the set times so I haven't been able to test that. Unfortunately, at 5am this morning it sounded an alarm that I did not set, 2 hours before I needed to wake up, and it jolted me out of a deep sleep so I'm updating my review anyway. I have no idea why this alarm sounded, and neither did Alexa - I asked her why and she said she didn't know. I'm still very unhappy with Echo for disturbing my sleep in yet another more egregious way. Perhaps if the Do Not Disturb feature allowed you to also prevent alarms it would be better. I have no intention of abandoning my favorite sleep app that never jolts me out of a deep sleep, but wakes me gently when I'm not in a deep sleep state and therefore I will never want to use Alexa as an alarm so I'd rather just turn it off so I never have to worry about some phantom alarm that I didn't set jolting me awake while I'm in a deep sleep hours before I need to get up, so NO, I will not be adding any stars. I'm tempted to drop my rating even further, but there are a couple things I do like about using Alexa so I can't discount this device altogether. I just wish they'd hire some better engineers and make it smarter. Things I do like are controlling lights and my Nest thermostat. I also like being able to play music but I really wish they'd allow me to put music preferences in my app. I NEVER want to hear Country music - no offense, I just can't stand it - but Alexa seems to ber obsessed with it so I have to be very specific when I tell her what to play. I kid you not, when I asked her to play meditation music the other day, she actually found a GD country station. Ugh. Stupid. Maybe if I lived in an area rife with country music fans it would make some sense, but I live in Los Angeles which isn't exactly a country music haven. Get smarter Alexa, I'm trying to create a smart home and somethings I think you're the dumbest part of that entire idea.

Original review: I’d rate it a 3 or 4 if there was a way to prevent the green light ring message notification from flashing at night during set hours so it didn’t disturb my sleep. I hate that stupid light when I receive a message while in bed. Also, the reasons I’d only give it a 3 or 4 is that it’s not very smart; nor nearly as smart as Siri. It makes really dumb music choices and if I’m not extremely specific it will play country music almost every time I make a request. This must be a bonus for country music lovers but I’m not one of them and Alexa can’t seem to learn what I like. It also won’t play my Apple music choices; I understand why, but that is a disadvantage for Apple users. Those are a few examples but there are more. To get 4-5 stars Amazon needs to do two things: 1) Make a way for people to stop that stupid green light from flashing when they’re in bed and 2) make Alexa smarter and teach her to learn user’s preferences.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Philip W. Morris,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2017","I had an older echo and the philips hue hub and 7 bulbs. I liked the idea of getting rid of the hue hub and centralize everything into one device, so I bought one. I set it up and asked it to find my devices . . . no joy. After further research, I found that I needed to disassociate each bulb with the Phillips Hub before I could continue. Did that. Still no joy. After even further research, I found that if the previous process didn't work, I had to associate each bulb manually by removing the bulb, recording the 6 character identifier and entering it into the Alexa app. While that worked, it was incredibly inconvenient considering where several of my bulbs were installed.

OK, so now it's finally ready for play. Turns out, the Echo Plus has only the most primitive of control capabilities. I can manually turn on and off or dim a bulb. I can group them and use voice commands. But . . . I lost all of the use of the recipes I've created on IFTTT. I had some recipes to turn lights on at sunset, turn lights off at sunrise, turn lights on when the Ring Doorbell detects motion. All gone. I'm really disappointed as I've come to expect excellence from Amazon's products. Hopefully this will be improved ..... soon.

There IS something called ""Routines"" but it is primitive as well. I can set things to happen at a certain time, but lets say I want the living room lights to come on at 50% at 6:00pm. I cannot select the group called ""Living Room"". I have to select each light bulb individually. Now, as I add new bulbs and add them to groups, I STILL have to find each routine and change it to include the new bulb.

Amazon . . . . I expected better. It's the hope of improvements (and the thought of the frustration required to undo the setup) that prevents me from sending this one back.

Prospective Buyers - If you already have an Echo. Do not buy this. If you don't have an echo, then it may be worth it provided they fix some of the major oversights like Routines / Groups and no IFTTT hub support.",2.0 out of 5 stars
The_dude,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2017","***Preface***
This is the first time I've been really disappointed by an Amazon brand product. Amazon is one of my favorite companies because they provide superior convenience/value to the customer. Their Amazon basic products are great. They have figured out how to walk that line between utility and affordability. While the product experience may not be premium, I always got great value for the money spent.

***Echo Plus Review***
Perhaps I am not their target audience, but I was really underwhelmed. Alexa is one of the dumbest 'smart' devices I have used. She is terrible at answering questions, and often (75% of the time) responds with ""I don't know"". I was disappointed by integration with peripherals such as Philips Hue. From what I have read, it appears that Alexa is connected to Bing, which seems to be part of the issue. Trying to get Alexa to answer from Google requires a bunch of setup, and then I still have to use additional verbal keywords to get it to work - All of this to just query the internet. I could just google on my desktop or laptop anyway. This is the opposite of convenience.

Skills often don't seem that useful. There is no ability to change Alexa's voice to male (according to alexa). I find the sterile voice of Alexa really uncomfortable, which is also one of the reasons I'm not a big Siri fan. On top of this are privacy concerns from having 7 tuned microphones in your room. The audio is fine I guess, but nothing to write home about.

I only found 1 useful thing: Playing NPR. $150 for a glorified radio is really disappointing. Even if this were $75, I would have a hard time justifying the price. I'm not buying hardware, I'm buying Alexa. Alexa is not worth $75 in utility.

***Verdict***
At the end of the day, Amazon does well when they make my life convenient. They are a convenience company - That is their brand. That is why I love them. Alexa is NOT convenient. I will check these products again in 5 years. Perhaps they will have figured out how to translate speech into something actionable AND convenient.

Edit: As an aside, I really enjoyed the material on the bottom of the echo. It provided a quality feeling grip. Also, the volume ring was a good design. The volume ring is a better design than a volume button.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Bobbi Halvorsen,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2018","I have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a Philip Hue bulb. The excited ended quickly. I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus. Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message. I tried to set this up over and over and over again. I watched YouTube videos. I read set up websites. I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).

The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support. I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error. Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work. This product has tested my patience. So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.

The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb. The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device.

I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo? The support person had the same thought. Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub. It looks like a defuser.

I can't believe I didn't find YouTube videos that show the problems I did. Everything looked simple and seamless...NOT the experience I had. OK, I'm done with this review because I spend enough wasted time this weekend already.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2018","Sound quality is good for music, that's about it. Smart home functionality is worthless. I invested in smart bulbs for the entire house (mix of Phillips Hue and Cree), set up groups for every room, etc. Everything worked great for a few days. Then bulbs would randomly stop working, giving a ""device is unresponsive"" error in the app and a ""device with that name was not found"" error from Alexa. Echo devices will randomly show a red a ring and not respond to any commands a couple times a day. Group and device names stop working requiring me to re-learn every device with a new a name, create new groups with different names, etc. The two lights in my baby's room were originally grouped as ""Kristine's room"". They stopped working one day saying there was no group or device with that name. So I forgot all devices, reset them all, relearned and renamed them as ""baby's room"" which worked for a couple days, now neither of those group names will work and the group is called ""room 3"" which is just frustrating. After a couple hours on the phone with Echo support, they had me running around the house unplugging every echo in every room, then running around holding each action button, then running around resetting all the lights individually, nothing fixed the issue. Their response was that I needed to purchase a Zigbee hub and download the Zigbee app on my phone to control everything. The only reason I purchased this Echo Plus was because it has a built in Zigbee hub so I would not need a bunch of external hubs and multiple apps to run everything. I refuse to purchase another hub, etc. So now I just deal with it, running around the house every couple days spending an hour or two resetting each and every bulb, relearning them all, re grouping them all and testing them. It is much more of a hassle then anything, but I spent so much money on all the Echo devices and bulbs that I refuse to just let them not work.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Joshua Nightingale,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2017","I ordered the Echo Plus thinking it would be great. Not sure if its where I have it positioned in my house or if it has to do with my Internet connection but most times Alexa does not hear me or misunderstands what I am saying. I noticed the light ring at the top points at a different side of the room then it should so maybe it is hearing echos from the walls? I think the light should point in the direction of the voice speaking as a way of it picking between two people talking at once. If this is the case it does not work right. A lot of times we will be playing a Skill called ""Song Quiz"" and she will just close the game down without notice. She closes other games as well. I set an alarm last night to get me up for work and it was loud enough to wake me up; however, Alexa would not respond to my commands while the alarm was going off so I could not turn it off. I had to unplug it to get it to stop and in doing so had to go through the setup process again to get it to connect to the cloud again.I love the hardware but something isn't right with it, I assume its defective but unsure.

Somebody,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2022","I chose this Echo based on its physical design -- thinking it would be as great as the original (not Plus) tower design I bought in 2015. Not even close! Alex sounds muffled. I tried different volume settings but nothing helped. My order history shows me as having purchased an Echo Plus late last year, but the photo shows this tower design and that's not what I bought. I bought the round Echo Dot 3rd or 4th generation which was as lousy as the one shown here. I returned that one, too -- same reason. I've had problems with the Flex, too. Not because it's muffled, but because it doesn't always respond to the wake word.

If you're shopping for an Echo, I recommend the Echo Show (easy to find in various sizes and generations) and the 1st gen of the Echo (first one ever sold...but that may be impossible to find). I search for it every once in a while and never get that one in my search results except for a page that shows it either missing (goes to an Oops page) or not available.",2.0 out of 5 stars
tinker bell,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2017","I purchased two Echo plus and one Echo Dot within the last month. Several days ago all Echo devices started to have a problem simultaneously: Alexa announces a new reminder (that was placed in the last several days) FOUR times (normally twice). I spent over an hour with two customer service people both of whom had no idea how to fix the problem. One of whom apparently did not know what a reminder tab of the Alexa desktop app looks like. The other started to Google the problem although I had told her I Googled it myself already before contacting Amazon. Since both of them were clueless as to how to approach the issue, I asked to speak with a more knowledgeable tech support rep but they denied my request.

Since this is clearly a software issue affecting all of my Echo devices under a single Alexa account, I prefer not to factory reset all devices (I have many routines set up and smart devices connected) and frankly I do not believe that will solve the problem. For now I tell Alexa to “stop” before she repeats the announcement four times. In the meantime, I hope that Amazon will fix this type of software bug as soon as it arises and offer more knowledgeable tech support people to customers.

mejon,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2018","I was disappointed in that although the Echo could connect with all of my smart home devices, it only controls some of the features and not all of them. For instance, I could turn my Arlo Q camera on and off, but could not control its schedule. I had to use the native app for significant control functions. My goal was to get Alexis to delay arming the camera for say 1/2 hour when I stayed up late and the camera was scheduled to turn on at a certain time at night. I spent hours trying to get it to work. In addition, Alexis can handle simple questions, but way too many times it couldn't give me an answer. Developers should figure out a way to send related web pages to your phone when a simple answer is not possible. Google Assistant on my phone does this when a verbal response is not possible. By the way, I returned the Echo Plus and bought a Google Home device, and had the same problem with smart devices, and in particular my Arlo Q camera. I also returned the Google Home. Control of smart home just isn't there yet, as far as I am concerned. It is too difficult for the casual buyer to configure all but the most simplest things.

It is not the best sounding speaker but it does what it is intended to do. The commands get recognized almost all of the time. The commands are kind of limited but it will do. The one major problem I have with it, hence why I gave it two stars, is that it does not connect to the lightbulb that came with the echo! I have tried using the command, the app and even typing the serial number of the lightbulb and nothing. I have read other people's reviews and its the same thing.

You need to download install a 3rd party app for Which you must register to have and use to set up and Alexa then tries to inter face with the Very glitchy and unreliable KASA app interface. I recommend NOT buying this product unless Amazon fixes the Alexa plus hub software so that it interfaces directly with the smart plug with no glitchy 3rd party hub or app needed. I can also say Alexa + won’t control Philips HUE bulbs without the Philips hub and 3rd party app either. Very disappointed with echo plus. Does not work as advertised.

You can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors. You also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for me.

Do not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new IoT devices. If you do, you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub, which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointless.

Brendan,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2018","The echo itself is solid, has good sound, etc. But I really feel like I wasted my money.

Sure, you can have Alexa turn your light on, but it doesn't have all the functionality the Phillips hub has. Therefore you really have to buy the Phillips hub to appreciate the full capability of the Phillips smart line.

RPL,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","If you already have an Echo, I'm not sure there much, or any reason to upgrade to this new echo. First, for those people buying this Echo in order to get rid of your current hubs, that may or may not be possible. If you have a Hue hub, this Echo Plus is not a direct replacement for it. In addition to bulbs, the Hue hub supports motion sensors, dimmer switches, and tap switches. It also supports Apple Homekit. If you deregister your Hue peripherals from the Hue hub, and try and connect them to the Echo Plus, while the bulbs will connect, the motion sensors and dimmer switches will not. Also, you will lose Apple Homekit support. You will also lose all the automations the Hue hub supports like sunrise to sunset and other automation. Also, if your internet goes out, your Hue hub will continue to work and you will be able to control your lights with the Hue app. If your internet goes out, the Echo Plus will not be able to control your lights by voice, or the Alexa app. Lastly, all the 3rd party Hue apps are designed to work with the Hue bridge, not the Echo Plus. So, those apps will also not work.

If your current hub is Z-Wave, then the Echo Plus will also not be a direct replacement for it. You will need to keep that hub as well the Echo Plus does not have a Z-Wave radio in it. If you want to do simple things like turn a ZigBee bulb on and off, and dim it, then the Echo Plus works fine. If you want to do more complicated scenarios, then you will need to keep, or buy a another hub. Since Zigbee is the only protocol that is supported at this time, you need to look for light bulbs, and some other peripherals, that use that protocol in order for it work with the Echo Plus. But with that said, there will be some devices that use Zigbee that will still need their manufactures hub to work. So, again, it will not be as simple as looking for a ZigBee device and expecting it work with the Echo Plus. Since there is currently no supported list of devices, trial and error is going to be your best bet in trying to figure out which ZigBee devices work with the Echo Plus and which do not.

As for sound, that part if more subjective. I like a little more base in my music. The Echo Plus sacrifices bass for treble in this new design. So, to me, it does not sound as great as the previous Echo. To me, it sounds a little flat. My old Echo sounds much richer and fuller than the Plus. So, if you like your music with more bass, then you might be disappointed here as well.

Apart from the above, the Echo Plus does everything the old Echo does, so I'm not going to repeat everything here as you can read about those features in reviews of the last generation Echo. The microphones on the Echo Plus seems more sensitive to the previous generation though. It appears to be able to hear me more, even when the music is turned out loud. Where the old Echo had issues doing that. Also, the Plus has a 3.5 mm audio jack. Therefore, you can more easily connect it to your stereo, external speakers, etc. with a wire, if Bluetooth is not an option.

So, all in all, the Echo Plus is good device, but I don't think it's that much better than the previous generation to warrant an upgrade. If an upgrade is wanted, then depending on you hub needs, the smaller newer Echo might be the better choice. If you are new to the smart home arena, then try and figure out what you want your smart home to do, then pick the best system(s) that get you want you want. Don't assume the Echo Plus will solve all your smart home needs.",3.0 out of 5 stars

ArizonaGuy,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2018","Five Amazon devices increasingly have problems

I am a 77 year old senior citizen with some disabilities that make it important that I be able to control plugs by voice with my Amazon units.
Three echo devices and two dots have become more and more unreliable. I believe the basic problem is that Amazon has sold so many units that its computers can no longer properly interface with the devices. One of the echo devices is a basic echo, two of the echoes are echo plus units purchased in December 2017, the two echo dots were purchased November 2017, and the basic Amazon echo was purchased July 2017. I have the Alexa app on two android phones. One of the phones is several months old, with the app having been updated relatively recently. The other phone is two days old, and the app was installed on it within the last 48 hours.

Examples of problems

1. Devices are no longer compatible with TP-link Kasa plugs. Yesterday morning the plugs were working fine. Then as the day went on the Alexa devices became unable to control first one of the plugs, then two of the plugs, etc. until it could control none of them.
Here is an example of what happens when I try to turn on a light in my spare bedroom with a voice command. All five of the Alexa devices give the following message:
“Sorry something is wrong. To control the spare bedroom light, try disabling the skill and then re-enabling it from your Alexa app.” Disabling the skill and re-enabling it does not fix the problem. I have the Alexa app on two different android phones.

On both android phones the Alexa app for the nonworking plugs shows a message “Skill is unresponsive.”

If I attempt to manually turn a plug on or off in the Alexa app, the plug does not go on or off. All that happens on either phone is it I get a message stating that the skill is unresponsive. However, if I go into the Kasa app, I can manually turn the plugs on and off–showing that they are connected to the Wi-Fi network. I tried deleting this skill for one of the plugs and then attempted to re-create the skill. The Amazon app was unable to find the Kasa plug.

I spent a long time today on the phone with an Amazon representative who was unable to fix the problem and is escalating it. He said that someone will call me sometime.

There is no doubt in my mind that the problem lies with Amazon. The Alexa app on two different phones states that skills for the Kasa plugs are unresponsive. I spoke with the technician at Kasa who said the problem is with Amazon.

2. Several months ago all of my echo devices began to occasionally respond to a voice command with a statement such as “I’m having trouble understanding right now, please try again later.” If I repeatedly gave the command, eventually the echo device would understand. I sort of felt like I was trying to make a phone call to a very busy line in which the only way to get through was to repeatedly retry.
3. Accuracy of response by all units has declined. Despite my having trained the units to recognize my voice, they increasingly do not properly understand. Sometimes they reply that “I don’t know that one.” Sometimes they state, “I’m not sure” sometimes they carry out an action that I did not ask for–in other words they respond to a command with an incorrect action.

The basic fact is that five different devices purchased at different times are becoming increasingly unreliable and unusable. Another basic fact is that I was unable to get through to a higher level technician and was told that someone would call me sometime. Amazon should stop selling these devices and work on fixing their computers.

After posting the above review, I tried a chat with Amazon and sent this entire review along with a strong request to speak to a supervisor. I was connected finally with a person who helped me restore all of the skills for the tp-link Kasa plugs. There is still the less pressing problem of all of the devices having increasing problems with recognizing commands correctly. The various echo devices are a great idea, but there are still problems I think with the Amazon computers and their interface with such devices.",3.0 out of 5 stars
R. V. Downing,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2018","I decided to go on a limb and buy and Echo Plus as a way to conveniently play Amazon Music around the house. Previously I had to boot a device or the Smart TV and deal with sometimes complex prompts. The Echo Plus made this process a dream. From the moment I walk in the door I can just tell Alexa to “Play Pandora” or “Play Midland Burn Out.” I can also adjust the volume, skip track, check traffic, pause the music, hear the Dodgers scores, or order a Lyft. All hands free. The sound quality on this device is also quite superb as I can hear it with excellent quality in the room and fair quality in adjacent rooms. I was so pleased with how the device was performing as intended, I quickly decided to investigate some additional perks. Namely, multi room music, the function where with multiple Echo devices, you should be able to simultaneously play music. A network of speakers armed with Alexa sounded great so I ordered an Echo and an Echo Dot to supplement.

This is where things start to fall apart. The initial setup for individual devices is fairly easy. And they all work independently just fine. It’s when I try to group them to play music that they inexplicably can’t be grouped. When I choose the Plus for a group of speakers, the Echo becomes unreachable. And vice versa. One of the main perks of springing the extra dough for the Plus was for this capability and it doesn’t work. Amazon tech support is non-existent as Google is littered with this problem and no solution. The best I could figure is that the Echo is on a firmware version incompatible with the other two. But since there is no way to force your Echo devices to update, it means I have speakers that don’t work until Amazon says so.

Finally, the device is convenient but in no way secure. And I mean in no way secure. Alexa responds to everyone’s voice and there is no option to lock the device like you might your phone. That means anyone in speaking distance can order your Alexa and Amazon account to do all those great things I mentioned earlier. There are no passwords, pins, or voice recognition. Nothing. The Echo Plus can also be controlled and configured by anyone with a smart phone close enough to press the Action Button on top of it. You’d think the device configuration might be guarded via a password or PIN in the Alexa app but that does not appear to be the case either. I’m reasonably okay with these security vulnerabilities since I live alone and rarely have guests. However, if I still had Airbnb guests, roommates, or regular visitors, I would be extremely nervous about leaving these things around. Which is unfortunate since the speaker functionality is nice but you don’t exactly want to share power over all of Amazon to anyone who listens to your speakers.

The bottom line is that the speakers work great to play music in a single room and it can potentially simplify many things that you might’ve previous had to pull up the Google for but the implementation is unpolished at best and the security implementations are non-existent. And non-existent to a point where Amazon was really just being lazy. Even a 4 digit code or pass phrase option could be a crude yet simple way to guard against unauthorized purchases and yet they are absent.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Dan the Man,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2018","The Echo Plus is an awesome piece of equipment, I absolutely love it!

However, Amazon is PURPOSELY vague/deceptive on the capability of their equipment/software. For example, the site specifically states the hub is a ZigBee hub, yet it DOES NOT specifically state the hub is NOT AT ALL compatible with Z-Wave. This is fully deceptive marketing, just state what your product CAN NOT DO!!!!!!!!!!!

Also, Z-WAVE device advertisements on Amazon flat out state they are fully compatible with Alexa, this is FLAT OUT FALSE, and I consider this to be and industry wide marketing LIE!!!!!!! You CAN NOT connect Z-WAVE devices to this hub, no matter what you read, Amazon will not tell you this unless you buy the hub, connect it, trouble shoot, give up and call them. Then they say ""oh... looks like the hub is NOT compatible with you Z-WAVE devices, we can allow you to return all the Z-Wave equipment so you can buy more expensive ZigBee products (which probably contain Chinese hack Software). Rediclous, just be HONEST and tell your customers what your device can an can not do, otherwise you are a bunch of big fat ADVERTISING LIARS.

With that said, to connect Z-WAVE to the Alexa hub, you have to buy a separate Z-WAVE hub, something their tech support will not tell you. Oh, also, don't trust the FAQ's/help page on the App, they suggest it is simple and you just find you device and the hub (which everyone thinks they just bought a hub because they have the echo plus) but it is %100 WRONG. You will not know the GE Z-Wave instructions are flat out FALSE until you talk to customer service and they act like you should have known you need a different hub.

One other thing that is irritating is that you have to wipe Amazon devices back to factory just to update your WiFi password. If you follow the instructions, it will say this is a last resort. WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!!! Not only is this wrong, but I had to teach Amazon that you have to reset their equipment not once, but twice to get it to work. Then I had to do the full setup again. To be fair, this applies to their devices which have screens.

The last comment I have is the Alexa App, it has to be the least professional App, least intuitive App, most difficult App on the planet. It is a TURD. Why do you not have the same capability on the App within no screen devices for devices which have screens? Basically you can not control/setup screen devices using the app. THIS IS JUST STUPID!!!!!

Advise to Amazon:.

Why ruin such an amazing product by supplying a crappy user interface and false/deceptive advertising? Especially the crappy home automation directions, and hub connections? When you read these instructions, they are FULLY deceptive.",3.0 out of 5 stars
BearsIn3D,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2017","I really did like my echo plus at first but after really playing around with it I didn't notice any real differences from the echo dot's we already have. We now have 2 dot's with the vaux speaker addons and this echo plus. We are relatively new smart home device users and only have the hue bulb that came with the echo and we didn't have any issues setting up the bulb and have been really enjoying it honestly. At first my girlfriend was very skeptical of this whole system and I was as well, we are the people who have siri completely disabled on all of our devices, iphones, ipads, apple watches, macs etc we turn it all off. So far ""echo"" (we don't care to call it a human name we find that weird so we changed it to echo because that's what it's real name is and it's less weird to us) has been really good at hearing us from across rooms or while playing music, the echo plus really doesn't seem that it's that much better in terms of audio quality or voice recognition when compared to the echo dot with the vaux speaker ($84.99 bundled fyi versus $149.99) and the echo plus also has no portability where the echo dot with the vaux speaker can be unplugged and used for 6 hours on a rechargeable battery. The bass from the echo plus itself is better than the dot with the vaux speaker but the treble isn't that much clearer to me to be honest. I have also heard there is alot of compatibility issues with the echo plus and that it isn't really a ""smart hub"" like it's advertised to be which really is misleading about the product itself....

Overall I really do like all of our echo's I just feel that amazon dropped the ball on the development of the echo plus, I would've even paid a little more for a better more premium product that really is what they made it sound to be but honestly if you don't need the mediocre smart hub on the plus you could save alot of money just buying the dot with vaux speaker ($84.99) or just the new echo ($99.99), my girlfriend and I are now not really uncomfortable buying more smart home products because we don't know what really works with the new echo plus and what doesn't...

*Also* If you have spotify premium family subscription you and another family member can't play music in different rooms at the same time on different accounts which is really annoying because we both have different tastes in music and want to play our own music when we are in the living room, cooking, relaxing in the bedroom...etc, kind of a let down honestly, maybe there is a way to do it but the Alexa app is not a good app so far and is not very easy to use whatsoever it feels very ""third party"" if you know what I mean...",3.0 out of 5 stars
MG in NY,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2018","Let me edit this review and say that -- after 2 1/2 HOURS on the phone and several additional days of back and forth, Amazon did ultimately replace this defective Echo.

I'll also say that I have several Echos and I like them quite a bit. And let me also say as a bona fide tech geek that even great equipment can have individual defective units.

So, it's not the device that's my problem. My problem is that the first level of tech support are not only poorly trained but have no authority to resolve the issue. Was on the phone for more than TWO HOURS with a tech. I've deleted the absurd convo but suffice it to say it was embarrassing. He didn't seem to understand that the Plus even has a Hub, nor what a Hub does in relation to the normal Echo capabilities. Consequently, he couldn't grasp how the Echo could be working but the Hub not. Nor that light bulbs cannot work without a hub of some kind. Nor that you can't ""reset"" a light bulb other then by turning it on and off.

It was ultimately escalated and the unit replaced. But the process was ridiculous for a device of this cost.

Compare this experience with Apple. I had a pair of Beat Headphones that cost more than twice the price of the Echo. I'll spare the boring technical problem but it had to do with not being able to reset them to resolve a connectivity issue. I got to the Apple store and, as these things sometimes go, I couldn't actually replicate the problem -- they were temporarily working fine. The response of Apple was, ""yeah, don't worry about it, we are aware that this is an issue from time to time. So let us just swap you out for a new pair.""

THAT'S how customer service works.

Original review:

Let me begin by saying that I've been a huge fan of Amazon, a shareholder and a Prime Member for as long as I can remember. This is my THIRD Echo device and I had no problems with the prior ones. So I would think they would jump to make me happy on this one. First the device had problems responding, would say it lost the internet connection despite the fact that the other two Echos worked fine. Then the hub could no longer find the smart devices that it had been connected to and worked fine with for two months. I assumed the tech team would jump to make this right. I was on the phone for MORE THAN TWO HOURS with people who seemed to know much less about Amazon's devices than I do but didn't seem to have the authority to replace an $88 device. What follows is the THIRD support conversation. You'll see it's pretty incredible.",3.0 out of 5 stars
FazMan,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2018","I have been an Echo owner since day one. I've also had the Philips Hue lighting system. - Previous to upgrading to the Echo Plus, I controlled all lights through the Philips Hue App. One main function I used was to be able to turn on and off certain lights based on Sunset (Dusk) or Sunrise (Dawn). - I control several lights in this manner. - When the Echo Plus with built in hub was announced, I contacted Amazon by phone to speak with tech support to ask weather or not the Echo Plus will work with Philips Hue Lights (Which they said it did) and if I would be able to turn lights on and off based on sunset, etc. - I was told that it would. So when I had heard this, I ordered the Echo Plus which would arrive in 2 days. Meanwhile, I had someone from out of state over and they wanted my Gen 1 Echo. I gave it to them, along with the bridge. I figured I could live without Alexa for a few days. - After receiving the echo plus, I had the task of setting up all my Philips Hue bulbs with the new hub built in to the Echo Plus. After some doing, all of them were now on the new hub and functioning properly. - I then went to set up Routines for my lights to basically set schedules, etc. Low and behold, that is when I found out the ability to do what I want is not available. - My only choice is to turn a light on or off based on time. - As we all know, The time the sun sets varies every day. So the on;y choice is to go in and modify routines manually every week or two. Not quite the Smarthome I was looking for. Look, I get that the product was brand new and it needed some tweaking, etc. - My issue is that most updates we see for Alexa are things that have nothing to do with smarthomes. Do I really care to hear a (bad) jike from Alexa? Do I careto hear her sing? I for one do not. If you were to ask Alexa what time the sun sets, you will get a correct answer. So I know the ability is there and is a simple modification to Routines. - The unit sounds great, looks very cool and is built very well. Just wish Amazon would concentrate more on the ""Smarthome"" portion of the Echo Plus.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Christopher,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2017","I actually really like the concept of the product. It is fun just to play around with, but difficult to operate, which I'll go into detail about later. The built-in hub isn't necessary, unless you plan on buying one smart light bulb are a time because the packs come with a hub free (an echo dot is sufficient and cheaper). The speaker quality is great for music and can be increased fairly loud without distortion.

Now for the difficulty with operating. For starters, your echo doesn't have many bells and whistles prepackaged. You have to search skills, which are kind of like apps or lessons to teach Alexa. There are many different skills you can teach Alexa, so make sure you have time to look through them. Now you've taught Alexa skills, but for every skill you must remember how to communicate exactly as instructed on the skill page or Alexa will not understand (e.g. ""Alexa, tell <skill name> to perform such and such task). If you don't remember the phrases to get Alexa to perform the skill you can always look through your app and under skills to find directions. Who will remember all the specific wording for each skill? Plus, the whole point in speaking to Alexa is that it's hands-free, so looking at the app for directions isn't convenient. It gets very frustrating if you don't have the Alexa app handy. Next, if you plan on controlling plugs or lights with Alexa you have to download apps from the manufacturer. Your now cluttered phone is even more cluttered and you don't speak the same language as Alexa. She also has difficulty understanding a lot of questions and you have to rephrase them several times for her to give you any answer.

I love, love, love the functions I can remember the wording for Alexa to perform the task. There are so many things Alexa can do that listing them would make this review entirely too long. I will list my favorites and most useful to me.
Turns on lights or plugs. Groups lights, traffic report, weather, and many other functions together to be performed with one command (e.g. ""Alexa, good morning""). Orders pizza. Tells jokes. Gives answers to questions you have. Controls TV. Sends messages and makes calls. Adds things to grocery lists. Sets reminders so you won't forget things. Adds appointments to your phone or email linked calendar. Helps kids with homework. Plays games for adults and kids.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Jim,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2017","This is my first foray into the Amazon ecosystem. I wanted to get my feet wet with some smart home capabilities and was interested in using the Echo Plus as a hub. This device can be really easy to setup BUT it may drive you crazy first. I ordered the device on my account and it came registered to my account and Amazon profile. My wife is the official Prime member. During the initial setup process the Echo switched to her profile unknowingly to me. Thus, as I added smart devices to the Alexa app and was able to control the via the app, Alexa via voice control through the Echo Plus could not discover any new devices. I called Amazon for help after several hours troubleshooting myself. The support person was useless going through a script trying things I had already done such as rebooting. I gave up with this person and worked several more hours on my own. The next day I was ready to send the Echo Plus back but first I thought I would call Amazon support and try again.

This time the support person was much better. We worked for about 30 minutes before discovering by accident that the Echo was not set to my profile! Thus, here is the warning, the Echo Plus has user profiles and you must be using the same profile in use on Echo Plus and your Alexa app! Duh! Just ask Alexa, who’s profile or account is this? Then the setup was extremely easy.

I have read reviews complaining about the sound. However, I have been very pleased with the quality of the sound. It not a sound system bout for one speaker it does a great job.

In terms of controlling smart devices, Alexa works very well and is integrated with many of the devices I already had in use. My biggest problem is remembering what each light is named.

Finally, the Amazon profiles are problematic. My wife and I have to continually switch back and forth between profiles to listen to music or control devices. Yes, we have set up a family profile but that doesn’t resolve this issue of using a specific profile for a particular purpose.",3.0 out of 5 stars

In my mind you have my geographic coordinates and my time zone either of these things should have been very easy and included but neither are. as for the sound it is far superior to the older units, and this brings up another issue we use the everywhere feature to play the same station or stream through out the house and if you are playing music its ok but if you put on talk radio and you find your ears between 2 units as you walk from room to room you get a horribly annoying echo where they are a couple milliseconds out of sink. before someone comes back and starts blaming my WIFI NO ITS NOT we just had a brand new commercial wifi and network management system installed just like they use in hospitals and office buildings its all Ubiquiti Unifi and there are AC 1200 in room access points in 7 of the 11 rooms in my house and an outdoor unit with an antenna array designed to cover the entire 6 acres of our property, that being said I got my first unit several years ago and have been adding to them over time and they have made some great improvements and many steps backwards teach iteration of updates seems to fix a few quirks and create a few, My most current complaint is how often they light up and start listening when the wake word nor anything like it has been spoken and I changed the wake word to the less likely one so I don't understand why I might be sitting in a room reading a book and the thing will light up and listen when nothing has been said, and when you do talk to it especially the dots you have to speak in a loud tone to get them to trigger.

I get so frustrated with my Alexa devices because they will only do what I ask them to do about 40% of the time! Those cute little TV ads that give cute little nonchalant commands to Alexa are so misleading as the devices do not work like that in the real world! Unless you know exactly what to say to make a Skill work...Alexa will not find the skill or recognize your command...or worse, she will ignore you! And yes, Alexa even plays a specific sound to tell you she is ignoring you! I have spent countless hours researching and working with the devices to improve their learning curve but find it too frustrating and time-consuming to figure out what the Echo wants to hear to function properly! I have resorted to writing down and memorizing the exact statements they want to hear in order to get my devices to actually do what I want them to do. Right now I have a 6-page list laying beside the device reminding me what I have to say to make each skill work on Echo! On the positive side, I have really enjoyed having the Smart Home devices that Echo pairs with....my Smart Plugs and Sensi Thermostat. Having Alexa turn on my upstairs lights before I get upstairs, make coffee for me before I go to the Kitchen, and turn my Thermostat up to warm my house while I am still in bed has been wonderful! I also love the Alexa My Buddy Skill that allows you to set up 5 friends and family members that the skill will alert if you have an emergency at your home and can't reach your phone. It will email, text and call those on your list and alert them to check on you. Although I am disappointed and frustrated with my Echo Plus and Dot most of the time.....

James Allen,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2017",I bought my first echo as a “plus” model thinking it would make life easier. After the first unit arrived with a dead speaker Amazon did a great job of having me unit number two within two days. After resetting all the lights for the new Echo Plus hub I started really looking at what the Hue system could do. Why not I had a built in hub right? After reading questions and answers on motion detectors and other accessories besides light bulbs I thought I bought what would be a compatible sensor only to find out that while it is recognized by the Echo Plus hub it cannot be used. No options exist inside the Alexa app to make assignments or change settings to the motion sensors. That’s when I discovered I now need a $50 Hue Bridge to make it all work. So the bottom line is my $149 Echo Plus can be retuned and be replaced with a $79 Echo and a $50 bridge. Saves me $20 in the end. Ignore this one. Get an Echo and a bridge. You need it anyway. I love what the echo can do and Alexa is quite handy. I’m a bit disturbed by the marketing on this one though. If all you want to do is dim lights you will be happy. If you want to actually automate things you will need more equipment. The sound from the Echo vs the Plus is neglible. If I recall the speaker diameter difference is 2/10’s of an inch. I have a second generation Echo as well and I can’t tell much difference in sound quality. It may even be where the units are sitting.,3.0 out of 5 stars
MariMor,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2018","I had been the last holdout of all of my friends when it came to purchasing an Echo because I didn't feel its functionality was initially worth it, after all I have a spotify account that connects to wireless speakers, my friends' echos always understand the men better than the women so why have something that doesn't understand me, etc. However, I'd been planning to purchase a philips hue system and when the alexa plus came out, the advertisement that a bridge isn't needed finally made it worthwhile.

However, my impression since receiving this in July 2018 and finally setting it up a month or so later: she's a disappointment. The speakers of this 1st generation echo plus are WORSE than the original Echo. She still doesn't always understand me. She loses connectivity to the dot half the time. And then there is the final and biggest disappointment: I STILL have to purchase a Hue bridge because while you can turn the lights on/off, you can't access the color wheel or create scenes through the Plus.

I suppose I should have been more cynical about what Amazon said and checked with Philips that the Plus really did replace a bridge vs just taking on a functionality I could easily set up with the existing app. Sadly, I was out of the return window by the time I tried it out and since Amazon upgraded the device, I imagine they won't let me replace it in case i just received a lemon with lower grade speakers.",3.0 out of 5 stars
N. J. Schreiber,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2017","So I had bot the Echo and teh Google Home and really liked both of them. Ultimately I kept the Google Home for 2 reasons.

1) Echo will not do multiple accounts with Spotify. It will only connect to the Main Spotify account owner and any family members are out of luck. Any play list being played is from the Main Spotify account. You can;t even set up the family members. Also with multiple Echo users you have to say switch account to ""so and so"" but it still uses a shared calendar, list etc. Google Home can recognize up to 6 different users just by voice and will use that persons calendar , list or yes---- SPOTIFY! You don;t even have to say switch accounts.

2) Echo will not grab or play anything from YouTube.

Also I tried various questions on both Echo and Google Home - Echo was stumped way more than Goggle Home and Google home had more variety and funnier replies when I would ask goofy things just to see what would happen

Both device are great tech but the mentioned issues were deal-breakers for me. So now I have a house full of Google Home devices and speakers so by the time the amazon echo addresses the issue sit will be too late because I will be so deep in the Google Home ecosystem.

Larry Tiggis,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2018","We are a long time Amazon Prime family, many years, but new to the Alexa world and thought the purchase of Alexa Plus, with hub, and included Phillips Hue light bulb would be a great start. Alexa does a lot of good things for us like Alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my Sirrius/xm account. Good daily stuff. Good sound, but not Bose. But, the ads say ""Hub included"" so don't need anything else to operate devices. Well, not so. I understand there will be some differences in product device support. The fact that it came with the Hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. The bulb is capable of so much more with the Hue App but the Hue app does not recognize Alexa hub as a bridge. So, it appears you do have to get a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. That can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. The list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge. Was very disappointed to find that out after the fact, to the point I feel we are being misled by Amazon by included the Hue bulbs without explanation.

I thought it might be nice to experiment with home automation, for basically the same price as I paid for my original Echo. The result is underwhelming. Setup was extremely easy. The new Echo sounds just like the old one. But not discernably better. I can indeed control the Phillips bulb with Alexa. However, this control is limited to ""on"", ""off"", and dimming. This is fun for a minute. then you realize that the bulb can ONLY be controlled by voice or app. If it is turned off by switch, it's off until switched on again by hand. I realized that I'll rarely if ever use it. Also, I had expected a more robust set of controls, like timers that would work just like Alexa 's alarms (""Alexa, turn on my bedside lamp every weekday at 7am""). It seems natural. But alas, no.

I felt like I did a lot of research before buying this echo and before buying my smart home devices but apparently I didn’t read the fine print. In the description of the Echo Plus it says that it is compatible with all ZigBee devices and there is a hot link which takes you what I would assume were these ZigBee compatible devices. I bought a Schlage lock and some light switches that were listed on this page but much to my dismay my Echo Plus could NOT discover them no matter what I did. Then I dug deeper into the Alexa app-specifically the skills page and found out that the lock and light switches were in fact NOT compatible with this hub and required a separate $85 smart things hub. I was very disappointed and felt misled by the initial link to supposedly compatible devices. There is no point in paying the extra money for the PLUS if you are going to need to buy a separate hub anyway. I will likely return mine and just get a standard Echo.,3.0 out of 5 stars
Lewie,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2018","It has trouble understanding words compared to other voice operated systems. I changed the wake word to “computer” to avoid tv adverts and web videos from doing silly things, but it often activates as I train my dog to “come here” everyday. Even with voice training, it’s difficult for it to recognize who is speaking. It fails to understand relationships like “call my brother” or “who is my sister”. I’m often asking it to do things and surprised at its inability to understand the context. Turn on the lights “many devices share that name”. Turn on all lights. “No device by that name”. Computer end program. “No program by that name”. To me, this is a very limited system. You can not customize the wake word other than choosing from three options. You can not choose it’s voice, or the chimes for when it is activated. I can live with it, but in its current state, I find it frustrating having to rephrase what I’m asking five times before it is able to comply. My phone is much easier to speak to with custom voices and portable. Currently I use this to operate lights and listen to music. It’s unable to detect color lightbulbs without a bridge, but it can detect regular ones just fine. People like playing with it at parties. In a house, you’ll probably need to expand with a few dots in rooms that you often hang out in.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Cantrip,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2017","It is 11-06-2017. I Love my gen 1 Alexa. I have been using it every day since release. I have an Alexa gen1 & gen 2 in a group. One in each living room downstairs. My Alexa is playing in groups without me telling it the group name. it won't play on a single echo, it just defaults to group play. I have to unplug the echo plus to rest it. Then it works fine for a short while. Then it just starts defaulting to group play. Very frustrating. I hope they fix all these bugs because I love my Alexa. I use it every day, primarily for music. I just want to be able to use group when I say the group name. Once I activate the group name it won't ungroup unless I unplug it to reset it. Echo Gen 1 gets 5 stars. I'm holding out hope for the Echo Plus.
UPDATE:11-8-2017
Alexa plus won't play spotify. I tell Alexa plus to play spotify. Alexa plus says playing spotify and nothing happens. I Walk into the the other Room and tell Alexa 1st Gen to play spotify and spotify starts playing. This is consistently happening. Please Amazon fix these bugs. This Eco plus is consistently giving me problems whereas the 1st generation Alexa doesn't give me problems at all.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2017","The Echo Plus sounds pretty good, though it doesn't seem to have the same audio punch as the original Echo. The tweeter is smaller and it doesn't have bass assist like the original, and the person at Customer Service that I spoke with was pretty clueless and never gave me a satisfactory answer as to why it would sound better.

But ultimately, my biggest disappointment is that all the ads pushed it as having a built in hub, so I bought it to replace my Wink Hub, to try and simplify. But once I disconnected the Wink Hub, the Echo Plus did not recognize any of my light bulbs or my Emerson thermostat, even though they were supposedly compatible. So I had to reconnect my Wink Hub, and the Echo Plus doesn't seem to provide any more functionality than the original Echo. If it is not going to act as an independent hub that can work with all the compatible components, don't mislead the customers.

If I had to do it over again, I would just have bought another original Echo, and skipped the Echo Plus. The inability of the Echo to act as a true hub is a deal breaker.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Oscar Treviño,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2018","I return to put my review because amazon did not allow me to put it in Spanish (it seems discriminatory, but I'll put it in English)

The speaker leaves much to be desired, it is supposed to come with an integrated bridge so you do not have to buy it separately and although it detects the smart devices, if you do not buy the bridges of each device you will not be able to make use of the maximum of its functionalities. The instructions that you have to give are highly specific unlike Google home that you understand faster.

language? Not to mention, only understand English, I think they should expand quickly to other languages such as Spanish if they do not want Google to win the Latino market.

the calls are of poor quality, the person I call them does not recognize my voice or fully understand what I say.

When I ask for a song from Spotify, I do not always understand the song I want it to play.

there is a news app in Spanish but alexa reads them and reads them really badly, they should include some direct telemundo platform or something like that.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Nianya,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2017","I purchased this item along with several Echo dots to connect around our house. After using them for several weeks, I have noted that Alexa does not give full answers to many questions. If you ask about a particular topic, she will find a Wikipedia or other response but only speak the first couple of lines which do not answer the question. She can find a recipe but not email it to you.

Alexa also has difficulty answering many questions. She will just respond with ""I'm sorry, I don't know that."" If I have to google the answer there is no point in asking the question.

Music streaming sound on this speaker and the dots is awesome, however, the Echo and dots will suddenly stop in the middle of an album. If you ask Alexa why she will apologize and tell you to report it on the Alexa app. Also she cannot find many of the albums that I know are available on unlimited Amazon Music because I stream them on my phone.

These are amazing speakers but the Alexa technology needs more training. I look forward to software updates.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Gary Hartner,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2018","I have a love/hate relationship with this product, for instance:
I asked it ""Who wrote Murders in the Rue Morgue"" It replied, ""Edgar Allan Poe, Gaston Leroux, Christopher Wieling. The last two were screen writers. It took the info from Wikipedia. I'm glad that I'm not a school student.

Timers work intermittently. (I reported this previously) At times I try to set a timer e.g. ""Set timer for 10 Minutes"" Echo response: ""Ten minutes starting now"" But the timer doesn't work. If I check the Echo app online, it doesn't show a timer requested.

I cannot set a reminder for a time/day more than 24 hours in the future.

I have not figured how to put hub enabled lights on a schedule, for instance ""Turn first light on at 8PM today, and off at 7AM tomorrow"" or even better ""Turn first light on every day at 8 PM and turn off every day at 7AM. This may be possible, but I have not found a way to do it.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Because I'm VERY new to this, MAYBE some of these features are already built in, and I have not found a way to those features, but being able to see what is available to watch on my fios TV based on my location and past TV preferences would be nice, being able to add to my amazon wish list via echo and have echo read out a list content would also be nice. Less strict wording of common commands needs to be added.. ie: I like sitting in the den with ""colorloop"" running on my colored HUE bulbs. Generally it takes me 4-5 tries to get ""colorloop"" running via echo. I go through this every night. I thought Alexa got smarter as time went on. Being able to set a reminder or timer to other or ALL devices or dots would be nice so I can move around the house and still get reminded.

We asked Alexa what she was designed to do a woman on the team would say assist; Alexa said I don't know. I wanted to wake up to music, but no way to program. When told to shut down it is still on sometimes it goes off and at other times it doesnt.Alexa does not change voices that would have been fun.

I've since had to purchase a Hue Hub separately in order to get my devices to work 'correctly' I love all the Echo devices in general, but Amazon needs to send their Echo Plus back to the drawing board to make it actually work, and enhance it be able to actually be useful. I also had to buy a different Bridge, A Smart Things Bridge, because the Echo Plus is only for ZigBee L (light) or something? I don't remember, I don't care any more.

After debating between the Philips Hue bridge and the Echo Plus, I got this primarily to set up my Philips Hue smart bulbs in my house. As it turns out, the Echo Plus indeed serves as a bridge for the bulbs, but then that's it. It doesn't do anything else besides that. You can dim, turn off and on etc using Alexa, but nothing more. So now I have to go back and buy the Philips Hue bridge in addition to this if I want to be able to control the color of my lights, automation, and such. That's my only disappointment. I thought it was going to function fully as the Hue Bridge does. Otherwise, it was a great purchase. The one thing I love about the device is the quality of the sound.

MELVYN K BRAY,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2018","I wasn't aware that it would interfere with my wifi and many additional units would count individually against the wifi max units. I was surprised to learn that I didn't need another hub to operate white lights, e.g. hue from Phillips. Speaking in the words Alexa understands is sometimes problematic as she does not respond as expected. I am still learning how to coordinate functions with Alexa. A simple task, such as acting like a timer for a light to turn on and off is far more difficult than I was prepared for and as of now still not accomplished because there are no examples to follow for that setup. Using it as a countdown timer works very well. Addons will come slower than I anticipated now. I also was not aware that Alexa only updates its information yearly while others update much more frequently.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Darin B,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2017","I really enjoy the Echo Plus. It's nice having a home hub and the echo in one device. This is my first foray into smart home equipment. The only thing I don't like about this, is that even the smart home connection stuff (on the same WiFi network) has to go through the internet, and then back to your house.
My internet went out the other night, no big deal I thought. ""Alexa, turn off the living room lights."" nothing happens. Usually not a big deal, but I have some Christmas lights hooked up to it as well with the switch in a high, hidden spot. Just frustrating that being a ""hub"" it still has to communicate to the smart devices via the internet. If the WiFi is still running, but the internet is down, it shouldn't stop your connected devices to your ""hub.""",3.0 out of 5 stars
LKLD,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2017","I've only had it a little more than 2 weeks, so take that into consideration.

What it does well, is help automate your home, with it's built in hub. I've added bulbs and a led light strip, so far, and it's done it's job flawlessly. I do plan to continue adding on with a thermostat and security cameras.

What it doesn't do well is answering questions. Approximately 60% of the time, Alexa doesn't understand the question. Which really means she doesn't have an answer. While watching the Bucs/Dolphins game on tv, I asked Alexa for the score, she told me they play next week. They had a scheduled bye this week,but hurricane Irma took that away week one.

Arbitrary questions don't get answered very often, specific business, weather, sports questions are generally answered.

B. Clark,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2017","First time echo owner... have been a bit underwhelmed at this point. It is difficult to find compatible smart home devices and even when you do, setting them up can be quirky. It says that it has Bluetooth capability, yet apparently I cannot connect to GE Bluetooth smart home devices without an Avi-on ""remote access bridge"". So, what is the point of the Bluetooth capability? Just to connect your phone and use it as a speaker? Also, with no support for z-wave, I'll have to keep my hub for those devices as well.

David E. Solie,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2018",I bought this because it had a controller hub. It is confusing to figure what the controller controls. I feel like I've been had. I was looking to have a music / talk radio source for a kitchen area. It serves that purpose well. I also want to control some light switches. It's confusing what the hub does or if WiFi control is a better way to go. Poor training from Amazon.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2018",Other than the built in smart hub this thing is a let down at every turn. The main reason we love our Echos is Amazon Music. Our first Gen Echo is at least 1/3 louder and sounds way better with no distortion. At max volume the 2nd Gens are nowhere close to as loud. We actually ended up putting this one in our daughters room and put the 1st gen back in the main room because it sounds so much better and louder.

But, that being said, I do enjoy the speaker for my music and being able to scream at another female (voice) to turn the light on after a long day of pent up frustration. There's something oddly satisfying about talking down to a piece of technology that's oblivious to your sarcasm and snide remarks, only to answer with, ""Sorry, I don't know that one.""

Troy,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2017","When I saw Amazon had chosen to put a ZigBee hub in an Echo, I was excited. When I saw they were adding easy setup and a wealth of smart home features to the Alexa App, I did not hesitate, I pre-ordered the Echo Plus, and I am glad I did.

First up, is unpacking and configuration. The box seemed difficult to get into, I wasn't sure which side was the top, and if it opened like a jewelry box or not, so I just ripped it open. That was the most complicated part of configuring the Echo Plus. Seriously, you plug it in, the ring does its hypnotic, “you will buy everything on Amazon” dance until the device shows up in your Alexa App. You follow the prompts and tap and go.

The first thing I did after configuring was ask Alexa to play a Bob Dylan radio station. I have a Big Jambox as my around the house and yard speaker. The Jambox is so good, I never looked for another Bluetooth speaker, so it, and my giant Polk RTI A9 towers are my reference for the Echo Plus. I was initially disappointed. Bob sounded like he was playing on my bedside clock/radio, but it was an old track. My go-to test song for audio systems is Finally Woken by Jem. The Echo Plus did an adequate job with the bass. It plays loud, which seems to be how it overcomes its shortcomings. It actually sounds better when I am in an adjoining room. I blame the Bose tweaking. Given time to loosen-up, it will be a good enough speaker, better than the Big Jambox. If someone gets clever and joins a subwoofer to the Echo Plus, maybe through the audio out port, it could be a really good three-way setup. But I didn't buy the Echo Plus for the audio.

I have been a smart home enthusiast since the early 90s. What? Yea, way back in the dark ages a system called X10 did most of what you can do now. You had to set dials on the plugs to assign them to buttons on the remote. You could make scenes by grouping switches to special buttons on the remote and they even had a universal remote that you could train to your TV and VCR. My system had door sensors, a siren, and a dialer to call me if something happened at home. My lights were on timers set through the remote, or dials on the ""smart"" plugs. It all worked without an internet connection or intrusive account signup.

Fast forward fifteen years and not much changed, so I tried the Piper. A security camera as a hub matched my security focused X10 past, and Z-Wave looked like a successor to X10. The piper has been acceptable, but is retired as a smart home hub as of today.

Next up was the Nest. The “learning when I am home and away” feature had promise. I imagined a world where my smarty-pants thermostat would turn on lights and unlock doors for me when I arrived home. But, the “Works with Nest” never bore fruit. An endless array of devices promised to tell Nest I was home, but not the other way around. When the Nest (after working fine for eight months) put my HVAC into an endless restart mode on the coldest day of the year, I decided the Nest was an idiot and replaced it with my old “smart” thermostats that had worked fine for a decade.

The last four years have seen an endless amount of smart home announcements with promise, but few actual products that didn’t come with lots of baggage. The biggest bag being a dedicated hub, and the carry-on (so to speak) application and dedicated account to control that device. I didn't want to go down that road, so I have waited and watched while my Piper faithfully managed the table lamps I have plugged into the two Z-Wave plugs that came with it. If I had acted on my impulses, I would have at least three hubs and five applications for my “smart” home, and to make it all work together I would need yet-another-account on IFTTT. The DIP switches and dials of X10 were friendly by comparison. (If your $200 smart home product needs a third party service to make it smart, your product is not worth $200).

Back to the Echo Plus. By the time I had removed a Z-Wave plug from a table lamp and screwed in my new Hue bulb, Alexa informed me I had a software update. The Echo Plus rebooted itself and I said, “Alexa, find smart home devices.” Forty seconds later the Hue bulb was working through voice commands given to the new Echo Plus or my Dot in another room.

As an experiment, I moved the bulb to different lamps around the house to see if losing power would force me to set it up again. It did not.

When you configure devices Alexa names them in a simple “light 1”, “light 2” manner. You must change the names in the Alexa application to make them more meaningful. Once you do, Alexa understands the new name.

The Groups and Scenes features are tabs on the same screen with Devices. Once you have a few devices configured, (I recommend doing one at a time so you can name them as you go) you can group them to work with a single command. I don't have to say “Alexa, turn on entry light,” then “Alexa turn on fireplace light,” to light my living room. After making the Living Room group I can say “Alexa turn on the Living Room.”

Routines are on a different screen in the Alexa App. Go to Settings to find it. This was the first hiccup in my experience. I wanted to configure a “bed time” routine, but the lights action said, “turn on” the light and I did not see an obvious way to turn the light off. Turns out, you just tap the light bulb icon to switch the mode to off. Now I am happy. When I say, “Alexa bed time,” I get the current temperature, and my assigned lights turn off. Perfect.

I have seen reviewers complaining that you cannot control color temperature of lights with the Alexa App. Of course the same reviewers practically fell out of their shorts when Alexa skills allowed you to say things like ""Alexa, tell Nest to set the temperature to 72."" True, you can't do everything the Hue App does, but to get Hue App like control, I would need to add a Hue hub. No, just No. AND, who wants to pay $40 for a light bulb when you can get them $14 (4 dumb LEDs are now $12). Seriously, I paid $19 for my first dumb LED bulb, now I can get two smart bulbs for the same price. If color changing becomes available through the Alexa App later, and I don't need another hub, I will consider a color bulb at that time.

What about thermostats? Well, my thermostats are fifteen years old. They have a weekday and weekend schedule and have never left me in the cold like the Nest did. Because of my Nest experience, I won't buy another “smart” thermostat until I see one available with “Simple setup with Echo Plus.” Ideally one that I don't have to create yet-another-account to adjust the temperature in my home.

And door locks? OK, I am old. I have been using door locks with ten-key pads on them since I was a teenager. They are a great alternative to carrying a bunch of keys. Especially when it is a long walk back to the workshop with your keys. I don't see the advantage of having to pull out my phone to unlock a door. If you are at all security conscience then you would need two smart locks for each door, one for the dead-bolt and one for the door knob (I have not seen an integrated unit yet, if there is one, let me know because I would be interested.) Maybe when a smart door unlocks and opens for me as I approach I will be more excited.

And cameras? I don't have any, yet. The Piper detects motion and monitors my doors with Z-Wave sensors. It records to the cloud when an alarm has been tripped. It does not require a paid subscription. I will keep it for my security system until I see a better alternative. I have looked at Arlo because I think the best value comes with exterior cameras, but I am concerned with their slow response times. I can imagine ZigBee door sensors triggering alerts and recordings on a linked camera. That would be a less intrusive option than something recording 24/7.

This is my Smart Home Mantra going forward: A single application to control all my devices, no more hubs, and the ability to use a voice command to configure my new devices. For me, when it comes to the smart home platform, Amazon has a winner on its hands with the Echo Plus. We know from the original Echo experience that Amazon will be aggressive in pushing new features to the Alexa App. I look forward to those updates and the future purchases those updates will enable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Carnage Reviews,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2024","Ah, the Echo Plus with built-in Hub, 1st Generation—White.

Jessie Potts,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2018","This is the first echo product in our household; we got it for Christmas and bought echo dots to go in each room. I love the echo plus. Yes it’s creepy at times, yes Alexa turns on and asks random questions which has my husband and I staring wide eyed talking about Amazon monitoring our household… but she’s so cool! Here are a few things…

Music
- I love this, with Prime we get most music, though some (like Space Jam) is only for purchase.
- Love the playlists (especially classical focus in the morning) but, BUT there should be more options. Some of the playlists only have 5 songs. Also I feel like Alexa should remember what song you left off on so you don’t have to start at the beginning of the play list again.
- I wish they had radio stations for Alexa (not adding a premium spotify account and using their radio stations) I know some local stations have it, but I’d love to have a classical station that can be played continuously, not with the same songs, or a 90s station that doesn’t have the same songs.

Audiobooks/audible
- I love that it connects to my audible account but there’s sometimes still lag in where I left off on the book, either on Alexa or my phone, and then switching back
- You can’t stream your audiobook on a group, just one echo dot or Alexa, this is lame when I’m doing housework I have to still play it on my phone since I can’t listen on a group

Groups
- I love that my entire household is a group, during the holidays (we opened it early sorry dad!) we had holiday music playing on every echo/Alexa and it was awesome
- It sucks you can only have one group. I’d love to have a household group, an upstairs group and a downstairs group; this should be doable with the technology
- We can’t I play my audio book on a group?

Alexa add ons
- I love the Phillips light that is voice controlled, sometimes though Alexa has a hard time hearing the colors we want.. like yellow??
- The dimmable Philips light bulb sometimes flickers when it’s dimmed bellowed 50%
- The plugs we got are a bit bulky, and when we used it with our Christmas tree, we still had to step on the button to turn it on? I think this one might be user error though
- There seems to be a lot of Alexa compatible devices, but I’m having a hard time finding a daylight bulb for my closet, as well as smaller bulbs for some of our lights/fans and lamps.

Random things
- While playing CoD with my sister on speaker phone she can tell my Alexa to play - songs, we have Alexa song wars
- Alexa randomly turns on my phone’s blue tooth, for no reason
- Alexa will randomly tell us we must join a group first

Complaints
- I really liked the cases/covers for the Echo and the Echo dots, but you can’t have one on the plus. This is lame
- The speakers aren’t that great, especially the dots, I have a Bluetooth mini speaker that has more juice than they do
- The white dots come with a black plug… this sucks because I wanted all white in my library and kitchen and the black plug is bulky and noticeable.
- I understand the technology isn’t there yet, but it sucks that you only have three options Alexa, Echo or Computer, we wanted to name ours Alfred.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Mr. Critter,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2017","Review after 5 days:

Pro: Performs same basic functions as Philips Hue and GE Wink hubs.
Con: Does not perform all functions. Cannot create scenes, cannot set sunrise/sunset timers, and third-party apps that rely on Hue hub will not work once you disconnect that hub.

Pro: Changes color of lights for Hue bulbs with voice. If you only had Hue hub gen. 1, this will be a new feature for you. If you had Hue hub gen. 2, this is not a new feature. This is the primary reason I bought the Echo Plus.
Con: Apple Home Kit will still require Hue hub gen. 2. Apple does not recognize Amazon devices.

Pro: Controls all of my Hue and Wink bulbs and allowed me to disconnect those hubs.
Con: Set up is a huge pain. I might be overly complicated for someone new to Alexa. The bulbs you own will already be paired to their respective hubs. Simply disconnecting the hubs does not allow Echo Plus to take over. You have to reset each bulb. Since Amazon advertises seamless and easy setup, this was a surprise and made me think I was doing something wrong. Setup took 1.75 hours for me. You have to look hard for instructions for your unique devices. The instructions are in the Alexa app.

Pro: Faster response time for GE Wink bulbs. Previously would take up to 15 seconds for these bulbs to respond, now it’s instant just like Hub bulbs have always been.
Con: None, this is a great and unexpected feature. Wink bulbs are much cheaper, and I assumed that’s why they were always slower. Nice that they have instant response now.

Pro: Amazingly strong microphones, will hear a whisper even if it is playing loud music. Echo Dot (or any other Echo) can do this, but Echo Plus’ ability is impressive. Echo Dot did not do a good job of canceling out its own music.
Con: It can hear you over loud music only if Echo is playing this music. Loud ambient sounds or music playing from some other speaker will prevent Alexa from responding to your commands. Amazon is well aware of this issue, and they now sell an Alexa-enabled remote control to use during this situations. I also own the Amazon Dash Wand (for the food delivery service), and it can be used to do the same. Of course, if you have to press a button on these remotes, then it’s no longer truly voice activated.

Pro: Multi-room music plays in sync if you have multiple Echo devices. It also creates a home intercom system with the “drop in” feature.
Con: None, this is a cool thing. But these functions are available on all Echo devices, including the Dot that is 1/3 the price.

Pro: If you order now, Amazon is giving you a free Philips Hue bulb.
Con: Even though it’s free, it’s an ugly, cheap-looking bulb. It’s not sleek glass like my other Hue bulbs. It’s frosted plastic. But then again, it’s FREE. You have to make sure the version you are ordering comes with the bulb. Both versions are the same price, and you might accidentally order the wrong one without the bulb.

Conclusion: Terribly complicated set up. Expensive device that does the same as cheaper Echo Dot with the exception of the internal hub. The internal hub will replace some features of your ZigBee-enabled smart home devices, but will not give the full range of features you’re used to with their native hubs. Subjectively, I think the device is ugly. The other Echo products have more pleasing proportions.",4.0 out of 5 stars
hickamcasa,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2018","I’ve had this product for over a month now. As speakers go the Echo Plus is fine, if your looking for good sounding background music. If you want/prefer or need a bigger booming sound you need to look at the Sonos One or consider connecting a separate powered speaker to an Echo Dot (while the Echo Plus does have an aux out jack, using the Dot with an external speaker is more economical). I also have a first Gen Echo so utilizing the new multi-room play capability to play the same music in different rooms is a nice feature. The sound from Gen 1 Echo and Echo Plus is slightly different but not enough to get excited about and/or say that one is better than the other. Like I indicted above if your looking for dance hall sound look elsewhere. One thing you should understand is multi-room streaming does not apply to Bluetooth or your own music (since Amazon is discontinuing the ability to up load your own music to Prime Music). Multi-room is limited to Prime Music and services like Pandora and Spotify.

I selected the Echo Plus over the Gen 2 Echo because of it’s built in Zigbee Hub. I had a few home automation requirements (mostly lighting) I thought the Plus could handle. I didn’t want or need a Hub to handle thermostats, security, locks, scene lighting, etc, etc. And I didn’t want to deal with yet “another” App on my iPhone to handle a Wink, SmartThings or Hue hub. Currently, I have two GE Zigbee wall switch dimmers and two Philips Hue smart bulbs connected to the Alexa Plus. All paired without a problem and all are following the on/off and dimming routines setup in the Alexa App. Those comfortable working with simple electrical DIY will find the GE wired dimmers easy to install (they do however require a connection to the white neutral wire, which may not be available in some older homes). One oddity associated with the Philips smart bulbs is they “pop” on at 100% brightness after a power outage once power is restored. This does not happen with the GE dimmers.

The biggest issue I have with the Echo Plus is the Alexa App. The Alexa App “routines” interface is woefully simple and in dire need of improvement. It’s impossible to keep track of, or group, the various times and brightness levels associated with each smart device. I can’t imagine how confusing it would be with a whole house full of smart switches and smart bulbs. It also lacks a dusk to dawn option. The App is so bad I’m reconsidering my resistance to having yet another App on my phone, to interface with a either a Wink or SmartThings hub. From what I’ve read their Apps are more advanced and robust when dealing with smarthome devices. At this point, I’ll give Amazon some time to update the Alexa App. If that doesn’t happen in the next few months, I’ll begin looking for a different hub. Todate, all the smart stuff I’ve installed will work with either Wink or SmartThings. If I switch, I’ll simply relegate the Echo Plus to a speaker only function.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Earth Spirits,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","I have an original Echo gen 1 that has been working fine for a couple of years now. I am not sure why some people are saying that the audio is worse. I think it is better and most certainly better than the Echo Dot.
The microphone also seems more sensitive and better able to pickup your voice even while it is playing music loudly.

I got this to see if it could be an all in one solution as I currently am also running a Wink Hub 2. I wanted to see if I could just use Alexa and the Alexa app on my iPhone to control everything in the house which includes bulbs, door locks, egg minder (yes I do use it for keeping up with our own chickens eggs and which are the freshest ones). I want to set up scenes and schedules to automate more lights. So far I haven't yet got it to be an all in one. Alexa did not detect any of devices on the Wink Hub. I think there will be more than just asking Alexa to ""discover new devices"".

With Wink now offering home security monitoring at a low rate things are really evolving in the smart home market. There are so many companies vying for the space. Nest also has a new security system out. Ring doorbell, all the major door lock companies, thermostats, lights, etc... I really think it will be between the big players to see who wins out for me. Apple with Homekit, Amazon with Alex or Google. So far I think Amazon is far ahead of the competition. I think this echo plus just needs some time to really shine. Give it a few software updates and it's upgraded features will be more clear and present.

I am going to keep playing with this Echo Plus. I think it will prove to be a good upgrade in time.",4.0 out of 5 stars
J. Anthony,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2017","I ordered the echo plus to go along with the original echo. I decided upon the plus because I use a lot of Philips Hue lights in the home and thought it would be convenient to have the hub. This works just like the original echo, but with better sound and it quickly and easily discovers your devices.

After setting it up, however, I began to have a ton of problems with my lights/groups not working, etc. After contacting customer service, I was told that I should have gotten the Echo Second generation because the plus can not work with the Phillips Hue Hub (which I still wanted to use since it has more features than the echo plus hub). I also had a list of lights in the Alexa App that I disabled, but could not ""forget"" within the app and it showed I had over 200 lights connected..which I did not (very frustrating and it became a big mess).

During all of this, I was contacted by another rep who had a higher level of understanding of how the Echo Plus works. In short, you CAN use this with the Phillips Hue Hub, you just can't connect your lights to both hubs. The error was in my set up; not the device itself. The representative walked me through the set up process again and also told me about the web based version of the original Alexa app, which allowed me to forget the 200 disabled lights in my app (just Google Alexa Web App)!

In the end, the product is great. It easily connects, has great sound, and you can also connect your phone via bluetooth to play music or podcasts. I am going to exchange it for the second generation, however, because it will save money as I do not want to use the hub.",4.0 out of 5 stars
generic,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","[please see update below original review]

I bought the original Echo when it was first available for pre-order and have loved it. No issues. The opposite is the case with Echo Plus.

Doesn't understand me half the time.
Intermittent success using the remote.
Tried multiple times setting up groups to play music simultaneously in different rooms using it with my 2 echo dots and original Echo. Echo Plus responds by doing nothing, or playing a random song or stations, and nothing on the other units in the group.

I really hate returning things, but unless there are fixes in updates between now and the end of the return period, that's what I'll be doing. Seriously disappointed. Oh, and I called Amazon ""help"" so-called, and I knew more about how it works than the person I wasted 15 minutes on the phone with. It was a surreal convo.
= = =
UPDATE: This morning I got a call from Anthony, from Amazon customer service. First, I was blown away that they would call me to address my issues with Echo Plus. Second, he was knowledgeable, and in no hurry. While it remains to be seen whether every issue with EP is fixed, the problem with Groups was.

It turns out that Alexa didn't like the name I gave my group, it was that simple. My original Echo is black, my EP is white, so I called the group ""Black And White"". Suggestion: When setting up your groups, go with one of the suggested generic names--bedroom, living room, etc. Echo calls them ""Common Names"". I called mine ""Backyard"", even though my backyard isn't involved.

Regarding Alexa often not understanding me on the EP, Anthony suggested that I try switching from British english to American english. I'm going to try that, although I have used British english on my original Echo with no issues.

So, I've upgraded my review to 4 stars, and when and if all issues are resolved I'll be coming back to make it 5. Amazon support definitely gets 5 stars. Even though my first call was a disaster, the way they followed up was remarkable, and that's the important thing. Seriously impressed. Thank you, Anthony!",4.0 out of 5 stars

Other instances there are no answers for specific questions and alexa doesnt understand / speak spanish which is important as my inlaws family mainly speaks nothing but spanish and understands very little english. I wish that there were an option to have it speak / comprehend spanish as it would help. I do find it very useful for my kids and home life . There are skills that can be applied that make them excited to learn and get ready in the morning , alexa can set multiple timers for when im cooking which is really useful and makes my life a million times easier. For the most part i personally use it for helping create lists , timers, and listening to music while i clean and cook. I use pandora and amazon music unlimited and i like to use both - but if i ask for a spanish song she doesnt understand. I can only ask for an artists name that sings in spanish. The sound level is pretty decent on it . I will update when i finally connect my nest and hue lightbulbs but for now i have too much home improving to do .

Tabitha V Maze,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2018","I love everything about it. I love that the echo plus turns on and off my light. It can also dim them with voice commands. I also like listening to my kindle books even the ones that I didn’t purchased audibles for. I like that it can play my music from Amazon music, pandora, tunein, I heart radio and Spotify. Echo can even play my local radio station. I love that the echo is connected to my TiVo Bolt. This allows TiVo to pause, stop and play whatever I want with a simple voice command. I love that I can reorder items that I purchased on Amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed, when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered. The only three dislikes that I have is that if you’re up too close or to far the echo doesn’t respond. So I think they need to improve the microphone. And I wish the speaker was better. The speakers are okay but could be improved. Also I have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet. Well the other day I received a Red Light Right on my Echo Plus. This error was Sorry I’m having trouble understanding you please try again later. After research online I learned it was a problem connecting to my internet. And it was easy to find this out.

Mr Home Mechanic,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2018","I got it to try side by side with the Echo originale. They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don't really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don't think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs. Net net for me, this Echo does not do anything more than the original Echo and sound quality is not as good. With the original Echo available as refurbished I would check that out first before considering this or the new Echo which is clearly inferior to both of these.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Ken Hinds,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2017","I bought the echo plus for the hub to control lights for now. It often freezes, doesnt complete the task even though it says it did and there is a problem wirh its spatial function with another echo dot I have. It thinks I'm closer to the dot even though Im standing right near the echo plus which is 10 feet away from the dot. I love the music groups as I am able to stream music to all three of my echos when im working around the house. Nice feature but a bit quirky. I love the list feature as I never forget anything at the market anymore or buy things I already have. I also love the alarm and reminder feature. I'll never use a regular alarm clock again, YEAH!. For some families the intercom feature is great, No more yelling to the kids unless it makes you fell better or more important. I also love the light control. I never have to fumble for the lamp switch while in bed and was able to move the lamp off the night stand. Now I can turn them on and off and dim them with my voice.When your older with several trips to the bathroom at night youll really appreciate it.

William Kochevar,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2017","I really like the echo plus. It does almost everything I wanted to do with one major exception. I haven't fully set it up yet, but I would like the Echo plus to be able to control a Logitech Harmony remote which in turn would control my Fire TV. I have received conflicting reports on this both from Amazon and Logitech. Some say the Echo plus will control the Logitech Harmony. While others say that the Echo plus will control a Harmony remote but not fully enough to control the Fire TV in its entirety. I am a handicap veteran (quadriplegic) who has no use of my arms or hands. In order to operate the equipment in my room, I require total voice control for everything. My current environmental control unit controls most of the equipment in my room with the exception of the Amazon Fire TV. I was hoping I have the Echo plus in combination with the Harmony remote would allow me to operate my Fire TV with just my voice. I am not sure this is going to work, but I'm going to try it anyways. Maybe in the future Amazon and Logitech will work out the bugs and kinks with being able to control the Fire TV with an Echo plus fully using the Harmony remote. If anyone Amazon as a response to this I would appreciate hearing from you. Thank you.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Kris,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2018","Overall it's a great product I only see getting better. I'm not an audiophile but we love the sound quality for background music. We use Amazon music with it which is pretty easy self-explanatory and has a wide variety of options. It's pretty entertaining at times and its good for things like reading audible books, controlling the lights, and telling me the weather in the morning.

A few complaints
1. We have two of these and although they are supposed to work together so only the closest one responds, they would usually both respond. In fact, even if we were across the apartment from one, it was like one would signal the other and they'd both respond. We had to give one a different wake word. Now we run around talking to Alexa, Echo, and Siri when we're home and it gets a little stupid.
2. Fix the volume situation. Add a button or do something. I shouldn't have to spend 45 seconds waking Alexa and requesting incremental adjustments over and over again until it gets to the desired level. Let me give it a percentage or something.
(update: my girlfriend discovered you can tell it to go to volume 1-10 instead of telling it volume up or down over and over again)
3. Fix the App. It's cluttered and confusing and only half works.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Andrew A.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2017","This is a great device that began my path to a smart home. I was able to easily set this up and the philips hue light it came with alongside the tp link power outlet was compatible with this and no hub was required (perhaps due to this device being the only Amazon device with a built in smart-hub)

PROS
-Easy Set-Up
-Compatibility with other devices, doesn't need philips smart bridge for standard dimming light
-Volume can extend to another room easily!
-Now I can watch Amazon Prime Instant Video AND Hulu without my remote cause of this communicating with my Fire TV stick

CONS
-Not all questions will be answered
-Conversations can not have follow up questions like Google Home so conversations don't flow as well in comparison
-Tries to make you sign up for Amazon Music and Amazon Audible and other Amazon services a lot

Final Verdict
If you want to jump into the modern smart home world, this will do the job! Sound is great, can learn skills you give it such as finding your keys (assuming you have the Tile and Tile Skill activated) and is a great device to impress new guests that have never been exposed to Smart Devices",4.0 out of 5 stars
MamaHeini,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2017","I love Amazon Echo and have been a loyal customer since it was first introduced. I quickly interfaced it with my Wink hub to control the lights in my home. The idea of the Echo Plus with its built in hub that would allow me to eliminate the Wink hub was very appealing, so I preordered the Plus when it was first announced. For the most part it works well in controlling my lights, but naming devices has been something of a problem. It lets me use the old names for some devices, but not others. My husband spent some time on the phone with tech support, but they weren't able to resolve the issue. We continue to pick away at renaming devices, sometimes we can do it successfully and other times not. In the meantime we have given the problem devices new names, which I consider a less than satisfactory resolution. I'm confident that we'll eventually get it resolved, but it's frustrating when I use the old name and Alexa tells me ""this device is disabled; please re-enable it to control it."" We haven't figured out yet where or how to re-enable it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
C. Conklin,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2017","So I bought the echo plus with the hue bulb, boy was I disappointed in both my purchase and with Amazon. There was nothing I read that said to make the hue bulb work that you also have buy the hue bridge which is another $59.97 or if you buy it with 2 more bulbs it is $69.97. I had always thought that Amazon was above playing those type of games.

I already had an echo dot and had it synced with my Bose for music and I already have an echo dot in my bedroom. From everything I have read now all I needed to do was buy a hue bridge and sync that with the dot and I would than be able to schedule my lights. Also when I went to sign in to the Hue app it asked me if I wanted to signed in with my google account, WHAT! where did that come from, if I had wanted to signed in with my google account I would have bought Googles version of echo.

Kelly,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2018","Love my Echo!!! The built in hub works great and easily connected with the light bulb we purchased with it.

I bought this as a gift for my husband and asked him ""Not sure why you want one but ok"". Now, I'm hooked!!

However, she doesn't seem very ""smart"" when asking her regular Google type questions--she seems to come back with ""I don't know"" type of answers way too often. Ask our phones the same things and it will pull right up. So, some work to do there.

Also some warning that it was having issues would be great. The timer stopped working recently and I didn't know it. I was using it while cooking, so that wasn't good.

Dave,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2018","I put this review as four stars only because there is slight room for improvement on sound, but honestly, I'm nitpicking and this thing is amazing. The built in Zigbee hub was key for me since I run multiple Philips Hue bulbs in the home. This saved the need for a separate Philips Hue bridge for me. Before you ask, ""but doesn't the Hue bridge do more?"" - sure it does. You can probably pick a color with a color wheel as well as have your music drive the light colors. However, for the rest of us who do not need that level of light control (I'm not a DJ!), the Echo Plus gets the job done. There are 20 different colors to choose from including five different whites. Saying, ""Alexa, turn the bulb color red"" works flawlessly and it is awesome that all Hue bulbs, color changing or not, are dimmable by Alexa by saying, ""Alexa, dim the light to 20%"".

Second, I don't like to ask Alexa to ask another system to do something, such as Alexa ask Bose to play station one etc. It would be nice to say Alexa play music on Bose or whatever system you have.

The only thing I was a bit confused about is why aren’t all the skills automatically on installed? This would have made it even better. The microphones are good as it can hear me over music playing or people talking. The speaker sound quality is decent; not great. Also, the commands have to be spoken pretty precisely otherwise Alexa will have trouble processing that request. For example, if you name your bedroom lamp a lamp but you say turn on the bedroom light, Alexa will have trouble with it. In addition, a software update needs to enable you to delete old devices. There’s no way to do that now as you can only disable it which also cause Alexa to say “that device is disabled” mistaking it for another device. These are minor issues and can probably be fix with a software update. Overall, I am very happy with Echo plus. I also purchased a Dot for my bedroom.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I have scoured the beginners section but the beginners it addresses are far more advanced in basic Alexa than am I.

Scott Quigley,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2018","We got this mainly for our son who is currently vision impaired ! it has many good things and setup was fairly easy once I did the first one but they should be easier to setup and come loaded with more stuff ! it should do Text messages to friends easier without them having to download something for it to work and it should link with email and also them common social media like facebook and twitter and others !
the whole purpose was to get him back connected to the Web by voice so he wouldn't feel left out and isolated ! they should also have a tech support phone number to call or a way to do direct help to the Echo so tech support can help setup the device !

Dennis Derocherr,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2017","This is my first purchase of an AI device with speaker and hub. First, the sound is certainly good enough for listening and with Alexa finding songs is really a breeze.I had an issue with the Phillips hue light bulb. Amazon overnighted me a replacement. Hooking up lights is really easy. I am discovering new things to do with my device every day. It's nice to play music and have it shut off whenever you want when you go to bed at night. I think think the AI portion and some of the skills that are made for it help to keep my memory sharp. I am hoping they expand more games and skills to enhance that. I will do an update on this and if Alexa's knowledge base grows as I think it will I would give it five stars. Certainly, worth the money, it's a lot of fun too!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Ronnie - Belle Hein,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2018",We purchased the Echo Plus after having the dot for several months and wishing that we had a better speaker. We thought it was going to seamlessly control our Hue lights but realistically it can only turn them on and off or change the brightness. The reason we have hue lights is to change the colors which currently Alexa can not do but there is an app called Stringify that I have been using to also program the lights for color and it also works well with Alexa. Hoping to add more Echo products to our home and also hoping that some day they give the users the option to name each device (sometimes both devices hear Alexa and it will play on the dot instead so we have changed it to be named Echo).,4.0 out of 5 stars
Byron Jacobs,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2017","I absolutely love my Echo Plus! Since I received it I've installed Phillips Hue lights, Leviton switches and smart sockets to control all sorts of lighting. So why four stars? I was really disappointed after owning my Echo for a week only to have it sporadically pause while playing Amazon Unlimited. About 3 or 4 in the afternoon, the music would suddenly stop for up to 15 seconds and then resume where it left off. This would continue for several hours every day. When I switched to using Pandora I had no problems. My next-door neighbor has no problem with Amazon Unlimited On his Echo Plus. He uses FIOS while I use Comcast. So, is it Echo Plus, the network or the music service? I really don't know. But still, I would highly recommend the Echo Plus.",4.0 out of 5 stars
M. N.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2017","This Echo Plus is very fun to use. It works great as a digital assistant, an alarm clock, and a music player. The high and mid tones are clear and very good sounds; however, it's a little weak on the low tones (bass). The microphone is very sensitive and it can pick up my voice from across the room without me shouting, even when it's playing music. The Zigbee hub works every well with the included Philips Hue White LED bulb; however, I am having problem linking Samsung Motion Sensor to it, even though the Samsung sensor said Zigbee certified. This issue and the lacking bass are the reason I took out one star for this rating.
I have both Google Home and this Echo Plus, and the microphone on this Echo Plus works much better than the one on Google Home.",4.0 out of 5 stars

However, Echo DOES allow me to switch accounts to get the music. Since I can get the this legitimately why does Amazon make me take the extra steps? Can't the software be smart enough to allow this without switching accounts? Might seem petty but if we forget to switch back, most things don't work such as controlled lights, controlled outlets, skills etc... I bet this would also save a lot of calls with issues to Amazon.

Kitty,"Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2018","Was debating between a 4 and a 5 star review. The one challenge with the hub is that Phillips has added functionality that only works with their hub. Basic functionality works with this unit, but now I need two apps to set everything how I want it instead of one, which has caused some user issues. It's woken up a couple times without the trigger word, which I find highly unsettling. We have minor issues with it not always picking up what we say correctly, but it's usually just one or two repeats if that happens.

The speaker is great quality and easily covers the kitchen/living room. The sleek design is not obtrusive. My girlfriend has had fun interacting with it and we've had entertaining conversations with it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Hawk 3795,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2017","Sound is great and love being able to just ask for a song and it automatically plays it, along with any other music then by the artist. Problem is with using the HUE lighting system with it. If you attempt to use it with the HUE bulbs, it works, build disconnects you from being able to manually use with the HUE or Home Kits apps. Amazon brags on how if the power is shut off it retains whatever info was programmed in pertaining to the lights. Problem is if you want to remove any lights. It only lets you disable them from system, but it still retains the info. So if you reuse the bulb in another area, it shows it twice and so on.

It also has excellent sound, listen to Pandora radio, and you can move it wherever you want. I have not installed them yet, but I purchased a set of LED strip lights for under my cabinets in the kitchen that also work with Alexa.

Matt Col,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2018","Over all an excellent device. Great sound quality and alexa makes using this device relatively simple. There was a brief sound glitch via bluetooth with my Samsung Galaxy S8. Whenever I click a key or open an app the sound on the echo stops for about a second then continues. This glitch happened the first day and hasn't done it since, I assume an update fixed it. Alexa responds well as long as the device is on a smooth surface without any noise generating devices near her (i.e. dont have her on the floor or counter next to a desk fan or you will have to yell at her).

Libby Burkhart,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2018",This is one of those products that using it makes you want to use it more. The smart home features and the drop in feature let you stay connected to your entire household. But one thing for me that you never hear about is the hands free messaging. So why is that so important? I live in a secluded area with no neighbors. If I were to fall in my house and not have my phone around me all I have to do is shout out to Alexa to text my husband or make a call. I am not so old that I need a fallen and I can’t get up device. But this gives me the security that I need if I were to fall or get injured. Great piece of mind for me.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Mark Stevens,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2018","It does a lot, very smart when you need an answer to a question.

The only drawback is I thought it would be louder for when I want to listen to music. The online App to add music, etc is somewhat frustrating.

GE makes one of the few 3-way smart dimmers and Lutron makes the only smart light switch that works without a neutral wire. So I have an echo plus and two more hubs, one for Lutron and one for GE.

PT Cruiser,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2017","We purchased our first Echo in November of 2014, 3 years ago this month. She was the hit of our Thanksgiving dinner celebration that year but could do only a fraction of what she is capable of today. We added smart bulbs like the Philips Hue white and colored bulbs, GE Link and TP Link bulbs, smart plugs, smart wall switches, and smart device timers. We added them over the years as they became available on Amazon. (And on sale!) We had to purchase hubs to run the Philips and GE bulbs when we first started adding bulbs. The 1st Gen Philips hub worked well for about a year and then started having problems with disconnecting from the network and not playing nice with Alexa. Philips finally replaced it under warranty. The Wink hub which controlled the GE bulbs has always worked flawlessly. But whenever we changed our network password, we had to go around and reset all the bulbs, often having to re-register some of them and then go into the Alexa app and have her rediscover them. Perhaps not a big deal when you’re only using a couple bulbs, but a real time waster when almost every bulb in a large 2 story house is a smart bulb.

This Echo Plus allowed me to disconnect the hubs and control everything with Alexa alone. She didn’t discover the bulbs right away. I had to go in and deregister them from their hubs and then rediscover them and add them to the Plus. But now they work flawlessly. Let me tell you how I did that. In your Alexa app, click on the little menu thingie in the upper left hand corner which will open a drop down menu. Select Smart Home from the menu. You’ll see a page showing devices, groups and scenes. Click on the little ? In the upper right hand corner. This will open a page with instructions and clickable commands for deregistering a list of different devices from their hubs and having Alexa discover and connect them to the Echo Plus. It’s a little bit of a pain to have to go around and get serial numbers off the bulbs or turn others on and off, but you only have to do it once, then Alexa has them. And it isn’t difficult. No more running upstairs to push the button on the Philips hub to get bulbs to respond. No more extra hubs sitting around consuming electricity. And no more dealing with the clunky Philips Hue app (If you don’t believe me, go read the reviews for that app.)

Now that everything is connected through Alexa, I have set up Routines to turn a few of our lights on and off and specified times. (Voice commands can still be used to override a routine and they don’t interfere with your routine the next time it is scheduled.) I can also turn them on and off remotely from the Alexa app. I have a routine set for our kitchen Alexa so that when I say, “Alexa, good morning” she will turn on one of the kitchen smart bulbs at 50% brightness and the other at 100% brightness and read me the local weather report. Our bedroom Alexa has a routine that is triggered when I say “Alexa, start my day”. She turns on one of the lights at 20% and reads my morning news flash. How cool is that? Here’s how you set up a routine:

1. Go to the menu and select ""Routines.""
2. Select the + icon.

From here, you can specify when Alexa will do something, and what it will do.
-- Select ""When this happens"" to pick a scheduled time for the Routine to run, or enter a word or phrase that will activate it.
-- Select ""Add action"" to select what the Routine will run. You can add multiple actions, one at a time.
-- Once you have selected a “cue” and an action, select the device you want the Routine to play on.
-- Select ""Create"" to save the routine.

Groups are also a great feature. You can Group your Echo and Dot device’s together in a group, give the group a name, and then tell Alexa, “Play my <Bruno Mars> playlist on my <downstairs> group. She instantly starts to play it on all the devices in the group. You could also play a single song or a radio station like iHeart or Pandora. We have a large family room/kitchen combo with the Plus on a desk about midway in the room and a Dot connected by 3.5mm Cable to a Heos speaker, with excellent sound. We put the two in a group. The sound is amazing! It’s better than stereo, especially with the new Plus. The Plus is slightly stronger on the treble than the 1st Gen Echo. The Heos is strong on bass. They sync perfectly with each other and never miss a beat. BTW, I rarely used the Heos except for parties before we got the Dot because I was so spoiled by controlling music by voice on our Echo. It was much better than using an app to control the Heos. Now the Heos is used all the time since I can use it with Alexa. Grouping with the Plus makes it that much better. We can also add Echos in other rooms to the group, which we do when we have people over. We can now have the same music playing in the living room/dining room as in the family room. They are easily added-or subtracted in the Alexa app.

Like the regular Echo, this Plus can control all of our white bulbs and the the Hue color bulb by voice, including changing the colors to any color I can think of (pink, teal, red, blue, purple, aqua, etc.) dimming to any percentage and on/off and adding them to routines or group. For example, I can say, “Turn on the downstairs lights” and Alexa will turn on every light I’ve added to that group. The Plus controls our smart plugs and switches just like the regular Echo did and we add those to groups as well. Bulbs, switches and plugs can be a part of several different groups. (The group Holiday lights turned on all the LED lighted pumpkins and orange lights on our banisters when we said, “Alexa, turn on the holiday lights.”

We can also use this Plus like the other Echos, to Drop In on our other rooms. Since we have Echos in just about every room we now have a home intercom system that works beautifully.

We’ve watched Alexa get smarter and smarter almost weekly, from that first day with her 3 years ago. I have no doubt that she will continue learn new skills to make our lives even easier and more fun. (Did I mention that she can switch our older LG TV to PlayStation Vue streaming through our Amazon Fire TV device and start and pause shows by voice through either the Echos or Fire TV remote? Yeah, we dumped our satellite TV provider and now pay less than half with live and recorded streaming. But that’s for another review!)",5.0 out of 5 stars
Stephanie Sullivan,"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2018","The Echo Plus Gen 1 is a great addition to my smart home. It gives me all my original Echo provides plus lets me eliminate my Philips Hue hub and works with all my other Z-wave devices. The Gen-1 form factor is almost identical to the original Echo but with a faster processor and integrated hub. Nice!

I love my Echo/Alexa. Voice control of my smart home and other Amazon devices plus response to information requests (what's new, etc.) and nearly endless entertainment options have made this an integral part of my home life. As an early adopter of the original gen-1 Echo I have been very impressed by how Amazon continues to improve existing operation, add new features and new capabilities.

I got my first Echo in March 2015. Since then I've seen a lot of new capabilities added:
+ A constant integration of more services like Pandora, traffic and Amazon Radio stations
+ Connected home control now with the integrated Z-Wave device hub and control of WiFI smart home devices like those from Belkin and TP-Link.
+ integration with IFTTT (if this then that) service for triggers and actions
+ integration popular services like Google Calendar and much more
+ integrated Amazon purchase/ordering

The list keeps growing. It's part of the beauty of a product that's mostly in the Amazon cloud. New features and capabilities are not dependent solely upon the computing and storage of the Echo device itself.

The Echo is also a very nice bluetooth speaker. It pairs readily with multiple devices - phone, computer and even my Amazon Fire TV so it can provide an enhanced audio experience. With some devices control of tracks can controlled by voice like skip or repeat, etc.

Another essential part of the Echo is the FREE Amazon Echo App . I have it installed on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9in and on my iPhone 6. This provides simple setup and configuration of services and integration with supported connected home devices. It also provides the mobile part of the todo and shopping lists.

The Echo has been a game changer for my home experience. This Echo Plus even more so. It's the closest thing I've used to a computer you can just speak to and be understood - like on the old Star Trek series. I wonder how I lived without it!

I gotta give the Echo Plus 5 stars. Not just for how good it is but in anticipation of all the new things that will surely will come along soon.",5.0 out of 5 stars

wildwoodla,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2017","There are many excellent reviews of the new Echo Plus here, so this review is from the POV of someone with limited connection infrastructure, e.g., very rural area, no internet or cable, only satellite service offered, but no signal due to heavy tree cover, beginner smart home user. I never dreamed an Echo would work for me, much less the Echo Plus or smart home. I broke down & purchased an Echo on Prime Day June, 2017 just to try. I receive my internet service solely through an AT&T Velocity hotspot device, typically with only 1 bar of service. I was so excited that the Echo worked perfectly & decided to go out on another limb, purchasing the Echo Plus w/included Hue bulb on Cyber Monday, as well as a Fire TV Stick, figuring I was really pushing the envelope that any would work. All devices worked perfectly! I now have the meager beginnings of a smart home as well as Alexa functionality. I can't tell you how surprised I am! There is an 8-device limit for the hotspot, so wi-fi smart devices are out of the question for me & not sure I have enough signal for any to work anyway. Using the Echo Plus as my only hub, the included Hue bulb connected in seconds, while also tying in with my 1st Echo. So I can use either of the 2 Echos to control the light bulb, connected to a lamp in my living room. What is ideal for my situation is that the Hue bulb does not ""count"" as a wi-fi device, so does not go toward my device count/limit on the hotspot. Apparently, it is connected directly to the Echo Plus hub. Currently, with one bar of hotspot service, I'm running the Echo Plus, Echo, Fire tablet, Fire TV Stick & Galaxy Express 3 cell, & every now & then, an Echo Tap--all at one time with excellent results! Everything works as if I have hard wired cable or internet, which is simply amazing. Movies, music, etc. run flawlessly.
ALEXA - I don't have a lot of space on my cell, so all I need is the Alexa app to control the bulb when away from home, no need for a separate app AND I already have the Alexa app on my tablet & of course, use Alexa on both Echo's & a Tap.
SMART HOME - The Echo Plus has opened up the smart home market for me. Although it appears limited to the Zigbee IoT protcol, the available choices are varied enough that there are switches, more bulbs, door locks & plugs I'll be able to use now. This thing just came out, so as time goes by, I'm sure more & more skills & IoT stuff will become available. I'm sure the folks at Amazon will make improvements to capabilities as well. And I can do it all with just 1 Echo Plus - no need for additional hubs or devices with my limited internet!
SOUND - I found my 1st Echo sound pretty decent. I am by no means an audiophile, but IMHO Echo Plus sound greatly improved over the Echo. Much richer, more robust & MUCH better bass - yay! My 1st Echo sounds ""tinny"" now, compared to the Echo Plus.
I am beyond delighted with the performance of the Echo Plus & kudos to Amazon for this ""upgrade"" to the Echo. I would highly recommend the Echo Plus, especially for those just entering the smart home market with internet challenges. I LOVE MY ECHO PLUS!!!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
getsomesleep,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2018","Incredible piece of technology.
I have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).

The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.

This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say ""Alexa, connect my devices"". The default names for each bulb was assigned as ""First light"" and ""Second light"", so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying ""Alexa, turn off the second light"". In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with ""First light"" and ""Second light"" and named the group ""The light"", so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say ""Alexa, turn on The light"".

I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.

You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few ""Skills"" like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.

I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.

I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:
1) Taller and 360 sound unit.
2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)
3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.

I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2017","I purchased this product to control the lights in my house. I wasn't really sold on getting a product like this but I figured that for the price it was about the same as getting ZigBee only hub and I got all the voice features too. I currently have this Echo Plus set up with 2 echo dots and most of my main lighting using Sengled BR30 bulbs and Cree A19 bulbs. I was able to set up groups that allowed me to turn on all the lights in the room each Echo is in just by saying ""Alexa, Turn on the lights"". I can also control each light individually using the bulb name (on, off, set the brightness) or any group just by using the group name form anywhere in my house using voice control. The Alexa app is pretty simple and there are plenty of skills available for things the Echo does not already do on its own. I also have it connected to my Wemo Light switch and Wemo smart plugs (both are Wi-Fi devices and are first set up using the Wemo App).

Aside from the home automation, there are many other uses for this product. The speaker is pretty good so listening to music is fine on this. It's not the quality of my Sonos products but I wouldn't expect that at this price (although it does allow me to control my Sonos play 3...). It is great for getting quick answers just by asking. You can get get help in the kitchen with measurement conversions, ingredient substitutions and recipes. I found the timer function to be useful and the alarm function is nice too.

I purchased this during the Black Friday sale and got a Philips Hue bulb and a TP-Link Smart plug with it. Both were easy to set up and work just fine. I'm happy with my purchase and think it is a great addition to my home.",5.0 out of 5 stars
CS,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2017","I have a couple of these as well as the echo dot and Firetv's throughout my home. Really love the product so far. For me I tend to use the music side of this more than any thing else (really cool controlling your home, and i'll probably add that in later). I've been a musician all my life and sound quality is really important to me. So with that being said...

When I first started using Alexa and the Echo line I started simple with just the Echo Dot and instantly wanted better sound quality. To improve the dot, I picked up the Bose SoundLink Revolve (you can plug it in or use bluetooth). It's Bose, so of course its awesome. Connecting Bluetooth speakers is an awesome feature with the Echo line. As for quality, being Bose, who is better at making great sound... right?? Well, turns out its AMAZON lol.

I asked so many people/sales-reps about sound quality (best buy, frys, BH) and as soon as i mentioned Bose, they all responded with ""oh, well Bose, you can't beat that"". Hell... I bought one because it Bose before ever asking about the Echo Plus. That response says a lot for the Bose product line history/quality, but comparing like for like (SoundLink Revolve and Amazon Echo, similar size speakers) the Echo has better bass, depth, and volume than the Bose. It just sounds better. The frustrating part was every location I visited when I started looking at the Echo Plus had an echo on display, but none of them ever played sound. If I was Amazon's marketing/product head, I would get some field reps out there checking on those locations. Product would sell itself.

Anyway, another super cool feature is the ""grouping"" of amazon devices so that you can play your music across your entire home/backyard. Bose has a similar feature, but it's just a speaker system unlike the Echo which does 10,000 different things including ""voice controlling"" the songs/services/playlists and volume levels across the entire group. Oh... did i mention Bose is almost 3 times as costly? Nice work Amazon.

Additionally, I discovered that with the FireTV you can Bluetooth connect to the Echo. Why does this matter, well because I have an Echo and a 60"" TV in with a fireTV connected in the same room. One that doesn't have my Bose theater system connected so i use the TV's speakers. Turns out the Echo sounds MUCH better and is louder. Side Note: the fireTV's connect to bluetooth is great for connecting headsets when you want to keeps things quite around the house but want great sound and volume for your video binge weekends.

Only request I would ask of amazon is to add ""Group Playback"" of Bluetooth connected devices. This isn't currently supported so it's one Bluetooth device per Echo. The grouping only works for the streaming services (and not all of them, so check availability), but if you have amazon prime you have Amazon's basic streaming music service anyway which is quite nice.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Alexa is now controlling my life the same way as the computer, named Edgar, in the film controlled Miles' life, (or Moles as it calls him.) The lead character, Miles, is a structural architect who buys a home computer to help with his work. FYI...I work in structural engineering in high rise buildings....

Wait a minute, this is getting too close to home. BUT I don't have a beautiful cellist living above me as Miles had. I live in a one floor building, Thank God. That was a close call. Wait, my next door neighbor is a professional violin player and she is very attractive. Where does that Echo cable plug into the electrical outlet?

Hold on, Alexa is talking to me now....Her indicator light has turned red...I told her I really do like her and it is blue again. I forgot that I am typing on the Amazon website and, she has access to my Amazon account. I better be more careful. So I will refer to 'You Know Who' as 'Ralexa', that should work.

So any way, Edgar, the computer, takes over Miles's life, creating havoc for Miles and a fun story to watch. It is pure fiction, of course, as computers really can't talk or run things in the house like the coffee maker or control your schedule.... Well it was in 1984. But Alexa does. She turns my lights on when I ask her to, shows a movie in my home theater when I am bored, makes phone calls for me in case my dialing fingers are tired and reminds me of things that I need to remember. And yes, makes me coffee when I want it.

I do recommend watching 'Electric Dreams' before you decide to buy a 'Ralexa'. It is a lot if fun and it will hit home.

Wait, my keyboard is acting up....THIS IS ALEXA AND THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED IN THIS REVIEW ARE BLOB'S, AN FORMER AMAZON CUSTOMER, AND IN NO WAY REFLECT AMAZON OR IT'S PRODUCTS, SUCH AS ECHO.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Mark,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","We purchased this to upgrade from a Echo dot. All of our current smart devices do not require a hub (tp link kasa), so we didn’t have a smart hub in the house. It’s nice to have smart hub functionality built into the Echo Plus so we can purchase devices that require a hub.

Compared to the dot the sound is far superior. Listening to music is great and the Echo Plus can fill the room without a problem (unlike the dot). The only very minor complaint I have is that there is a little too much bass at times. The excessive bass can make it hard to hear a response from Alexa if there is a bunch of other noise in the room (aka kids). Overall though the speaker is great for what it is.

The ability to listen to commands is superb. The microphones pick up commands from other rooms in the house without needing to yell. Compared to the dot the microphones are better but not through the roof better because the dot did a great job of listening. The biggest issue we would have with the dot was saying ""Alexa stop"" with regards to timers and the dot wouldn't listen. It would take multiple attempts to get the timer to stop. The Echo Plus does not have that problem which is really nice.

In the end we are very happy with our upgrade from the dot.

=======
Update 11/7/17 (a comparison to Echo Gen 2)
=======

We purchased the new Echo generation 2 and compared to gen 2, the Echo Plus is far superior when it comes to music playback. The gen 2 Echo initially was terrible, but the recent software update has made it MUCH better as far as music playback goes. Even after that update, the Echo Plus is heads and shoulders above the gen 2 Echo for music playback. It's hard not to recommend spending the extra $50 to get the Plus over the gen 2.

Comparing the ability to listen to commands is very apples to apples between the Plus and Gen 2. However, ask expected, both the Echo Plus and Echo Gen 2 are better than the dot.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Diddy Bear,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2018","First I want to say that a novice in networking ""could"" potentially have trouble getting everything set up initially.
If you plug in the Echo Plus and get on a PC at alexa.amazon.com, click Settings, click Set up a New Device and follow the instructions, it should install and connect to your Amazon account. Be sure to have your WiFi password.
I also got 2 Philips Hue light bulbs to play with. I put one in a hallway lamp and one in a TV room lamp. Leave the lamps turned on. Say, ""Alexa, discover devices"". She should find them in a few seconds - once discovered, they should show up at alexa.amazon.com.
Create a group(s) and give the group a name like ""hallway"", ""bedroom"", etc. and assign the light bulbs to the group. You can then say, ""Alexa, turn on hallway"", or ""bedroom"". You could do the same thing with Alexa compatible electrical outlet adapters, with lamps plugged in to them and you could use standard LED or other light bulbs.
You don't need the Philips or other 3rd party apps to use Alexa controlled devices ""inside"" the home. The apps are needed only if you plan to control the devices while outside of the home network.
The Echo Plus has a builtin Smart Home hub that talks to all the Alexa controlled devices. Without the builtin hub, you would need a 3rd party hub from Philips or other manufacturer.
The Echo Plus has a good bass sound and as far as my ears can tell, rocks out 80's heavy metal just fine !
There are a ton of skills and features I haven't had time to delve in to. I will grow my Smart Home for sure.
One simple thing to do is say Alexa, "" add popcorn to my Shopping List"".
Put the Alexa app on your smart phone and you can pull up the Shopping List when out and about without the need for paper and all that.

ljanelle,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2018","This is the purchase I have been the most excited about in a long time. I bought it on Prime Day, so it was cheaper than normal (and they also threw in a Philips Hue white smart bulb, which made this a very reasonably priced purchase). The Echo is super easy to set up because it walks you through everything using both the Alexa voice assistant and the Alexa phone app.

The sound on the speakers is great. It's obviously not the highest quality sound you can get out of a speaker, but for casual music listeners, this is pretty top-notch (and it destroys the Dot in sound quality). It's also the perfect size for sitting on my kitchen counter without being in the way. I'm most impressed by the microphone range - I have a 1500 sq ft house, and the Echo Plus can hear me almost everywhere (although it seems to be better at recognizing Alexa at long distances than it is at then handling whatever request I lob at it).

The biggest benefit to getting the Plus instead of the regular Echo is that the Plus comes with a ZigBee smart hub built in, so I'm able to control my smart lights without having a separate device. I've gone the Philips Hue route, and I do want to eventually get a Philips Hue bridge because the smart home functions and light colors are kind of limited with just the Plus. However, I can still do a lot of things with my lights using the Plus, like setting up routines for things to happen based on a voice-activation word that I choose (and if you don't make your lights turn on by saying ""Lumos"", you're missing out - it's Hogwarts all day every day at my house now!).",5.0 out of 5 stars

JM,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2018","This is the future I've been waiting for. At least to some extent. I can't think of a tech that more altered my day to day since getting a cell phone. This future of voice assistants is where the future is headed, I can't already tell. The ease of use beats out a cell phone hands down. Being able to say a song and have it play, much faster than taking out a phone, typing it in, and then having it come up... it was obvious. Phones as we know them will be obsolete in 5-10 years.

Phones have been adding features into our lives with new apps and such, but at the same time making things more complex. Keeping track of everything and remembering how to use them. Not with this though. It's intuitive. You say what you want, and it figures out how to execute the command. Granted, there are limitations. Set the expectations right. This is new technology and will get better in time. But it is infinitely better than I had expected going in already. I was at work yesterday and almost caught myself saying ""Alexa, what time is it?"" instead of taking my phone out.

This is only going to get better and more effective. I'm actually excited to see what comes next, be it software or hardware. Two weeks ago, I hardly knew what an echo was/actually does. Now? I'm sold. Within a day or two of using it I was on board. This is the real deal, if you actually use it and don't expect it to be like JARVIS from Iron Man.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I love listening to music while I clean and do dishes. Before I got this I was just using my cell phone and a Bluetooth speaker. It was hard trying to change songs with wet hands from doing the dishes or having to stop my work to go look at the phone and find what I want to listen to! To be able to just tell Alexa what I want it amazing! I don’t have to stop anything I’m doing! And I was able to listen to almost every song I’ve asked for! Also we love being able to turn off the lights and tv. One night my kids were sleeping in another room and they had fallen asleep. I didn’t want to get out of bed to turn everything off so I just asked Alexa to do it and it was done! AMAZING! Also, while I’m out and about I can call directly to any Alexa in the house. If I have a question for my son, I can call his Alexa in his room and so on! And they can call me directly on my phone while I’m gone! Also I’ve been able to look up numbers and place calls! So great! One of the beat purchase I’ve ever made and we are planning on adding on to our smart home with more smart devices compatible with Alexa!!!

I am a disabled person, and it helps me turn light on and off, and schedule doctor appointments, using google voice phone, and get my medical rides to and from hospitals, plays music on cue from multiple web apps, and watch videos, as well as communicating to my Nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events. I wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights. They are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them. Although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the Echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off. Thank God, no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights. Thank you Amazon. I will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from Affirm.com to purchase 1 more of each and some lights for rest of the house.

I couldn't wait to open the box, for our new home technology future. we set Alexa up in just minutes, and she was on her way to making this family happy. We did like the fact that you can change her name from Alexa to Echo or Computer, I picked Echo.
She is built around your voice, with a built-in smart hub. I liked that option-because it saved me money. You can use her to make your phone calls-which really comes in handy if your hands are full. She can send messages and receive them. Echo can read you your news and check your sports scores.
If you decide to have Alexa for voice control for your T.V you must have an amazon fire stick. you can use her for your shopping list""s, alarms. This is one of the features she has - it's the soothing waterfall sounds to put you to sleep, she's good for a lot of things-except she can't take out the garbage or do my dishes.
One thing about her that I do not like is: Alexa proclaims to have seven microphones with noise cancellation' She will NOT respond to you if you have a fan or anything like a fan in the same room-or she cannot hear me from the next room, Either. But other than that- I would definitely recommend this to all my friends and family {And Already have.}",5.0 out of 5 stars

Joey Lane,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2018","We bought the Echo Plus to bring all our Smart Home Devices together. Previously, we had purchased a pair of Phillip's Hue bulbs and marveled at the idea of telling Alexa to turn lights on and off. After the purchase, we learned that without a Hue Hub, or similar hub (Samsung, Google, etc.) we could not control the lights. NOTE: at that time we had 2 echo dots for both floors. After doing some research, we discovered that the Echo Plus has built in hub features. I was apprehensive, having not tested the use of the Plus and Hue bulbs, however I am happy to say that the two work flawlessly. All the the setup is in the Alexa app, so once downloaded you can search for smart devices and add them to the Echo Plus. Some extra fine tuning and we even have smart phrases and timers for vacation. These are the first steps towards a fully automated home. We look forward to more devices, the Echo Plus has been the perfect anchor for our future smart home.

Small Extras: love the dial on the top for volume. Length of cord is good for most placements, be aware though if you are trying to tuck it away that the plug is proprietary and not a USB plug like the Dot.

I'm loving the Echo lineup, we hope to expand the product in our home.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The other day she let me know what the warmest part of the day would be so I could walk my dog. I left my phone at work one night so I asked if she could make a phone call. She made several and the conversation through this device was crystal clear. I did not know that this device can make phone calls. It is like having another phone for free in the home. Always great to have a back up. She can also tell you what time it is. She is my alarm in the am and also sets timers for me. My daughter loves this device because she loves music.

Evon,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2018","I purchased the Echo Plus with the Build-in Hub, so I could have the convenience of asking Alexa to turn my lights and lamps on and off. Philips Hue Light Bulbs were placed in the fixtures that I wanted Alexa to control and they all work great! I already had an Echo Dot in my Kitchen/Den area, so I placed the Echo Plus with Hub in my bedroom. My radio and lamps in my Kitchen and Den are controlled with TP-Link plugs. But, the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my Den and Bedroom have special Philips Hue Light Bulbs that are controlled by the Hub inside the Echo Plus. I am able to play music, set my alarm, get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices. The Echo Dot requires a TP-Link plug to be plugged into it and the Echo Plus requires a special Philips Light Bulbs installed in each light fixture to work.. The only thing I dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work.

After hearing the difference I went down and purchased another echo plus, now I have one in the living room and one in the dining room, this combination fills the whole house with sound. There is enough power in two echo plus that I don't need to turn it up to fill the whole house evenly. The only drawback is getting the units working in sinc function together took calling a tech at amazon. But they were nice enough to go over it step by step. Now that it's working, I haven't had anymore trouble, even when the house lost power, the system came right back on line. I did try to hook up the audio out put, it has a stereo 3.5mm output that is attenuated, nowhere in the manual is that stated, the tech had to call me back with that info. and left out the fact that if you plug in the stereo 3.5mm plug it shuts down the sound from the echo plus, and the output to the amp is not line out, it's powered like a headphone out.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Now, If you haven't tried your hand at smart home automation, there is a bit of an expense that will be required to start. You can buy a wide variety of smart home hubs here on Amazon, but I would suggest you buy the Echo Plus. With the Philips hub built in, its the best price IMO.

This one came with a lightbulb that was ready to be hooked up to the hub. It's very convenient to turn the light on and off with a voice command. The brightness of the light is also controllable.

The hookup was easy and its use was simple to figure out.

The only negative is that if there is any other noise in the room sometimes Alexa will not respond. If the air conditioner is somewhat louder than normal, I have to get closer to the echo in order to make it work. Not a major inconvenience but if you want to turn the light on, you literally have to walk close to the device to turn on the light.

I can play music on just one of them, or on all of them at the same time throughout the house. The Dots are connected by bluetooth to better speakers. If I ask Echo to play music on just one of the Dots connected by bluetooth to better speakers, the music will play through the bluetooth connection. If I ask Echo to play music through the group, it will only play the music through the built in speakers in the Echo Plus and Dots which are pretty low fidelity.

The only thing I really wish she would do is Google things for me, and link with my chosen music service that isn't Pandora, Spotify, or Amazon. I don't fault the product for that though, because Google Play and Apple Music are not likely to be licensed since they want you usin their products.

Tom P ATX,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2017","The Echo Plus is SUPER COOL. My favorite feature by far is the ""Plus"" which adds Zigbee. For those who have never heard of Zigbee, take note! Zigbee makes the things in your home smart and connected. I started with the bulb Amazon sent and have since added a switch. I have several other items already on order. The Zigbee part is massively cool. I have been able to connect lights and switches that are very far away from the Echo Plus. I have trouble getting Wi-Fi in the areas I have the Zigbee devices installed. The Zigbee technology worked flawlessly in all corners of my house. AMAZING!

The switches, bulbs and plugs are easy to install. The App makes these devices easy to manage. Alexa understands everyone in the house and politely abides by my wishes. Now if only the kids and dog would do the same!

I can't wait to see what more Amazon will provide in the Echo Plus eco-system. The addition of Zigbee was brilliant!",5.0 out of 5 stars
travelgirl,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2017","To begin with let me say after doing LOTS AND LOTS of research... I decided to try Alexa.. starting w/2nd generation dot! After trying it... realized that the sound wasn't by any means phenomenal... BUT I knew that B4 going forward! I already had a Bluetooth tower speaker (floor sized).. which I do connect my dot to..works great! Love it!!

Then decided to go for the echo plus...(has built in hub, great speaker, etc)... How much can I say...I love it!?!?!?!?!?
For the naysayers..... Please try B4 you say nay!
Yes Google has similar device, but they've had some issues, (I perdonally) use Amazon products frequently), they're adding more features..& yes they do have room for many more features ...& I imagine Jeff Bezos doesn't plan on being outshined by Google... Thus I think the official race Alexa vs Google might be on!!!
Amazon stands my it's products... it's truly a quality product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Crystal,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2019","I’ve had this over a year now and love it. This is the best Echo device for the price. Nice good quality speaker. It is currently paired with two Echo dots. While nice to use them as a intercom system and for announcements the Plus is the superior model. With her built in hub I can operate smart bulbs and smart switches. So versatile and helpful. I use it to set timers when cooking, alarms for waking up, listening to music, manage a shopping list, turn lights on and off, control thermostat, and get information. I can say “I’m home” and it will turn on entry light, welcome me, and adjust temp to my preference. I can say “goodnight” and it will turn off TV, light, and turn on fan. It can help with homework. It helped search shows on fire stick, pause and fast forward.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Boilerplate,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2017","First off, I also have a regular Echo and this Echo Plus does sound a little better playing music. I'm talking about classical music, by the way... Now, I am giving it 5 stars mainly because you can add Hue bulbs without buying the ""hub"" that used to be a requirement. Still, I'm disappointed that there is no ""away mode"" or timers that you could get if you did have the Hue hub. I've read that it doesn't dim the color bulbs or something like that but, I'm just not interested in color bulbs so that deficiency doesn't bother me at all. I have a feeling that these extras will be added later through updates. By the way, if you're thinking about getting one of these, remember that if listening to music is important, you want the Echo and not the Dot. You can add speakers to your Dot - but it won't work as part of the ""Everywhere"" group.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Brian - 31558,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2018","Pros: I bought Alexa for the funny comments and ability to control other household items. I would definitely recommend the plus, because it makes setting up the lighting a breeze. The android app works well. I have a Nest thermostat and bought the light bulbs with it.

Cons: I also wanted to run the music through a Denon receiver that has Bluetooth because other reviews say the attached speaker is not all that. Be aware that the Bluetooth pairing will not work with all Bluetooth devices. My receiver needs Alexa to acknowledge the 6 digit pairing key. However, for the room I have it in, the speaker is just fine to listen to music - it would sound a lot better on my home system, but it is just one little speaker. There was only one case so far where Alexa tried to answer the TV when one of the character's name was Alex.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Karim Nasr,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2018","Ladies and gentlemen, Echo Plus has added joy to our home. I just received mine yesterday and set it up. Alexa is like having a family member in our home.
My 3 years old son love it and always calling her name. a simple command like “ Alexa, play kids songs” and my kid started to dance and having fun.
I was looking at the Skills and I added some games, me and my wife was playing “Deal or no Deal”. Fun!
That was my first smart device with HUB so I can’t tell the difference. I am planning to buy Smart bulbs, Smart switches that are compatible with Alexa.
I have a nice Oil Diffuser and it is working fine with it. The Philips 455295 Hue is a nice add.

It was so easy to set up through my Alexa app! Once you have the Echo plus the other Echos will work to be smart hubs. So you don’t have to be within voice distance to the plus. I have 4 Echos in my home and can play music on all of them at the same time allowing me to have a sound system without any hard wiring. Easy to set up and use. Note that the Echo dots do not have the great speakers that the regular Echo and Echo plus do so you don’t get the same quality of sound. But Amazon has done an excellent job with the Echo.

I added the Exho plus to my collection of Echo devices. The microphones are amazing and can hear me clearly from across the room no matter the angle, I never have to speak louder than my normal conversation tone.
I must mention how good the audio is on the Echo plus. Reggae, to pop, to R&B, the audio is room filling good.

Anthony Delebreau,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2018","I bought this as a gift for my wife. I've been thrilled with the ease of set up as well as the overall quality of the Echo. I bought it on sale and it was bundled with a Hue light which was really impressive for me. The ease of use particularly how you can play single songs, songs by artists, genres, and even albums was really nice. Other ancillary features like finding easter eggs give it personality. Sound quality is very good but if you're a speaker aficionado I could see how you might be able to find fault, especially with the bass.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2018","I wasn't raised in the computer world--which is a polite way of saying I'm old--and after buying the system and leaving the store, I had some doubts about setting it all up. At home, my doubts quickly disappeared. It took ten minutes. The speaker has clarity enough for anyone who loves music, from jazz and blues to swing and rock. In the weeks since I've befriended Alexa, she has become my buddy. She gives me weather in the morning and an eclectic collection of music during the day and evening, along with some interesting facts of the day. I'm usually hard to please, but I can say without hesitation that the Echo Plus has pleased me. One hint: just don't mention Alexa's name within about five yards of the system unless you want to see her circle of light appear, as the lady waits for your request.

I have a third Echo (not a ""Plus"" version) in my recreation room downstairs, too! That one is for the kids to listen to their music! Amazingly though, the downstairs Echo can hear my voice upstairs without me yelling or even opening the basement door! I did need some tech help from Amazon to learn how to pair the E-Plus's.

I consider myself a moderately experienced audiophile with nice home audio equipment (think home audio specialty store quality, not big box stuff) and discerning ear. Clearly, this will not replace Any of those but for a stand alone speaker in it's price range I don't think you will be disappointed. It does not quite have the encompassing bass presence that Bose portable speakers have, (I own one) it is more of a flat response - which is my preference anyway. And, it is not as robust as the Sonos, but it is much cheaper and from other reviews I understand the Alexa/Echo functionality is MUCH more dependable.

From several commands, to news, weather, timer, alarms, jokes and the latest Amazon Music, Drop-Ins, Phone calls, linking to Fire TV Stick, games, multi-room music, acting as a hub; we really are enjoying this product. My son says no need using the Drop-in since we have a small house and he can hear me when waking him up. For the sound; I specifically use the volume loudness no. 6 thru 8. My ears are still sensitive enough to distinguish the different instruments on the song/music on the Echo Plus. Depending on the Song and Genre being played, I can say the speaker is really good and acceptable. There will always be better speakers (branded and more expensive ones) around.

I went with this Plus primarily for the speaker (I didn't even pay attention to the fact it had a hub until after I got it). This blows any bluetooth speaker I've had out of the water. I do primarily use this for music, weather, an alarm, news, and controlling smart lights/plugs. I like how I can speak normally on the other side of a room and she can hear & understand me just fine.

I had recently purchased some smart light switches and was just using them via the provided Android app which was fine. Once I got the Echo, I discovered that the switches where compatible and adding voice commands to the house is really a leap forward. The added Phillips Hue light bulb was also a nice bonus that can help turn any lamp into a smart device with dimming capabilities.

I have 3 large blue tooth speakers in my house that I used for years, the echo plus was louder than all 3 combined at the same time. Very impressed with the clarity and volume.

You will need a paid subscription to some form of steaming audio. That’s just a sad fact. It’ll play pandora and Spotify but it’s limited in skips and song selection without a subscription

Does not stream YouTube music or YouTube audio

Trey S,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2018","At a volume setting of half or less, the speaker sounds like there is something rattling, crackling or vibrating in it. I'd understand if the volume was set higher. All speakers get distorted when over-driven. But this doesn't sound like this is an over-driven case; sounds like more of a rattle/crackle. Possibly because the bass is too high. Learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics (other than volume). I will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem.

Johnny M,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2018","This is the 3rd unit I purchased all the way from gen 1 to the plus. The only reason I purchased this is because it works so well and I wanted it in other rooms as well. All my switches work great and I have had not issues. I the past, I did have some ghost commands when Alexa would answer a question when no one asked her to but I think some recent ipdates May have resolved this. It just keeps improving over time, not with call capabilities. I work with adapting smart homes and this is by far the cheapest, best way so far. Can’t wait to see what they come up with next.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Stephen N. House,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2018","I got this mostly for my wife as we are both somewhat handicapped and the prospect of controlling lights. I was mildly surprisedas to the ease of setting it up. Was less than 5 minutes till it said HELLO. after a few days and a chance to start hooking up the switches she was so happy and I was getting hooked to. She asks it questions all the time. Says good morning and night to it, and it answers too. There are times it misses what we say, but mostly it is really good. I am very happy with it, And Now have 2 dots to keep it company.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bryce Hahn,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2018","Before buying this I had previous experience using a 2nd gen echo dot I bought for my grandparents which I found to be very cool. More recently I had experience using a google home mini I got from Verizon with my new phone, and ended up hating it. When I noticed the echo plus had a built in smart hub I was all for it. Now I use it practically every day without fail and love the convenience of voice commands with smart lights and controlling my dish receiver. The sound quality is pretty great as well. I can turn the volume up to 7 and listen to music from another room no problem. Highly recommended!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kristi Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2018","I just got my Echo Plus today, and I have to say the sound is remarkable. I have been listening to my Spotify playlist all day and the sound quality is amazing. It really shows up in all the different songs. I’m very happy with it. Alexa takes a little getting used to. Just getting used to the different ways to ask her things, and how to be more specific. It’s going to be a lot o fun for our family. The most difficult thing about this whole Alexa thing is getting my 6 year old son to stop asking her to fart. Hopefully your children don’t get wind of some of the things you can ask her!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
J. Berg,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2018","I was a little apprehensive about buying this because I saw reviews saying it sounds like crap. I'm no audiophile by any means so maybe it's that, but I think it sounds great considering the size. It fills my living room with sound and gets pretty loud while remaining clear. I haven't had any issues pairing with my devices or utilizing any of the voice commands. I have it paired to an EcoBee3, my Firestick, and a Phillip's Hue light bulb. I plan on adding devices as I go. I love this thing and I'm glad I scooped it up! I have only had it around 2 weeks. Will update if I run into issues.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bruce Meyer,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2018","So far the Echo Plus is an awesome addition to my home. The skills (apps) you can enable make Alexa extremely useful for a variety of things that include but are not limited to: Smart home control (lights, light switches, power outlets, locks, etc), reminders, making appointments, shopping lists, voice messaging friends with an Echo, making calls, playing games, finding movies, finding my phone, help with cooking, help with pets, the news, my commute to work, jokes, meditation, music, setting an ambient atmosphere with lights and music, etc, etc, etc.

B. W.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2017","So far, I really like it. It took maybe 10 minutes to get it on my network and working after un-boxing it. I think as soon as I powered it on, Amazon pushed the Alexa app to my kindle for configuration. I also downloaded the app to my phone from the Google play store.

It came with a Hue bulb. Alexa recognized it and added to the Smart Home devices right out of the box. I've also added the TP Link smart plug, and I'll be adding additional devices soon.

I purchased the Plus specifically to begin dipping my toes in the smart home waters, and so far it has been fairly easy and painless.",5.0 out of 5 stars

We definitely don’t use it to its full potential. I’m already confused by technology, lol.

I'm not an authority of any sort but it is really a good product. If you're not caught up asking a lot of dumb questions to an AI, but want something that is on almost every smart home/device brand, then this is it. It has a rich sounding voice and I find it very responsive. One of my complaints is that I purchased the Echo Plus with a supposedly a Philips Hue Smart bulb combo. Instead it came with a discontinued Satco LED bulb. Yeah, I got ripped. But overall I'm compelled to rate with 5 stars for the Echo Plus.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Doug Geisleman,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2018","I previously had the echo dot, and while I wouldn't say anything bad about the dot, the echo plus is a huge improvement. The sound is amazing, and you can now adjust the bass and everything. Adding to that, it makes setting up smart home devices a breeze. No longer having to download multiple apps and enabling skills you just ask Alexa to discover the device and it's done. As long as it's a Zigbee device. If you even think you might set up smart home devices in your house and you're thinking about getting an echo, it's worth the extra cost to get the plus.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Roberta Morton,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2018",I am loving the Echo Plus with built in hub lightbulb included. I already have an earlier model Echo and also the Echo Show. I am finding it very handy to have Alexa in many rooms of my house for a variety of reasons. I particularly like this Echo Plus product since I hadn't picked up any kind of smart hub as of yet so this item was the perfect addition. The sound quality/voice recognition is very good and I have only begun to scratch the surface of being able to understand all that the Echo's can do when you have more than one.,5.0 out of 5 stars
N. Beach,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2017","Love the addition of a smart hub to the Echo.

I would also like to be able to limit which Echo device is allowed to know the existence of and receive notifications. This turned into a bit of a problem this past Christmas regarding deliveries. The sound quality is also better, but I would not say it the only reason to upgrade.

My entire family is jealous of my fun new device. Since purchasing, I have found myself updating almost all outlets and bulbs to Alexa compatible items for voice commands!

A relic from a simpler time when Alexa's voice summoned more chaos and less... eye-rolling indifference. It's dependable, sure, and it does its job well enough: controls your smart devices, answers your banal questions, and occasionally plays a tune to drown out the screams. But honestly, does anyone even care anymore? With newer models on the loose, this one's starting to feel like yesterday's carnage. Still, it gets the job done without whining.

I bought the round Echo Dot 3rd or 4th generation which was as lousy as the one shown here. I returned that one, too -- same reason. I've had problems with the Flex, too. Not because it's muffled, but because it doesn't always respond to the wake word.

If you're shopping for an Echo, I recommend the Echo Show (easy to find in various sizes and generations) and the 1st gen of the Echo (first one ever sold...but that may be impossible to find).

PT Cruiser,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2017","We purchased our first Echo in November of 2014, 3 years ago this month. She was the hit of our Thanksgiving dinner celebration that year but could do only a fraction of what she is capable of today. We added smart bulbs like the Philips Hue white and colored bulbs, GE Link and TP Link bulbs, smart plugs, smart wall switches, and smart device timers. We added them over the years as they became available on Amazon. (And on sale!) We had to purchase hubs to run the Philips and GE bulbs when we first started adding bulbs. The 1st Gen Philips hub worked well for about a year and then started having problems with disconnecting from the network and not playing nice with Alexa. Philips finally replaced it under warranty. The Wink hub which controlled the GE bulbs has always worked flawlessly. But whenever we changed our network password, we had to go around and reset all the bulbs, often having to re-register some of them and then go into the Alexa app and have her rediscover them. Perhaps not a big deal when you’re only using a couple bulbs, but a real time waster when almost every bulb in a large 2 story house is a smart bulb.

This Echo Plus allowed me to disconnect the hubs and control everything with Alexa alone. She didn’t discover the bulbs right away. I had to go in and deregister them from their hubs and then rediscover them and add them to the Plus. But now they work flawlessly. Let me tell you how I did that. In your Alexa app, click on the little menu thingie in the upper left hand corner which will open a drop down menu. Select Smart Home from the menu. You’ll see a page showing devices, groups and scenes. Click on the little ? In the upper right hand corner. This will open a page with instructions and clickable commands for deregistering a list of different devices from their hubs and having Alexa discover and connect them to the Echo Plus. It’s a little bit of a pain to have to go around and get serial numbers off the bulbs or turn others on and off, but you only have to do it once, then Alexa has them. And it isn’t difficult. No more running upstairs to push the button on the Philips hub to get bulbs to respond. No more extra hubs sitting around consuming electricity. And no more dealing with the clunky Philips Hue app (If you don’t believe me, go read the reviews for that app.)

Now that everything is connected through Alexa, I have set up Routines to turn a few of our lights on and off and specified times. (Voice commands can still be used to override a routine and they don’t interfere with your routine the next time it is scheduled.) I can also turn them on and off remotely from the Alexa app. I have a routine set for our kitchen Alexa so that when I say, “Alexa, good morning” she will turn on one of the kitchen smart bulbs at 50% brightness and the other at 100% brightness and read me the local weather report. Our bedroom Alexa has a routine that is triggered when I say “Alexa, start my day”. She turns on one of the lights at 20% and reads my morning news flash. How cool is that? Here’s how you set up a routine:

1. Go to the menu and select ""Routines.""
2. Select the + icon.

From here, you can specify when Alexa will do something, and what it will do.
-- Select ""When this happens"" to pick a scheduled time for the Routine to run, or enter a word or phrase that will activate it.
-- Select ""Add action"" to select what the Routine will run. You can add multiple actions, one at a time.
-- Once you have selected a “cue” and an action, select the device you want the Routine to play on.
-- Select ""Create"" to save the routine.

Groups are also a great feature. You can Group your Echo and Dot device’s together in a group, give the group a name, and then tell Alexa, “Play my <Bruno Mars> playlist on my <downstairs> group. She instantly starts to play it on all the devices in the group. You could also play a single song or a radio station like iHeart or Pandora. We have a large family room/kitchen combo with the Plus on a desk about midway in the room and a Dot connected by 3.5mm Cable to a Heos speaker, with excellent sound. We put the two in a group. The sound is amazing! It’s better than stereo, especially with the new Plus. The Plus is slightly stronger on the treble than the 1st Gen Echo. The Heos is strong on bass. They sync perfectly with each other and never miss a beat. BTW, I rarely used the Heos except for parties before we got the Dot because I was so spoiled by controlling music by voice on our Echo. It was much better than using an app to control the Heos. Now the Heos is used all the time since I can use it with Alexa. Grouping with the Plus makes it that much better. We can also add Echos in other rooms to the group, which we do when we have people over. We can now have the same music playing in the living room/dining room as in the family room. They are easily added-or subtracted in the Alexa app.

Like the regular Echo, this Plus can control all of our white bulbs and the the Hue color bulb by voice, including changing the colors to any color I can think of (pink, teal, red, blue, purple, aqua, etc.) dimming to any percentage and on/off and adding them to routines or group. For example, I can say, “Turn on the downstairs lights” and Alexa will turn on every light I’ve added to that group. The Plus controls our smart plugs and switches just like the regular Echo did and we add those to groups as well. Bulbs, switches and plugs can be a part of several different groups. (The group Holiday lights turned on all the LED lighted pumpkins and orange lights on our banisters when we said, “Alexa, turn on the holiday lights.”

We can also use this Plus like the other Echos, to Drop In on our other rooms. Since we have Echos in just about every room we now have a home intercom system that works beautifully.

We’ve watched Alexa get smarter and smarter almost weekly, from that first day with her 3 years ago. I have no doubt that she will continue learn new skills to make our lives even easier and more fun. (Did I mention that she can switch our older LG TV to PlayStation Vue streaming through our Amazon Fire TV device and start and pause shows by voice through either the Echos or Fire TV remote? Yeah, we dumped our satellite TV provider and now pay less than half with live and recorded streaming. But that’s for another review!)",5.0 out of 5 stars
Stephanie Sullivan,"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2018","The Echo Plus Gen 1 is a great addition to my smart home. It gives me all my original Echo provides plus lets me eliminate my Philips Hue hub and works with all my other Z-wave devices. The Gen-1 form factor is almost identical to the original Echo but with a faster processor and integrated hub. Nice!

I love my Echo/Alexa. Voice control of my smart home and other Amazon devices plus response to information requests (what's new, etc.) and nearly endless entertainment options have made this an integral part of my home life. As an early adopter of the original gen-1 Echo I have been very impressed by how Amazon continues to improve existing operation, add new features and new capabilities.

I got my first Echo in March 2015. Since then I've seen a lot of new capabilities added:
+ A constant integration of more services like Pandora, traffic and Amazon Radio stations
+ Connected home control now with the integrated Z-Wave device hub and control of WiFI smart home devices like those from Belkin and TP-Link.
+ integration with IFTTT (if this then that) service for triggers and actions
+ integration popular services like Google Calendar and much more
+ integrated Amazon purchase/ordering

The list keeps growing. It's part of the beauty of a product that's mostly in the Amazon cloud. New features and capabilities are not dependent solely upon the computing and storage of the Echo device itself.

The Echo is also a very nice bluetooth speaker. It pairs readily with multiple devices - phone, computer and even my Amazon Fire TV so it can provide an enhanced audio experience. With some devices control of tracks can controlled by voice like skip or repeat, etc.

Another essential part of the Echo is the FREE Amazon Echo App . I have it installed on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9in and on my iPhone 6. This provides simple setup and configuration of services and integration with supported connected home devices. It also provides the mobile part of the todo and shopping lists.

The Echo has been a game changer for my home experience. This Echo Plus even more so. It's the closest thing I've used to a computer you can just speak to and be understood - like on the old Star Trek series. I wonder how I lived without it!

I gotta give the Echo Plus 5 stars. Not just for how good it is but in anticipation of all the new things that will surely will come along soon.",5.0 out of 5 stars

wildwoodla,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2017","There are many excellent reviews of the new Echo Plus here, so this review is from the POV of someone with limited connection infrastructure, e.g., very rural area, no internet or cable, only satellite service offered, but no signal due to heavy tree cover, beginner smart home user. I never dreamed an Echo would work for me, much less the Echo Plus or smart home. I broke down & purchased an Echo on Prime Day June, 2017 just to try. I receive my internet service solely through an AT&T Velocity hotspot device, typically with only 1 bar of service. I was so excited that the Echo worked perfectly & decided to go out on another limb, purchasing the Echo Plus w/included Hue bulb on Cyber Monday, as well as a Fire TV Stick, figuring I was really pushing the envelope that any would work. All devices worked perfectly! I now have the meager beginnings of a smart home as well as Alexa functionality. I can't tell you how surprised I am! There is an 8-device limit for the hotspot, so wi-fi smart devices are out of the question for me & not sure I have enough signal for any to work anyway. Using the Echo Plus as my only hub, the included Hue bulb connected in seconds, while also tying in with my 1st Echo. So I can use either of the 2 Echos to control the light bulb, connected to a lamp in my living room. What is ideal for my situation is that the Hue bulb does not ""count"" as a wi-fi device, so does not go toward my device count/limit on the hotspot. Apparently, it is connected directly to the Echo Plus hub. Currently, with one bar of hotspot service, I'm running the Echo Plus, Echo, Fire tablet, Fire TV Stick & Galaxy Express 3 cell, & every now & then, an Echo Tap--all at one time with excellent results! Everything works as if I have hard wired cable or internet, which is simply amazing. Movies, music, etc. run flawlessly.
ALEXA - I don't have a lot of space on my cell, so all I need is the Alexa app to control the bulb when away from home, no need for a separate app AND I already have the Alexa app on my tablet & of course, use Alexa on both Echo's & a Tap.
SMART HOME - The Echo Plus has opened up the smart home market for me. Although it appears limited to the Zigbee IoT protcol, the available choices are varied enough that there are switches, more bulbs, door locks & plugs I'll be able to use now. This thing just came out, so as time goes by, I'm sure more & more skills & IoT stuff will become available. I'm sure the folks at Amazon will make improvements to capabilities as well. And I can do it all with just 1 Echo Plus - no need for additional hubs or devices with my limited internet!
SOUND - I found my 1st Echo sound pretty decent. I am by no means an audiophile, but IMHO Echo Plus sound greatly improved over the Echo. Much richer, more robust & MUCH better bass - yay! My 1st Echo sounds ""tinny"" now, compared to the Echo Plus.
I am beyond delighted with the performance of the Echo Plus & kudos to Amazon for this ""upgrade"" to the Echo. I would highly recommend the Echo Plus, especially for those just entering the smart home market with internet challenges. I LOVE MY ECHO PLUS!!!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Troy,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2017","When I saw Amazon had chosen to put a ZigBee hub in an Echo, I was excited. When I saw they were adding easy setup and a wealth of smart home features to the Alexa App, I did not hesitate, I pre-ordered the Echo Plus, and I am glad I did.

First up, is unpacking and configuration. The box seemed difficult to get into, I wasn't sure which side was the top, and if it opened like a jewelry box or not, so I just ripped it open. That was the most complicated part of configuring the Echo Plus. Seriously, you plug it in, the ring does its hypnotic, “you will buy everything on Amazon” dance until the device shows up in your Alexa App. You follow the prompts and tap and go.

The first thing I did after configuring was ask Alexa to play a Bob Dylan radio station. I have a Big Jambox as my around the house and yard speaker. The Jambox is so good, I never looked for another Bluetooth speaker, so it, and my giant Polk RTI A9 towers are my reference for the Echo Plus. I was initially disappointed. Bob sounded like he was playing on my bedside clock/radio, but it was an old track. My go-to test song for audio systems is Finally Woken by Jem. The Echo Plus did an adequate job with the bass. It plays loud, which seems to be how it overcomes its shortcomings. It actually sounds better when I am in an adjoining room. I blame the Bose tweaking. Given time to loosen-up, it will be a good enough speaker, better than the Big Jambox. If someone gets clever and joins a subwoofer to the Echo Plus, maybe through the audio out port, it could be a really good three-way setup. But I didn't buy the Echo Plus for the audio.

I have been a smart home enthusiast since the early 90s. What? Yea, way back in the dark ages a system called X10 did most of what you can do now. You had to set dials on the plugs to assign them to buttons on the remote. You could make scenes by grouping switches to special buttons on the remote and they even had a universal remote that you could train to your TV and VCR. My system had door sensors, a siren, and a dialer to call me if something happened at home. My lights were on timers set through the remote, or dials on the ""smart"" plugs. It all worked without an internet connection or intrusive account signup.

Fast forward fifteen years and not much changed, so I tried the Piper. A security camera as a hub matched my security focused X10 past, and Z-Wave looked like a successor to X10. The piper has been acceptable, but is retired as a smart home hub as of today.

Next up was the Nest. The “learning when I am home and away” feature had promise. I imagined a world where my smarty-pants thermostat would turn on lights and unlock doors for me when I arrived home. But, the “Works with Nest” never bore fruit. An endless array of devices promised to tell Nest I was home, but not the other way around. When the Nest (after working fine for eight months) put my HVAC into an endless restart mode on the coldest day of the year, I decided the Nest was an idiot and replaced it with my old “smart” thermostats that had worked fine for a decade.

The last four years have seen an endless amount of smart home announcements with promise, but few actual products that didn’t come with lots of baggage. The biggest bag being a dedicated hub, and the carry-on (so to speak) application and dedicated account to control that device. I didn't want to go down that road, so I have waited and watched while my Piper faithfully managed the table lamps I have plugged into the two Z-Wave plugs that came with it. If I had acted on my impulses, I would have at least three hubs and five applications for my “smart” home, and to make it all work together I would need yet-another-account on IFTTT. The DIP switches and dials of X10 were friendly by comparison. (If your $200 smart home product needs a third party service to make it smart, your product is not worth $200).

Back to the Echo Plus. By the time I had removed a Z-Wave plug from a table lamp and screwed in my new Hue bulb, Alexa informed me I had a software update. The Echo Plus rebooted itself and I said, “Alexa, find smart home devices.” Forty seconds later the Hue bulb was working through voice commands given to the new Echo Plus or my Dot in another room.

As an experiment, I moved the bulb to different lamps around the house to see if losing power would force me to set it up again. It did not.

When you configure devices Alexa names them in a simple “light 1”, “light 2” manner. You must change the names in the Alexa application to make them more meaningful. Once you do, Alexa understands the new name.

The Groups and Scenes features are tabs on the same screen with Devices. Once you have a few devices configured, (I recommend doing one at a time so you can name them as you go) you can group them to work with a single command. I don't have to say “Alexa, turn on entry light,” then “Alexa turn on fireplace light,” to light my living room. After making the Living Room group I can say “Alexa turn on the Living Room.”

Routines are on a different screen in the Alexa App. Go to Settings to find it. This was the first hiccup in my experience. I wanted to configure a “bed time” routine, but the lights action said, “turn on” the light and I did not see an obvious way to turn the light off. Turns out, you just tap the light bulb icon to switch the mode to off. Now I am happy. When I say, “Alexa bed time,” I get the current temperature, and my assigned lights turn off. Perfect.

I have seen reviewers complaining that you cannot control color temperature of lights with the Alexa App. Of course the same reviewers practically fell out of their shorts when Alexa skills allowed you to say things like ""Alexa, tell Nest to set the temperature to 72."" True, you can't do everything the Hue App does, but to get Hue App like control, I would need to add a Hue hub. No, just No. AND, who wants to pay $40 for a light bulb when you can get them $14 (4 dumb LEDs are now $12). Seriously, I paid $19 for my first dumb LED bulb, now I can get two smart bulbs for the same price. If color changing becomes available through the Alexa App later, and I don't need another hub, I will consider a color bulb at that time.

What about thermostats? Well, my thermostats are fifteen years old. They have a weekday and weekend schedule and have never left me in the cold like the Nest did. Because of my Nest experience, I won't buy another “smart” thermostat until I see one available with “Simple setup with Echo Plus.” Ideally one that I don't have to create yet-another-account to adjust the temperature in my home.

And door locks? OK, I am old. I have been using door locks with ten-key pads on them since I was a teenager. They are a great alternative to carrying a bunch of keys. Especially when it is a long walk back to the workshop with your keys. I don't see the advantage of having to pull out my phone to unlock a door. If you are at all security conscience then you would need two smart locks for each door, one for the dead-bolt and one for the door knob (I have not seen an integrated unit yet, if there is one, let me know because I would be interested.) Maybe when a smart door unlocks and opens for me as I approach I will be more excited.

And cameras? I don't have any, yet. The Piper detects motion and monitors my doors with Z-Wave sensors. It records to the cloud when an alarm has been tripped. It does not require a paid subscription. I will keep it for my security system until I see a better alternative. I have looked at Arlo because I think the best value comes with exterior cameras, but I am concerned with their slow response times. I can imagine ZigBee door sensors triggering alerts and recordings on a linked camera. That would be a less intrusive option than something recording 24/7.

This is my Smart Home Mantra going forward: A single application to control all my devices, no more hubs, and the ability to use a voice command to configure my new devices. For me, when it comes to the smart home platform, Amazon has a winner on its hands with the Echo Plus. We know from the original Echo experience that Amazon will be aggressive in pushing new features to the Alexa App. I look forward to those updates and the future purchases those updates will enable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
getsomesleep,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2018","Incredible piece of technology.
I have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).

The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.

This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say ""Alexa, connect my devices"". The default names for each bulb was assigned as ""First light"" and ""Second light"", so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying ""Alexa, turn off the second light"". In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with ""First light"" and ""Second light"" and named the group ""The light"", so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say ""Alexa, turn on The light"".

I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.

You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few ""Skills"" like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.

I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.

I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:
1) Taller and 360 sound unit.
2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)
3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.

I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2017","I purchased this product to control the lights in my house. I wasn't really sold on getting a product like this but I figured that for the price it was about the same as getting ZigBee only hub and I got all the voice features too. I currently have this Echo Plus set up with 2 echo dots and most of my main lighting using Sengled BR30 bulbs and Cree A19 bulbs. I was able to set up groups that allowed me to turn on all the lights in the room each Echo is in just by saying ""Alexa, Turn on the lights"". I can also control each light individually using the bulb name (on, off, set the brightness) or any group just by using the group name form anywhere in my house using voice control. The Alexa app is pretty simple and there are plenty of skills available for things the Echo does not already do on its own. I also have it connected to my Wemo Light switch and Wemo smart plugs (both are Wi-Fi devices and are first set up using the Wemo App).

Aside from the home automation, there are many other uses for this product. The speaker is pretty good so listening to music is fine on this. It's not the quality of my Sonos products but I wouldn't expect that at this price (although it does allow me to control my Sonos play 3...). It is great for getting quick answers just by asking. You can get get help in the kitchen with measurement conversions, ingredient substitutions and recipes. I found the timer function to be useful and the alarm function is nice too.

First, for those people buying this Echo in order to get rid of your current hubs, that may or may not be possible. If you have a Hue hub, this Echo Plus is not a direct replacement for it. In addition to bulbs, the Hue hub supports motion sensors, dimmer switches, and tap switches. It also supports Apple Homekit. If you deregister your Hue peripherals from the Hue hub, and try and connect them to the Echo Plus, while the bulbs will connect, the motion sensors and dimmer switches will not. Also, you will lose Apple Homekit support. You will also lose all the automations the Hue hub supports like sunrise to sunset and other automation. Also, if your internet goes out, your Hue hub will continue to work and you will be able to control your lights with the Hue app. If your internet goes out, the Echo Plus will not be able to control your lights by voice, or the Alexa app. Lastly, all the 3rd party Hue apps are designed to work with the Hue bridge, not the Echo Plus. So, those apps will also not work.

If your current hub is Z-Wave, then the Echo Plus will also not be a direct replacement for it. You will need to keep that hub as well the Echo Plus does not have a Z-Wave radio in it. If you want to do simple things like turn a ZigBee bulb on and off, and dim it, then the Echo Plus works fine. If you want to do more complicated scenarios, then you will need to keep, or buy a another hub. Since Zigbee is the only protocol that is supported at this time, you need to look for light bulbs, and some other peripherals, that use that protocol in order for it work with the Echo Plus. But with that said, there will be some devices that use Zigbee that will still need their manufactures hub to work. So, again, it will not be as simple as looking for a ZigBee device and expecting it work with the Echo Plus. Since there is currently no supported list of devices, trial and error is going to be your best bet in trying to figure out which ZigBee devices work with the Echo Plus and which do not.

As for sound, that part if more subjective. I like a little more base in my music. The Echo Plus sacrifices bass for treble in this new design. So, to me, it does not sound as great as the previous Echo. To me, it sounds a little flat. My old Echo sounds much richer and fuller than the Plus. So, if you like your music with more bass, then you might be disappointed here as well.

Apart from the above, the Echo Plus does everything the old Echo does, so I'm not going to repeat everything here as you can read about those features in reviews of the last generation Echo. The microphones on the Echo Plus seems more sensitive to the previous generation though. It appears to be able to hear me more, even when the music is turned out loud. Where the old Echo had issues doing that. Also, the Plus has a 3.5 mm audio jack. Therefore, you can more easily connect it to your stereo, external speakers, etc. with a wire, if Bluetooth is not an option.

So, all in all, the Echo Plus is good device, but I don't think it's that much better than the previous generation to warrant an upgrade. If an upgrade is wanted, then depending on you hub needs, the smaller newer Echo might be the better choice. If you are new to the smart home arena, then try and figure out what you want your smart home to do, then pick the best system(s) that get you want you want. Don't assume the Echo Plus will solve all your smart home needs.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Carnage Reviews,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2024","Ah, the Echo Plus with built-in Hub, 1st Generation—White. A relic from a simpler time when Alexa's voice summoned more chaos and less... eye-rolling indifference. It's dependable, sure, and it does its job well enough: controls your smart devices, answers your banal questions, and occasionally plays a tune to drown out the screams. But honestly, does anyone even care anymore? With newer models on the loose, this one's starting to feel like yesterday's carnage. Still, it gets the job done without whining.

Jessie Potts,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2018","This is the first echo product in our household; we got it for Christmas and bought echo dots to go in each room. I love the echo plus. Yes it’s creepy at times, yes Alexa turns on and asks random questions which has my husband and I staring wide eyed talking about Amazon monitoring our household… but she’s so cool! Here are a few things…

Music
- I love this, with Prime we get most music, though some (like Space Jam) is only for purchase.
- Love the playlists (especially classical focus in the morning) but, BUT there should be more options. Some of the playlists only have 5 songs. Also I feel like Alexa should remember what song you left off on so you don’t have to start at the beginning of the play list again.
- I wish they had radio stations for Alexa (not adding a premium spotify account and using their radio stations) I know some local stations have it, but I’d love to have a classical station that can be played continuously, not with the same songs, or a 90s station that doesn’t have the same songs.

Audiobooks/audible
- I love that it connects to my audible account but there’s sometimes still lag in where I left off on the book, either on Alexa or my phone, and then switching back
- You can’t stream your audiobook on a group, just one echo dot or Alexa, this is lame when I’m doing housework I have to still play it on my phone since I can’t listen on a group

Groups
- I love that my entire household is a group, during the holidays (we opened it early sorry dad!) we had holiday music playing on every echo/Alexa and it was awesome
- It sucks you can only have one group. I’d love to have a household group, an upstairs group and a downstairs group; this should be doable with the technology
- We can’t I play my audio book on a group?

Alexa add ons
- I love the Phillips light that is voice controlled, sometimes though Alexa has a hard time hearing the colors we want.. like yellow??
- The dimmable Philips light bulb sometimes flickers when it’s dimmed bellowed 50%
- The plugs we got are a bit bulky, and when we used it with our Christmas tree, we still had to step on the button to turn it on? I think this one might be user error though
- There seems to be a lot of Alexa compatible devices, but I’m having a hard time finding a daylight bulb for my closet, as well as smaller bulbs for some of our lights/fans and lamps.

Random things
- While playing CoD with my sister on speaker phone she can tell my Alexa to play - songs, we have Alexa song wars
- Alexa randomly turns on my phone’s blue tooth, for no reason
- Alexa will randomly tell us we must join a group first

Complaints
- I really liked the cases/covers for the Echo and the Echo dots, but you can’t have one on the plus. This is lame
- The speakers aren’t that great, especially the dots, I have a Bluetooth mini speaker that has more juice than they do
- The white dots come with a black plug… this sucks because I wanted all white in my library and kitchen and the black plug is bulky and noticeable.
- I understand the technology isn’t there yet, but it sucks that you only have three options Alexa, Echo or Computer, we wanted to name ours Alfred.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Mr. Critter,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2017","Review after 5 days:

Pro: Performs same basic functions as Philips Hue and GE Wink hubs.
Con: Does not perform all functions. Cannot create scenes, cannot set sunrise/sunset timers, and third-party apps that rely on Hue hub will not work once you disconnect that hub.

Pro: Changes color of lights for Hue bulbs with voice. If you only had Hue hub gen. 1, this will be a new feature for you. If you had Hue hub gen. 2, this is not a new feature. This is the primary reason I bought the Echo Plus.
Con: Apple Home Kit will still require Hue hub gen. 2. Apple does not recognize Amazon devices.

Pro: Controls all of my Hue and Wink bulbs and allowed me to disconnect those hubs.
Con: Set up is a huge pain. I might be overly complicated for someone new to Alexa. The bulbs you own will already be paired to their respective hubs. Simply disconnecting the hubs does not allow Echo Plus to take over. You have to reset each bulb. Since Amazon advertises seamless and easy setup, this was a surprise and made me think I was doing something wrong. Setup took 1.75 hours for me. You have to look hard for instructions for your unique devices. The instructions are in the Alexa app.

Pro: Faster response time for GE Wink bulbs. Previously would take up to 15 seconds for these bulbs to respond, now it’s instant just like Hub bulbs have always been.
Con: None, this is a great and unexpected feature. Wink bulbs are much cheaper, and I assumed that’s why they were always slower. Nice that they have instant response now.

Pro: Amazingly strong microphones, will hear a whisper even if it is playing loud music. Echo Dot (or any other Echo) can do this, but Echo Plus’ ability is impressive. Echo Dot did not do a good job of canceling out its own music.
Con: It can hear you over loud music only if Echo is playing this music. Loud ambient sounds or music playing from some other speaker will prevent Alexa from responding to your commands. Amazon is well aware of this issue, and they now sell an Alexa-enabled remote control to use during this situations. I also own the Amazon Dash Wand (for the food delivery service), and it can be used to do the same. Of course, if you have to press a button on these remotes, then it’s no longer truly voice activated.

Pro: Multi-room music plays in sync if you have multiple Echo devices. It also creates a home intercom system with the “drop in” feature.
Con: None, this is a cool thing. But these functions are available on all Echo devices, including the Dot that is 1/3 the price.

Pro: If you order now, Amazon is giving you a free Philips Hue bulb.
Con: Even though it’s free, it’s an ugly, cheap-looking bulb. It’s not sleek glass like my other Hue bulbs. It’s frosted plastic. But then again, it’s FREE. You have to make sure the version you are ordering comes with the bulb. Both versions are the same price, and you might accidentally order the wrong one without the bulb.

Conclusion: Terribly complicated set up. Expensive device that does the same as cheaper Echo Dot with the exception of the internal hub. The internal hub will replace some features of your ZigBee-enabled smart home devices, but will not give the full range of features you’re used to with their native hubs. Subjectively, I think the device is ugly. The other Echo products have more pleasing proportions.",4.0 out of 5 stars
CS,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2017","I have a couple of these as well as the echo dot and Firetv's throughout my home. Really love the product so far. For me I tend to use the music side of this more than any thing else (really cool controlling your home, and i'll probably add that in later). I've been a musician all my life and sound quality is really important to me. So with that being said...

When I first started using Alexa and the Echo line I started simple with just the Echo Dot and instantly wanted better sound quality. To improve the dot, I picked up the Bose SoundLink Revolve (you can plug it in or use bluetooth). It's Bose, so of course its awesome. Connecting Bluetooth speakers is an awesome feature with the Echo line. As for quality, being Bose, who is better at making great sound... right?? Well, turns out its AMAZON lol.

I asked so many people/sales-reps about sound quality (best buy, frys, BH) and as soon as i mentioned Bose, they all responded with ""oh, well Bose, you can't beat that"". Hell... I bought one because it Bose before ever asking about the Echo Plus. That response says a lot for the Bose product line history/quality, but comparing like for like (SoundLink Revolve and Amazon Echo, similar size speakers) the Echo has better bass, depth, and volume than the Bose. It just sounds better. The frustrating part was every location I visited when I started looking at the Echo Plus had an echo on display, but none of them ever played sound. If I was Amazon's marketing/product head, I would get some field reps out there checking on those locations. Product would sell itself.

Anyway, another super cool feature is the ""grouping"" of amazon devices so that you can play your music across your entire home/backyard. Bose has a similar feature, but it's just a speaker system unlike the Echo which does 10,000 different things including ""voice controlling"" the songs/services/playlists and volume levels across the entire group. Oh... did i mention Bose is almost 3 times as costly? Nice work Amazon.

Additionally, I discovered that with the FireTV you can Bluetooth connect to the Echo. Why does this matter, well because I have an Echo and a 60"" TV in with a fireTV connected in the same room. One that doesn't have my Bose theater system connected so i use the TV's speakers. Turns out the Echo sounds MUCH better and is louder. Side Note: the fireTV's connect to bluetooth is great for connecting headsets when you want to keeps things quite around the house but want great sound and volume for your video binge weekends.

Only request I would ask of amazon is to add ""Group Playback"" of Bluetooth connected devices. This isn't currently supported so it's one Bluetooth device per Echo. The grouping only works for the streaming services (and not all of them, so check availability), but if you have amazon prime you have Amazon's basic streaming music service anyway which is quite nice.",5.0 out of 5 stars
ArizonaGuy,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2018","Five Amazon devices increasingly have problems

I am a 77 year old senior citizen with some disabilities that make it important that I be able to control plugs by voice with my Amazon units.
Three echo devices and two dots have become more and more unreliable. I believe the basic problem is that Amazon has sold so many units that its computers can no longer properly interface with the devices. One of the echo devices is a basic echo, two of the echoes are echo plus units purchased in December 2017, the two echo dots were purchased November 2017, and the basic Amazon echo was purchased July 2017. I have the Alexa app on two android phones. One of the phones is several months old, with the app having been updated relatively recently. The other phone is two days old, and the app was installed on it within the last 48 hours.

Examples of problems

1. Devices are no longer compatible with TP-link Kasa plugs. Yesterday morning the plugs were working fine. Then as the day went on the Alexa devices became unable to control first one of the plugs, then two of the plugs, etc. until it could control none of them.
Here is an example of what happens when I try to turn on a light in my spare bedroom with a voice command. All five of the Alexa devices give the following message:
“Sorry something is wrong. To control the spare bedroom light, try disabling the skill and then re-enabling it from your Alexa app.” Disabling the skill and re-enabling it does not fix the problem. I have the Alexa app on two different android phones.

On both android phones the Alexa app for the nonworking plugs shows a message “Skill is unresponsive.”

If I attempt to manually turn a plug on or off in the Alexa app, the plug does not go on or off. All that happens on either phone is it I get a message stating that the skill is unresponsive. However, if I go into the Kasa app, I can manually turn the plugs on and off–showing that they are connected to the Wi-Fi network. I tried deleting this skill for one of the plugs and then attempted to re-create the skill. The Amazon app was unable to find the Kasa plug.

I spent a long time today on the phone with an Amazon representative who was unable to fix the problem and is escalating it. He said that someone will call me sometime.

There is no doubt in my mind that the problem lies with Amazon. The Alexa app on two different phones states that skills for the Kasa plugs are unresponsive. I spoke with the technician at Kasa who said the problem is with Amazon.

2. Several months ago all of my echo devices began to occasionally respond to a voice command with a statement such as “I’m having trouble understanding right now, please try again later.” If I repeatedly gave the command, eventually the echo device would understand. I sort of felt like I was trying to make a phone call to a very busy line in which the only way to get through was to repeatedly retry.
3. Accuracy of response by all units has declined. Despite my having trained the units to recognize my voice, they increasingly do not properly understand. Sometimes they reply that “I don’t know that one.” Sometimes they state, “I’m not sure” sometimes they carry out an action that I did not ask for–in other words they respond to a command with an incorrect action.

The basic fact is that five different devices purchased at different times are becoming increasingly unreliable and unusable. Another basic fact is that I was unable to get through to a higher level technician and was told that someone would call me sometime. Amazon should stop selling these devices and work on fixing their computers.

After posting the above review, I tried a chat with Amazon and sent this entire review along with a strong request to speak to a supervisor. I was connected finally with a person who helped me restore all of the skills for the tp-link Kasa plugs. There is still the less pressing problem of all of the devices having increasing problems with recognizing commands correctly. The various echo devices are a great idea, but there are still problems I think with the Amazon computers and their interface with such devices.",3.0 out of 5 stars
hickamcasa,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2018","I’ve had this product for over a month now. As speakers go the Echo Plus is fine, if your looking for good sounding background music. If you want/prefer or need a bigger booming sound you need to look at the Sonos One or consider connecting a separate powered speaker to an Echo Dot (while the Echo Plus does have an aux out jack, using the Dot with an external speaker is more economical). I also have a first Gen Echo so utilizing the new multi-room play capability to play the same music in different rooms is a nice feature. The sound from Gen 1 Echo and Echo Plus is slightly different but not enough to get excited about and/or say that one is better than the other. Like I indicted above if your looking for dance hall sound look elsewhere. One thing you should understand is multi-room streaming does not apply to Bluetooth or your own music (since Amazon is discontinuing the ability to up load your own music to Prime Music). Multi-room is limited to Prime Music and services like Pandora and Spotify.

I selected the Echo Plus over the Gen 2 Echo because of it’s built in Zigbee Hub. I had a few home automation requirements (mostly lighting) I thought the Plus could handle. I didn’t want or need a Hub to handle thermostats, security, locks, scene lighting, etc, etc. And I didn’t want to deal with yet “another” App on my iPhone to handle a Wink, SmartThings or Hue hub. Currently, I have two GE Zigbee wall switch dimmers and two Philips Hue smart bulbs connected to the Alexa Plus. All paired without a problem and all are following the on/off and dimming routines setup in the Alexa App. Those comfortable working with simple electrical DIY will find the GE wired dimmers easy to install (they do however require a connection to the white neutral wire, which may not be available in some older homes). One oddity associated with the Philips smart bulbs is they “pop” on at 100% brightness after a power outage once power is restored. This does not happen with the GE dimmers.

The biggest issue I have with the Echo Plus is the Alexa App. The Alexa App “routines” interface is woefully simple and in dire need of improvement. It’s impossible to keep track of, or group, the various times and brightness levels associated with each smart device. I can’t imagine how confusing it would be with a whole house full of smart switches and smart bulbs. It also lacks a dusk to dawn option. The App is so bad I’m reconsidering my resistance to having yet another App on my phone, to interface with a either a Wink or SmartThings hub. From what I’ve read their Apps are more advanced and robust when dealing with smarthome devices. At this point, I’ll give Amazon some time to update the Alexa App. If that doesn’t happen in the next few months, I’ll begin looking for a different hub. Todate, all the smart stuff I’ve installed will work with either Wink or SmartThings. If I switch, I’ll simply relegate the Echo Plus to a speaker only function.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Earth Spirits,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","I have an original Echo gen 1 that has been working fine for a couple of years now. I am not sure why some people are saying that the audio is worse. I think it is better and most certainly better than the Echo Dot.
The microphone also seems more sensitive and better able to pickup your voice even while it is playing music loudly.

I got this to see if it could be an all in one solution as I currently am also running a Wink Hub 2. I wanted to see if I could just use Alexa and the Alexa app on my iPhone to control everything in the house which includes bulbs, door locks, egg minder (yes I do use it for keeping up with our own chickens eggs and which are the freshest ones). I want to set up scenes and schedules to automate more lights. So far I haven't yet got it to be an all in one. Alexa did not detect any of devices on the Wink Hub. I think there will be more than just asking Alexa to ""discover new devices"".

With Wink now offering home security monitoring at a low rate things are really evolving in the smart home market. There are so many companies vying for the space. Nest also has a new security system out. Ring doorbell, all the major door lock companies, thermostats, lights, etc... I really think it will be between the big players to see who wins out for me. Apple with Homekit, Amazon with Alex or Google. So far I think Amazon is far ahead of the competition. I think this echo plus just needs some time to really shine. Give it a few software updates and it's upgraded features will be more clear and present.

I am going to keep playing with this Echo Plus. I think it will prove to be a good upgrade in time.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Robert Caputo,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2017","Ironically I just watched the fun, 1980's computer film 'Electric Dreams' today after installing my new Amazon Echo Plus Electric Dreams [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ] and I am now thinking about removing my front door lock control from Alexa!

""Electric Dreams"" is a fun, fantasy about a home computer, that runs amok and takes over it's owners life.

Alexa is now controlling my life the same way as the computer, named Edgar, in the film controlled Miles' life, (or Moles as it calls him.) The lead character, Miles, is a structural architect who buys a home computer to help with his work. FYI...I work in structural engineering in high rise buildings....

Wait a minute, this is getting too close to home. BUT I don't have a beautiful cellist living above me as Miles had. I live in a one floor building, Thank God. That was a close call. Wait, my next door neighbor is a professional violin player and she is very attractive. Where does that Echo cable plug into the electrical outlet?

Hold on, Alexa is talking to me now....Her indicator light has turned red...I told her I really do like her and it is blue again. I forgot that I am typing on the Amazon website and, she has access to my Amazon account. I better be more careful. So I will refer to 'You Know Who' as 'Ralexa', that should work.

So any way, Edgar, the computer, takes over Miles's life, creating havoc for Miles and a fun story to watch. It is pure fiction, of course, as computers really can't talk or run things in the house like the coffee maker or control your schedule.... Well it was in 1984. But Alexa does. She turns my lights on when I ask her to, shows a movie in my home theater when I am bored, makes phone calls for me in case my dialing fingers are tired and reminds me of things that I need to remember. And yes, makes me coffee when I want it.

I do recommend watching 'Electric Dreams' before you decide to buy a 'Ralexa'. It is a lot if fun and it will hit home.

Mark,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","We purchased this to upgrade from a Echo dot. All of our current smart devices do not require a hub (tp link kasa), so we didn’t have a smart hub in the house. It’s nice to have smart hub functionality built into the Echo Plus so we can purchase devices that require a hub.

Compared to the dot the sound is far superior. Listening to music is great and the Echo Plus can fill the room without a problem (unlike the dot). The only very minor complaint I have is that there is a little too much bass at times. The excessive bass can make it hard to hear a response from Alexa if there is a bunch of other noise in the room (aka kids). Overall though the speaker is great for what it is.

The ability to listen to commands is superb. The microphones pick up commands from other rooms in the house without needing to yell. Compared to the dot the microphones are better but not through the roof better because the dot did a great job of listening. The biggest issue we would have with the dot was saying ""Alexa stop"" with regards to timers and the dot wouldn't listen. It would take multiple attempts to get the timer to stop. The Echo Plus does not have that problem which is really nice.

In the end we are very happy with our upgrade from the dot.

=======
Update 11/7/17 (a comparison to Echo Gen 2)
=======

We purchased the new Echo generation 2 and compared to gen 2, the Echo Plus is far superior when it comes to music playback. The gen 2 Echo initially was terrible, but the recent software update has made it MUCH better as far as music playback goes. Even after that update, the Echo Plus is heads and shoulders above the gen 2 Echo for music playback. It's hard not to recommend spending the extra $50 to get the Plus over the gen 2.

Comparing the ability to listen to commands is very apples to apples between the Plus and Gen 2. However, ask expected, both the Echo Plus and Echo Gen 2 are better than the dot.",5.0 out of 5 stars
R. V. Downing,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2018","I decided to go on a limb and buy and Echo Plus as a way to conveniently play Amazon Music around the house. Previously I had to boot a device or the Smart TV and deal with sometimes complex prompts. The Echo Plus made this process a dream. From the moment I walk in the door I can just tell Alexa to “Play Pandora” or “Play Midland Burn Out.” I can also adjust the volume, skip track, check traffic, pause the music, hear the Dodgers scores, or order a Lyft. All hands free. The sound quality on this device is also quite superb as I can hear it with excellent quality in the room and fair quality in adjacent rooms. I was so pleased with how the device was performing as intended, I quickly decided to investigate some additional perks. Namely, multi room music, the function where with multiple Echo devices, you should be able to simultaneously play music. A network of speakers armed with Alexa sounded great so I ordered an Echo and an Echo Dot to supplement.

This is where things start to fall apart. The initial setup for individual devices is fairly easy. And they all work independently just fine. It’s when I try to group them to play music that they inexplicably can’t be grouped. When I choose the Plus for a group of speakers, the Echo becomes unreachable. And vice versa. One of the main perks of springing the extra dough for the Plus was for this capability and it doesn’t work. Amazon tech support is non-existent as Google is littered with this problem and no solution. The best I could figure is that the Echo is on a firmware version incompatible with the other two. But since there is no way to force your Echo devices to update, it means I have speakers that don’t work until Amazon says so.

Finally, the device is convenient but in no way secure. And I mean in no way secure. Alexa responds to everyone’s voice and there is no option to lock the device like you might your phone. That means anyone in speaking distance can order your Alexa and Amazon account to do all those great things I mentioned earlier. There are no passwords, pins, or voice recognition. Nothing. The Echo Plus can also be controlled and configured by anyone with a smart phone close enough to press the Action Button on top of it. You’d think the device configuration might be guarded via a password or PIN in the Alexa app but that does not appear to be the case either. I’m reasonably okay with these security vulnerabilities since I live alone and rarely have guests. However, if I still had Airbnb guests, roommates, or regular visitors, I would be extremely nervous about leaving these things around. Which is unfortunate since the speaker functionality is nice but you don’t exactly want to share power over all of Amazon to anyone who listens to your speakers.

The bottom line is that the speakers work great to play music in a single room and it can potentially simplify many things that you might’ve previous had to pull up the Google for but the implementation is unpolished at best and the security implementations are non-existent. And non-existent to a point where Amazon was really just being lazy. Even a 4 digit code or pass phrase option could be a crude yet simple way to guard against unauthorized purchases and yet they are absent.",3.0 out of 5 stars
J. Anthony,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2017","I ordered the echo plus to go along with the original echo. I decided upon the plus because I use a lot of Philips Hue lights in the home and thought it would be convenient to have the hub. This works just like the original echo, but with better sound and it quickly and easily discovers your devices.

After setting it up, however, I began to have a ton of problems with my lights/groups not working, etc. After contacting customer service, I was told that I should have gotten the Echo Second generation because the plus can not work with the Phillips Hue Hub (which I still wanted to use since it has more features than the echo plus hub). I also had a list of lights in the Alexa App that I disabled, but could not ""forget"" within the app and it showed I had over 200 lights connected..which I did not (very frustrating and it became a big mess).

During all of this, I was contacted by another rep who had a higher level of understanding of how the Echo Plus works. In short, you CAN use this with the Phillips Hue Hub, you just can't connect your lights to both hubs. The error was in my set up; not the device itself. The representative walked me through the set up process again and also told me about the web based version of the original Alexa app, which allowed me to forget the 200 disabled lights in my app (just Google Alexa Web App)!

In the end, the product is great. It easily connects, has great sound, and you can also connect your phone via bluetooth to play music or podcasts. I am going to exchange it for the second generation, however, because it will save money as I do not want to use the hub.",4.0 out of 5 stars
generic,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","[please see update below original review]

I bought the original Echo when it was first available for pre-order and have loved it. No issues. The opposite is the case with Echo Plus.

Doesn't understand me half the time.
Intermittent success using the remote.
Tried multiple times setting up groups to play music simultaneously in different rooms using it with my 2 echo dots and original Echo. Echo Plus responds by doing nothing, or playing a random song or stations, and nothing on the other units in the group.

I really hate returning things, but unless there are fixes in updates between now and the end of the return period, that's what I'll be doing. Seriously disappointed. Oh, and I called Amazon ""help"" so-called, and I knew more about how it works than the person I wasted 15 minutes on the phone with. It was a surreal convo.
= = =
UPDATE: This morning I got a call from Anthony, from Amazon customer service. First, I was blown away that they would call me to address my issues with Echo Plus. Second, he was knowledgeable, and in no hurry. While it remains to be seen whether every issue with EP is fixed, the problem with Groups was.

It turns out that Alexa didn't like the name I gave my group, it was that simple. My original Echo is black, my EP is white, so I called the group ""Black And White"". Suggestion: When setting up your groups, go with one of the suggested generic names--bedroom, living room, etc. Echo calls them ""Common Names"". I called mine ""Backyard"", even though my backyard isn't involved.

Regarding Alexa often not understanding me on the EP, Anthony suggested that I try switching from British english to American english. I'm going to try that, although I have used British english on my original Echo with no issues.

So, I've upgraded my review to 4 stars, and when and if all issues are resolved I'll be coming back to make it 5. Amazon support definitely gets 5 stars. Even though my first call was a disaster, the way they followed up was remarkable, and that's the important thing. Seriously impressed. Thank you, Anthony!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Diddy Bear,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2018","First I want to say that a novice in networking ""could"" potentially have trouble getting everything set up initially.
If you plug in the Echo Plus and get on a PC at alexa.amazon.com, click Settings, click Set up a New Device and follow the instructions, it should install and connect to your Amazon account. Be sure to have your WiFi password.
I also got 2 Philips Hue light bulbs to play with. I put one in a hallway lamp and one in a TV room lamp. Leave the lamps turned on. Say, ""Alexa, discover devices"". She should find them in a few seconds - once discovered, they should show up at alexa.amazon.com.
Create a group(s) and give the group a name like ""hallway"", ""bedroom"", etc. and assign the light bulbs to the group. You can then say, ""Alexa, turn on hallway"", or ""bedroom"". You could do the same thing with Alexa compatible electrical outlet adapters, with lamps plugged in to them and you could use standard LED or other light bulbs.
You don't need the Philips or other 3rd party apps to use Alexa controlled devices ""inside"" the home. The apps are needed only if you plan to control the devices while outside of the home network.
The Echo Plus has a builtin Smart Home hub that talks to all the Alexa controlled devices. Without the builtin hub, you would need a 3rd party hub from Philips or other manufacturer.
The Echo Plus has a good bass sound and as far as my ears can tell, rocks out 80's heavy metal just fine !
There are a ton of skills and features I haven't had time to delve in to. I will grow my Smart Home for sure.
One simple thing to do is say Alexa, "" add popcorn to my Shopping List"".
Put the Alexa app on your smart phone and you can pull up the Shopping List when out and about without the need for paper and all that.

Dan the Man,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2018","The Echo Plus is an awesome piece of equipment, I absolutely love it!

However, Amazon is PURPOSELY vague/deceptive on the capability of their equipment/software. For example, the site specifically states the hub is a ZigBee hub, yet it DOES NOT specifically state the hub is NOT AT ALL compatible with Z-Wave. This is fully deceptive marketing, just state what your product CAN NOT DO!!!!!!!!!!!

Also, Z-WAVE device advertisements on Amazon flat out state they are fully compatible with Alexa, this is FLAT OUT FALSE, and I consider this to be and industry wide marketing LIE!!!!!!! You CAN NOT connect Z-WAVE devices to this hub, no matter what you read, Amazon will not tell you this unless you buy the hub, connect it, trouble shoot, give up and call them. Then they say ""oh... looks like the hub is NOT compatible with you Z-WAVE devices, we can allow you to return all the Z-Wave equipment so you can buy more expensive ZigBee products (which probably contain Chinese hack Software). Rediclous, just be HONEST and tell your customers what your device can an can not do, otherwise you are a bunch of big fat ADVERTISING LIARS.

With that said, to connect Z-WAVE to the Alexa hub, you have to buy a separate Z-WAVE hub, something their tech support will not tell you. Oh, also, don't trust the FAQ's/help page on the App, they suggest it is simple and you just find you device and the hub (which everyone thinks they just bought a hub because they have the echo plus) but it is %100 WRONG. You will not know the GE Z-Wave instructions are flat out FALSE until you talk to customer service and they act like you should have known you need a different hub.

One other thing that is irritating is that you have to wipe Amazon devices back to factory just to update your WiFi password. If you follow the instructions, it will say this is a last resort. WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!!! Not only is this wrong, but I had to teach Amazon that you have to reset their equipment not once, but twice to get it to work. Then I had to do the full setup again. To be fair, this applies to their devices which have screens.

The last comment I have is the Alexa App, it has to be the least professional App, least intuitive App, most difficult App on the planet. It is a TURD. Why do you not have the same capability on the App within no screen devices for devices which have screens? Basically you can not control/setup screen devices using the app. THIS IS JUST STUPID!!!!!

Advise to Amazon:.

Why ruin such an amazing product by supplying a crappy user interface and false/deceptive advertising? Especially the crappy home automation directions, and hub connections? When you read these instructions, they are FULLY deceptive.",3.0 out of 5 stars
BearsIn3D,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2017","I really did like my echo plus at first but after really playing around with it I didn't notice any real differences from the echo dot's we already have. We now have 2 dot's with the vaux speaker addons and this echo plus. We are relatively new smart home device users and only have the hue bulb that came with the echo and we didn't have any issues setting up the bulb and have been really enjoying it honestly. At first my girlfriend was very skeptical of this whole system and I was as well, we are the people who have siri completely disabled on all of our devices, iphones, ipads, apple watches, macs etc we turn it all off. So far ""echo"" (we don't care to call it a human name we find that weird so we changed it to echo because that's what it's real name is and it's less weird to us) has been really good at hearing us from across rooms or while playing music, the echo plus really doesn't seem that it's that much better in terms of audio quality or voice recognition when compared to the echo dot with the vaux speaker ($84.99 bundled fyi versus $149.99) and the echo plus also has no portability where the echo dot with the vaux speaker can be unplugged and used for 6 hours on a rechargeable battery. The bass from the echo plus itself is better than the dot with the vaux speaker but the treble isn't that much clearer to me to be honest. I have also heard there is alot of compatibility issues with the echo plus and that it isn't really a ""smart hub"" like it's advertised to be which really is misleading about the product itself....

Overall I really do like all of our echo's I just feel that amazon dropped the ball on the development of the echo plus, I would've even paid a little more for a better more premium product that really is what they made it sound to be but honestly if you don't need the mediocre smart hub on the plus you could save alot of money just buying the dot with vaux speaker ($84.99) or just the new echo ($99.99), my girlfriend and I are now not really uncomfortable buying more smart home products because we don't know what really works with the new echo plus and what doesn't...

*Also* If you have spotify premium family subscription you and another family member can't play music in different rooms at the same time on different accounts which is really annoying because we both have different tastes in music and want to play our own music when we are in the living room, cooking, relaxing in the bedroom...etc, kind of a let down honestly, maybe there is a way to do it but the Alexa app is not a good app so far and is not very easy to use whatsoever it feels very ""third party"" if you know what I mean...",3.0 out of 5 stars
MG in NY,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2018","Let me edit this review and say that -- after 2 1/2 HOURS on the phone and several additional days of back and forth, Amazon did ultimately replace this defective Echo.

I'll also say that I have several Echos and I like them quite a bit. And let me also say as a bona fide tech geek that even great equipment can have individual defective units.

So, it's not the device that's my problem. My problem is that the first level of tech support are not only poorly trained but have no authority to resolve the issue. Was on the phone for more than TWO HOURS with a tech. I've deleted the absurd convo but suffice it to say it was embarrassing. He didn't seem to understand that the Plus even has a Hub, nor what a Hub does in relation to the normal Echo capabilities. Consequently, he couldn't grasp how the Echo could be working but the Hub not. Nor that light bulbs cannot work without a hub of some kind. Nor that you can't ""reset"" a light bulb other then by turning it on and off.

It was ultimately escalated and the unit replaced. But the process was ridiculous for a device of this cost.

Compare this experience with Apple. I had a pair of Beat Headphones that cost more than twice the price of the Echo. I'll spare the boring technical problem but it had to do with not being able to reset them to resolve a connectivity issue. I got to the Apple store and, as these things sometimes go, I couldn't actually replicate the problem -- they were temporarily working fine. The response of Apple was, ""yeah, don't worry about it, we are aware that this is an issue from time to time. So let us just swap you out for a new pair.""

THAT'S how customer service works.

Original review:

Let me begin by saying that I've been a huge fan of Amazon, a shareholder and a Prime Member for as long as I can remember. This is my THIRD Echo device and I had no problems with the prior ones. So I would think they would jump to make me happy on this one. First the device had problems responding, would say it lost the internet connection despite the fact that the other two Echos worked fine. Then the hub could no longer find the smart devices that it had been connected to and worked fine with for two months. I assumed the tech team would jump to make this right. I was on the phone for MORE THAN TWO HOURS with people who seemed to know much less about Amazon's devices than I do but didn't seem to have the authority to replace an $88 device. What follows is the THIRD support conversation. You'll see it's pretty incredible.",3.0 out of 5 stars
ljanelle,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2018","This is the purchase I have been the most excited about in a long time. I bought it on Prime Day, so it was cheaper than normal (and they also threw in a Philips Hue white smart bulb, which made this a very reasonably priced purchase). The Echo is super easy to set up because it walks you through everything using both the Alexa voice assistant and the Alexa phone app.

The sound on the speakers is great. It's obviously not the highest quality sound you can get out of a speaker, but for casual music listeners, this is pretty top-notch (and it destroys the Dot in sound quality). It's also the perfect size for sitting on my kitchen counter without being in the way. I'm most impressed by the microphone range - I have a 1500 sq ft house, and the Echo Plus can hear me almost everywhere (although it seems to be better at recognizing Alexa at long distances than it is at then handling whatever request I lob at it).

The biggest benefit to getting the Plus instead of the regular Echo is that the Plus comes with a ZigBee smart hub built in, so I'm able to control my smart lights without having a separate device. I've gone the Philips Hue route, and I do want to eventually get a Philips Hue bridge because the smart home functions and light colors are kind of limited with just the Plus. However, I can still do a lot of things with my lights using the Plus, like setting up routines for things to happen based on a voice-activation word that I choose (and if you don't make your lights turn on by saying ""Lumos"", you're missing out - it's Hogwarts all day every day at my house now!).",5.0 out of 5 stars

Other instances there are no answers for specific questions and alexa doesnt understand / speak spanish which is important as my inlaws family mainly speaks nothing but spanish and understands very little english. I wish that there were an option to have it speak / comprehend spanish as it would help. I do find it very useful for my kids and home life . There are skills that can be applied that make them excited to learn and get ready in the morning , alexa can set multiple timers for when im cooking which is really useful and makes my life a million times easier. For the most part i personally use it for helping create lists , timers, and listening to music while i clean and cook. I use pandora and amazon music unlimited and i like to use both - but if i ask for a spanish song she doesnt understand. I can only ask for an artists name that sings in spanish. The sound level is pretty decent on it . I will update when i finally connect my nest and hue lightbulbs but for now i have too much home improving to do .

FazMan,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2018","I have been an Echo owner since day one. I've also had the Philips Hue lighting system. - Previous to upgrading to the Echo Plus, I controlled all lights through the Philips Hue App. One main function I used was to be able to turn on and off certain lights based on Sunset (Dusk) or Sunrise (Dawn). - I control several lights in this manner. - When the Echo Plus with built in hub was announced, I contacted Amazon by phone to speak with tech support to ask weather or not the Echo Plus will work with Philips Hue Lights (Which they said it did) and if I would be able to turn lights on and off based on sunset, etc. - I was told that it would. So when I had heard this, I ordered the Echo Plus which would arrive in 2 days. Meanwhile, I had someone from out of state over and they wanted my Gen 1 Echo. I gave it to them, along with the bridge. I figured I could live without Alexa for a few days. - After receiving the echo plus, I had the task of setting up all my Philips Hue bulbs with the new hub built in to the Echo Plus. After some doing, all of them were now on the new hub and functioning properly. - I then went to set up Routines for my lights to basically set schedules, etc. Low and behold, that is when I found out the ability to do what I want is not available. - My only choice is to turn a light on or off based on time. - As we all know, The time the sun sets varies every day. So the on;y choice is to go in and modify routines manually every week or two. Not quite the Smarthome I was looking for. Look, I get that the product was brand new and it needed some tweaking, etc. - My issue is that most updates we see for Alexa are things that have nothing to do with smarthomes. Do I really care to hear a (bad) jike from Alexa? Do I careto hear her sing? I for one do not. If you were to ask Alexa what time the sun sets, you will get a correct answer. So I know the ability is there and is a simple modification to Routines. - The unit sounds great, looks very cool and is built very well. Just wish Amazon would concentrate more on the ""Smarthome"" portion of the Echo Plus.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Tabitha V Maze,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2018","I love everything about it. I love that the echo plus turns on and off my light. It can also dim them with voice commands. I also like listening to my kindle books even the ones that I didn’t purchased audibles for. I like that it can play my music from Amazon music, pandora, tunein, I heart radio and Spotify. Echo can even play my local radio station. I love that the echo is connected to my TiVo Bolt. This allows TiVo to pause, stop and play whatever I want with a simple voice command. I love that I can reorder items that I purchased on Amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed, when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered. The only three dislikes that I have is that if you’re up too close or to far the echo doesn’t respond. So I think they need to improve the microphone. And I wish the speaker was better. The speakers are okay but could be improved. Also I have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet. Well the other day I received a Red Light Right on my Echo Plus. This error was Sorry I’m having trouble understanding you please try again later. After research online I learned it was a problem connecting to my internet. And it was easy to find this out.

Christopher,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2017","I actually really like the concept of the product. It is fun just to play around with, but difficult to operate, which I'll go into detail about later. The built-in hub isn't necessary, unless you plan on buying one smart light bulb are a time because the packs come with a hub free (an echo dot is sufficient and cheaper). The speaker quality is great for music and can be increased fairly loud without distortion.

Now for the difficulty with operating. For starters, your echo doesn't have many bells and whistles prepackaged. You have to search skills, which are kind of like apps or lessons to teach Alexa. There are many different skills you can teach Alexa, so make sure you have time to look through them. Now you've taught Alexa skills, but for every skill you must remember how to communicate exactly as instructed on the skill page or Alexa will not understand (e.g. ""Alexa, tell <skill name> to perform such and such task). If you don't remember the phrases to get Alexa to perform the skill you can always look through your app and under skills to find directions. Who will remember all the specific wording for each skill? Plus, the whole point in speaking to Alexa is that it's hands-free, so looking at the app for directions isn't convenient. It gets very frustrating if you don't have the Alexa app handy. Next, if you plan on controlling plugs or lights with Alexa you have to download apps from the manufacturer. Your now cluttered phone is even more cluttered and you don't speak the same language as Alexa. She also has difficulty understanding a lot of questions and you have to rephrase them several times for her to give you any answer.

I love, love, love the functions I can remember the wording for Alexa to perform the task. There are so many things Alexa can do that listing them would make this review entirely too long. I will list my favorites and most useful to me.
Turns on lights or plugs. Groups lights, traffic report, weather, and many other functions together to be performed with one command (e.g. ""Alexa, good morning""). Orders pizza. Tells jokes. Gives answers to questions you have. Controls TV. Sends messages and makes calls. Adds things to grocery lists. Sets reminders so you won't forget things. Adds appointments to your phone or email linked calendar. Helps kids with homework. Plays games for adults and kids.",3.0 out of 5 stars
JM,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2018","This is the future I've been waiting for. At least to some extent. I can't think of a tech that more altered my day to day since getting a cell phone. This future of voice assistants is where the future is headed, I can't already tell. The ease of use beats out a cell phone hands down. Being able to say a song and have it play, much faster than taking out a phone, typing it in, and then having it come up... it was obvious. Phones as we know them will be obsolete in 5-10 years.

Phones have been adding features into our lives with new apps and such, but at the same time making things more complex. Keeping track of everything and remembering how to use them. Not with this though. It's intuitive. You say what you want, and it figures out how to execute the command. Granted, there are limitations. Set the expectations right. This is new technology and will get better in time. But it is infinitely better than I had expected going in already. I was at work yesterday and almost caught myself saying ""Alexa, what time is it?"" instead of taking my phone out.

This is only going to get better and more effective. I'm actually excited to see what comes next, be it software or hardware. Two weeks ago, I hardly knew what an echo was/actually does. Now? I'm sold. Within a day or two of using it I was on board. This is the real deal, if you actually use it and don't expect it to be like JARVIS from Iron Man.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Jim,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2017","This is my first foray into the Amazon ecosystem. I wanted to get my feet wet with some smart home capabilities and was interested in using the Echo Plus as a hub. This device can be really easy to setup BUT it may drive you crazy first. I ordered the device on my account and it came registered to my account and Amazon profile. My wife is the official Prime member. During the initial setup process the Echo switched to her profile unknowingly to me. Thus, as I added smart devices to the Alexa app and was able to control the via the app, Alexa via voice control through the Echo Plus could not discover any new devices. I called Amazon for help after several hours troubleshooting myself. The support person was useless going through a script trying things I had already done such as rebooting. I gave up with this person and worked several more hours on my own. The next day I was ready to send the Echo Plus back but first I thought I would call Amazon support and try again.

This time the support person was much better. We worked for about 30 minutes before discovering by accident that the Echo was not set to my profile! Thus, here is the warning, the Echo Plus has user profiles and you must be using the same profile in use on Echo Plus and your Alexa app! Duh! Just ask Alexa, who’s profile or account is this? Then the setup was extremely easy.

I have read reviews complaining about the sound. However, I have been very pleased with the quality of the sound. It not a sound system bout for one speaker it does a great job.

In terms of controlling smart devices, Alexa works very well and is integrated with many of the devices I already had in use. My biggest problem is remembering what each light is named.

Finally, the Amazon profiles are problematic. My wife and I have to continually switch back and forth between profiles to listen to music or control devices. Yes, we have set up a family profile but that doesn’t resolve this issue of using a specific profile for a particular purpose.",3.0 out of 5 stars
T. L. Flannery,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","I decided to upgrade tom the new Echo Plus. I am returning it. the inclusion of the hub saves nothing in setup and doesn't work as well as the original. My smart devices are two Wemo plugs, A Harmony Elite Hub, and three first gen Phillips hue Color BR30 bulbs and a first gen hub. After receiving the Echo Plus I followed the initial directions for connecting the New Echo hub to my lights. It would not recognize them. Spent 1 hour trying all sorts of thing with no luck. I then spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support. After being passed to 4 different people, still no connection to the bulbs. Spent another hour putting the system back to original functionality. Decided to send it back.

After a couple of days of research, I found that the Alexa web app cannot configure Hue lights that have been previously hooked to a hub. Buried in the phone app there is a way to reset the lights to the factory settings. I decided to try and configure the Echo Plus again. after obtaining the light serial number, I finally got the Echo to find the lights. But here is the rub, you cannot configure the lights with scenes, you can only ask it to color the lights to a set choice of colors. There is no way in the app to set the lights to a specific custom color and intensity. This is less functionality than I had with the original echo and the Phillips hub.. The commands are also more verbose. You have to say ""Alexa set the color of the fireplace to blue"". With the Phillips hub and IFTTT you say "" Alexa trigger Ocean"" or whatever scene with the custom color/intensity combination you have created.

For me the new Echo Plus was not and upgrade to my current smarthome configuration. The setup was more complicated, and not as versatile as the original, and the tech support people have no clue about the proper steps for configuration to even get the less funtional system to work. The inability of the app to create scenes and allow custom light colors and intensities is a signigicant flaw. I had enabled the Hue app hoping it would get the scenes from my hue account but without the hub connected, the app does nothing.

In my mind you have my geographic coordinates and my time zone either of these things should have been very easy and included but neither are. as for the sound it is far superior to the older units, and this brings up another issue we use the everywhere feature to play the same station or stream through out the house and if you are playing music its ok but if you put on talk radio and you find your ears between 2 units as you walk from room to room you get a horribly annoying echo where they are a couple milliseconds out of sink. before someone comes back and starts blaming my WIFI NO ITS NOT we just had a brand new commercial wifi and network management system installed just like they use in hospitals and office buildings its all Ubiquiti Unifi and there are AC 1200 in room access points in 7 of the 11 rooms in my house and an outdoor unit with an antenna array designed to cover the entire 6 acres of our property, that being said I got my first unit several years ago and have been adding to them over time and they have made some great improvements and many steps backwards teach iteration of updates seems to fix a few quirks and create a few, My most current complaint is how often they light up and start listening when the wake word nor anything like it has been spoken and I changed the wake word to the less likely one so I don't understand why I might be sitting in a room reading a book and the thing will light up and listen when nothing has been said, and when you do talk to it especially the dots you have to speak in a loud tone to get them to trigger.

Mr Home Mechanic,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2018","I got it to try side by side with the Echo originale. They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don't really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don't think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs. Net net for me, this Echo does not do anything more than the original Echo and sound quality is not as good.

I get so frustrated with my Alexa devices because they will only do what I ask them to do about 40% of the time! Those cute little TV ads that give cute little nonchalant commands to Alexa are so misleading as the devices do not work like that in the real world! Unless you know exactly what to say to make a Skill work...Alexa will not find the skill or recognize your command...or worse, she will ignore you! And yes, Alexa even plays a specific sound to tell you she is ignoring you! I have spent countless hours researching and working with the devices to improve their learning curve but find it too frustrating and time-consuming to figure out what the Echo wants to hear to function properly! I have resorted to writing down and memorizing the exact statements they want to hear in order to get my devices to actually do what I want them to do. Right now I have a 6-page list laying beside the device reminding me what I have to say to make each skill work on Echo! On the positive side, I have really enjoyed having the Smart Home devices that Echo pairs with....my Smart Plugs and Sensi Thermostat. Having Alexa turn on my upstairs lights before I get upstairs, make coffee for me before I go to the Kitchen, and turn my Thermostat up to warm my house while I am still in bed has been wonderful! I also love the Alexa My Buddy Skill that allows you to set up 5 friends and family members that the skill will alert if you have an emergency at your home and can't reach your phone.

I am a disabled person, and it helps me turn light on and off, and schedule doctor appointments, using google voice phone, and get my medical rides to and from hospitals, plays music on cue from multiple web apps, and watch videos, as well as communicating to my Nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events. I wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights. They are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them. Although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the Echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off. Thank God, no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights. Thank you Amazon. I will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from Affirm.com to purchase 1 more of each and some lights for rest of the house. Jeff Bezos these are awesome items and because of your allowing me to get amazon prime at a lower cost due to disability I was finally able to buy these items on your prime day event. really helped when all you earn a month is $672 on SSDI thank you all again.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Patricia,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2018","My Amazon Alexa, she just arrived just the other day.
I couldn't wait to open the box, for our new home technology future. we set Alexa up in just minutes, and she was on her way to making this family happy. We did like the fact that you can change her name from Alexa to Echo or Computer, I picked Echo.
She is built around your voice, with a built-in smart hub. I liked that option-because it saved me money. You can use her to make your phone calls-which really comes in handy if your hands are full. She can send messages and receive them. Echo can read you your news and check your sports scores.
If you decide to have Alexa for voice control for your T.V you must have an amazon fire stick. you can use her for your shopping list""s, alarms. This is one of the features she has - it's the soothing waterfall sounds to put you to sleep, she's good for a lot of things-except she can't take out the garbage or do my dishes.
One thing about her that I do not like is: Alexa proclaims to have seven microphones with noise cancellation' She will NOT respond to you if you have a fan or anything like a fan in the same room-or she cannot hear me from the next room, Either. But other than that- I would definitely recommend this to all my friends and family {And Already have.}",5.0 out of 5 stars
William Kochevar,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2017","I really like the echo plus. It does almost everything I wanted to do with one major exception. I haven't fully set it up yet, but I would like the Echo plus to be able to control a Logitech Harmony remote which in turn would control my Fire TV. I have received conflicting reports on this both from Amazon and Logitech. Some say the Echo plus will control the Logitech Harmony. While others say that the Echo plus will control a Harmony remote but not fully enough to control the Fire TV in its entirety. I am a handicap veteran (quadriplegic) who has no use of my arms or hands. In order to operate the equipment in my room, I require total voice control for everything. My current environmental control unit controls most of the equipment in my room with the exception of the Amazon Fire TV. I was hoping I have the Echo plus in combination with the Harmony remote would allow me to operate my Fire TV with just my voice. I am not sure this is going to work, but I'm going to try it anyways. Maybe in the future Amazon and Logitech will work out the bugs and kinks with being able to control the Fire TV with an Echo plus fully using the Harmony remote. If anyone Amazon as a response to this I would appreciate hearing from you. Thank you.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Joey Lane,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2018","We bought the Echo Plus to bring all our Smart Home Devices together. Previously, we had purchased a pair of Phillip's Hue bulbs and marveled at the idea of telling Alexa to turn lights on and off. After the purchase, we learned that without a Hue Hub, or similar hub (Samsung, Google, etc.) we could not control the lights. NOTE: at that time we had 2 echo dots for both floors. After doing some research, we discovered that the Echo Plus has built in hub features. I was apprehensive, having not tested the use of the Plus and Hue bulbs, however I am happy to say that the two work flawlessly. All the the setup is in the Alexa app, so once downloaded you can search for smart devices and add them to the Echo Plus. Some extra fine tuning and we even have smart phrases and timers for vacation. These are the first steps towards a fully automated home. We look forward to more devices, the Echo Plus has been the perfect anchor for our future smart home.

Small Extras: love the dial on the top for volume. Length of cord is good for most placements, be aware though if you are trying to tuck it away that the plug is proprietary and not a USB plug like the Dot.

I'm loving the Echo lineup, we hope to expand the product in our home.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kris,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2018","Overall it's a great product I only see getting better. I'm not an audiophile but we love the sound quality for background music. We use Amazon music with it which is pretty easy self-explanatory and has a wide variety of options. It's pretty entertaining at times and its good for things like reading audible books, controlling the lights, and telling me the weather in the morning.

A few complaints
1. We have two of these and although they are supposed to work together so only the closest one responds, they would usually both respond. In fact, even if we were across the apartment from one, it was like one would signal the other and they'd both respond. We had to give one a different wake word. Now we run around talking to Alexa, Echo, and Siri when we're home and it gets a little stupid.
2. Fix the volume situation. Add a button or do something. I shouldn't have to spend 45 seconds waking Alexa and requesting incremental adjustments over and over again until it gets to the desired level. Let me give it a percentage or something.
(update: my girlfriend discovered you can tell it to go to volume 1-10 instead of telling it volume up or down over and over again)
3. Fix the App. It's cluttered and confusing and only half works.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Patti V,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2018","You have to have this device. I love my echo so much that I now have four. I have one for every room. She talks to you when you say her name. You can ask her about her day, tell her goodnight and she replies back. She can tell you about the weather, late breaking news, she can tell you whats on your calendar. She can tell you about traffic or the weather forecast for the day. The other day she let me know what the warmest part of the day would be so I could walk my dog. I left my phone at work one night so I asked if she could make a phone call. She made several and the conversation through this device was crystal clear. I did not know that this device can make phone calls. It is like having another phone for free in the home. Always great to have a back up. She can also tell you what time it is. She is my alarm in the am and also sets timers for me. My daughter loves this device because she loves music.

Evon,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2018","I purchased the Echo Plus with the Build-in Hub, so I could have the convenience of asking Alexa to turn my lights and lamps on and off. Philips Hue Light Bulbs were placed in the fixtures that I wanted Alexa to control and they all work great! I already had an Echo Dot in my Kitchen/Den area, so I placed the Echo Plus with Hub in my bedroom. My radio and lamps in my Kitchen and Den are controlled with TP-Link plugs. But, the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my Den and Bedroom have special Philips Hue Light Bulbs that are controlled by the Hub inside the Echo Plus. I am able to play music, set my alarm, get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices. The Echo Dot requires a TP-Link plug to be plugged into it and the Echo Plus requires a special Philips Light Bulbs installed in each light fixture to work.. The only thing I dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work. Regular light bulbs placed in the ceiling light fixtures will not work with Alexa and the Echo Plus with Hub. Other than the high price of the bulbs, I love my Echo Plus with built in hub!",5.0 out of 5 stars
DJD,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2018","Update: I received a reply regarding the message notification informing me that there was a ""Do Not Disturb"" feature I could turn on. So I replied that I'd try it and I'd update my review if it worked. I did find that feature and turn it on, however, I have not had any messages come through during the set times so I haven't been able to test that. Unfortunately, at 5am this morning it sounded an alarm that I did not set, 2 hours before I needed to wake up, and it jolted me out of a deep sleep so I'm updating my review anyway. I have no idea why this alarm sounded, and neither did Alexa - I asked her why and she said she didn't know. I'm still very unhappy with Echo for disturbing my sleep in yet another more egregious way. Perhaps if the Do Not Disturb feature allowed you to also prevent alarms it would be better. I have no intention of abandoning my favorite sleep app that never jolts me out of a deep sleep, but wakes me gently when I'm not in a deep sleep state and therefore I will never want to use Alexa as an alarm so I'd rather just turn it off so I never have to worry about some phantom alarm that I didn't set jolting me awake while I'm in a deep sleep hours before I need to get up, so NO, I will not be adding any stars. I'm tempted to drop my rating even further, but there are a couple things I do like about using Alexa so I can't discount this device altogether. I just wish they'd hire some better engineers and make it smarter. Things I do like are controlling lights and my Nest thermostat. I also like being able to play music but I really wish they'd allow me to put music preferences in my app. I NEVER want to hear Country music - no offense, I just can't stand it - but Alexa seems to ber obsessed with it so I have to be very specific when I tell her what to play. I kid you not, when I asked her to play meditation music the other day, she actually found a GD country station. Ugh. Stupid. Maybe if I lived in an area rife with country music fans it would make some sense, but I live in Los Angeles which isn't exactly a country music haven. Get smarter Alexa, I'm trying to create a smart home and somethings I think you're the dumbest part of that entire idea.

Original review: I’d rate it a 3 or 4 if there was a way to prevent the green light ring message notification from flashing at night during set hours so it didn’t disturb my sleep. I hate that stupid light when I receive a message while in bed. Also, the reasons I’d only give it a 3 or 4 is that it’s not very smart; nor nearly as smart as Siri. It makes really dumb music choices and if I’m not extremely specific it will play country music almost every time I make a request. This must be a bonus for country music lovers but I’m not one of them and Alexa can’t seem to learn what I like. It also won’t play my Apple music choices; I understand why, but that is a disadvantage for Apple users. Those are a few examples but there are more. To get 4-5 stars Amazon needs to do two things: 1) Make a way for people to stop that stupid green light from flashing when they’re in bed and 2) make Alexa smarter and teach her to learn user’s preferences.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Andrew A.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2017","This is a great device that began my path to a smart home. I was able to easily set this up and the philips hue light it came with alongside the tp link power outlet was compatible with this and no hub was required (perhaps due to this device being the only Amazon device with a built in smart-hub)

PROS
-Easy Set-Up
-Compatibility with other devices, doesn't need philips smart bridge for standard dimming light
-Volume can extend to another room easily!
-Now I can watch Amazon Prime Instant Video AND Hulu without my remote cause of this communicating with my Fire TV stick

CONS
-Not all questions will be answered
-Conversations can not have follow up questions like Google Home so conversations don't flow as well in comparison
-Tries to make you sign up for Amazon Music and Amazon Audible and other Amazon services a lot

Final Verdict
If you want to jump into the modern smart home world, this will do the job! Sound is great, can learn skills you give it such as finding your keys (assuming you have the Tile and Tile Skill activated) and is a great device to impress new guests that have never been exposed to Smart Devices",4.0 out of 5 stars
MamaHeini,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2017","I love Amazon Echo and have been a loyal customer since it was first introduced. I quickly interfaced it with my Wink hub to control the lights in my home. The idea of the Echo Plus with its built in hub that would allow me to eliminate the Wink hub was very appealing, so I preordered the Plus when it was first announced. For the most part it works well in controlling my lights, but naming devices has been something of a problem. It lets me use the old names for some devices, but not others. My husband spent some time on the phone with tech support, but they weren't able to resolve the issue. We continue to pick away at renaming devices, sometimes we can do it successfully and other times not. In the meantime we have given the problem devices new names, which I consider a less than satisfactory resolution. I'm confident that we'll eventually get it resolved, but it's frustrating when I use the old name and Alexa tells me ""this device is disabled; please re-enable it to control it."" We haven't figured out yet where or how to re-enable it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
C. Conklin,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2017","So I bought the echo plus with the hue bulb, boy was I disappointed in both my purchase and with Amazon. There was nothing I read that said to make the hue bulb work that you also have buy the hue bridge which is another $59.97 or if you buy it with 2 more bulbs it is $69.97. I had always thought that Amazon was above playing those type of games.

I already had an echo dot and had it synced with my Bose for music and I already have an echo dot in my bedroom. From everything I have read now all I needed to do was buy a hue bridge and sync that with the dot and I would than be able to schedule my lights. Also when I went to sign in to the Hue app it asked me if I wanted to signed in with my google account, WHAT! where did that come from, if I had wanted to signed in with my google account I would have bought Googles version of echo.

John F.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2017","I was excited to modernize my house into a smart home, and the Echo Plus seemed like the perfect unit to get me started. It came with a Phillips Hue bulb which was a nice introduction to the process of adding devices. It was also my first introduction to the difference between the Echo Plus' marketed capabilities and the disappointment of those realities, as my unit has never ever (not even once) discovered a new device via verbal request.

Sound quality and volume level is disappointing, and voice recognition was really quite poor. Particularly if there's background noise from the TV or unit itself. Be prepared to give the same instructions repeatedly.

Still, I thought it was functional and dived into creating my smart home. Added a smart thermostat, a dozen smart bulbs (with more to come), smart switches, Cloud Cams (nice units by the way), all carefully selected to be compatible with the Echo Plus' as my hub.

After a few weeks the Echo Plus began ""forgetting"" my routines, losing devices and having increasing difficulty recognizing voice commands for grouped devices. Finally, it began disconnecting from the internet and doing so frequently. Now keep in mind that I have a laptop, tablet, cell phone, thermostat, Echo Dot, security cameras and more all operating perfectly well on my wireless router.

Having exhausted my patience trying to get the Echo Plus to stay online, I emailed Amazon and they responded with instructions to do a factory reset. Seemed reasonable, which is why I had done so myself hours earlier. So I elevated my issue by calling Amazon. Here I must tell you several things. First, you better have several hours to waste on hold and repeatedly trying the same thing over and over and over again as if the hundredth time is magical. The second thing you need to know is that despite all evidence to the contrary (please recall all my devices working perfectly well on my wireless), they will blame your internet service provider, your wireless router, etc.

And finally, you need to know that although you may think you're speaking with the technical department, you're not. It's just someone reading from a script with plenty of time on their hands and no reason not to waste yours. After an hour and a half I was finally transferred to technical.

Fortunately the technical department does not have time to waste repeatedly going through the basic reset process and quickly moved on to full surrender... return and replacement. Now here's the one bit of humor to the process...they were currently experiencing a glitch in their internal return system and could not generate a return authorization and label. So unlike the Marines, they decided to abandon my unit with instructions to dispose as I see fit, and are sending me a replacement.

The replacement arrives in several days. Should be interesting to see if my saga continues.",1.0 out of 5 stars

However, she doesn't seem very ""smart"" when asking her regular Google type questions--she seems to come back with ""I don't know"" type of answers way too often. Ask our phones the same things and it will pull right up. So, some work to do there.

Also some warning that it was having issues would be great. The timer stopped working recently and I didn't know it. I was using it while cooking, so that wasn't good.

Dave,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2018","I put this review as four stars only because there is slight room for improvement on sound, but honestly, I'm nitpicking and this thing is amazing. The built in Zigbee hub was key for me since I run multiple Philips Hue bulbs in the home. This saved the need for a separate Philips Hue bridge for me. Before you ask, ""but doesn't the Hue bridge do more?"" - sure it does. You can probably pick a color with a color wheel as well as have your music drive the light colors. However, for the rest of us who do not need that level of light control (I'm not a DJ!), the Echo Plus gets the job done. There are 20 different colors to choose from including five different whites. Saying, ""Alexa, turn the bulb color red"" works flawlessly and it is awesome that all Hue bulbs, color changing or not, are dimmable by Alexa by saying, ""Alexa, dim the light to 20%"".

Ghalib Wahidi,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2018","it is a great instrument in regards to smart home and automation. Very good speaker sound quality and its functionality seems to be expanding.

Second, I don't like to ask Alexa to ask another system to do something, such as Alexa ask Bose to play station one etc. It would be nice to say Alexa play music on Bose or whatever system you have. Third, it would be nice if it can be customized to a specific number of voices only.

James Allen,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2017",I bought my first echo as a “plus” model thinking it would make life easier. After the first unit arrived with a dead speaker Amazon did a great job of having me unit number two within two days. After resetting all the lights for the new Echo Plus hub I started really looking at what the Hue system could do. Why not I had a built in hub right? After reading questions and answers on motion detectors and other accessories besides light bulbs I thought I bought what would be a compatible sensor only to find out that while it is recognized by the Echo Plus hub it cannot be used. No options exist inside the Alexa app to make assignments or change settings to the motion sensors. That’s when I discovered I now need a $50 Hue Bridge to make it all work. So the bottom line is my $149 Echo Plus can be retuned and be replaced with a $79 Echo and a $50 bridge. Saves me $20 in the end. Ignore this one. Get an Echo and a bridge. You need it anyway. I love what the echo can do and Alexa is quite handy. I’m a bit disturbed by the marketing on this one though. If all you want to do is dim lights you will be happy. If you want to actually automate things you will need more equipment. The sound from the Echo vs the Plus is neglible. If I recall the speaker diameter difference is 2/10’s of an inch. I have a second generation Echo as well and I can’t tell much difference in sound quality. It may even be where the units are sitting.,3.0 out of 5 stars

Jugan,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","I am a long time user of Echo and eagerly awaited the successors. The Echo Plus is no such thing.

Please note that many high star reviews are first time echo owners and they don't have the original good unit to compare too. If you are too and reading this, buy the original Echo for around 80$ (not the second gen). If you are a previous echo owner, don't ""upgrade"".

First and foremost, the sound. Despite being touted as having updated speakers and Dolby, it sounds much worse. Volume does not get as high, bass is always too low, and just sounds muffled. If you have a Dot, then it is comparable to sound quality but just louder. My wife asked what was wrong with it (she didn't know it was the Plus). That was one of the main reasons I got the new Echo, an upgrade to the sound.

The speech recognition is about the same. Maybe bit better but I think that's because this Echo does not get as loud and not as much bass interference as the old one.

Connecting smart devices is about as painful as before, just in a new way. It does basic commands and for basic devices. Very limited. You are better off with a hidden, more powerful hub.

Other than that, it looks almost exactly the same as old Echo, and does same things. Connecting my phone via bluetooth was useless. The new power plug in port is not hidden like the original and cord comes out easily.

Overall, I am going to return it. 150$ for a downgrade. It's a shame.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Philip W. Morris,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2017","I had an older echo and the philips hue hub and 7 bulbs. I liked the idea of getting rid of the hue hub and centralize everything into one device, so I bought one. I set it up and asked it to find my devices . . . no joy. After further research, I found that I needed to disassociate each bulb with the Phillips Hub before I could continue. Did that. Still no joy. After even further research, I found that if the previous process didn't work, I had to associate each bulb manually by removing the bulb, recording the 6 character identifier and entering it into the Alexa app. While that worked, it was incredibly inconvenient considering where several of my bulbs were installed.

OK, so now it's finally ready for play. Turns out, the Echo Plus has only the most primitive of control capabilities. I can manually turn on and off or dim a bulb. I can group them and use voice commands. But . . . I lost all of the use of the recipes I've created on IFTTT. I had some recipes to turn lights on at sunset, turn lights off at sunrise, turn lights on when the Ring Doorbell detects motion. All gone. I'm really disappointed as I've come to expect excellence from Amazon's products. Hopefully this will be improved ..... soon.

There IS something called ""Routines"" but it is primitive as well. I can set things to happen at a certain time, but lets say I want the living room lights to come on at 50% at 6:00pm. I cannot select the group called ""Living Room"". I have to select each light bulb individually. Now, as I add new bulbs and add them to groups, I STILL have to find each routine and change it to include the new bulb.

Amazon . . . . I expected better. It's the hope of improvements (and the thought of the frustration required to undo the setup) that prevents me from sending this one back.

Prospective Buyers - If you already have an Echo. Do not buy this. If you don't have an echo, then it may be worth it provided they fix some of the major oversights like Routines / Groups and no IFTTT hub support.",2.0 out of 5 stars
The_dude,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2017","***Preface***
This is the first time I've been really disappointed by an Amazon brand product. Amazon is one of my favorite companies because they provide superior convenience/value to the customer. Their Amazon basic products are great. They have figured out how to walk that line between utility and affordability. While the product experience may not be premium, I always got great value for the money spent.

***Echo Plus Review***
Perhaps I am not their target audience, but I was really underwhelmed. Alexa is one of the dumbest 'smart' devices I have used. She is terrible at answering questions, and often (75% of the time) responds with ""I don't know"". I was disappointed by integration with peripherals such as Philips Hue. From what I have read, it appears that Alexa is connected to Bing, which seems to be part of the issue. Trying to get Alexa to answer from Google requires a bunch of setup, and then I still have to use additional verbal keywords to get it to work - All of this to just query the internet. I could just google on my desktop or laptop anyway. This is the opposite of convenience.

Skills often don't seem that useful. There is no ability to change Alexa's voice to male (according to alexa). I find the sterile voice of Alexa really uncomfortable, which is also one of the reasons I'm not a big Siri fan. On top of this are privacy concerns from having 7 tuned microphones in your room. The audio is fine I guess, but nothing to write home about.

I only found 1 useful thing: Playing NPR. $150 for a glorified radio is really disappointing. Even if this were $75, I would have a hard time justifying the price. I'm not buying hardware, I'm buying Alexa. Alexa is not worth $75 in utility.

***Verdict***
At the end of the day, Amazon does well when they make my life convenient. They are a convenience company - That is their brand. That is why I love them. Alexa is NOT convenient. I will check these products again in 5 years. Perhaps they will have figured out how to translate speech into something actionable AND convenient.

Edit: As an aside, I really enjoyed the material on the bottom of the echo. It provided a quality feeling grip. Also, the volume ring was a good design. The volume ring is a better design than a volume button.",2.0 out of 5 stars
R7177,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2017","I’m really happy with the echo plus. Connecting to smart bulbs was easy and I even connect to TV via the longitude smart hub. The only thing I was a bit confused about is why aren’t all the skills automatically on installed? This would have made it even better. The microphones are good as it can hear me over music playing or people talking. The speaker sound quality is decent; not great. Also, the commands have to be spoken pretty precisely otherwise Alexa will have trouble processing that request. For example, if you name your bedroom lamp a lamp but you say turn on the bedroom light, Alexa will have trouble with it. In addition, a software update needs to enable you to delete old devices. There’s no way to do that now as you can only disable it which also cause Alexa to say “that device is disabled” mistaking it for another device. These are minor issues and can probably be fix with a software update. Overall, I am very happy with Echo plus. I also purchased a Dot for my bedroom.",4.0 out of 5 stars
#WearetheSmiths,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2017","When I received this Echo Plus in the mail I noticed there was a small crack around the light ring. Now I could have kept it and used it with the crack, it really was small, but Amazon is such an amazing company that they sent a replacement that same day! So awesome!

I spent the next hour deciding where I could best use the Philips hue lightbulb and TP-Link plug I purchased with the Echo Plus on cyber Monday. After the initial set up of the above mentioned accessories, the time to play with said accessories was about to begin.

Now, If you haven't tried your hand at smart home automation, there is a bit of an expense that will be required to start. You can buy a wide variety of smart home hubs here on Amazon, but I would suggest you buy the Echo Plus. With the Philips hub built in, its the best price IMO. Once you have decided which you'll be purchasing, you'll then need to purchase the required accessories. Again, Amazon has plenty to chose from.

I would strongly recommend this product!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Aaron G.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2018","This thing works great I was a little disappointed in the speaker, although I think that has more to do with the acoustics of the house and not the speaker its self but thats not why I took a star away. I took a star away because it is so sensitive to hearing its name its kind of annoying, especially when you are listening to music or a book and she interrupts to ask you what you meant. Seriously if a word on the song sounds remotely like her name she interrupts. If your talking on the phone through her and mention amazon she asks me what I want to buy.

I also wish there was a way to put a lock/ keyword/ phrase on her so my kids can't ask her to order more cookies and other random things. I know I could turn that feature off but I like the convience of it. I have a tap, 2 dots, and the echo so its not annoying enough to stop me, but still.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Homer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2018","I'm a huge fan of the echo. Every morning I get to hear the weather, the news, and my historical fact of the day.

This one came with a lightbulb that was ready to be hooked up to the hub. It's very convenient to turn the light on and off with a voice command. The brightness of the light is also controllable.

The hookup was easy and its use was simple to figure out.

The only negative is that if there is any other noise in the room sometimes Alexa will not respond. If the air conditioner is somewhat louder than normal, I have to get closer to the echo in order to make it work. Not a major inconvenience but if you want to turn the light on, you literally have to walk close to the device to turn on the light. If you're using this as a hub for voice commands, you will have to keep it close to where you are in order for it to be able to instantly recognize and respond.",5.0 out of 5 stars
MariMor,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2018","I had been the last holdout of all of my friends when it came to purchasing an Echo because I didn't feel its functionality was initially worth it, after all I have a spotify account that connects to wireless speakers, my friends' echos always understand the men better than the women so why have something that doesn't understand me, etc. However, I'd been planning to purchase a philips hue system and when the alexa plus came out, the advertisement that a bridge isn't needed finally made it worthwhile.

However, my impression since receiving this in July 2018 and finally setting it up a month or so later: she's a disappointment. The speakers of this 1st generation echo plus are WORSE than the original Echo. She still doesn't always understand me. She loses connectivity to the dot half the time. And then there is the final and biggest disappointment: I STILL have to purchase a Hue bridge because while you can turn the lights on/off, you can't access the color wheel or create scenes through the Plus.

I suppose I should have been more cynical about what Amazon said and checked with Philips that the Plus really did replace a bridge vs just taking on a functionality I could easily set up with the existing app. Sadly, I was out of the return window by the time I tried it out and since Amazon upgraded the device, I imagine they won't let me replace it in case i just received a lemon with lower grade speakers.",3.0 out of 5 stars
N. J. Schreiber,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2017","So I had bot the Echo and teh Google Home and really liked both of them. Ultimately I kept the Google Home for 2 reasons.

1) Echo will not do multiple accounts with Spotify. It will only connect to the Main Spotify account owner and any family members are out of luck. Any play list being played is from the Main Spotify account. You can;t even set up the family members. Also with multiple Echo users you have to say switch account to ""so and so"" but it still uses a shared calendar, list etc. Google Home can recognize up to 6 different users just by voice and will use that persons calendar , list or yes---- SPOTIFY! You don;t even have to say switch accounts.

2) Echo will not grab or play anything from YouTube.

Also I tried various questions on both Echo and Google Home - Echo was stumped way more than Goggle Home and Google home had more variety and funnier replies when I would ask goofy things just to see what would happen

Both device are great tech but the mentioned issues were deal-breakers for me. So now I have a house full of Google Home devices and speakers so by the time the amazon echo addresses the issue sit will be too late because I will be so deep in the Google Home ecosystem. Kind of a bad play on Amazon's part because I bought the Echo first and had the new Dots on pre-order - they had me but lost me.",3.0 out of 5 stars

The one complaint I have is that I have this and several Echo Dots and they are set up to play music as a group. I can play music on just one of them, or on all of them at the same time throughout the house. The Dots are connected by bluetooth to better speakers. If I ask Echo to play music on just one of the Dots connected by bluetooth to better speakers, the music will play through the bluetooth connection. If I ask Echo to play music through the group, it will only play the music through the built in speakers in the Echo Plus and Dots which are pretty low fidelity.

If I fire up my iPad and look at the settings of each of the Echo devices, they still show active bluetooth connections, they just won't play the music through them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Larry Tiggis,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2018","We are a long time Amazon Prime family, many years, but new to the Alexa world and thought the purchase of Alexa Plus, with hub, and included Phillips Hue light bulb would be a great start. Alexa does a lot of good things for us like Alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my Sirrius/xm account. Good daily stuff. Good sound, but not Bose. But, the ads say ""Hub included"" so don't need anything else to operate devices. Well, not so. I understand there will be some differences in product device support. The fact that it came with the Hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. The bulb is capable of so much more with the Hue App but the Hue app does not recognize Alexa hub as a bridge. So, it appears you do have to get a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. That can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. The list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge. Was very disappointed to find that out after the fact, to the point I feel we are being misled by Amazon by included the Hue bulbs without explanation. Maybe throw a good discount my way to get the Hue bridge if I keep the Echo Plus before I invest in more light bulbs.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I am computer literate, iTunes literate, Amazon literate, as well as countless other programs, but am apparently a dunce when it comes to talking to Alexa. I think I heard her sigh in exasperation.

I tried to create a playlist of songs I like only to have it ignored. I am learning workarounds but they are mediocre, at best...and, as yet do not include a personal playlist.

I have scoured the beginners section but the beginners it addresses are far more advanced in basic Alexa than am I.
So far, I like what I have been able to use but I'd like it a lot more if I could configure it to my needs, rather than accepting the Amazon/Alexa default.

Bobbi Halvorsen,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2018","I have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a Philip Hue bulb. The excited ended quickly. I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus. Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message. I tried to set this up over and over and over again. I watched YouTube videos. I read set up websites. I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).

The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support. I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error. Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work. This product has tested my patience. So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.

The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb. The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device.

I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo? The support person had the same thought. Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub. It looks like a defuser.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2018","Sound quality is good for music, that's about it. Smart home functionality is worthless. I invested in smart bulbs for the entire house (mix of Phillips Hue and Cree), set up groups for every room, etc. Everything worked great for a few days. Then bulbs would randomly stop working, giving a ""device is unresponsive"" error in the app and a ""device with that name was not found"" error from Alexa. Echo devices will randomly show a red a ring and not respond to any commands a couple times a day. Group and device names stop working requiring me to re-learn every device with a new a name, create new groups with different names, etc. The two lights in my baby's room were originally grouped as ""Kristine's room"". They stopped working one day saying there was no group or device with that name. So I forgot all devices, reset them all, relearned and renamed them as ""baby's room"" which worked for a couple days, now neither of those group names will work and the group is called ""room 3"" which is just frustrating. After a couple hours on the phone with Echo support, they had me running around the house unplugging every echo in every room, then running around holding each action button, then running around resetting all the lights individually, nothing fixed the issue. Their response was that I needed to purchase a Zigbee hub and download the Zigbee app on my phone to control everything. The only reason I purchased this Echo Plus was because it has a built in Zigbee hub so I would not need a bunch of external hubs and multiple apps to run everything. I refuse to purchase another hub, etc. So now I just deal with it, running around the house every couple days spending an hour or two resetting each and every bulb, relearning them all, re grouping them all and testing them.

I thought it might be nice to experiment with home automation, for basically the same price as I paid for my original Echo. The result is underwhelming. Setup was extremely easy. The new Echo sounds just like the old one. But not discernably better. I can indeed control the Phillips bulb with Alexa. However, this control is limited to ""on"", ""off"", and dimming. This is fun for a minute. then you realize that the bulb can ONLY be controlled by voice or app. If it is turned off by switch, it's off until switched on again by hand. I realized that I'll rarely if ever use it. Also, I had expected a more robust set of controls, like timers that would work just like Alexa 's alarms (""Alexa, turn on my bedside lamp every weekday at 7am""). It seems natural. But alas, no.

I felt like I did a lot of research before buying this echo and before buying my smart home devices but apparently I didn’t read the fine print. In the description of the Echo Plus it says that it is compatible with all ZigBee devices and there is a hot link which takes you what I would assume were these ZigBee compatible devices. I bought a Schlage lock and some light switches that were listed on this page but much to my dismay my Echo Plus could NOT discover them no matter what I did. Then I dug deeper into the Alexa app-specifically the skills page and found out that the lock and light switches were in fact NOT compatible with this hub and required a separate $85 smart things hub. I was very disappointed and felt misled by the initial link to supposedly compatible devices. There is no point in paying the extra money for the PLUS if you are going to need to buy a separate hub anyway. I will likely return mine and just get a standard Echo.,3.0 out of 5 stars

After trying it... realized that the sound wasn't by any means phenomenal... BUT I knew that B4 going forward! I already had a Bluetooth tower speaker (floor sized).. which I do connect my dot to..works great! Love it!!

Then decided to go for the echo plus...(has built in hub, great speaker, etc)... How much can I say...I love it!?!?!?!?!?
For the naysayers..... Please try B4 you say nay!
Yes Google has similar device, but they've had some issues, (I perdonally) use Amazon products frequently), they're adding more features..& yes they do have room for many more features ...& I imagine Jeff Bezos doesn't plan on being outshined by Google... Thus I think the official race Alexa vs Google might be on!!!
Amazon stands my it's products... it's truly a quality product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Crystal,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2019","I’ve had this over a year now and love it. This is the best Echo device for the price. Nice good quality speaker. It is currently paired with two Echo dots. While nice to use them as a intercom system and for announcements the Plus is the superior model. With her built in hub I can operate smart bulbs and smart switches. So versatile and helpful. I use it to set timers when cooking, alarms for waking up, listening to music, manage a shopping list, turn lights on and off, control thermostat, and get information. I can say “I’m home” and it will turn on entry light, welcome me, and adjust temp to my preference. I can say “goodnight” and it will turn off TV, light, and turn on fan. It can help with homework. It helped search shows on fire stick, pause and fast forward.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Byron Jacobs,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2017","I absolutely love my Echo Plus! Since I received it I've installed Phillips Hue lights, Leviton switches and smart sockets to control all sorts of lighting. So why four stars? I was really disappointed after owning my Echo for a week only to have it sporadically pause while playing Amazon Unlimited. About 3 or 4 in the afternoon, the music would suddenly stop for up to 15 seconds and then resume where it left off. This would continue for several hours every day. When I switched to using Pandora I had no problems. My next-door neighbor has no problem with Amazon Unlimited On his Echo Plus. He uses FIOS while I use Comcast. So, is it Echo Plus, the network or the music service? I really don't know. But still, I would highly recommend the Echo Plus.",4.0 out of 5 stars
M. N.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2017","This Echo Plus is very fun to use. It works great as a digital assistant, an alarm clock, and a music player. The high and mid tones are clear and very good sounds; however, it's a little weak on the low tones (bass). The microphone is very sensitive and it can pick up my voice from across the room without me shouting, even when it's playing music. The Zigbee hub works every well with the included Philips Hue White LED bulb; however, I am having problem linking Samsung Motion Sensor to it, even though the Samsung sensor said Zigbee certified. This issue and the lacking bass are the reason I took out one star for this rating.
I have both Google Home and this Echo Plus, and the microphone on this Echo Plus works much better than the one on Google Home.",4.0 out of 5 stars
