theCTHman,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2023","Update - I purchased an Eve Energy (another Matter device), and was having similar problems. Eve’s customer service was very quick and helpful to point out that my issue was that I was using a HomeKit-Enabled WiFi router (AMPLIFI Alien), which was essentially blocking Matter devices from joining. After deleting the router from HomeKit, the Nanoleaf bulb (and Eve Wnergy) were able to be added to my home and are now working seamlessly with HomeKit over Thread as intended!

I would recommend this product again, at least with my recent experience in HomeKit. Leaving the original review/problem below (including the rant, for transparency), in case anyone else has this issue:
Original Post: Please do not purchase at this point, as they don’t work with Apple HomeKit, nor Thread. This is false advertising.
Purchased a while ago and the bulb wouldn’t connect to HomeKit or Thread; only the Nanoleaf app. Got the runaround from Nanoleaf support for a long time and wasted many hours doing everything under the sun to try to get it to work. They finally sent a replacement, but the new one has exactly the same problems…
Nanoleaf should still be selling the old HomeKit only versions until they get it together. Fingers crossed they release an update that fixes all of this, but it has been over 6 months, with no updates that do anything.
I have many HomePod Minis and Thread enabled Apple TV. Also many of the old Nanoleaf HomeKit-only bulbs. Everything else in my smart home works perfectly. I have many other Thread devices I have purchased since, and they work great.",5.0 out of 5 stars

---------
About a week after my earlier review (see below), I received a notification to upgrade my devices' firmware to version 3.6.173. After upgrading, I observed that the slider used to enable the power loss recovery feature now remains at the ON position when set. Also, I'm seeing better thread connectivity: in the past, some devices would occasionally go offline and I blamed my thread border router. Kudos to the Nanoleaf team for fixes and doing so in quick time.
Initial review
---------------
Device is great but app features are unreliable. The power loss recovery feature should prevent a lamp that was previously off from turning on after a power loss. However, if you set the slider in a device's menu to the ON position, it moves back to the OFF position (on its own) after a couple of seconds, hence, the feature won't work.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JK,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2024","A few years ago I bought two of the non-matter Nanoleaf A19 bulbs. They worked so well and had nearly instant responses from the HomeKit app. At the time I was using around 20 Hue A19 soft white bulbs and slowly over the last few years I’ve been having my Hue bulbs burn out. I wasn’t replacing them and got to the point I needed to do something. So I ordered 16 Nanoleaf “Matter” bulbs thinking I’d have great performance like my “HomeKit” versions and also color bulbs rather than soft white that I had with Hue.
I have had nothing but issues since installing. I have never experienced such terrible smart home products. I have tried connecting via Nanoleaf app, HomeKit app, turning off cloud sync, factory refreshing, moving bulbs around to different locations, nothing has worked. If I create a scene in HomeKit, the bulbs randomly change brightness color and almost change in a “choppy” non smooth fashion. Hue bulbs and normal “dumb” dimmers typically have a smooth dimming feature, not these bulbs. They will take multiple steps to dim to where I set it to - might be that I go from 100% down to 20% and the bulbs will suddenly jump to 80 - 60 - 20 or something like that, not in sync, all random and very choppy. I’ve got grouped accessories (3 bulbs per fixture) and each bulb in the group changes independently of the others. Occasionally some change to different colors during the dimming/off/on procedure. There is no explanation to this. I hesitate to make any changes in HomeKit and if there is a scene set I typically need to run it multiple times before it sets correctly.
Lastly I had at least one bulb that would visibly “glow” after showing as off in HomeKit or Nanoleaf apps. I tried factory resetting and moving this bulb and no changes. There could have been more that did this, it was just the one bulb that was in a fixture right above my bed, so every night I could see it glowing in a dark room. Nanoleaf didn’t seem to care about this even after a video and picture. It has a visible glow in a dark room and getting video and picture of this is difficult but even in my evidence it showed a glowing orb in a fixture of 3 bulbs.
I have sent numerous emails to Nanoleaf, spent hours and hours troubleshooting, and there is no solution from them. They tried claiming their engineers were working on a solution which I had no idea was even released because even after it released the bulbs still didn’t work right. Nanoleaf support has run me around in circles, having new people respond to me and act like my ticket didn’t have enough reported data already and they’d ask me to do the standard troubleshooting actions every time I responded or send another list, screenshot, video, etc. The lack of care in the problem was astounding and their support was unwilling to provide help beyond copy/paste support replies.
I don’t know how some of you are enjoying these bulbs. I bought 16 of them and not a single one performed like any other smart bulb I’ve ever tried. They were so bizarre in how they were acting it couldn’t have been just a bad batch, these are terribly engineered. Maybe it’s related to HomeKit and Matter and them not working - but save you money and go to Hue for consistency and an actual good product. Maybe if Nanoleaf decides to go back to their old design I’d be interested again, but these matter bulbs are 100% junk!",1.0 out of 5 stars

- Thread network is very quick and responsive
Cons
- No adaptive lighting
- Does not color match older HomeKit version

Cody M,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2024",Not sure what all the negative reviews are about. Considering I used to use “Sengled”’and had all kinds of issues. That bulb requires a hub and it’s SOOOO frustrating because it disconnects constantly. Whereas this bulb only requires Bluetooth and WiFi. I’ve had this for about 2 months and it’s awesome. No issues. Very bright and easy to use. Love this product considering what I had was terrible,5.0 out of 5 stars
TK,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2022","Colors are fantastic on this, and I find these both more responsive and more vibrant and color accurate than my Hue color bulbs. I'm in the process of transitioning away from Hue and have already bought several more of these.
Only bad thing I can say is these bulbs seem incapable of doing 2500-3000k white range. After a certain point tuning white to a warmer tone, the bulb just starts to dim instead of going warmer. Not a big deal, but odd since it is perfectly capable of doing yellow or orange. My guess is the white and color LEDs are entirely separate. Possibly something that could be fixed in the future via firmware updates.
Other thing I'd note is I highly recommend using these on a Thread network, and not via standard wifi or bluetooth. I've seen a lot of complaints about these, and have not experienced any of these, most likely because I have multiple Thread capable devices that can act as Thread border routers (Nanoleaf shapes, latest Apple TV, and Apple Homepods).",5.0 out of 5 stars
thessmiko,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2022","Update: I also bought a set of Nanoleaf Lines. These have made the app faster and more reliable. I still cannot schedule the bulbs, and circadian lighting still cannot be set in a scene. The desktop app is basically worthless - it constantly crashes and needs to be reconfigured after every shutdown.
Still considering a return because the price point is so high and the connectivity/configurability of these bulbs are poor.
--
I bought these because I was excited that they were google compatible, no hub needed, rgbcw light bulbs. I got the 3 pack and put them in my living room - a side table, a desk lamp, and a floor lamp.
I'm considering returning them less than a week in. I feel like the only way to get these lights to work as described is to also buy a nanoleaf shapes set, which is a hefty investment.
Light quality:
Beautiful bright whites, with 5 degrees of warmth.
Dimmer is a good range, can get very dim.
RGB colors have a full spectrum but are dim even at full brightness. Don't plan to do anything but watch a TV or monitor if you have all your lights in RGB mode.
Connectivity:
It took me forever to find the guide to connect my lights to my Google home. Nanoleaf's links did not work - I found a walk through on a third party website.
Google assistant can turn 2 of my 3 lights on or off on average - one always is missing. It varies which one.
Google cannot schedule lights (requires a thread router, i.e. a 200 set of nanoleaf shapes)
Google cannot set scenes (requires a thread router)
The mobile app cannot schedule these lights for the same reason.
The mobile app takes a while to locate my lights so that i can turn them on, off, or change the color. Most of the time it cannot find 1 or 2 of the lights and I have to restart the app.
App:
The mobile app is a challenge to use.
Essential lights can only have a limited number of basic scenes (preset color patterns) on them.
Circadian lighting cannot be set in a scene (this means you have to choose circadian lighting on each bulb, each time after you change a scene).
Circadian lighting sometimes forgot to update (warm up after sunset) unless I opened the app.
So -
I really feel like these are great bulbs if you are already bought in to nanoleaf panels.
As standalone bulbs they are great white spectrum bulbs with beautiful if dim rgb colors, but they are very frustrating to use.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Ben,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2024","Picked up several of these to replace all the lights around the house. They're easy to install, simple to control with the app, and easy to integrate with Apple HomeKit. I love being able to use Siri to control all the lights in my house as I move room to room, no switches required. The new updated model works with Thread and they're super responsive, turning on/off almost immediately. I love the circadian lighting option, which changes the color and temp of the light with the time of day, making it easier to fall asleep and wake in the morning. I've been really happy with these Nanoleaf Essential bulbs and will continue to use them to illuminate my home.",5.0 out of 5 stars
9to5 Insights,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2024","Pros:
- Rich color options with 16M+ RGBW colors
- Simple HomeKit setup
- More affordable compared to other smart bulbs on the market
Cons:
- Requires constant power to the lamp
- Response time can be slow
Insights:
The Nanoleaf Smart LED A19 is a versatile smart bulb that shines with its vibrant colors and easy integration with Apple HomeKit. However, its design only draws power from the lamp it is installed in. So, like all electronics, continuous power is crucial for maintaining its connection to HomeKit. If the lamp's power is turned off, then you will lose connectivity and all home automation integration. You must use the Apple Home app, Siri, or another compatible home automation platform to control the on/off function of the bulb. It's also worth noting that you may experience slower than expected response times when using this bulb with Apple HomeKit. On the positive side, it is considerably less expensive than other smart bulbs on the market. Overall the Nanoleaf Smart LED A19 is a solid choice for enhancing your smart home lighting.",4.0 out of 5 stars
HowAboutNope,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2024","I’ve been disappointed with color fading on these bulbs. I wanted some low ambient lighting that slowly fades colors. These tend more to hop/flash from color to color than to gently fade, and there is a limit how many steps a scene can contain, so you can’t fake it very easily either. It’s especially visible when they’re set dimmer than 100% bright.
Initially, I set these up using the Nanoleaf app. Then I realized I couldn’t automate them unless I got more kit, so I also bought a HomePod Mini, and set them up again using Home. They’re easy to set up either way.
Via Apple Home it was easy to automate them. They turn off at night if I forget, or turn themselves on when my phone is the first one into the home at night. It was easy to set some basic settings and now I can shout to Siri to turn on bright lights or “make the lights blue” or whatever.
The circadian setting in the Nanoleaf app is very good but I haven’t found a way to access it through Home. That is, if you want to use the circadian lighting, you have to do that via the Nanoleaf app every time, manually. Surely we could at least ask for a widget for this? But ultimately I want to be able to access that setting via Home because that’s where I automate from. It shouldn’t be so hard to say “turn on my light to the circadian setting for the current time of day,” but it’s not possible. Fingers crossed for an update.
I’m happy with how bright they are and my partner, an android guy, is not having any issues accessing them from his own hardware.
But for now, I’m mostly just turning them on and setting them to a solid color because the fades are so jarring, and that’s not why I got them or why I bought a HomePod Mini to go alongside them. So that’s disappointing and I think next time I’ll shop around more.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Josh,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2023","TL;DR: the Nanoleaf app does just fine with these bulbs but it doesn't use Matter to communicate with them (!!!). So far my experience with these Matter-enabled bulbs has been significantly worse than the Essentials with HomeKit bulbs: each bulb took multiple tries to connect to my smart home ecosystem, requiring a factory reset of the bulb if it failed & Home Assistant control of the bulbs seems flaky.
Why 3 stars?
PROS:
- the response times are fast, thanks to Thread
- the bulbs are brighter & more energy efficient than the ones they replaced
- the bulbs can act as Thread routers
- my kids love the scenes you can set the lights on
CONS:
- initial setup was a PITA (-1.5)
- Home Assistant, my main smart home controller, regularly loses connection to the bulbs (probably not Nanoleaf's fault, so I'm not actually deducting any stars for this)
- the bulbs can't be grouped to avoid the popcorn effect when simultaneously controlling multiple bulbs in a single room (-0.5)
Who am I? A tinkerer who authored the initial Home Assistant integration for HomeKit over Thread, specifically to support my original Nanoleaf A19 Essentials bulbs.
Would I buy these (Matter BR30 bulbs) again? No, not right away at least. I do think that Thread-based protocols are the future & I want to support Nanoleaf, who has twice now done the right thing & replaced my Elements controller, even well past the warranty expiration for the second one (manufacturing/component issue they discovered in the power regulation section of the circuit board). Additionally, my favorite Zigbee BR30 bulb was discontinued & I didn't want to pay anywhere close to the price of these bulbs for a Zigbee bulb that couldn't route (I'm looking at you, Sengled). If money were no object, I would have replaced these 6 BR30 bulbs with a nice Zigbee bulb first and then upgraded to Matter at a later date. I don't tend to purchase temporary solutions, however, preferring to be economical with my money (says the person that just bought these $$$ bulbs when a cheapo dumb bulb would have been just fine).
Should you buy them? I would wait a few months or have lots of patience. You should have a Thread Border Router in a good location. Go in with low expectations and maybe your smart home ecosystem of choice will surprise you.
If you decide to purchase these bulbs, set them up one at a time in a lamp sitting right in front of you. First things first, onboard them to the Nanoleaf app & perform any firmware update you are asked to do. Then, go into the bulb's settings in the NL app and click the ""connect to matter"" button. On Android, it will pop up a list of apps that can pair over Matter. In my case this was Google, Alexa, and Home Assistant. After selecting Home Assistant, it was luck of the draw if the app was able to onboard the bulb. If it failed, clicking retry never worked; additionally, the app would not allow you to exit the flow and retry. A full factory reset of the bulb is required to try again. Anecdotally, I found that if the bulb was immediately connected to a Thread network, which was the second step the NL app did during initial pairing, my chances of success were significantly better to connect to the bulb using HA's Matter controller. Finally, I never had any success attempting the QR code or 11-digit code directly within HA but YMMV.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Camdan Mead,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","I bought this because I wanted smart lights to use in my dorm room, where my university wifi doesn't support peer-to-peer networking and traditional smart home devices don't work, because it is one of the only lights on the market that supports Thread (which is a non-IP based mesh network). So, for the purpose that I bought it, it works amazing. Super responsive, easy to set up, and works on university wifi.
Unfortunately, I pretty much have to leave it on one color of white at all times, the color accuracy leaves much to be desired. While red, green, and blue look fine, I usually want less saturated colors, or maybe other colors on the rainbow (purple maybe?) and they just don't look good. Even the variable color temperature is rough, it either looks blue, orange, or white, and the only white that is reasonably bright is very cool.
With that said, if all you want is a Thread smart bulb that maybe supports color changing (even if it might not be stellar), this bulb is perfect.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I applied the update to the bulb that the app said I needed. Then I tried to connect to Apple Home from a special place in the Nanoleaf app. I could not get it to connect.
I deleted the bulb from the Nanoleaf app and reset it (switching the power on and off 10 times). Then, I redid the setup process and it all worked; I was automatically prompted to add it to my Apple Home.

gEoFF,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2023","I was looking forward to smooth experience. As someone who was an early adopter of home automation, I have worked with several platforms and ultimately am a HomeKit user. I figured the evolution to Thread enabled devices would have made for smoother setup, but that unfortunately was not the case. Of the 6 bulbs I purchased, 4 were extremely difficult to setup. The inconsistencies between them was alarming. upon setting up the initial 3, I had to perform a hard reset on 2 several times, before I was able to connect them. I tried setting them up first in the Home app, then Nanoleaf app. Once they were migrated to Home, I was prompted to update the firmware. Here's where things became extremely frustrating. Once again 2 were extremely problematic. I had to reset them multiple times in order to update the firmware. One would not take. I reached out to Nanoleaf customer support. I hate to say this, but they are terrible. Forget getting any reasonable help. They shared a video on how to rest, which I already had. I replied that I performed their suggested reset and almost two weeks and several emails, they finally got back to me. I responded and well, about a week later, not reply. I was about to return them, but tried resetting the one again. Actually, had to reset it 3 times and set it back up. Finally the firmware took. The next 3 exhibited the same issue. 2 needed to be reset, and one required several resets before I could update the firmware. I sure hope they fix their software, it's terrible. At this point, I will only buy Thread enabled devices, which these are the only options so far. I would also like brighter bulbs. Nanoleaf should release something with twice the output. These are great, but not for everywhere. Also, hire some decent customer service people please!

avholic,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2024","I bought these bulbs because I need four BR30 smart bulbs for my recessed dining room lighting. For the record I already own more than a dozen of (pre-Matter) Nanoleaf A19 thread compatible smart bulbs all integrated in my massive HomeKit system.
While the original (pre-Matter) Nanoleaf bulbs support HomeKit's Adaptive Lighting (ie. Circadian lighting) these Matter compatible Nanoleaf bulbs DO NOT (as of the time I wrote this review). There is no firmware upgrade to enable that feature for Apple HomeKit users on these Matter-Nanoleaf bulbs. The Nanoleaf App stated that my new bulbs have the latest firmware.
Bad decision for Nanoleaf. Unfortunate for Apple HomeKit users. Matter (non-HomeKit) users would not even notice because they probably never experienced native circadian lighting functionality in their respective ecosystems.
I regret not buying more HomeKit exclusive A19 bulbs while they were still available. Unfortunately Nanoleaf only started selling BR30 bulbs in Matter format. Which is why I am keeping these BR30 bulbs but not buying anymore of these Matter Nanoleaf bulbs until Nanoleaf fix their backwards-oriented products (technology wise).

J. Tant,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2024","To set the stage, I am in the Nanoleaf HomeKit system in a BIG way. Shapes. Elements. Lightstrips. Even a remote. And of course about twenty bulbs. Having them all work flawlessly with HomeKit was the major reason...a quality product with absolutely wonderful integration is something that I really valued. And I never had a cross word about Nanoleaf.
But here we are.
I'm not the kind of person who follows developments in this space overly religiously. I had the system, it works, end of story for me. However, one of my Essentials bulbs started flickering a bit, enough so that I figured it was an LED bank that was overheating or something, and hence a replacement is called for. Little did I know that I really should have stocked up and hoarded the HomeKit bulbs, because, well...
The Matter bulb is not as good. Worse in fact. Much worse.
Oddly enough, the catalyst for this review is the HomeKit adaptive lighting. It's really a great feature and one that not only works, but satisfies my OCD of having all lights in a room use the same color and temperature. When setting up the Matter version here...adaptive lighting via the Home app simply isn't there. And I believe I get why, being Matter is a particular protocol or whatever that's built around compatibility. So what I'm left with is trying to use the Nanoleaf version of adaptive lighting to get this to integrate VISUALLY, and not just SYSTEMICALLY. And this bulb absolutely fails.
To get it to work at least approximately as well as the HomeKit bulb, I had to manually fiddle with the bulb in the Nanoleaf app, itself a frustrating ordeal. For managing the hardware, the Nanoleaf app is really only good for downloading updates and finding interesting scenes. For pure hardware management, it's lousy. So an hour later I have it kind of, almost, but not quite set up to do the same things it only took me about ten minutes to do with the HomeKit bulb.
In short, I have an ""upgrade"" with less functionality than the original.
And this is sad. I have a LOT of HomeKit items from Nanoleaf, the majority of which (namely about twenty bulbs...) simply have no equivalent replacement from Nanoleaf. This leaves a very bad taste in my mouth as I contemplate future smart home maintenance. I'm sure the time will come shortly when I will have problems with the other bulbs in the house (wear and tear, lack of continued firmware updates, etc) and will give serious thought to bailing and going to another vendor. Not having native HomeKit integrations is really a deal breaker for me.

Hambric’s Curve,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2024","After hours of frustration trying to add the Nanoleaf Essentials Smart Bulb to HomeKit, I decided to return it. If you’re using HomeKit in ios 17, I recommend that you find another smart bulb as this one may not easily connect. The bulb works great with the Nanoleaf app, so I can see that the bulb itself is of a nice quality, but without HomeKit integration, it doesn’t fit my needs. My reason for using HomeKit is to manage my smart accessories in one app to avoid using multiple apps. It’s nice to have the color options, but until I find a replacement, I just put the LED bulb this Nanoleaf Essentials was meant to replace back into my lamp and deleted the Nanoleaf app from my phone. This experience has turned away from even trying other Nanoleaf products, which is a shame.
Update: After deleting and reloading everything a couple of times, including making sure the instances were ‘forgotten,’ the Nanoleaf Essentials bulb is now working correctly in HomeKit. Ironically, I added it to HomeKit before adding it to Nanoleaf, and that seems to have done the trick.

DP,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2023","So look, I have the PRIOR edition HomeKit over thread nanoleaf bulbs and they are GREAT. Nice colors, beautiful scenes, thread connectivity rock solid, very little latency.
I assumed these new Matter versions would be more newer and more better. WRONG. Nanoleaf does NOT currently support Group Scenes for Matter edition bulbs. This essentially means that I cannot trigger nanoleaf scenes from HomeKit with the new bulbs. This is a dealbreaker for me. I was also pretty annoyed with nanoleaf support because I explained my issue and they wanted me to try all this troubleshooting that was useless and then later I discovered in a Reddit thread that the problem is that group scenes don't work in the matter edition. Hellooooo maybe nanoleaf support should know that and have told me?????????
After I called them out on it, they said ooooh yeah we're aware of that, and allege that they will roll out support in a future update. Color me doubtful.
Anyways, this is a particular issue for my use case. If inability to trigger nanoleaf scenes via HomeKit is not a dealbreaker for you, then the bulbs otherwise do have the same good thread connectivity and fast response as old version. They are bright and have beautiful colors. You can trigger all the color changing scenes through the nanoleaf app and that works perfectly.

Garren R.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2024","I wanted to like these. They’re bright, have great colors, and they feel high quality in your hand. When you first set them up and they’re connected, they’re awesome. You’ll feel like a genius consumer, laughing to yourself as you remember the expensive hue bulbs you smugly scrolled past on your way down to nanoleaf.
Then an hour will go by and you’ll try to turn your lights off only to see “NO RESPONSE” in Homekit under one or more of your devices. No prob, you’ll think. I’ll just cycle the power and let them connect fresh. Yep that’ll work, for 20 minutes. Then back to NO RESPONSE. I’m exaggerating a bit, admittedly—sometimes they’ll work for short stretches of a day, day and a half. But inevitably, you’re headed back to NO RESPONSE town, and soon. Usually right when you *really* need the lights to turn on, like so you don’t trip over your dog in the dark. But they won’t turn on, and you will trip over your dog in the dark.
I know it’s not my wifi. I have a great mesh network with more nodes than my house needs. I even dedicated two of them to the nanoleafs ONLY via mac address filtering and still, no dice. My hub is the newest 4K apple TV. Oh, and all of my other IoT stuff works flawlessly. I should have said that first.
Anyway, I don’t normally write reviews but I felt like if I could save one hopeful person from having their hopes dashed like mine, then my frustration wouldn’t entirely be in vain. These bulbs are truly the epitome of “too good to be true” and I highly regret purchasing them. My stupidity led me to continue fussing with them until after the return date cutoff, so I’m stuck with them. They’re going in a drawer. Or maybe I’ll give them to an enemy.

Madholm,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2022","I have Hue lights throughout my entire house (excluding bathroom, attic and closets), but I wanted to try out thread devices after switching to eero mesh routers. While I already knew these bulbs were going to have poor color brightness, I thought they would be good for adding adaptive lighting to fixtures/rooms of less importance.
I installed one for testing over the weekend on my back patio, which installed and updated after a couple tries. Then on Monday, after I tossed the box into the recycle bin, I paired up the other two bulbs. Neither of these bulbs would update and after re-adding them I was able to get a second bulb up to date. The third bulb is now saying it’s attached to another home and it won’t let me add it to my home.
I have installed dozens of lights and HomeKit accessories. These Nanoleaf bulbs are hands down the worst initial customer experience of any smart home device I’ve ever purchased and set up.
The fact that I’m going to have to call customer service the mist basic function device function of “initial set up” is unacceptable. If these bulbs don’t over deliver for the price point, they will be my first and (possibly) last Nanoleaf product.
UPDATE: Nanoleaf customer care got the bulbs working after a few hard resets so I have updated my review score to 3 stars. I will likely buy more of their products, but I am docking points for the frustration of updating the firmware and another for the color brightness. Overall the A19 bulbs from Nanoleaf are acceptable quality color lights with great features like thread. They won’t be the best choice for every lighting need, but they are reasonably priced. I would recommend checking these for any fixtures you are considering something like a Hue standard or Hue white ambiance bulb unless Hue decides to cut the price of those products.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Mike Andrews,"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2023","First off, these bulbs are pretty legitimately 60W replacements. The colors are rich, and they're capable of a wide range of color temperatures. In short, the light output is great. Now for the negatives:
The setup process is cumbersome. I couldn't get the QR code to scan in the Nanoleaf app. This is by far the smallest one of these I've ever seen, so perhaps it was just too small for my iPhone 13 Mini's camera? Had to type in the code.
Of two bulbs I have, only one has taken the firmware update, despite multiple attempts. Perhaps it's over bluetooth and your phone has to be right next to the bulb?
Once the bulb is in Homekit, you'll find that you can't do many of the cool features of the bulb like the flickering or slowly cycling through the colors. You have to do those from the Nanoleaf app.
Finally, I had intended to give this to my kid to control from an iPad. The bulbs only have full functionality from one app, and of course, that's the app where I set them up on my phone. I'll have to un-pair them and re-do the setup from the other device.
I'm sure we'll find a use for these somewhere. I had high hopes for them, but they've turned out to be the worst of a dozen or so homekit-related purchases.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Drew,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2023","I have 6 of the lights installed. The Matter adoption was very easy, and has been working without any issues. The light produced from the bulbs is pretty good, although of note, the RBG colors are significantly dimmer than the daylight whites.
The matter integration has the lights responding very quickly to commands, however there is no grace. Dimming the lights is jarring, having the light jump strait to the indicated level. My main pain point is when I adjust the lights they are not coordinated. The 6 lights operate as 6 separate lights, instead of a group. It leads to a pop-corn effect where lights pop to the requested setting randomly over a period of a second or so.
The lights do keep their previous setting when I turn them off via the light switch. There are 2 things to note though. 1: it takes a bit for the lights to re-connect after power is restored via the light switch. 2: The lights are reset if you toggle the light switch quickly 5+ times.
I'll probably keep the lights, however I'll be moving them to secondary areas. Closets, smaller rooms ect.",3.0 out of 5 stars
AppleSuperFan,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2024","I’m loving these lightbulbs so far. I’ve tried many of the cheaper HomeKit and Matter bulbs available on Amazon, and while I was impressed with Meross bulbs, they stopped responding a few weeks ago. I moved to another set that came with 6 for $30 (a great deal), but they weren’t bright at all, though they were Matter bulbs.
These ones by Nanoleaf were extremely easy to set up with Apple HomeKit on my iPhone and paired almost immediately. I quickly integrated them into my scenes in place of the old bulbs and had a great experience with that, too. These bulbs use the Matter standard and should work much better than the previous type of accessory. They are also very bright, nearly double the previous ones and quite a bit brighter than the Meross 120s they replaced in a few places.
I’m very impressed. I was initially hesitant after reading a review on another product disparaging the Nanoleaf brand, but these have so far been nothing but awesome. They are more expensive than the other sometimes Chinese brands, but it seems they are worth every penny. They are certainly much cheaper than the Hue line. Good luck, YMMV.",5.0 out of 5 stars
taylor simpson,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2024",After having the shapes and loving them I decided to get this thing and honestly its not worth it. The colors are terrible. It works reliably ONLY IF YOU DONT CHANGE ANYTHING between uses and it becomes a hassle when you do. Its not as bright as my simple Ikea wireless bulb I had before even on natural colors. It also changes colors weirdly meaning transitions from one color to another often results in some really funky completely different colors so if you have a constantly changing color it never comes out right compared to the Shapes panels.

YAZEED A.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2023","I like the options and the app is ok, but they're a real hassle to use.
I got them connected to my homepod after I got frustrated with the slow and unreliable bluetooth connection, and they were still dropping connections and not doing what I want. After 10 months, one of the lightbulbs stopped working completely, until i did a reset, after which it only produced yellow lights (i.e., bright white wasn't working at all). After troubleshooting with their support they stopped replying.
After many instances of lost connections, slow light switching, and app crashes I decided to bite the bullet and get a philips. NIGHT AND DAY difference; the color options, the app interface, the app availability (mac app!), etc. are just superior. At first I tried the bluetooth connection and it was very smooth, much smoother than the hub-connected Nanoleaf, but then I got the hue bridge and used that instead.
I know it's more than double the price to get a hue, but just get it. I ended up spending more money in the end by not buying a philips from the get-go. Try to look for a deal or a used bulb(s) if you can, but just don't get nanoleaf.

RGB2,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2022",I love these bulbs. I got these because of the price and Thread support. It works great with my homepod mini using thread and is fast and responsive. It also works great with Alexa. The white light is among the best I've seen. The white light is very bright. I also really like both adaptive lighting using homekit and the circadian lighting using the nanoleaf app. Both options do a great job of adjusting the white light to the time of day. You get cool white during the day gradually changing to warm white as the sun goes down. It's awesome. The downside comes when using RGB colors. They aren't very bright or saturated. I knew this before I bought the bulbs from seeing other reviews and was still a little surprised how let down I was. I am the only one in my house that cares about color so it's not a big deal that the RGB colors on the bulbs aren't that good. I would definitely recommend these bubs for people that want to replace their standard bulbs with smart bulbs wherever you need white light.,4.0 out of 5 stars

A little busy.
They’re also not as quick as HUE when it comes to on and off or changes. Nothing terrible. Just worth mentioning. I don’t know if I would have bought these if they weren’t on sale. Maybe? Overall they work. I’ve only had them for a week or so, so we’ll see.",4.0 out of 5 stars

UPDATE: did a factory reset on the bulb and it is now working again. I’ve returned the rating to a 4. Everything works fine now.

Phil,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2023","UPDATE 2: Changed from 3 stars back to 1 star. Added additional bulbs and not a single one linked up without some sort of error. Everything seemed okay at first but in less than 24 hours they started jumping around from thread to Bluetooth to disconnected. Couldn’t control with Alexa after a while. Couldn’t get the “unavailable” bulbs working again. Not worth the trouble. Took all of them down and shipped them back for a refund.
UPDATE: Changed from 1 to 3 stars because I was finally able to get them added through Alexa but took about 12 hours of messing around, dealing with errors, moving near different Echo devices, moving near different bulb locations, moving near different WiFi access points. It was a nightmare.
Not sure if it was an Alexa or nanoleaf problem but it refused to join the Thread network directly through Alexa and kept looping, prompting for a network key. I was able to get the network key from the nanoleaf app but it still didn’t accept it for future bulbs. So, the method was 1. Add to Alexa using Bluetooth 2. Add to nanoleaf app for Thread network and firmware updates. Still trying to figure out how to get Google to add the devices through Matter so I can use my choice of voice control but haven’t been successful. It sees the lights but won’t onboard them, even when generating a new Matter code in the Alexa app. Might not be possible because different manufacturers don’t share Thread network credentials? Not sure.
ORIGINAL REVIEW: I was thrilled to learn that my Amazon and Google devices now support Matter, more specifically Thread and was looking forward to having easy to set up lights that worked universally across ecosystems and didn’t require a separate hub. Maaan I was in for the biggest disappointment of my life. Six hours later, I am giving up. Won’t work with Alexa or Google and even though it was smooth enough linking it to the nanoleaf app, it kept dropping from Thread to Bluetooth to disconnected.

E.L.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2023","I tried some other smart bulbs. And when I set those on 1% to use as a night light, it's almost at 25% of full brightness. Thankfully, not this one. 1% is such a dim glimmer you might not know it's on, and from there you can go all the way to 100. My only wish is that I could get even more lumens out of it, but that's more my fault than the bulb's fault, for not checking the lumens vs. my own lighting conditions. At 100% power this is going to give you about the same as a 50W old-school incadescent bulb. If you want something equivalent to 100W to really get some light, all I can say is do your research about watts and lumens before picking a bulb on the market.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Logic Board,"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2023","The lights have great color however, once they lose connection with your HomePod. Or something happens some kind of a little glitch you can’t figure out. suddenly your light doesn’t connect anymore. And it’s basically just a completely overpriced LED bulb. Their tech-support sucks. They give you a list of things to do reset the bulb turn the lights on and off, etc, etc. And then when you go do all that and they don’t work regardless. Tech Support says thanks for trying will pass this on to our developers and you’re stuck with an overpriced LED bulb that can’t connect to your system. I’ve wasted hours and hours and hours on these lights. I’ve climbed up my ladder to go up to my 20 ft ceilings and replace their old lights with these new “matter” lights, and they still don’t work. In metro I wish I bought the Phillips Hue which are a bit more expensive or tried new cheaper ones.
The problem is, I’m now hooked on the ability to be able to change the lighting in my house to create looks with greater depth of field. Being able to turn the lights on and off at certain times, or change the light settings at different times, so you never have to even worry about turning the lights on and off because they gradually go dimmer as the night goes on, and then go into a sleep mode where just a low light is on and all sorts of places with the house. And then it breaks.
And when it breaks, there’s no fixing it you can’t get your scheme back to work again. It’s like when you make a great music mix and then it gets lost or iTunes changes format and loses it or something like that. It’s just gone and you don’t feel like going back and doing it again. That’s what these lights are like. Someday somebody will be able to make a reliable light like this. Unfortunately, that day has not come and these lights don’t deliver any kind of reliability to work as they say they would. Buy at your own risk.

The adaptive lighting feature of HomeKit is great. I have only two complaints:
1. The brightness in white hues is great, but when setting to any other color it’s VERY dim. If you want bright RGB, look into Philips Hue instead.
2. Rather than issuing a software update for Matter support, it sounds like Matter versions of these bulbs will be a separate model.

K. McCarvel,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2023","I bought this to set up a mini smart home set up and to have time based lamps. After I received the light bulbs, I realized I need to have a smart home hub which meant purchasing another device like an Apple Home Pod Mini. Once that arrived, I tried to set up the light bulb which is not user intuitive at all.
There is a QR code on the device for Matter but when you screw it into the lamp, it gets obscured. Flipping this 180 degrees would have solved the problem but it shows how little testing or care goes into this product. Thankfully they know this is an issue and provide a sticker with the QR codes.
You have to download their app to get the firmware updates and to operate the light bulb. The app sucks. It's poorly designed with a very unfriendly user interface and is frankly confusing. As someone that picks up new devices and interfaces well, this was a nightmare. It has a tendency to copy to WeChat's interfaces which I find to be not like anything else I experience in the US.
Their customer support portion of the app is very heavily adopted from WeChat which is the worst part of both apps. I reached out to customer service and was told I'd get an answer in 5 minutes, it ended up being about 10 minutes which isn't bad at 9pm PT on a Monday night. The support rep sent instructions which were out of date and the ""Turn On Pairing Mode"" didn't exist or I couldn't find it.

Pros:
Super Easy to add to the Home app (I added to the Home app before I downloaded the Nanoleaf app)
Updating Firmware is super quick
Switched to Thread within minutes (probably faster)
Nanoleaf app is a little confusing
Brightness is okay - I’ve played around with the preset scenes and the colors definitely do look a little washed like what everyone says on their reviews. (I’ve got these strictly for pure white and amber for night time viewing to ease the eyes)
Weird default color. When it defaults to white, instead of being white. It has a pinkish/red tint to the bulb. Not sure why that is, but I do have to manually change it. (A little annoying)
When deleting “duplicates” it’ll delete the bulbs from the Home app as well. Had to add them back to the Home App. (Minor hassle)

EU,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2023","Setting up the bulbs in Apple Home was easy - you don't even need the Nanoleaf app. However that app is necessary for firmware updates and some more advanced options.
Colors are nice overall. I love the swatch view where you can easily make minor changes to the temperature.
I keep each lamp connected to an Eve Energy Outlet - I like to keep power off of my lamps when they are not in use. Some of them are pretty old & I feel better keeping the power completely off unless I am using them. Unfortunately, this setup doesn't work with these bulbs.
They keep going unresponsive after power has been off for a length of time. If it's just a couple minutes, it is usually fine. But leave power off overnight and 3/4 of them have lost connection in the morning. Sometimes they just lose the connection in Home, sometimes in Nanoleaf too. In general it seems to take them a little time to find the network when they've been out of power. Sometimes they just can't connect again. Sometimes certain changes in the Nanoleaf app fixes it. Otherwise re-pairing will - which is obviously not ideal at all.
Nanoleaf did respond quickly when I reported the issue but they blamed Google Home...which I don't have. They also said to just use the Nanoleaf app to turn the bulbs on/off - which I have no interest in doing, or factory reset/re-pair. Which is kinda ridiculous to need whenever the devices haven't had power...my last smart bulbs handled that without issue. I just wanted thread/Homekit specific instead of needing multiple systems.
I don't know if that's really the expectation - that these bulbs should never lose power. Seems like really poor design if so. Or poor quality control if this shouldn't happen.
So if you never need to turn the power off, and don't typically lose power, you are more likely to be happy with these. As for me, unless I can find a magic configuration, or there's an actual fix, I will probably return these and figure something else out.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Anon,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2023","These bulbs are different than standard wifi smart bulbs in that they rely on the thread networks for communication and matter for protocol. Most smart home hubs from the mainline ecosystems (Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung Smarthings, and Apple Homekit) all provide the thread network and matter controller. In theory, you simply add to your smart home and it works great.
In practice, nanoleaf has terrible firmware for their entire essential lines (see other comments about unresponsive devices). Nanoleaf has failed to properly implement the matter communication protocol which leads to the problems listed in other reviews. I would not recommend these to anyone; even if you're very familiar with networking and thread/matter, these are a nightmare, much less an average consumer. Nanoleaf has acknowledged the problem and promised for months to fix the issue via a firmware update, but that has yet to be seen.
If you do buy these, whatever you do, don't pair more than about 8-10 or they will destroy your thread network and potentially make it not only impossible to communicate with your bulbs, but also with your other thread devices.

I decided to first try these bulbs (mostly due to the thread support as I have a couple thread devices between the location of these bulbs and the router.

Honestly. These are great. They are very responsive and have good color and I’m pretty happy with the brightness as well.
Everyone complaining about these…. I feel like the issue is most likely with their network and HomeKit configs. Conflicting items. Or poor network setup.
I will admit I am a systems engineer so my home network is very much optimized like an enterprise network is. But that only means that my network is operating as intended.

Josue,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2023","Not that anyone still trusts Amazon reviews since bad ones are suppressed to simply move product through the Bank of Amazon — but I’m doing my diligence to share my experience with this product. First off, app is developed so incredibly poorly. Riddled with UI errors overlaying where you can’t read the screen or see buttons halfway hidden behind elements. Too many hieroglyphic icons instead of plain simple shapes with text decryptions for what the buttons do. Far too frustrating to use to be of any utility. I work in software development and I have been digging for 20 minutes just to find the setting to simply tell the bulb not to automatically come back on after a power outage (which according to Google apparently exists somewhere) It’s bad. A perfect example of exactly how not to build an app. Do better nano leaf.
Secondly, the bulb itself leaves so much to be desired. It’s so slow to ‘boot up’ that when power is restored to it, it flashes through the different colour tones it uses to ‘mix’ and achieve your programmed default colour. I.e. if you want to use this as a regular lightbulb absolutely look elsewhere. The ‘warm incandescent’ colour tone is a mix of 3 other colours which when all illuminated product the right tone, but when you power the bulb off and back on it cycles through these slowly and you get this bizarre rainbow show as the light boots up and slowly add the colours to achieve your desired mix. This makes totally unfeasble for use in my opinion. People want to turn on the light switch and have the light they programmed immediately, not a bulb that has to ‘boot up’ by cycling through a rainbow light show. Incredibly dumb design a HUGE miss. Shocked this product even made it to market. It’s clear that nanobot is just another pop-up lighting company focused on quantity over quality. Do better.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2024","I'd give 0 stars if possible. Just not working as intended. NOT compatible with Samsung smartthings station (the wireless charger / thread matter hub/gateway).
Initial delight: plug in the lamp, popup on phone, wanna add the light? Oh yeah! Wow! So much better than z-wave/zigbee stuff..click next and always ends up on error 39-517. Hm..after one hour of trying still same crap.
Install nanoleaf app, are the lamps defective? Adding the lamp, nanoleaf claims there's no thread network available (yeah there is). Added lamp via bluetooth.
Yeah,aint gonna accept that. Delete the lamp, re-add..keep going..plops. worked! It found the smartthings thread network.
How ever the lamp is NOwhere to be seen in the smartthings app - despite nanoleaf claiming to have added it to the network.
Add it to smartthings separately? Trying..failing..
Clicking around noticed firmware update for the lamp in the nanoleaf app. Did that.
Delete the lamp, start all over.
Nope, can't add to smartthings station, always the same error. (Smartthings station firmware was up to date).
Can't add it to Amazon alexa either (yes, the one that supports matter/thread).
Lamps sit in nanoleaf app, no alexa integration, no smartthings integration.
Should've believed people's complaints all around the internet and walked away...

They are slightly less bright than my RGBW Hue bulbs, but I rarely use them at full brightness. They’re very responsive and so honestly doubt I’ll ever buy another Hue bulb again with this type of competition. I really don’t think I could be any more pleased for the prices.

Russell J.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2023","This product is embarrassingly bad. I can only comment on integration with Apple HomeKit to be fair. The older models also has small issues but work pretty decent. However these matter ones are borderline useless. I have three of these and only one is even remotely reliable. I have factory reset, deleted from HomeKit and reintroduced back in HomeKit to no avail. The only and I mean only thing these work consistently for is just turning on using the white color on and off. If you had the bulb on another color when it was turned off it always briefly comes on to that color before going to white. I have a very solid thread network in my home so it is not that. I have about 50 some HomeKit devices and these bulbs are the only products that I would say give me problems or simply just don’t work on a regular basis. I really hope a firmware release will fix these issues in the future because they are reasonably priced, brighter than hue bulbs and have a somewhat decent color rendering (not anywhere near the color quality as hue but acceptable). I’m giving these a few months to hope for an update to come through otherwise their place in my smart home may be short lived. I truly think they seem to be effected by other wireless protocols and have major issues when two bulbs are in the same fixture. Almost seems that whichever bulb gets the command first by a split second is the only bulb that executes and the others are left just sitting in whatever state it was in. Can not recommend these at all.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Customer Review,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2022","For anyone out there who has been searching for a HomeKit color bulb and is tired of their current ones disconnecting or just not always working when they should- these bulbs from Nanoleaf are the solution. I have tried bulbs from many brands except for LIFX (too expensive), and either the white tones are off of the colors don’t match the on-screen controls. Almost all of them tend to have some kind of issue with maintaining connection to your HomeKit hub. These are the first HomeKit bulbs that I have ever used that just work like they are supposed to, get decently bright, and have nice-looking colors. I’m so glad that I bought these!

E. Hill,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2022","I decided to try these bulbs since they were Thread capable and one YouTuber said they would be updated to Matter. He was wrong as the Nanoleaf web site says they won’t be. I got 6 of these bulbs paired them with the Google Home app. They seemed to work for the first week but as time went on they slowly got so they wouldn’t respond and often showed off-line. I downloaded the Nanoleaf app and did a firmware update which took many tries to get completed on most of the bulbs. No change in operation. When they stop responding I have to do a factory reset and load them in to Google Home again only to have them fail again. This evening I couldn’t get one of them to work again even after resetting it several times. Maybe the problem is with Google home or maybe I’m getting interference for the Bluetooth channel but my other Bluetooth devices work fine. I sure don’t recommend these to anyone using that app. After spending most of a day on them I took them out of service and went back to regular bulbs as I can do without the frustration. The Nanoleaf app isn’t too user friendly to me as I couldn’t see how to delete the device in the app to reinstall it after the reset. Sometimes the bulbs would work in the Nanoleaf app even if it didn’t in Google Home but not always. I didn’t return them to Amazon because I threw away the boxes so if you decided to try them keep the packaging just in case.

However, these NanoLeaf bulbs speak the newer protocols (Thread) just fine and work well with HomeKit and are significantly cheaper than Hue.
Please note: I have a HomePod device which acts as a Thread router - I am not 100% sure how these would work if they were connected to a network that didn't have thread - I assume they back down to other protocols but if you have HomeKit and a HomePod etc..

Ces3190,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2023","I purchased a few different Matter/Thread products to add to my smart home setup. I have multiple TBRs (Nest Hub 2, Apple TV 4K 2022, Smarttthings Station).
Although all of the products I purchased were finicky and difficult to pair, these lights stretched my patience to its breaking point. Connecting them to the Nanoleaf app was simple, but then adding them to Apple Home and Smartthings was basically impossible. I don’t know precisely how many hours I spent attempting and failing to pair them to the Apple Home and Smartthings, but it was easily in excess of 20 hours.
In short, despite dozens of factory resets, attempting to pair from iOS and Android devices, these bulbs refused to pair outside the Nanoleaf app. I observed multiple instances of the same device reported across different devices within the Nanoleaf app (example: iOS app saying a bulb was paired to thread in one room and the android app saying it was only available over Bluetooth in another room; deleting the bulb on one device only for it to remain on another and then reappearing in the original device in a new room).
Sometimes, the bulbs would fail to pair to Smartthings but then from within the Nanoleaf app would not allow me to attempt to pair again because the Nanoleaf app reported the bulbs had already been paired Matter.
To control for the cross platform inconsistencies, I eventually tried to exclusively use an Android device and I also tried to pair directly with Smartthings and Apple Home. None of these solutions worked.

But if you’re buying them, you’re effectively buying a nine dollar per bulb white light. I say this because they continuously lose connectivity. The designers decided that they would not make it easy to reset the bulbs in the app. Their solution is for you to delete the bulbs from the app, go up to wherever you have the bulbs, unscrew them, scan them and add them to the app. They’ll argue that the barcode was on the box, but normal people don’t keep empty bulb boxes. If the app was designed to allow one to restart the bulbs without having to erase them and climb up to the ceiling to rescan them, then this is a five star product however because they continuously lose connection nearly every week, and even when they are connected, they take about two minutes to connect, they are just nice white bulbs with a rare occasion to use them for any other color.

It's good for everyone if products can talk to all the different ecosystems. Unfortunately, Nanoleaf has a ways to go before they will have a Matter-based BR30 bulb that works reliably with HomeKit.
These are terrible! All three of them will show in the Nanoleaf app, so I know they're on the Thread network (the app says so), but different ones at different times show no response in HomeKit. If none of them showed ever, then I would figure it was an installation problem, but yesterday bulbs 1 and 2 showed, but 3 is unresponsive. Today, bulbs 1 and 3 show, but 2 is unresponsive. I thought perhaps they were too far from the HomePod mini border router, so I moved it about 6 feet away and that didn't help. I am disappointed because I'd had such good luck with Nanoleaf before and I thought they would get this right. Back they go.",1.0 out of 5 stars
J. J. Kelly,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2024","Edit: After 2 months of owning I've found these to be terrible bulbs that never work right even after the last update. I would highly recommend looking at something else.
These are my first Thread devices and i can say, so far, I'm not impressed. Color is pretty good with pretty good color with both the tunable whites and rgb. Brightness is also rather acceptable. However, the promised functionality and ease of use of Thread/ Matter has be greatly exaggerated so far. These bulbs took several days of pairing and resetting to finally connect to my border router, and have averaged going unavailable and needing a power cycle a least daily, sometimes just one, sometimes both at the same time. I am pretty tech savvy (to the point I build my own IoT/ESP devices), but if you're not at such a level, I HIGHLY recommend going with a better supported platform such as WiFi or Zigbee because they are just not there yet. I was planning on buying more, but, as of now, it would be a bad investment.",1.0 out of 5 stars

It has to be removed and reset regularly. Just poor all around
-Original review-
Primary complaint is it’s not bright enough to light any main area of the home. It’s better as a secondary light/night light for the kids.
I was able to set it up just fine except I had to type the code in manually. The QR code did not work for all three lights. I have a HomeKit set up and this is the first device I have used that hasn’t worked with the QR code.
Once I had everything set up the update took a few tries and was really slow but I didn’t mind that much.
Finally, it’s not a consistent user experience. Changing the color in the home app doesn’t always work and sometimes it changes to a totally different color then what is selected. The Nanoleaf app is the same way but it seems to work better. The Nanoleaf app offers additional features and functionality then the home app and that’s disappointing to me. If I can’t do everything from my platform of choice then that defeats the purpose of it being thread/matter compatible. In the end, I moved the lights to my kids lamps in their rooms and they love it.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Joel,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2023","Pairing with Bluetooth works, although rather comical. First, the app says ""what's the code on the device?"" but I had put it in a fixture from which I couldn't see it. But if you remove the bulb it's off, so there is nothing to pair. So I turned it in in a bare lamp, but now it's so bright I can't read the code on it. So write down the code, install bulb, power it on, pair it over Bluetooth.
But Thread was a no-go (I'm using Thread on my eero 6+), the Nanoleaf app just says ""No network found"". It recommends I check permissions, all but camera (?) are granted. My phone is on the eero WiFi. No idea what to try next.
I bought these to use on Thread, so if I can't get this to work I'll have to return them.
Edit: Heard back from Nanoleaf support: ""We are not able to support Eero routers.""
Maybe they work with Homepods, maybe they work with Nanoleaf border routers, I don't know as I have neither. But a device that does not freely interoperate with all vendors is a huge step backwards. So much for the promise of Thread, guess I'll have to stick with WiFi where company A will work with company B.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Craig,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2023","I bought 9 of these bulbs hoping to have a few outside and the rest inside. I have a Nest hub gen 2 that acts as the matter controller and thread border router. I powered on the lights one by one making sure the firmware was updated and I could control the light through Google home.
I then placed all the bulbs where they belonged but I could only see 5 of the 9 bulbs! I've waited days hoping it would take a bit for the thread mesh to figure it out but no luck. I can see two lights that are outside and 3 inside. The lights should act as mesh extenders so all my lights should connect.
That is not the case with these lightbulbs. This defeats the purpose of thread.
The only way I can control all my outside lights is if I stand next to them and control them over Bluetooth.

WaysofSir,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2022","I like the product when it works. However, they don’t work. Most of the time they are unreachable, meaning you can’t use Siri or the app to change the brightness, color, scene, etc. you know.. the whole reason one gets a smart bulb. Meaning these became very expensive light bulbs that could only be operated with the traditional light switch.
Troubleshooting was a pain and I had to do it far too often. Once the bulbs were reset and re-added back to the app and HomeKit, they worked for the rest of the day usually. Wake up.. unreachable again. I’ve had numerous smart bulbs and worked in tech for 10 years. I know exactly what to do. These are just junk bulbs.
Warranty.. what warranty? The seller who happens to be the manufacturer of the bulbs, did nothing to help resolve the situation. No offer of replacement bulbs or a refund. Thank goodness for Amazon customer service. Can’t tell you how disappointed I am with these knockoff bulbs from this knockoff company.
Overall, I was excited to try the nanoleaf bulbs. I had a Philips hue system for years and loved it. Sold my home and started trying different setups. There are better bulbs than these for cheaper. And if you want the best, go Philips hue. They’re expensive but worth it. They do more than every other bulb and never have issues.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Davey,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2024","I cannot recommend this product. I bought it because Nanoleaf is supposed to be a good company with good products. This however is is something to stay away from. I tired many different ways to connect this bulb with HomeKit and could not. I am sending it back. Nanoleaf wants you to download *their* app, sign in and add the bulb and supposedly it then gets added to HomeKit. Despite several tries, resets etc, it would not add to HomeKit. Their app is nothing but a poor copy of HomeKit not to mention a store trying to sell you more of their stuff. I have installed other Matter-enabled and non-matter-enabled devices in HomeKit without having to download a proprietary app, as it should be. Meross outlets and bulbs all install flawlessly directly into the Apple Home app. Ill stick with companies that want it to work right more than trying to harvest your information.",1.0 out of 5 stars

I bought the lights to try put thread and matter. I've had so so luck trying out ZigBee and while wifi lights works I'm not a fan of bow finicky they can be.
These lights, straight up nightmare. Will not connect to my thread router.
Now to clarify, I'm using an Echo Gen 4 which claims to be compatible. Simply will not connect. I checked the instructions to see maybe if I was missing something. The instructions say if you can't get it to connect, you must connect it to another thread router. Well jerkfaces, I only have the ONE thread router.

My place is only 1500 square feet, and the bulbs are optimally placed for a Thread network, but even the one that's 5 feet from the border router goes offline constantly. It's definitely not my local WiFi either as I'm pulling 1.2 Gbps internet speed over WiFi. I've worked in various IT and IT Security jobs for 23 years, and even I got sick of troubleshooting and trying to make these work. These are by far the worst smart devices of all the ones I've placed in my home. After several days of frustration, I decided to return them and replace them with the Philips Hue bulbs and hub.

In the Nanoleaf app, they show added to Nest Thread's network, but then in Google Home show disconnected. They were also problematic at adding in the Nanoleaf app. Had to reset them several times. I'd add them to the Nanoleaf app, but then they stop broadcasting so I couldnt add them also to Google Home. So I unplug and re-plug them back in, and then could add them Google Home too. But they refuse to stay connected, and even in the Nanoleaf app, the bluetooth will show ""connecting"" and never connect. I just can't recommend these lights and I'm very technical minded.

Chip,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2023","Try Philips Hue as an alternative. It can't be any worse than these.
I'm a gadget nerd and not intimidated by networking and using Wifi and Bluetooth products. The Nanoleaf A19 bulbs though make me want to throw them in the dumpster. These constantly disconnect from whatever network they're connected to (is it Wifi, or Bluetooth, or Thread? Who knows!).
Re-pairing them requires scanning a QR code on the bulb itself WHILE it's in its socket. Impossible to do on the bedside lamp where I had these. Don't lose the separate QR code card it comes with! That's the only other way to scan and re-pair.
Totally frustrating experience.
While I'm sure many people may have had no problem, I found the constant re-pairing neediness of these bulbs insufferable and not worth my time and effort.

BCG,"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2022","I bought this bulb because I thought it would do basic smart features like Philips Hue, such as setting timers to have the bulb come on and off at certain hours, at a certain color and brightness, or to turn off after a set number of minutes. These bulbs cannot do this unless you have additional equipment such as an Apple HomePod, Apple TV, Google Home, etc which is completely ridiculous! My Philips Hue bulb can easily do these basic tasks without any other hub device. So if you buy this bulb and don't have a HomePod or whatever, all you can really do is manually turn it on and off and have it cycle through colors like a light show -- no ""wake up"" scene, no way to change color or brightness based on the time of day, no way to set it to turn off after X minutes, etc. It's really unbelievable that a company would design a bulb that connects to your iPhone, WiFi, etc but not provide any actual smart features.",1.0 out of 5 stars

These bulbs worked for a few days and then totally dropped off of my HomeKit setup. I followed the directed steps to ""factory reset"" them, re-added them to HomeKit, and they stopped working. I tried to do everything within the NanoLeaf app, as well, but there was nothing to do as it's reliant on HomeKit to add the bulbs.
I contacted NanoLeaf support and they responded very promptly, but there was nothing for them to do because they've apparently messed up their firmware and the iOS NanoLeaf app so badly that they can no longer guarantee their product. They won't even offer a replacement since there's no guarantee of any A19 bulbs working.

Except the circadian lighting on all three of the bulbs from one of my packs mysteriously wouldn't work.

Derek Stringham,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2022","I purchased these due to their early Thread integration and want to move away from a hub tethered smart lighting system (Hue). The lighting itself is good, and Apple Home integration was smooth, however these fail me because when new firmware is available the lighting is unavailable to Siri as it is “updating” in Apple Home. I have to open the Nanoleaf app every time to manually update said firmware before the lighting will work once more. Additionally, it is a pain to update the firmware at times. As I write this, the firmware update recursively states “Update -> Downloading -> Processing -> Update”…rinse and repeat u til it finally states “Retry” due to enough failures apparently. And, less of a gripe more of a better user experience is the seeming inability to smoothly and gradually transition the lighting from off to on and vice versa; the lighting is either on or off there does not seem to be a way to “fade” the lighting.

Colin,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2024","I purchased these bulbs to avoid having to get a Hue Bridge or similar product and just utilize Thread via a Nest Hub and HomePod Mini that I already had.
Immediately, problems arose. Getting the bulbs added to the Nanoleaf app worked, but trying to add Matter devices to Google Home and Apple HomeKit was incredibly frustrating. I had to try numerous times before I could get them added. Even after I got them added, there were numerous connectivity issues, to the point where I had to remove and re-add a bulb. Some automations I set up don’t seem to work properly either. I set up an occupancy sensor to trigger a light to go on automatically, but instead the light never switched on and became totally unresponsive, so I had to turn off the light switch and turn it back on to reset the bulb.
There’s also the issue of light switches. While you will have this problem with any smart bulb, they require power to enable their smart features, so a dumb switch will disable that. You either need a smart switch that works properly with smart bulbs (I’ve seen people reference Inovelli for this, though I personally haven’t tried them) or just just have to leave the light switches on and control the lights via your mobile device/voice command exclusively.
The experience has been far from smooth. I expected more consistent connectivity and responsiveness, but so far it’s been a mixed bag.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Maynard Handley,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2021","I bought these purely on the grounds that I wanted my IoT hardware to be future-proofed, and so should be Thread-based. Turns out that is not a great strategy! Just because a company is forward-looking enough to use Thread doesn't mean they get the rest of the system correct...
The biggest problem with these lights is they flicker. I don't understand what the issue here is. Can no-one build an LED light that doesn't flicker? Just put a damn capacitor in the bulb! This is not rocket science.
Of my 7 Hue bulbs, two ambiance and one color flicker if I drive them at higher than 90% brightness; one hue white flickers if driven at below 70% brightness.
The Nanoleaf I was sent flickers at ANY brightness when at a high color temperature (ie blueish-white) and at anything below about 80% brightness when at a low color temperature. This is not acceptable!
A secondary problem is that it's very slow to respond to HomeKit commands, but I am willing to overlook that for now as it may reflect the distance between the bulb and my Apple TV. Let's see if it gets better as my Thread network fills in.
FWIW of all smartbulbs I have tried
- Hue (as HomeKit) were easy to set up -- but after a few years half have degenerated to some form of flicker unless I keep them in a certain brightness range
- Nanoleaf also easy to set up -- and flickering right out the gate.
- Wyze -- nicely bright, no flicker so far after about two years with two bulb sample. But not HomeKit, so irritating WiFi setup, and I have to use HomeBridge. All communication goes through a server (not local) which once a day decides to reject my authentication token, and I have to try the request again. So 100% for hardware, 0% for software. And being non-HomeKit, you don't get Apple's time of day dependent color temperature.
- Probably the best overall have been Ikea. Again you need HomeBridge, and you have to go through the pain of Ikea's weird Zigbee setup and their weird mental model of how lights are associated with controllers are associated with rooms. But the lights are *mostly* bulletproof once set up, and are extremely cheap.
If whatever I buy lands up sucking one way or another then you might as well pay less for the suckitude.
I think Ikea based on Thread will be the winner once they finally make that switch. Sure, you'll need HomeBridge probably, but if you're already doing that at least you get a bulb that doesn't flicker, is bright enough, and doesn't randomly stop working for dumb reasons.
But damn, it's a sorry indictment of this space that we've been at this for almost 10 years (the first Hue's came out in 2012) and you still cannot buy a product that doesn't suck, whether you are willing to pay at the high end (Hue), midrange (Nanoleaf) or the low end (Wyze or Ikea).",2.0 out of 5 stars

nathanimal,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2022","I bought 13 of these for my home theater, and they have been my most buggy HomeKit devices in my home... which includes quite a few devices which are not natively supported by HomeKit.
The problem seems to stem from Thread integration, which I don't believe is Nanoleaf's sole problem. But my lights would often become unresponsive to commands, either through HomeKit or the Nanoleaf app. I tried everything I could to troubleshoot this, including resetting the Nanoleaf bulbs several times. Nothing worked.
But when they did work, they weren't smooth in turning on/off, or color changes. They were rarely in sync.
I have been using Philips Wiz lights bulbs, and though they don't work with HomeKit without a HomeBridge, they have been much more reliable, and they execute commands smoothly. The Wiz app is just better, and the color programs are more interesting.
So I replaced all the Nanoleaf bulbs with Wiz bulbs, and I am much happier with them. They just work. Having a remote control that works independent of HomeKit is nice too, much more intuitive for my occasional guests who are luddites with smart home technology.

C. Weiser,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2023","I purchased these bulbs because I run HomePods at home and wanted something on the Thread network that would respond quickly and effectively. At first, this setup worked well. I came from a LIFX setup whose bulbs did not directly integrate with HomeKit, but rather relied on Siri Shortcuts. It was nice to be able to control bulbs directly from the HomeKit app and to tell Siri to set the lights to certain colors or brightness!
The last few months, my bulbs have gone from almost immediately responsive to unresponsive at all. Siri works fine for all other tasks, but when trying to talk to the NanoLeaf bulbs, it's always ""one moment…your lights are taking awhile to respond"" and then my request doesn't go through. Occasionally my scene requests will occur after 30 seconds, but that's not guaranteed.

Eric,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2021","I have a fairly well developed smart home with wifi bulbs, these thread enabled bulbs, and a significant number of Zigbee and bluetooth devices. The Nanoleaf Essential bulbs are connected to a HomePod mini using Thread.
These are the slowest devices on my network, usually taking 5-10 seconds to respond when they aren't stuck updating their status in which case they are unresponsive. I have bluetooth servos connected via Home Assistant that can receive a command from the Home app, have it forwarded by Home Assistant and physical move something in less time than the Nanoleafs take to respond. I was excited to finally get Thread devices, but my experience with these bulbs has discouraged me from investing more into devices supporting that protocol at this point in Matter's development.

My solution was to first add them in the Nanoleaf app. After doing so, you can use the Nanoleaf app to easily integrate them into Homekit. Using the app, you can also update to the latest firmware which I highly recommend as it improves the reliability of the bulbs. If you want to successfully pair it to another smart home platform like Home Assistant, I found it works best to remove the bulb entirely from the Nanoleaf app after the firmware update and add it back in.

The price is reasonable $20 verses ($50 freaken dollars + hub for Hue?) never again! Just not worth the price.
They set up fairly quickly and are very bright on the white setting but, like Hue, are a bit dimmer on any color setting. I looked up the list for Siri approved colors on line, and there are a LOT of them!
I agree that their app is a bit clunky, but I was able to do some update with it in about 6 minutes, not too bad. Only other issue is you need to use email if you have questions (the phone number just has an answering machine) but they do respond to emails in a day or too and will follow-up if needed. Overall I'm pretty happy with these bulbs, and I think you will be too. PS, Sorry Amazon, I now use HomeKit exclusively (Alexa has gone to the landfill) and I will never go back.

Charles Francis Xavier,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2022","As a first time HomeKit user, I tried a few different bulb brands with Thread and the Nanoleaf A19 series is so amazing that I replaced all the bulbs in my house with them.
I tried Meross too and Nanoleaf is the *clear winner* - especially when they have a sale.
Fast Thread response, good brightness, great color range, and top value for a HomeKit setup.
I wish they made a floodlight for outdoor use too. I’d buy it instantly.

cons: colors are bit washed out
new review as of 05/22/2024:
About a month before this updated review, Nanoleaf pushed out an update to all bulbs/lightstrips to version 3.6.173 and since then, connectivity and reliability of all bulbs have improved 99%. Since the update, the bulbs have never gone offline and become ""unreachable"" (that I've seen anyways). Since the update, the only time I've seen them as unresponsive (lightstrip was only device offline) is when I review thread network using the Eve Home app, but even then, the downtime was no more than 2 minutes. Looks like the update resolved all the issues I was having and for that, I thank Nanoleaf. It has been a month since update, so i feel confident recommending these bulbs.
old review below:
I cannot recommend these bulbs, especially at the absurd price of $20/bulb (not even Hue bulbs run that much). Until connectivity issues are addressed via future firmware update, this product is barely worth 2 stars (mind you, i never rate anything one star, ever). If you do purchase, your milage will vary. I have 15 nanoleaf bulbs and sometimes, they all go offline for no reason. it's as if any chatter on the network confuses the bulbs. my mesh network is quite robust, there's no reason any of these bulbs should lose connection to their parent router.",5.0 out of 5 stars

AGBAMTEUSA,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2024","I bought these to use with Apple HomeKit and after hours of trying and reading and watching tutorials, I could not get any of them to work. It seems like if you just want to use the Nanoleaf app it should be fine, but that’s not what I wanted and they didn’t do what they were advertised to do. Immediate return.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Warren S,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2024","I won 3 of these at an Apple related hackathon. At first, great! I installed 2 overhead and one 1 lamp. Synced with Apple's Home App. Then, after a couple months, all 3 are unresponsive. Home app reported ""Unavailable."" Re-installed the Nanoleaf app, got on a ladder and re-installed each bulb. Updated to current firmware. Result? Appears in the Nanoleaf app, but not Home. So, I can set the color from the Nanoleaf app. But, no Siri. So, 3 colorful dumb bulbs.
Before Nanoleaf, I installed some cheaper bulbs. Fewer features. Yet, I can reinstalled by turning on-off three times. No ladder needed. Steps with Matter? fetch ladder - unscrew - manually enter code - rescrew - test - ask support - ask support again - give up - write a negative review - sigh.
I really can't fault support for replying with boilerplate. Can you blame them? It's a $15 bulb! Would suggest a design with fewer features. For example, I had re-installed cheaper bulbs in about 10 minutes. Nanoleaf? A couple hours with no luck.",1.0 out of 5 stars
The Parenting Patch,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2024","While the color looks great on these lights, they will NOT stay connected.

Ido Ronen,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2024",There is a reason why it's relatively cheap- it's not working. won't connect to apple home kit or any other Matter device. Don't waste your money on that crap (as expected from Nanoleaf). 0 Stars,1.0 out of 5 stars
Andrew Tinkham,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2024","I ordered a three pack of these bulbs. They joined my HomeKit based network easily and the colors were vivid. I wanted to like these bulbs, but ultimately they let me down.
1. I think the proliferation of trackers on the Internet is a problem, so I run AdGuard Home on my network to block trackers and ads. The Nanoleaf app errored both in account creation and on downloading new scenes to the bulbs until I disabled the protection. I have a lot of what home devices, though, and no other app for those devices has run into this problem.
2. The app itself constantly errored. It would error changing a bulb’s state or even just updating to show the current state. These failures were different from the tracking prevention errors in that either immediately retrying the action (or in some cases, killing the app and relaunching it) resolved the issues.
3. Of my 3 bulbs, 1 has an issue where it won’t completely shut off. It remains with a faint bluish white glow regardless of what color the bulb was when it hit the “off” signal. This glow doesn’t go away until power is fully cut to the bulb. Both the Nanoleaf app and the Apple Home app report the bulb is off but it’s still emitting light.
4. I contacted Nanoleaf support about this issue. After the standard “try a factory reset and re-pair the bulb” answer I expected, the support rep demanded a video proving that I’d actually done the factory reset. The mistrust and hassle combined with the above issues was the final straw and I immediately returned all 3 bulbs.
I’m done with Nanoleaf.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Kelly,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2024","Nanoleaf has updated their app and removed basic settings options and functionality. It broke the thread network for all 6 bulbs and I can’t reset the bulbs in the app, I can’t remove the thread network and I can’t use Nanoleaf without HomeKit anymore so now these bulbs are no better than any cheap LED bulb.

Trash,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2024","DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL. If you are an IOS user Nanoleaf no matter what product you buy will force you to use the “Apple home app.” The connectivity between the two Apple is TRASH. The apps will work together for a few weeks just perfect and then it’s all down hill from there. I highly recommend you stick with the simple cheap stuff like Govee because none of my Govee products have ever had issue with connecting or not connecting. Who ever is running the show here is a clown. These have to be the biggest waste of money on the planet you might as well just go buy regular led bulbs for $5 because this trash will have you using the lights like normal led bulbs.
