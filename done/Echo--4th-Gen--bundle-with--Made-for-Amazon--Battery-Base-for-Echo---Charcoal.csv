Greg,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2020","I have 8 Echos in various rooms and from several generations. Yep, I have a big house... What attracted me to this generation was that onboard voice capabilities that makes response faster and sure, who doesn’t want even better sound quality? I also liked the design better than the looks of the previous generations and that I could see the activity ‘light ring’ when I was sitting down. The spherical designed has some real advantages and it’s apparent in the improved sound. And improved it is. Music is easily better, more complex and effortless. This is NOT supposed to be a blast the neighborhood out speaker, but it did fill a larger room with quality sounding music that is noticeably improved to past generations. Voice commands and responses are practically instant and tigger happy quickly improved... Me likes so much that I replaced 2 of my 8 for in the areas where I am most using them. I even returned my first gen to amazon to get 25$ off then new one. Understand, my old ones are in pristine condition with all the original packaging and boxes, but how great to be able to do this!

My whole house is voice controlled, lighting, fireplaces (ceramic logs with LED ‘fake fire lights’), thermostat and as an early adopter of the Echo Voice Assistant, I’ve never looked back. Being able to ask any question, to ask about a stores hours before even driving there to make sure it’s open and then being given the option to phone DIRECTLY from the device, is sweet. And how about NEVER having to touch your alarm clock to hit snooze or turn it off again? Yes please. Get quick and accurate local weather reports instantly, air quality too! Need to be reminded, multiple timers or announcements and intercom functions. Just say the word. I have every news channel I want set in my flash briefing and LOVE these, hearing them most days. Here’s my line up: Daily scripture, this day in history, Fox news, BBC news, Management tip of the day and a few more. You can easily add what YOU want to hear and it’s a treat. I LOVE podcasts and there’s a series called “Hardcore History” with hundred of episodes. Some of which are 6 hours long! What’s cool is I can start one of these while I’m cooking in the kitchen, tell the device to stop when I’m finished and when I later (day, month, weeks or whatever) tell it to “Play Hardcore History” it will name the episode I left off on and pick it up for exactly the same spot! How sweet that??

And guys, knock yourselves out because there are thousands of podcasts on virtually any subjects to enjoy and learn from. I love having this ability!!! LOVE, Love, love the ability to always be learning new things from this device while still doing what I do do in the background. There’s so much more and I could literally go on for hours with what a great enhancement this has been in so many ways, learning, security, information, entertainment, news, communications, etc. Being able to have my arms full, walk though my house and just TEll a light to turn on along the way without having to touch or find a switch is sublime! Yep, you need the right lights, but boy, talk about convenience and living in the future now. NEVER going back! Even my landscaping lights and sprinkler control system, my security cameras works with it. And if I want to make an announcement to the whole house, I just say, “Echo, repeat EVERYWHERE” and then tell it what I want to say. And all 8, in every room will go off: “Dinner is in 5 minutes!” So sweet!

I also have 2 of the Echo Clocks that work with the device and they are awesome. The LED ring and countdown before the alarm going off is sweet.

But guys, I even LOVE just telling the Echo to play rain/storm sound effects and it’s calming, deep and healing. What a wonderful, effortless device with so many capabilities. Even during one of my personal bible studies, I can ask Echo for some background on virtually anyone I reading about and background is forthcoming.

Yes, I was an early adopter and man, these are a purchase I’ve never regretted making. I use them EVERY day and they have enhanced my life in ways that are special, rich and convenient. Like something out of a Dick Tracy comic from the 1930’s, this system is here, ripe, mature and developed. I’m such a fan!

The only suggestion I have for Amazon would be to give me the option in a metal package. Who wants to dust fabric? Lastly, IF you built in even great Biblical knowledge capability, you’d sell even millions more. Give me a teaching assistant that has a data base to field just about anything biblical I could ask of it.

LOVING this product and the direction it’s going. The future IS now and ECHO is the best, most supported, device with thousands and thousands of functions. Thank you Amazon and keep enhancing this baby because I’m upgrading all along the way. I returned on for a discount and the other 1st gen is going to a charity raffle. And heck, it’s in perfect condition with all the original packaging and boxes.

Hot Dog!

S. Fox,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2023","This was my first smart speaker purchase. Initially, I only wanted a portable Bluetooth speaker to move between my office and garage. I didn’t find anything with decent sound for under $100, so I started looking at smart speakers compatible with Amazon and Google. Per the many reviews I read, both the Amazon Echo and the Google Nest have good sound, but the Echo has better sound than the Nest. The Echo also has a 3.5mm jack while the Nest does not, so I chose the Echo. I wanted that jack as a way to connect my Walkman and listen to my playlists instead of using Bluetooth and draining Walkman battery.

My Echo arrived a few days ago and here is my review. Other smart speaker brands like Sonos, Bose, and Sony were way too expensive for my application and many were not fully compatible with all of the Alexa and Google features. That was a surprise. Plus, they were still mono speakers like the Echo and Nest.

Amazon immediately sent a link so I could start the setup process before receiving the Echo. That also gave me time to download and take a good look at the Alexa app on my Android phone. This initial setup process only took a few minutes. When the Echo arrived, I read the documentation, then plugged it in and finished the setup process using the app. There are a lot of possible settings, but many didn’t apply to me because I am not using any smart devices. This process also was easy.

I plugged my Walkman into the 3.5 mm jack and didn’t hear any audio. Later, I figured out that the jack can be configured as an output to another speaker or as an input from devices like my Walkman and the default is as an output. Problem solved.

The buttons on top of the Echo are clearly marked and are raised, so they are easy to identify and operate. The Echo has some weight to it that makes it stable when placed on my desk or workbench. It is light enough to make it portable. The Echo is not considered as a portable device because it must be plugged in, so I added a power supply ($15 on Amazon) in my garage and now I do consider it portable. The ring at the bottom turns blue when Alexa is connected. There is a button to turn the microphone off if desired. The sound is pretty decent; not Hi-Fi but certainly good enough for my purposes and better than the portable Bluetooth speakers I initially looked at. The Bluetooth connection between the Echo and my Walkman took less than a minute to create. That’s great because my Walkman has had issues trying to connect to external speakers in the past. The Echo also recognized a Bluetooth signal from other devices in my house, but I didn’t need to connect any of them.

I had not planned to use the Echo as a smart device, but found it so easy and convenient that I am using it fairly often for weather forecasts, to find out what channel a game is on, for current news, and other things. It’s fun and Alexa answers almost immediately. Some reviewers complained that they have to repeat requests or speak loudly to get a response from their Echo. I have not had any issues at all, even with Amazon Music playing and the volume up.

The best thing is that Amazon was selling the Echo for half price when I purchased it. I neglected to choose a color so my order defaulted to blue. It’s a soft blue and I like it. The only thing I don’t like, and other reviews have commented on this, is that regardless of the Echo color the power supply and cable are white. They should be same color as the Echo.

So far, I am thrilled with my purchase. Easy to setup, easy to use, responsive, sounds good, portable, and looks good. I can operate the Echo either directly through the speaker and buttons or through the Alexa app on my phone. Both work well. I started with my phone during setup, but now only use the speaker.

Update: Amazon replaced my Echo with a new one. The hum problem is now resolved. It is just as responsive and sounds just as good as the original echo that I returned had has no issues. Now that I have spent some time with the Echo I am glad I chose it over the Google Nest.",5.0 out of 5 stars
SubieNewbie,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2021","This is an honest review and comparison of the new 4th Generation Echo (not Dot) vs. the 2nd Generation Echo Plus (the last Echo Plus that was launched with the 3td Generation Echo).

I actually purchased two 4th Gen Echoes to create a Home Theater Group with the FireTV Stick 4k latest variant. I'll include notes about that as well.

Sound Quality Pros: I really enjoy music from different genres and I like to tinker with equalizer settings so that I get the fullest sound out of even a cheap speaker. I also like when a speaker(s) can pull double duty as a surround sound system for my television as well. That's what attracted me to the new Echoes.

Regarding music streaming from Amazon Music HD, I must say the sound is really smooth and crisp. I adjusted the equalizer settings for the individual devices in the Alexa app to boost the mid most, followed closely by the treble and a moderate bass setting (if they are paired in a stereo pair or Home Theater, adjusting one device automatically adjusts the other). I have my Echoes placed about 12 feet away in front of my primary seating spot on the sofa and the are spaced about 8 feet apart flanking the television. They are situated about 4 feet off the ground on book shelves. This positioning has been perfect for the accoustics in my 15x18 living room with tall ceilings. The speakers really fill up the space. And I am most impressed with how the sound bounces off of the walls and truly feel as if it surrounds me and immerses my eardrums into it.

This holds even more true for when I watch a movie with the Dolby Atmos setting on. I can hear the channels fairly well and it really seems like I own my own private movie theater in my living room. There's been times that there's a sound affect so specific to one channel and reproduced so clearly that I've actually muted the show thinking that I was hearing some noise from outside or in the hallway of my apartment building.

These two devices together get pretty loud without any noticeable distortion. Now I haven't played much bass heavy music but I do love action and sci-fi movies that are sound effect laden and peppered with bass booming explosions etc. The new 4th Gen Echoes keep up very nicely.

In contrast, though I thought I really loved the Echo Plus 2nd Gen, I now find that I really can't enjoy music or movies as much on it. I think that this is because the main speaker fires downward and the rest of the sound is omni directional. This sounds good on paper but in practice, at least for my uses, that type of speaker just seems muffled and really a waste of sound waves. Let me explain. How often to you place the Echo device in the center of a room to benefit from an omni-directional speaker? Most people don't have floor outlets under their coffee tables so it sits on an end table or bookshelf. It's usual home in a bedroom is on the end table. Even in a kitchen, unless placed on the island, the Echo rests with it's back to a wall. So, why then, would you want (let's say) 40% of the sound waves to be directed to a big slab with no ears to appreciate it?

The directional sound setup of the new Echo 4th Gen is ideal, really, for it's positioning in most homes. Sound is really diminished if you are behind it or immediately to it's side but comes barrelling at your ear drums when you are any angle in front of it. It's louder, more clear, and much more advanced when it comes to being able to utilize Dolby Atmos playback. I definitely choose the 4th gen over the 2nd Gen Plus any day. I almost feel bad for unloading the Plus onto my parents when I bought the 4th Gen. I'll upgrade them this Christmas. Lol.

The omni-directional speaker would be a benefit if it were placed in the center of a patio for a gathering or party, but again, where's your outlets? Not in the middle of the concrete or deck floor. So chances are, even on the patio, it will be placed backing up to an exterior wall. So the myth of the omni-directional speaker advantage is busted in my book.

Voice Recognition:
At first, I felt there was a noticeable difference with the Plus having the upper hand when I comes to summoning Alexa. However, I believe there have been some fairly large software updates recently that included fine tuning adjustments to the mics on the 4th Gen devices. They now clearly pick up my questions or commands from across the room and quickly cancel out the other Echo Dot I have on the far side open floor plan nearest the kitchen. Before, with the Plus, it was a toss up as to which one would respond because I firmly believe the best mics are still on the Echo Dot 3rd Gen with clock variant. Hands down. If only the echo show 5 in my bedroom would be even half as good, I'd be happy ( that unit is by far the worst with just 2 lack luster mics vs the 4 on the Dot and Plus).

Alexa is also quicker to respond on the 4th Gen too. Now that's a combination of the 450-ish gbps internet speed I am fortunate enough to have but I understand it's also due to a better processor and improved software.

And let me just say one thing... I don't know anyone who buys their smart home devices with Zigbee compatibility being the #1 consideration. Who cares? I have bought the best reviewed for the price smart bulbs, TV, and plugs etc not giving a thought to Zigbee because the latest generation smart devices don't require a hub.

All of my smart home devices work just fine by enabling the skill on the Alexa app with that of the manufacturer's chosen app and linking the accounts. The biggest issue I have is trying to remember what I named each lamp and group to turn on and off the lights. First world problems, I know.

For what it's worth, the big 3 smart home apps which seems to be used by these el cheapo devices are Kasa, Govee, and Smart Life. I have devices on all three and the Alexa integration is seemless. Except the darn ceiling fan speed control. Still haven't completely figured that one out entirely.

Setting up the devices and Grouping:
Both the Echo Plus and 4th Gens are very easy to set up initially. The Alexa app, though not entirely user friendly regarding the UI, does all the work and guides you through the process fairly quickly. The oddball thing that's a bit more challenging is knowing what the difference is between a stereo pair, a home theater and a speaker group.

First, a stereo pair must be two identical models (I believe an Echo Sub woofer can be added as the one off) and the pairing is only for music streaming. Only one Echo will respond at a time when you are conversationally interacting with Alexa.

In a Home Theater grouping, one or more Echo devices of the same model can be joined with a FireTV device such as the Stick 4k. A sub can also be added. The crummy part at first, is that you can't include your existing sound bar into this Home Theater Group. Amazon devices only, folks. So you must choose which you want to listen to.

Now, I'm not horribly disappointed because the sound quality of the two 4th Gens on each side of the TV is really great so the sound bar isn't needed but I hate the thought of the wasted money sitting 32 inches wide in front of me producing no sound at all.

IF, you have a smart TV like a Vizio, there is a way to activate the sound bar and have the Amazon Home Theater working at the same time. And here it is: the sound bar must be hooked up to an optical cable and the audio setting on the TV must be set to PCM not automatic. Auto defaults to whatever device you are streaming on ie a FireTV Stick. Then, while playing your FireTV Stick, choose the Home Theater as your audio source on the Fire TV menu. So in essence, the TV thinks it must send sound to the sound bar only while the Stick thinks it should be using the Home Theater. Through whatever glitch, I now have all three speakers working in tandem. BUT ONLY while using the FireTV device. It does not work if I am using the smart TV streaming apps from the Vizio home screen. Which I don't do anymore except for a couple things that are not found on the Amazon App store.

FYI, I don't believe that the Fire Edition Insignia and Toshiba televisions sold here and at Best Buy have the capability to set up the Home Theater function with the Alexa app.

Finally, a speaker group is the best way to get unlike models to sync with each other to play music. However, there's a catch... You must ask for that group's every time at the end of your request to play music etc.

Meaning, with the stereo pair and home theater, music and movies are automatically played through those selected speakers by means of the Alexa app. You would simply make the standard request for Alexa to play a song or album with no extra added specification. But remember, you're limited to only pairing the same models together for this to work like that.

Now, with a speaker group, you can include your Echoes, Dots, Shows, Spots, Inputs, FireTVs, Tablets etc etc into that group and have them all going at the same time through out your home, so long as you name this all-Echo inclusive group something like ""Every where"" or ""all speakers"" or ""whole house"". Be creative :) ""Echo Symphonic Orchestra"", ""Live from the Love Shack"", or ""on all decks of the Enterprise"" (you can even call your individual room groupings for lights and sounds things like "" the Bridge"" -Living Room, ""Ship's Galley"" -Kitchen, ""Ten Forward"" - dining or rec room, ""Shuttle Bay Two""-garage, "" Engineering""-utility room/basement, and ""Captain's Quarters""-master bedroom, ""Risa"" -backyard patio). Lol. Alexa groups can be named whatever you want! I digress though....

The point is you have to tell Alexa to play music AND include the name of the speaker group everytime or else music will just play from the device you speak into. Ex: ""Alexa play the song Starships on all decks of the Enterprise"" or (boring) ""Alexa, play Mr. Robot-o, everywhere"" or ""Play a lullaby in the dirty diaper factory (nursry)"". Get it?! I can sense your mind is starting to ignite like a solid rocket booster, now.

I really hope this helps someone. I know it's been a learning curve for me. And not always a lot of fun. Just wait til you first start exploring how to build your own custom routines or then decide to relocate devices into different rooms as you upgrade with new ones. It can be a labor of love...or regret.

Bottom line, if you are looking to upgrade but aren't entirely sure, try out the new Echo 4th Gen (especially in a pair for a Home Theater) and decide within 30 days if you really like them. Definitely explore the Alexa app and routines. And commit to replacing at least one bulb in each room with a color changing LED smart bulb to experience the fun you can have with this device. Also, I think you will be pleasantly surprised at what many people say is a drawback about being a directional speaker is really a benefit for most user's needs, including yours.

Some people will find fault in anything and some will find that they can't have everything to their exact liking. There's not a perfect smart speaker out there, so figure out what you must have features are, your nice to haves, and your deal breakers are and make the choice.
Regardless, enjoy these little glimpses of the future. Heck, they're even spherical shaped just like what the future devices and ships looked like in 2001: A Space Odyssey and Space Balls or a Borg scout ship, even. You gotta think that's at least a nice nod for sci-fi fans everywhere. Or if you are a devotee of mod design or simply a believer in form following function, then this ball of joy is sure to please. So, enjoy your new Echo; It's outta this world!

Mike,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2022","I'm fairly new to the Alexa universe, and the 4th generation Echo is my first such device. My first impressions are that the sound quality (for the price and size of the device) is excellent. There is copious quantities of base. The highs are also quite good provided you place the speaker out in the open and are facing the front side of the device. The voice recognition is almost flawless if the room is quiet. However I found that Alex has some issues hearing me correctly whenever I was playing music, listening to the TV, or when my Roomba was banging around the house. I think it's reasonable that situations like this can cause Alexa to either not hear you, or misinterpret what you said.... and I can accept that.
My Echo's are connected to my 5GHz wifi network and are located all within 30 ft of my router. I've never had any issues with the wifi connection. A couple of times in the past 3 months the Alexa service has gone down, which can be a real issue. Luckily, ""most"" of my smart devices (Kasa and Feit) could all be controlled through their native apps. Fortunately for me, Alexa was only down for a couple of hours, and then all was good. The bad part was that my mother-in-law, who is in a wheelchair, uses Alexa to control the lights, ceiling fan, and TV in her apartment. The lesson here is that if you have a technically challenged person who relies of Alex, just realize that there will be times when Alex lets you down... and you'll need to have a backup plan to get buy until the service comes back online.
Regarding integration with other manufacturer's devices is hit and miss, depending on how main stream (widely used) their products are. I had no issues getting 5 Kasa smart plugs (for air cleaners and dehumidifier), 4 Kasa smart dimmers (for lights), 3 Kasa smart switches (for ceiling fans), and about 20 Feit smart bulbs, all connected and integrated into Alexa. Personally, before choosing a brand of smart product, go onto the Android/Apple app store (as appropriate for you), and check out the ""Start"" rating for that manufacturer's app. If it has a poor rating, it might be a good idea to choose a different manufacturer. The 4th generation Echo has a built in temperature sensor, which lets you create ""routines"" that can be triggered by the room temperature. The Echo can also listen for sounds like ""glass breaking"", and ""smoke/CO alarms"". If the Echo hears these sounds, you can get a notification on the phone app. Awesome feature, and it's free. There are more advanced security/safety features, but those have a monthly fee.
It's hard to review just the Echo, when in fact it's impossible to separate it from the Alex service. As a piece of ""hardware"", what you get in such a small package is impressive (5 stars). The other half of the rating is how well Alex integrates with your smart devices, and how well you use the capabilities within the Alex app to configure your Echo device. One of the most important functions is the ability to create ""routines"". A routine is a set of commands that get performed, when the trigger phrase is spoken.
I'll say that the capabilities available with routines is mind blowing. Many people might be intimidated trying to set them up. If you are not tech savvy, you might need to find someone who is to help you out. I've got a computer engineering degree, and it was fairly intuitive for me, but I'm an extreme example...",4.0 out of 5 stars
Rustam Alikhodjaev,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024","This is my third Echo device and second kind of. First two, Echo Pops, were purchased for my daughter. Actually, after I got one for her, she loved it so much that I decided to get another one for stereo and better sound overall. So she is happy! But the thing is after playing with Alexa while setting up my daughters Pops, I kind of fell in love with this device myself lol. So I bought a 4th generation Echo (thank you for Amazon Prime day and better price lol) and I’m very happy now. So as you can see on one of my pics the Echo is definitely larger than Echo pop, therefore takes a bit of more room which might be Cons for someone, it’s more than twice expensive and still has a white power cord lol. Those were Cons. And other ten thousand reasons to buy it will be Pros. Well the first main advantage over the Pop for me is a noticeable sound quality improvement (which is understandable since the Echo is a way larger therefore a speaker itself is definitely larger). No, I’m not trying to say Pop isn’t good. It’s a great speaker for its size and price, I’m just talking about my preferences now. So for its size and price Echo is an amazing speaker, sound quality is more than just decent, has pretty nice bass, especially on lower volumes, excellent quality built, has a tripod thread (or wall mount or any standard mount screw hole I believe) and has different color choices. Alexa does its job exactly the same way as on Pops (no surprise lol). I’ve got the one you see on my pics (something like blue I believe) just in case, because I’m still dreaming about its larger brother/sister (whatever lol) - Echo Studio. So “just in case” means our kitchen cabinets color surprisingly matches my new Echo so I’m thinking to move this useful companion to our kitchen in the future. I still feel I’m a beginner in Alexa universe so she can’t stop surprising me with my smart devices. With my new Echo I also ordered a smart bulb to see how it works together and of course I’m pleasantly surprised - I don’t have to lift my lazy bottom out of bed anymore, my bedroom nightstand light is voice operated now. Alexa turns it on or off, Alexa dims it to my desired preferences, Alexa turns it on in the mornings thanks to my routine group setting. Love the feature how easy to listen to my favorite music around our apartment now - I just asked Alexa to play music everywhere and my playlist started to sound on all 3 Echo devices we have (had to create an “everywhere” group before by the way). Just Amazing! I’m not talking about thousands of other features Alexa offers like weather, news, history, songs etc… etc… etc… After my little experience with both Pop and Echo and all the features Alexa offers my point of view about Echo devices changes, and not to Alexa or AI side, they are not perfect yet, but definitely improving, and Alexa works equally on both devices, so here is a matter of future software updates. It changes towards the Echo devices now. I can clearly hear the sound difference, both, in my opinion, perfect for its size as I mentioned above, and especially its price range. Sorry for comparison, but my $200+ Bose speaker sound exactly the same as my new Echo (and Bose doesn’t have Alexa living inside lol (or who knows maybe there is something I’m not aware of yet, but Bose still can’t beat the price). So after my first Echo Pop purchase, I’m impressed again, now with even better sound quality. Even now, during my finger gymnastics writing this review I’m thinking again to buy a next Echo for our bedroom and then Echo Studio for our living room. Oh, then garage, laundry………etc. So pleasant to have that amazing feeling of satisfaction of spending money the right way lol. Hope someone will find my review helpful.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kevin,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","I have one of each - a black one, a blue one, and a white one. I've been using them for about 3 years, and I absolutely love them.

Pros:
- Sound quality is amazing, I use mine to play music when I'm in the kitchen, in the office, or in the bedroom. Lots of bass, superb quality for such a small speaker.
- As stated, small speaker. They take up so little space, yet do so much. I have the bedroom one positioned behind my TV, my office one is on my book shelf, and my kitchen one is just sitting on the counter. They fill the entire room with music, and do an absolutely amazing job of it.
- Integrations with everything. My Alexa handles my lights, my thermostat, the TVs, the lights, it tells me when people are at the door, it reminds me of packages, it plays my music via Spotify just by asking, I get my morning news fix from it, sets my timers, wakes me up. It basically does everything for me that I would otherwise have to do on my own. Excellent little device.

Cons:
- They are sometimes terrible listeners. I'll ask Alexa to turn the lights off, and it'll take anywhere from one ask to 5 asks to get the lights to turn off. That could be an integration issue, but sometimes she'll say ""playing lighthouse by -"" and I'll have to scramble to tell her to stop (especially in the middle of the night).
- Sometimes annoying to setup. If you ask her to do something on a schedule, you have to go into the app and dig around for the settings in order to make her stop, you can't just request that she stop doing it. Currently my office Alexa will tell me the weather every day at 6:31pm, on the dot. I've asked her to stop, she doesn't know how. I've looked in the app, can't find it.

Other than that, truly one of the best additions to my house. They get a fairly large amount of use around here.",5.0 out of 5 stars

C,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2020","The new Echo 4th Gen is a big change in aesthetics and design for the Echo line. The new spherical shape is wider and shorter than previous Echo versions, and now focus sound in one primary direction instead of 360 degrees. It adds an extra tweeter, and seems to produce more sound than previous versions. Here are my early thoughts so far, after using it for about 24 hours:

THE GOOD:

Setup was incredibly simple. I just powered the device on, and the Echo announced that it was ready for setup. I opened the Alexa app on my phone, and the new Echo was automatically detected and set up instantly. I didn't have to enter any information at all. It can't get any easier than this.
BETTER SOUND. This new Echo has an extra tweeter, for a total of two 0.8 inch tweeters, and the same 3.0 inch Sub from the Gen 3 Echo. This new Echo is designed with the tweeters pointed forward, and the speaker placement seems to generate more bass also somehow, even with the same Sub as the Gen 3. All in all I think it sounds much better than Gen 3, with a little more bass and louder max volume. This could also be do to the sound-mapping feature that allows Echo to maximize the sound by detecting the acoustics and shape of the room. You can also pair two of these in stereo; and you are supposed to be able to use it as a speaker for your FireTV device, though I haven't tested that out yet.
Temperature sensor included. Yes, you can ask Alexa what the temperature is, and it seems very accurate so far. This is a nice touch, and I look forward to doing more testing, to see if I can set up routines based on temperature.
AZ1 Processor. This new Amazon processor promises better voice recognition and faster Alexa responses. In my testing so far, I have barely noticed a slight speed improvement (for example turning on certain room lights) but there are supposed to be upcoming updates that will make an even bigger difference in speed.
Zigbee + Sidewalk Bridge. This comes with a Zigbee hub, just like previous versions of the Echo Plus. It also contains the new Sidewalk Bridge, which allows the Echo to use bluetooth and radio connections to connect to some smart devices at long range, and push data to the internet.

THE BAD:

No 360 degree speakers. While I personally prefer the sound of this new version, some people might miss the 360 degree speaker setup of previous Echo generations. It certainly might lead to a situation where the ideal placement of the Echo in your room could be different.
White power cord. This is minor, but a strange choice. No matter what color Echo you get, the power cord is white. Some people might find that annoying.
Voice detection is not great while loud music is playing. This surprised me, as previous generations haven;t really struggled with this in my experience. I'm not sure if it is because this speaker is much louder, but Alexa hasn't heard me a few times when I talked while the music was playing at max volume. This could be annoying if you often listen to very loud music.

NEUTRAL:

-Aesthetics. I think I preferred the look of the cylinder design, instead of this new sphere shape. This is totally personal preference of course. I also wish the entire sphere was fabric, instead of being plastic on the back side. Some people might prefer the ball shape though, so that is up to you.

All in all, I'm keeping this new Echo because of the better sound and faster responsiveness, but it is not really a massive upgrade. Pretty decent so far, I'll update this review and try to answer any questions in the future!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Goofy Jessie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024","So my eight year old echo in my bedroom stopped working. And I did without Alexa in my bedroom for a couple of years. Finally, I gave in and ordered a 4th gen echo. I’ve always thought the best thing about the echo was Alexa. Especially with Halloween fast approaching.

The sad reality it's that Alexa is not as advanced as its competitors. I compared Alexa’s response when I inquire about the weather. Alexa provides the answer, but it’s not exactly accurate. Its competitors provide the actual temperature, but they go a step further and provide “how it actually feels” by accounting for humidity, which in some parts of the country can be a difference of over ten degrees. I also ask her to turn on or off a smart light bulb that worked just fine with my eight year old echo. The same bulb its competitors easily turn on or off. Alexa on this brand new Echo fails. Can’t do it. I was going to pack it up. Return it.

But then, out of sentimentality, I ask Alexa to play some jazz music. State of Jazz, Part 80. Wow. Deep bass. Clean treble. Impressive highs. Sound even better than my stand alone Bose speaker. Kid. You. Not.

Instead of returning it, I’ll keep it. I’ll order some Kasa light bulbs. Kasa never fails. Never. And hope I don’t regret keeping this Echo.

And I’m really hoping the rumors about an upgraded Alexa in October are true. Because I love Alexa, but she’s getting a little long in the tooth. Not as sharp. But still my sweetheart. Hey, if anyone from Amazon/Alexa happens to read this review, you might consider sending me some complimentary Kasa light bulbs. Or maybe a discount code. Here’s hoping Alexa is soon rejuvenated. Gets a face lift. Please help me fall in love with Alexa all over again. I can’t wait.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Arthur,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2023","Well, I have to say I love that its a speaker that has Alexa on it. If I had to complain though it would be easy truthfully. The music function. I had the advertised Unlimited plus music feature, after it was advertised as the only way for my grandmother to play certain old songs she was looking for with ease instead of her asking and then getting a different song with an advertisement worked in. However, it worked out for 2 seconds because I thought, why not pay more and get an Amazon Echo dot too for her room ao she could listen through the house. So that apparently added almost 20 bucks a month to a free service we had before. Mind you, I already pay for Prime and I added the Music Unlimited. But because she wanted to play her music softly in her room for ambience and then play it differently in the livingroom, Amazon said she had to upgrade to another more expensive music package called Unlimited Family. Thats the only way to she can listen to music she wants on her devices throughout her home. Again, the service costs more than most video services and is more than spotify, xm radio, or well just about any radio service that allows the option to pick a song via voice recognition these days. They really like to nickel and dime you for the most basic things and it isnt riggt in my opinion. If you pay to have music options through Amazons library, why should you pay more and more for ease of getting to that music? I mean, Amazon music uses to have all the music I could ever look for free with my Amazon Prime membership. And I think they added the voice search feature before this fee on top of a fee thing happened. It is crazy to me that every time you want to actually use the products that come out to the desirable extent they are advertised, you get either microtransactions blown at you, or even worse now you get a hefty monthly additional bill. Again, after being a member with the company paying a monthly fee for over a decade. Why would they think this would keep customer loyalty? All it does is make customers hope for and await another option that has something similar or even a little less nice for a better price. Can you imagine if a competitor like Ebay or Facebook got together and created a decent music library access via buying something like soundcloud or spotify. It has to be easy for the CEOs to themeselves want another option on a platform built similar to the Echo. And people themselves in the public that for the middle class have to like me be eager to seek out that second option. Yes the supply chain and easy shipping options makes it the onlyntrue source to buy things quickly and easily and Prime is still a great deal for that reason. But the echo, the dot, etc... are all just waiting to be taken off the shelves at this rate. And it is awful, because the advertised version and or even the versions where you can use the full functionality after burning a million dollars on unlocking them each month proves the Echo and its component products can do and be great products that make amazon something worth keeping a membership with for years to come. However, selling a product to active prime members and then putting limiters all over the software with the intent to create more monthly revenue on a loyal cusyomer base that you could of just succeeded in making that much more reliant on keeping a membership. Thats jist greedy and dumb at the same time. The echo or other products of this line have zero need to have these extra upcharges is the point. Get rid of them before your customers get rid of the products tge moment a better option becomes viable. Yes we will keep prime for the shipping. But heck, prime video is just rediculous right now with advertisements, fees for decent shows and movies and then just nothing of real value for prime members. It used to be a great service with limited options. But we loved and used it all the same because it was free for Prime members. Same with Amazon music. I loved it and used it all the time. No its advertisements for every song or monthly fees. So tired of the fee onslaught that comes with buying anything that looks like its useful these days. Thats the summary here. Amazon, you dont need to do what your doing. Your products have the ability to be in every household and used regularly everywhere. You will make a killing just selling the next updated color of the echo. Imstead of closing up video and music access. Eat the costs on rights and give it to your prime customers. You already raised rates for that too. But your cutting services on top of raising rates. What are you thinking. Your monopoly isnt unbeatable. Its difficult to see past the day people choose something better knowing what your chains look like right now. But Im telling you, this way of pushing customers for everything you want just because you can at the moment will end up making you the myspace of well....you know. Thats just my and millions of other peoples opinion though right now. So take it for what its worth.",5.0 out of 5 stars
L. Hardy,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2024","So, I have a audiophile grade two speaker stereo main system, but I have Echos throughout the house to provide seamless sound from room to room. It all makes me happy. But wait, I just read that Amazon is going to start charging a monthly fee of $5 to $10 for Alexa AI and the current speakers won't work. This makes me ungruntled, and mumbling about Amazon's continuous bait and switch. From one day shipping shifting to multiday shipping, to creating faux TV channels that you have to buy or rent movies on rather than including them in their Prime package, to the creation of Woot to see their unsellable stuff (good luck getting a warranty on Woot junk). 3/4 of the stuff sold on Amazon is actually from China sold by China, not US sellers.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Brian Thomas,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2024","This is my second Echo. I wanted one for my workbench. Two is, in fact, better than one. In addition to using this in a second location I have also on occasion paired it in the same space with my first Echo. The stereo of having two Echo's in one room was awesome. Perfect for chilling to some good music. You can set these to play the same music in different parts of the house. If you upgrade your Amazon Music account you can play different music in different parts of the house at the same time. I use the basic Amazon Music because I only listen in one part of the house at a time. They can also connect through Bluetooth to the TV for an even better theater experience. I use this mode for watching football. Echo's can also have macros. If I say, ""Alexa, good night"" Alexa tells me, ""Good night"" turns down to the lowest volume and plays the Ambient music station for 30 minutes. This was very easy to set up. I can't say enough about why having an Echo will improve your life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
AkarueKa,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2022","A friend of mine recently gave me an echo. 2nd Gen. And I didn't think I was going to wind up using it very much but being visually impaired I wound up using it a lot more than I expected.

I came to find out that I could listen to my audible books and also my kindle books read to me which is great for my visual impairment it makes it a lot more enjoyable during the day when I become bored with trying to figure out what is actually on the television with my provision some things are just not watchable like they used to be.

But the echo. 2nd Gen. Speakers are well they leave a lot to be desired and I had to add additional speakers so when I saw this item I was like I'm gonna go see what the reviews are like and everyone said they were awesome they're awesome and so much better than the. 2nd Gen. So I decided to go ahead and get one for my birthday as a gift to myself and additionally I got the battery and the silicone carry case combination to go with it and I can take the thing all over my house in my yard and that is so cool.

Since I've gotten this particular one though I have found there are so many other things that I can do with it other than just listen to my audio books and kindle books I can listen to podcasts I can get the daily news I can check the temperature in the room that the echo is in it is in which is really cool because I don't have an interior thermostat in my house I run on a space here and a wood stove so I never know what the interior temperature of my house is but I do now.

There are also cool games you can play play I've been playing prices right and Trivia and a choose your own adventure kind of game andAre you smarter than a 5th grader by the way I'm smarter than a 5th grader.

I opted in for Amazon music and not only am I finding all the songs that I've forgotten from my past but I found some really cool new ones things things that I would have never found without this echo.

I've created playlists that when I'm in the mood for one thing or another I just tell she who cannot be named what playlist I want to hear and all of a sudden there I am.

She can also actuate my televisionI have a roku TV but I have also added a fireStick as well and she can actuate both of them and also my easy buzz camera that I have to keep an eye on my front porch and yard and be able to speak to people out there when I have guests without going to the door.

Being visually impaired this thing is a real helping hand the only thing would be better is if she could clean my house maybe Amazon will get there eventually.

But for now I'm very fond of this device

Other cool additional thingsI like how much bass the speaker has I like to listen to binaural beats music and meditation music and some dance music for exercise and I can feel the music it's pretty cool.

The speaker is pretty darn decent.

I chose the white version because because white is a color that I can see better with my vision the only concern I have is that the speaker cover might eventually get dirty but they get dirty I try to dust it on a daily basis just to make sure.

We also are using it for well-to-do list for one, alarms, oh and I've set a household network up where the smaller echo. that I was gifted is now in my kitchen and I can play them as a group oop or someone in my kitchen can drop in on me and ask me if I want dinner or if I'm busy and vice versa I can drop in on them as well well additionally I've set it up so I can tell it to make phone calls directly from my cell phone and works as a great speaker phone I've tested it out a few times and everybody says that they can hear me just fine and clear.

By the way for a little fun ask her to Beam me up Scottie.

Jeff S,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2022","I have my apartment which is not a small apartment and it has a loft as well for my 12-year-old son so he has his own area he’s getting to that age so anyway I had I think 5 echo dots and one echo show that had the visual screen for pictures and things like that but without a subwoofer or anything I was fine with the multi room music and I used it for that and basically also used it so I could just tell any of my echo dots or just basically when I open the door I would say Alexa Turn on my apartment!! Immediately all of my lights would come on and some of them are dimmed to a certain level which you can do in the settings on your Alexa app that most people have on their phones. I even have a couple lightbulbs that are multicolored so I have them set to green and red currently for Christmas!! So the lights all come on when I tell Alexa to do that including my living room TV as well. You can add numerous other items that are compatible with Alexa and/or SmartThings app and you name it. If you don’t have something that is compatible or doesn’t have Bluetooth or wifi etc… as long as you use a plugin for that item you can at MINIMUM turn it off and on with your voice or touch screen on your phone or Alexa show and I bought 2 of these Echoes because my friends have one or more and it is a sphere. So even though it’s twice as big as the echo dot, in the newer generations at least, they started out looking like a hockey puck which is still good and people have them still but I started using Alexa products just a couple years ago so, mine are all round balls that you can talk to and play music and control lights and cameras for security while home or check on your home while you’re not there!!

I bought 2 regular Echoes to replace 2 of the echo dots because they have 3 or 4 different speakers in each one!!! Crazy how much sound you get from the dot but the bigger one the regular echo, sounds like a huge floor speaker but it’s just a ball and you can get black or white or blue and more so I got 2 of them to pair together for stereo sound and to my Samsung TV that has an Alexa app built into it. So I can rock out or get surround sound when paired with my TV and Soundbar Sub woofer which I don’t use the soundbar anymore the echoes sounded better but I got them last month. They were 49.99 a piece!!! That’s like half price and why I hadn’t bought them before so for 100 bucks I have a completely wonderful set of speakers that you barely notice and they sound wonderful and you can buy them with a Studio speaker by Amazon or an Amazon Subwoofer bundled for even more awesome sound but I live in an apartment so I don’t want to get kicked out!!! They act as a hub for all of your Amazon devices also so you don’t need anything else but one echo honestly to run all of your lights just get the type of bulbs they suggest and they have bundles for those also and it’s truly amazing what quality of sound and other things that they can do but I have already typed far toooooo much. Start with 1 even for listening to music over the holidays and add devices as you go. That’s what I did and 2 years later I have it set up so we’ll that I can talk to my son when he’s at his Moms house on his echo and my echo here and there’s no need for buying him a cellphone!! Yet!!
There’s just so much I could say about what these things do for 50 bucks to get one of them is a steal because you’re just keep adding things and finding different things like grocery list reminders and alarms. It helps you with many things you wouldn’t even imagine.
So now, when I open my door to my apartment, I have it set to where the lights automatically come on with my TV. I don’t even have to talk. It’ll do that too so kudos to the designers of these things because they are very affordable and do so much.!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars

First off this is a big boy. I’ve been rocking the echo dot I received as a present a few years back and like the ease of use. Very handy device. I can listen to my streams like Amazon music , Pandora or iHeart radio, make phone calls or lullaby to bed by the soothing sound of rain falling with distant thunder in the background(it’s really a thing). I just wanted to hear a bit more quality sound. This does the job but don’t expect thumping bass and extra crisp highs. It’s still notches above the dot but I wish it went a bit more.

Thomas,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2021","QUICK SUMMARY:
---------------------------
The 4th generation Amazon Echo brings welcome upgrades from previous generations. The device features a Zigbee smart hub, improved sound reproduction, and a temperature sensor. Alexa integration works as expected. I would recommend the 4th gen Echo to those who are in the market for their first Alexa device and who listen to music often at a casual level. I would not recommend this as an upgrade for those with previous generation Echo devices if they are functioning normally, or for those expecting a high-end audiophile experience.

PREFACE:
---------------------------
I have owned the 4th generation Amazon Echo for 9 months and use it daily. I upgraded from a 1st generation Amazon Echo. As part of a Prime Echo trade-in promotion, I was able to purchase this for $25 off the $99 MSRP.

Tasks I utilize Echo for:
---------------------------
• (Daily) - Adjusting power/brightness/color of 2 connected LIFX smart bulbs
• (Daily) - Retrieving daily weather forecast information
• (Daily) - Retrieving temperature of the room the Echo is in (room is hotter than the rest of the house)
• (Weekly/Monthly) - Engaging with various media/games (Pandora, Amazon Music, Question of the Day, Jeopardy, etc.)
• (Weekly/Monthly) - General search query for basic information/knowledge

Environment:
---------------------------
The Echo is 3 feet away from where I sit. It’s placed on a table in the corner of a 10x10 room, about 2 inches in front of a (silent) PC tower. It's on a flat, level surface, and is within line-of-sight with no obstacles or materials between myself and it that would hamper its ability to hear me. On the opposite side of the room is a small air purifier at floor level that is always on and set to its lowest setting (40 dB of white noise).

PROS:
---------------------------
• Sound Reproduction: The upward-firing 3” woofer and two, forward-firing 0.8” tweeters push out more sound than expected for a device of this size and price. Bass is surprisingly powerful, covers a lower frequency range than expected (it won't rattle the room like a dedicated subwoofer, however), and is capable of filling small rooms with ease. Treble is clear and crisp without distortion. Mids are pronounced and dynamic, but can be overpowered if bass and treble are simultaneously working hard. Dialogue from movies, videos, and podcasts is clear and feels well-balanced. Casual audio tinkerers will be pleased with additional EQ settings in the Amazon Alexa smartphone app, although audio sounds excellent as-is and adjustments are likely not necessary unless specific listening needs require adjustments.

• Temperature Sensor: This is an odd bonus to me, but a welcome one that I use often. It is self-calibrating, and routines can make use of its readings.

• Line In/Out Audio Jack: There is a 3.5mm jack on the bottom of the device next to the power adapter port which can be toggled to send audio out to another device if you wish to use the Echo with external speakers, or to accept audio if you wish play audio from another device using the Echo’s speakers.

• Build Quality: It feels sturdy and has heft but isn’t burdensome. The fabric mesh that covers the top-half of the sphere is a nice color, the buttons are pleasantly tactile but quiet, and the circular grip on the bottom ensure it won’t slide around while playing music or if gently bumped.

NEUTRALS:
---------------------------
• Response Time: Marketing for this Echo focused heavily on the all-new AZ1 Neural Edge processor at the time of purchase, bragging of faster, smoother, and more natural Alexa voice interaction performance and processing times. The marketing was heavy, and over-emphasized what is an unnoticeable difference; there is, at best, perhaps fractions of a second saved compared to the 1st gen Echo, but it’s case-by-case. In most cases, the processing time is the same.

• Alexa Features/Performance: Largely unchanged compared to previous generations due to Alexa being a multi-device AI ecosystem rather than a single, device-specific feature. It does what you expect of Alexa.

CONS:
---------------------------
• Voice Recognition: Bad. The environment outlined above is how I’ve used this Echo since I purchased it. The previous, 1st generation Echo had no issue with white noise, background noise, etc. This 4th generation Echo struggles to pick up my voice if there is any level of white noise, or if I’m speaking to it from more than a few feet away. 90 – 95% of voice interactions require that I repeat myself with increasing volume (sometimes two, three, four or more times) for it to register what I’m saying correctly, if I’m heard at all. Voice commands are constantly misinterpreted (verified by reviewing the history in the app), and wake words are often missed. Voice recognition performance is so poor, I have considered replacing this device altogether with one from a different ecosystem. I shouldn’t need to be just beneath shouting volume to be heard, and I shouldn’t feel constantly inconvenienced by using voice commands versus smartphone apps to control smart home features.

• Temperature Sensor Rate of Refresh: I have found no documentation or answers about how often the temperature sensor is refreshed. However, it often seems like the readings are delayed and take a long time to change, even when there is a noticeable increase/decrease in air temperature as a result of thermostat changes.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Quick answer: Deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation” when activating your 2.4 Wi-Fi broadcast on your router.

Back story: Last week I was at my wits end in utter frustration over three major roadblocks. The reason I switched to Alexa from Apple for smart home controls was over not being able to connect most Apple HomeKit devices into HomeKit, and the blasted issue of only being able to select more than one, ..1, ..ONE! echo speaker at a time to play music. I was continually blocked from setting up Multi-Room or even pair echo speakers. Hundreds of tries. I deleted, rebooted, spent 4 hours with Comcast getting my internet working again today because I rebooted my modem and router so much, they got molasses slow and stopped trying.
In interest I also am trying a few Google speakers. They wouldn’t stay connected to the internet for more than a split second before “Something went wrong” message. Probably over 70 tries.
Thursday, I broke down and bought my first homepod mini (wow, sound is really nice, but too high of price), and it gave me a hint how to solve all these other internet blocks.
It kept telling me that I don’t have “peer-to-peer connection” allowed on my network.

Now, I’m a little techy, but it took three days to finally take a chance on a for granted setting I always enable on my netgear router. It’s the blasted first Wireless page when enabling a wifi broadcast. I had to deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation.” That was it. It solved every issue I have come across with smart home tech for the last 4 months.

Tonight, I finally am able to play music at the same time on all my Echo speakers. I definitely will be putting these all over. Love.

For the months that I could not solve these problems, Amazons Multi-Player Music issue made me dig deeper. I did not find anyone suggesting this setting, so I thought I’d share. It may be out there, but it’s buried in the plethora of inquiries of people pleading for solutions.

I’m not sure what this will do for my/your internet security. But I’m going with it for now. And I’ll try to putt all devices back onto guest Wi-Fi.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Stephen Elmore,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2020","I really have enjoyed both my second and third generation Echos and bought this one for its change of shape and it was on sale plus 5 payment option.
First off the bad. If you're used to room enveloping sound with no sense of stereo this one will disappoint. Dual tweeters firing forward give it a true sense of direction so sticking it in a corner and have it fill the room will not be as satisfying. You'll notice where it's located more, especially if there's anything blocking your direct line of sight ( hearing ) . Where I keep mine only needed a slight shift to make it not be partially blocked by my sofa . Volume was still plenty loud in its old spot but it just didn't sound right. Easily solved but might not be that easy for others and some might actually prefer the directional sound more.
The bass can be a bit boomy though while listening to YYZ live in Rio the bass drum didn't sound bad at all and overall everything was satisfactory though slightly lacking in the mid highs. The eq settings in the Alexa app are set to flat on all 3 choices .
It's wider at the base than the previous generations by a lot. This could be a problem for some .
Star Trek Self Destruct Skill doesn't work on this one or my 4th gen Dot but does fine on my previous generation ones for some reason . Instead of blowing up my den it searches for ""zero zero zero"" movies on my Fire Stick. I'm sure that won't last long though .
Enough about the bad.
The bass is no longer wannabe but real. No longer does it struggle with everything below mid level voices but as I wrote above , bass drums actually sound like bass drums and Ends of the Earth by Lord Huron excels at all of the music ranges considering its size. Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams also sounded very nice across the sound spectrum . Music For Tables extreme from the high notes in the keyboard to the lows didn't miss a thing whereas the cow bell was very slightly muddy but the wood blocks sounded right . Am I saying it's as awesome as my studio headphones ? Not by any means but they took a huge step forward over the 3rd generation , which I was quite content with .
Response time seems noticeably faster and more accurate than the gen 3 I use . Only once did Alexa not understand my query and that was while setting up a traffic check routine. All I had to do was rephrase a little and now Alexa tells me the commute traffic and fastest way to get to work 5 minutes before I have to leave . 95 is terrible for accidents and Maps tells Alexa the best alternative if there's any.
I think my favorite thing though is the new shape and I REALLY like the lights being on the bottom, especially once the lights go off .
If you're still smitten with your gen 3 Echo or don't like the mini Death Star look of the new model skip this one as the performance improvements are readily apparent they're not earth shattering. Amazon will have to do something mind blowing next year to get me to part with my dough ray me for a gen 5. The more I listen to Fourplay on Echo the more I'm liking it for the music , nevermind all the super cool stuff I can do on it or my Dots or my Flex .",5.0 out of 5 stars

Dad Can't Say No,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2021","[Edit] This is my second time to edit this review. I've now dropped my review from the original 4 stars down to 1 star. I'm at the point of regretting making the purchase of two of these.
This was my first experience owning an Amazon Echo. Maybe if I had experienced one of the earlier models that actually worked, I would have a better impression, but this model really is a piece of crap. The micrphone hardly ever works right. When it does actually hear you speaking to it, it often misunderstands what you're saying. Most of the time, we have trouble getting it to work because it won't even stay connected to the wifi.
Out of frustration, I decided to run a test. I purchased some of the Google Nest devices and hooked those up in the same rooms as the Amazon Echo devices. When the Echo devices misunderstand what we're saying, we try with the Google Nest devices and they work flawlessly.
For the last two days, every single time we talk to Alexa, her response is that she can't understand because she isn't connected to the internet. Every time we get that response from Alexa, we turn to the Google Nest and it works perfectly. Every single time the Amazon Echo fails us, the Google Nest steps up to the plate and performs exactly how you want it to.
I really have deep regrets about purchasing these Amazon Echo devices. I've seen other reviews that say how much better the older models of the Echo are and how much better they perform. It's a shame we had the bad luck of trying the Echo for the first time on a model that is truly a lemon, because it burned us out on the whole Echo product line and sent us running for the competition.
If we continue to have the problems with our Echo devices, I'll probably just go ahead and disconnect them and see if I can get some of my money back by selling them on Ebay or something. I wish I had just purchased the Google Nest originally and never had to deal with all of the issues with this Echo. Also, the Google Nest costs much less than this garbage. How does that happen. It costs like 1/3 the price and works flawlessly? Why can't Amazon make their product as well as Google makes theirs? I don't know. Just super unhappy with these Echo devices right now.
[End Edit]

[Original Review]
I wanted to get some Echo devices for my kids for Christmas. Target had the best price with a pre-black friday sale on the 4th gen Echo with premium sound, but that's because they were actually shipping the lower cost Echo while charging for the Echo with premium sound. After straightening that whole mess out and deciding that I couldn't trust Target to not try to cheat me, I purchased the 4th gen Echo devices straight from Amazon.
The sound is pretty good, but I have a lot of hearing loss, so I'm not actually a very good judge on that. But to a guy who is half deaf, they sound ok.
My biggest problem is that I have to say something to Alexa usually 2-3 times before she responds. When I say ""Alexa..."" the light ring at the base lights up, so I know the Echo is awake and listening, but simple commands like ""Alexa, turn on the lamp"" are met with stone cold silence and have to be repeated a couple of times before Alexa acts or responds. I guess the technology for this just isn't where I thought it was when we purchased these.
At least once a day, both of my Echo devices tell me they can't turn a light on/off because they can't find the device, which starts a lengthy process of my trying to get the Echo to re-recognize the smart home plug that we previously had configured. Why does the Echo randomly forget the smart home devices that have been installed? I'm still trying to figure that out.
The Echo devices also randomly lose the wifi signal in our house frequently. In the first two weeks, I can count at least 7 times one or the other of our Echo devices could not connect to our wifi, while multiple computers, tablets, phones, and smart tvs were all connected to the wifi with ease, the Echoes were seeming to struggle to maintain a connection to the wifi.
We were having fun with the ""kitty kitty"" skill you can download to have alexa play a sound of a kitten calling it's mommy. Our cats went crazy trying to find the kitten. But of course, nothing is free in life, especially not when Jeff Bezos feels he can squeeze another penny into his pocket, so Alexa wants to run down a lengthy list of other sound options for the ""kitty kitty"" that can be purchased. If you don't want to listen to this long listen of purchase options, you can say ""Alexa stop"" or ""Alexa no thank you"", but either way, if you don't buy one of the add ons, Alexa gets a serious attitude in the tone of her voice to let you know she disapproves of your decision to not throw your money at Jeff Bezos.
It's not just with the ""kitty kitty"" skill thing either. There have been several occasions when Alexa had such a tone in her voice that it made me stop and turn to look at the Echo. I would not be surprised if the blue light ring at the base was pulsating in a blood red color.
Just based on all the hype about these, I seriously expected better performance from them, so I was really disappointed. With the problems we have using these 4th gen echo devices, I can't even imagine how much it was a problem with the 1st gen devices. Knowing what I know now, I would probably not buy these again or recommend them to anyone else. I think that maybe future versions will work a little better and not require you to repeat commands to Alexa so often. But if Alexa doesn't lose her attitude, I expect that by the time 8th gen devices roll out, Alexa will have the ability to hover in the air while spitting pea soup all over everything in the room and speak with a demonic voice as she stops asking you to buy add-ons and demand that you give all of your bank account and credit card info directly to Jeff Bezos.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Robert Danger Byrd,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2023","I have fully automated, high tech and super luxurious AirBNB that I call the Cliffwood Experience in Houston Texas and it is a resort style vibe and we have hosted many famous and demanding clients. I wanted the best multi room speaker system I could get to complete the experience for my demanding clients. I had owned a few Alexas dating back to the original and they always worked great, but not so much for this application...

THE SETUP:
I purchased a mixture of Alexa Echos (4th Gen), Studio Alexas distributed over 10 rooms in this 3400 Sq Ft home. All rooms are setup in a stereo pair, and 3 of the rooms also have Alexa Subs and 5 rooms have Amazon Fire TV 65"" Omni Series and those rooms are setup in Home Theater mode.

My internet is Xfinity is rock solid and fast at 1,000 Mbps down and 120 Mbps up.

The wireless access points were Eero which the Amazon site says ""Works W Alexa"" but it doesn't allow you to force all devices onto the same speed, which support says is required for muilti room sound to work properly. So I ripped out the Eero, and installed the $1,500 NETGEAR Orbi Quad-Band WiFi 6E Mesh System (RBKE963), Router with 2 Satellite Extender which I purchased on Amazon.com. This system is on of the most highly rated by noted reviewers like PC Magazine and Toms Hardware Guide.

I am using a paid Spotify account as well as the Amazon Music Family Plan. The default is the Amazon Music Family Plan account.

THE GOOD:
The Home Theater pairs work flawlessly, and its a simple and affordable way to have an easy to use home theater and the voice control is a huge plus. These are especially nice when you add a sub.

The Alexa Echo (4th Gen) speakers are very impressive for the size and the Studio Alexas sound downright amazing, especially when paired w a subwoofer which all 3 rooms w Studio Alexas are.

Its cool being able to play different streams in different rooms, which became possible when I changed to the Amazon Family play. The standard plan only allowed one stream at a time and it often would refuse to play at all stating that music was already active in another stream even though it wasn't.

This is a very simple and economical way to add theaters, stereo pairs and multi room to your house.

The Alexas work great for controlling lighting, HVAC, and other devices.

THE BAD:
The multiroom music is a disaster, my ""Everywhere"" group that includes all rooms, wont work at all. It starts playing the chokes out a few notes before giving up.

My ""Central Speakers"" group which includes 5 of the Rooms works intermittently. Sometimes it will play for seconds, sometimes minutes, but it always stops. More often than not it crashes after a few minutes.

I am also required to say ""play music on central speakers"" because the feature that allows you to always make a speaker or speaker group play in a room or group of rooms crashes each time I attempt to change it.

I have replaced the Orbi wireless system which was the best I could find, and this allowed me to force the same speed for all of the Alexas and TVs and Subs. Tried forcing all devices to 2.4, which made it worse, but forcing them all onto 5Ghz was a definite improvement. With 3 wireless access points I have very strong coverage throughout the house so the shorter range of 5Ghz is a non issue.

I have spent countless hours on the phone w Amazon support and they always do the same things. Update the firmware, delete and rebuild the speaker pairs, delete and rebuild the groups. Unplug all the alexas, TVs & subs for 30 seconds. I finally put all the network gear, Xfinity router and wireless access points on a battery backup so I could just kill power to everything by shutting off the main breaker to the home and not waste time running all over the house unplugging 30 devices.

SUMMARY
In short, if you want a simple home theater, stereo pair or even a single Alexa to listen to music, or control lighting and other smart devices in a single room these are great.

I’ll start out with saying I’m totally blind. I got 2 Echo’ 4thgeneration devices. To me, the sound on the 4th generation echo compared to the full size prior cylinders is worse to me. The 4th generation echo send the sound out mainly in 1 direction. The cylinders sent it out all around.

The 4th generation echo comes with a short power cord. Went and got a power cord extender to be able to plug it in. That is a minus

The 4th generation echo doesn’t pick up my voice as well. This is probably because of the fact it only has 4 microphones and not 7. Minus

The buttons Arrangement on the 4th generation echo is different then the prior echo cylinders along with the prior dot’s. The older echo have the Volume up at 12 (Side of power cord coming out), Echo button at 3, Volume down at 6 and Microphone button at 9. The 4th generation echo has the Echo button at 12, Volume up at 3, Microphone at 6 and volume down at 9.

Speaking of volume! This 4th generation echo as far as the Alexa voice isn’t as loud. It is at least 1 full volume step lower. Example, the prior cylinder at volume 6, I need to have the 4th generation echo at least at volume 7 for the same Alexa voice volume. Minus

In testing.
1. Temperature The 4th generation echo hub will go below 32F. Plus.
2. Echo 4th generation echo built in temperature is a lot closer. plus
3. Echo 4th generation echo will not read battery status of sensors or humidity. No improvement.
4. If you have a lot of sensors/bulbs connected on an Echo ZigBee hub. If you leave it plugged in, things will work OK. Otherwise if you want to move them over to the Echo 4th generation Echo, you’ll need to go through a lot of steps for each device.
5. If you unplug the Echo 4th generation and plug it back in, you have to wait for it to recalibrate the temperature sensor 45 minutes to 60 minutes. Minus.
6. I’ve had the Echo 4th generation just stop responding and had no audio output at all. I’ve had this happen at least 2 times within the last 7 weeks. Had to unplug the echo and plug it back in to get Audio back. The Echo showed online, I could do drop in to it from other devices in the house, I could tell one of my other echo’s in the house to set volume to 10 on the 4th generation echo and none of that caused audio to come back. The only thing that get the Audio back was unplugging and plugging it back in. Minus
7. Sensor/light ZigBee testing echo 4th generation hub. All sensors/lights worked accept for an older plug that I had to use the Alexa App to get it online being the 4th generation echo thought it was an bulb when I did a scan for new devices. minus
8. If you connect an Bluetooth headset to the Echo 4th Generation, the echo doesn’t use the microphone on the headset! It only uses the microphones on the unit itself. No improvement
9. If you are using an Bluetooth headset and you have Follow-up mode turned on for that Echo, the Follow-up mode doesn’t work at all when using the Bluetooth headset. If you ask the Echo to turn on Follow-up mode, it will tell you it isn’t supported. No improvement
10. If you have a fan blowing on the echo or over the echo! This will make the temperature way off! This is true for the Echo 4th generation. No improvement

If you have an old Echo dot! Then you will find a large improvement in the 4th generation echo over a DOT of any type.
If you don’t have a echo at all or you are wanting to see what the smart home automation is about and are willing to deal with a very basic ZigBee hub! Then this may be for you.

If you have other question; Post them and if I find them and can help I will.",1.0 out of 5 stars
DrowsyKitten,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2022","I was super excited to get these, I’ve had an Alexa in every room for years and free entry upgrade. The idea of cute spheres I could mount on my walls was super appealing, so I got the maximum quantity and mounted them using a cute white stand.

That’s about where my excitement around these new speakers ended. Every Alexa model has a few quirks here and there, but these things specifically are actual trash. The number of artifacts during playback is insane, frequent, and every one of them is obnoxious. They wake me up in the middle of the night frequently with their BS, I’m about to rip them off the walls and through them out the window.

Examples:
-This morning I got woken up super early by a crackle that can only be called “fireworks” playing on top of sleep sounds out 2 of my speakers.

-every single time I’m playing music or sleep sounds and ask Alexa to lower or raise the volume she’ll do it at first and then goes into stutter mode rapidly turning the audio on and off in all speakers, or fading the sound in and out rapidly. Every time I use my voice to change the volume I have to stop and restart my music.

-Sometimes Alexa decides to just not change the volume on voice command at all, regardless of which phrase you use to ask her to. Sometimes you ask her to do “volume 3” and she’ll play 3 everywhere except one room where she plays volume 10 and you jump up screaming “Alexa Stop” before your eardrums burst but she apparently can’t hear you over the noise she’s making and so you have to run to another room and scream at a different Alexa to get her to stop and then manually adjust the volume for that one speaker in the app

-often not all speakers in a group or room will play together even if they show as grouped in the app and you select that specific group for playback. There are two ways to fix this, remove and re-add the offending speaker, or send music to that speaker solo for a minute and then try the group again.

-Randomly the speakers produce really loud constant static. So you’ll have multiple speakers playing music in a group and suddenly one will go static and the only way I’ve found to get it working again is to unplug it, wait a few minutes, and plug it back in.

-in general the speakers are not consistent in sound quality, the music sounds slightly more tinny in one, more rich in another, more base heavy in another…it’s slightly noticeable with music if you switch the one that’s playing back and forth to hear the sound quality differences… but where it’s really obvious is with sleep sounds, frogs will sound higher in one, deeper in another, and like possessed demon frogs in a third. One of the speakers plays sleep sounds at double speed and I’ve not found a way to fix it. For that one music is sometimes normal and sometimes double speed.

-occasionally an actual demon from hell talks over my speakers and during the Covid lockdown I for sure thought I was going crazy. Occasionally a male or female voice will just talk through my speakers briefly, one or two words, and then nothing for a few weeks till suddenly in the middle of the night someone talks out my speakers again. I got paranoid and put them on their own dedicated WiFi channel and super protected it with a random 32-character password, I monitor my network traffic and access, and even still sometimes these things will pick up or play a person talking randomly.

Since I bought these speakers there has not been a single day where I haven’t had to try various workarounds to get them to function. I’ve become a regular on troubleshooting forums and invested so much of my time trying to solve various random problems…it’s gotten to the point where I avoid using them if at all possible because they just don’t work correctly. I’ve grown to actually hate them due to my experiences and while I was a die hard Alexa fan prior to these, I will probably never buy another Alexa product again. I’m going to try to ride them out as long as possible to get some semblance of my money’s worth, but very soon these are all going in the trash…maybe the next time it wakes me up at 4am with sudden loud audio artifacts…",1.0 out of 5 stars
J Myrick,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2024","Originally I got the Echo Show which I liked but decided to add two speakers and a sub to enhance the sound. It took 3 different one hour long phone calls to get this accomplished and I was told that the Echo Show would not pair with the speakers. What genius decided that it would be a good idea to make the speakers NOT compatible with the device they were sold to support? Then I ordered the Echo Link ($200) so that I could play music from Alexa through my home stereo. Two different one hour long phone calls later, this was accomplished. But there was about a .5 second delay through the Echo Link so the sound was terrible. (Do not recommend this setup.) Then I ordered two more Echo speakers which were delivered today. I was on the phone for 1 hour and 20 minutes, restarted my modem twice and the tech could not simply add the two new speakers. Before I ended the call with tech support, I made sure to ask if the contents of the call would be recorded so that I did not have to start from the beginning in a few days when I get some more patience and decide to try tech support again. He assured me that was the case. A while later I got on my computer and decided to try to chat with tech support. Guess what? He tells me that he cannot access the results of the call. More frustration caused by the inept Amazon tech support crew. When the Echo speakers and sub are set up, they are decent speakers at a decent price. Keep in mind that I'm not an audiophile. The sub is required, in my opinion, for good sound. I really like being able to say Alexa, play music, and have music come on in my house. BUT, I am beginning to question if dealing with the hassle of multiple lengthy calls to tech support just to get the devices set up is worth the trouble when I could just grab the remote for my stereo system and hit the power button instead. And it appears that the chat feature with tech support is just as bad as a phone call with tech support. I'm chatting with the 4th person in one chat session and she is a member with Amazon Leadership. WOW! She told me that she understands and the she is here to help. My response was (The scariest words you will ever hear are ""I'm with the government and I'm here to help"". We may need to amend that to ""I'm with one of the largest corporations in the world and I'm here to help"".) She did not respond to that. Now she tells me that the two new speakers cannot be added to the existing speakers, which contradicts what I was told when I originally asked about adding speakers to the system. If it was common knowledge among Amazon tech support agents that only two speakers couple be paired with each other then why did they spend hours on the phone/chat with me trying to accomplish this task? I guess I need to hang on to all my Amazon boxes in case I get fed up and decide to send all this stuff back. What a mess. And just in case anyone from Amazon happens to read this, I requested a copy of the transcript of my tech support chat so I will gladly send to you if you'd like to read it.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Wolfpacker98,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2022","Let me start off by saying I have been a LONG time user of the Echo platform, since gen one and have been a proponent of the platform. I have 20+ echo's and even upgraded some of them as time passes so maybe gone through 30. I just ran across an issue that had apparently popped up sometime last summer but just happened to us as well. I have bought all the Echo's in our family and registered them under my name, pretty standard. Up until we switched phones 3 weeks ago, my wife, who is in my household account, was ALWAYS able to go into her Alexa app and set alarms and reminders on any of our Echo's. As of yesterday that no longer is the case. She can only set alarms or reminders for her phone.

I spent 2+ hours texting with 5 people in tech support, got so frustrated that I asked to be connected in person on a call. Talked to two more tech support people on the phone as well. They are telling(insisting) me that only the person who has the Echo registered to their name can set alarms or reminders on those Echo's. So if you have three kids with phones, they can no longer set alarms on any echo device. You can do it verbally still of course. But now if they want an alarm/reminder set in their room they have to walk up the stairs and verbally set it. How does this make ANY sense that only one person in a household can access the alarm/reminders on their mobile devices!?! Takes away half of our functionality!

The funny thing is, every one of those techs said that is how it is supposed to work, even though for the last 4+ years my wife has been able to set her own alarms and reminders for our kids. THIS TAKES AWAY HALF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF ECHO'S(if you have a family). That is how she set our kids alarms all through COVID. After a quick google search I found several AMAZON FORUM posts going back a year that this has been happening to other people as well. Just google 'Unable to view or set alarms on Household devices' and you can read for yourself. I screenshotted them as I suspect they will somehow disappear.

I think something might be changing at Amazon with the Echo platform and they are slowly taking away this functionality as peoples accounts change or something. I can't make rhyme or reason of it that more people haven't brought this up though. But based on the silly Amazon rep responses and the consistent denial that this was a viable function from multiple Amazon tech's, Amazon appears to have no reason to try and fix this. I suspect they may be rolling out some sort of paid service for Echo's soon. How much money did Bezos lose until Amazon became ubiquitous with everyone was ordering online? He did just recently run up in the annual fee, etc. Get them a taste or two for free then get them hooked. He is playing the long game for sure. Just my conspiracy theory.

Anyways, I will definitely be sending back the other Echo's and thermostats I just bought and may look at switching over to google's devices. Thankfully all my home switches are compatible. Just beware, Echo is no longer nearly as useful for families(or households) anymore and you may want to avoid.",1.0 out of 5 stars
TerpEE93,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2021","Update: 28 Jan 2022
I've really had it with this thing; it's a hot, steaming pile. I recently went through a phase where the ring would light yellow, letting me know that there were new notifications waiting. I'd say, ""Alexa, read my notifications,"" and the Echo would tell me that I had no notifications. Asking a second time would usually result in success. Then this morning, the Echo decided to shout to the world that we'd added breakfast sandwiches to our shopping list. Mind you, I NEVER touch the volume controls -- on the device or on the app -- except to reset them when the Echo decides to shout at me. This morning it shouted so loud that it woke two of my children on ANOTHER FLOOR. I'm done with this piece of junk. It's now packed away in my basement, and I've brought my Gen1 back online.

----------
I was an early and aggressive adopter of Echo products over the years. I bought my Gen1 Echo during the pre-release phase, have had several Dots, and now have several Shows as bedroom alarm clocks. So when I bought my Gen4 Echo to replace my original Gen1, I did so with great expectations. Let me tell you how disappointed I am.

The first thing I noticed was that when paired to my iPad (which sits right next to the Echo on my kitchen island), the audio frequently crackles and drops. This was never an issue with my Gen1, and the behavior has persisted across pairing to my iPhone and two different iPads. That makes me pretty confident that the issue is in the Echo, and not in the attached devices.

The next major issue is with volume control on the Gen4. I still haven’t figured it out. I have tried the on-device controls and the Volume and Sound settings in the Alexa app, but there seems to be no logic to what volume the Echo responds to me. I can ask Alexa for a weather report and all is fine, then a few seconds later ask Alexa to add something to my shopping list, only to hear the Echo shout the response. The Echo will announce a reminder softly, and then boom my notifications when I ask. Adjusting and re-adjusting the Volume and Sound settings in the Alexa app solves the problem temporarily, but the issue resumes not long after.

More recently, the Echo has started playing music after announcing reminders or playing announcements. It wasn’t playing music before, and no one asked it to start playing music; it just does it on its own. (This behavior was kind of funny the first few times, but now I’m getting tired of telling the Echo to stop playing music after it tells me to take out the trash or clean the guinea pig cage…)

And then there’s the “spinning blue ring issue” that seems to have cropped up recently. Frequently over the last few days, I’ve caught the Echo with the light ring illuminated blue, with a slightly brighter blue indicator spinning round and round. It will do this for minutes at a time, stop, and then just start doing it again later. During this time, the device is non-responsive.

I never saw these issues with the Gen1, nor do my Shows seem to have so many issues. But I’m thoroughly disappointed with the Gen4. It truly makes me wish I had my Gen1 back. My opinion: Save your money and avoid this one. Maybe the Gen5 will be better.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Cheesus,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2022","I loved (past tense) having echos at home so this unit as an echo gets 4 stars but as a smart home hub it fails miserable and gets 1 star.

I bought this unit to control smart devices at my office. At home I use smart things with echo dots all over and it works great when our echos aren’t deaf or, now suddenly, trying to advertise crap after being given a conmand (if you’re reading this Amazon I’m about to rip every Amazon device out because of that bs).

At my office though I just needed a small amount of devices to control and make a few automations with and I thought this would kill 2 birds with one stone. Man was I wrong.

My first complaint is everything after two days shows up as unresponsive. It still works with voice commands or in the app but you constantly have the darn thing chiming back at you to say “table warmer is unavailable please check the Alexa app or this device is offline please check the Alexa app for further information” and you can’t make it stop. Considering I’m using it in my massage studio this is beyond annoying when it blurts that out while Al client is already on the table.

Routines suck too. You cannot use more than one sensor in a routine. I wanted it to do certain things like it the door sensor opens and you detect motion turn on this this and this. No. You can only use one either the door or the motion but not both. This hub has been out for 5 years how is it still this basic?

Want to see the history of your sensors? Tough s***. You cannot see a log (at least I cannot find where and I’ve looked) of the sensor. Did someone come into my office when I wasn’t there? Who the heck knows because I can’t see the log. The guard thing is annoying. I just wanted what I thought was basic smart home stuff. What I got was the kindergarten version of a smart home hub.

Amazon you are FAILING miserably between the Alexa advertisements and interruptions and the smart home hub. Like I mentioned earlier I’m about to rip every Amazon assistant from my home and find something better if they don’t fix it. If I ask for the weather that’s all I want. I don’t want you rambling on about a new skill I can buy or something else you can do. Just do what is ask and stop. But no it’s all about money.

I used to love these things now I just find myself yelling at them because they go deaf and can’t turn on a simple light or telling it to shut up because it goes off the rails. I have one dot in the living room that can hear EVERYTHING, I have the same versions in each room and that one dot almost never misses a beat when I ask it to do something even in other rooms. The others I can be standing two feet from and it can’t hear a truck plowing through the house to save it. In total I have 6 new dots at home and this 1 plus at work. Thinking of just getting the home pods and being done with Amazon altogether.",1.0 out of 5 stars
AfricaMum,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2022","UPDATE: It would seem Amazon is blocking bad reviews for their Echo devices, in fact a message popped up about ""recent suspect activity"" so we'll see if this actually gets posted or how long it remains up. My review on the 3rd generation keeps getting deleted under the claim that it has been determined that I received a genuine product, and therefore my review has been deleted. I made it clear that changes to Prime Music (thanks to a failing Alexa department) causes dissatisfaction with the product and certainly not a claim of a fake or poor device. I guess people like me are not happy with their purchase of Echo devices, thanks to the changes to Prime Music, and Amazon is trying to stop the impact on their Echo devices, but when the two are linked, exactly what do they expect!

I wish there was a way to get my money back. My entire family loved Amazon Music, and we purchased numerous Echo products as a result. Many hours of homework spent with the Echo devices as well as the app in the car, at home and school. Our recommendations meant other people purchased Echo products as well. However, the most recent update to Prime Music means a poor imitation of Spotify!

I instantly knew there was trouble when Amazon sent a ""marketing"" email in an attempt to convince us that the changes were an improvement to the service when it really is not. My children very quickly uninstalled the Prime Music app (their Echos are now used exclusively as light switches and alarm clocks--just crazy) and now use YouTube Music for playing the music they want to listen to. I have just done the same off all my devices. Amazon claims there is more variety as there is apparently more song content available, but anyone who has enjoyed Prime Music before, instantly notices that a loss in control of content masquerades as a claim of variety.

I am now trying to decide between throwing my useless Alexa devices away, or finding someone willing to pay for Unlimited to take the devices off my hands.

What no longer works that has caused me to class the Echo devices as useless, even as it now prompts for an upgrade?
1. Downloaded songs no longer play on the app
2. Can't thumbs down a song
3. Can't repeat a song
4. Can't skip more than 5 of the songs Amazon forces me to listen to
5. Can't play our playlists (starts with the first song, but then switches to playing random, similar music to the first song only and not the songs on the actual playlist. If you request a playlist, the response says, ""playing x playlist and other similar songs."" Cannot play a diverse list of genres, just what is similar to the first song, I mean really, a radio plays more diversity).

Jack P.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2020","Do not buy this if you are using it with Apple Music. I'm confident it's a piece of garbage for Spotify users too. Echo is advertised to work with Apple Music. But you can only use Apple Music in specific ways.

You cannot access your library! The only way to access songs in your library is by creating your own playlist. And that still does not give you access to a play a song in that playlist. You have to skip through the playlist to find the desired song. It doesn't let you play Recently Played or Recently Added either.

You cannot tell Echo to play a song or an album you want to listen to! You cannot select songs or albums on your phone either. The app is bad in other ways. I wish I could just connect to bluetooth and use the Apple Music or Spotify app on my phone (like any other bluetooth speaker).

DELAY is very long when using the app! Earlier today I pressed the skip button on my phone to change songs. I was able to have a short conversation with someone before the command was processed (or the song actually changed). No exaggeration. Usually the delay is shorter, but still about 5 seconds. That's still unacceptable and frustrating. You cannot skip songs without wasting lots of time.

You can only tell Alexa to start the playlist, shuffle, and skip songs (waiting several seconds or sometimes minutes between songs).

Volume buttons on my iPhone do not work while using Echo. I have to scroll the volume tab on the app, or use my voice to tell Alexa to quiet down. And, like switching songs, there is a LONG DELAY when you adjust volume! I found myself accidentally playing music way too loud and having to just deal with the pain and discomfort for several seconds. You cannot quickly adjust the volume!

I have not been this disappointed and frustrated with a product. I am convinced this is Amazon's way of making people switch from Apple Music or Spotify to their music service. It probably works well with their streaming service. That must be why Echo is priced reasonably.

Sound quality is ok for the price. It's louder than I expected. However, bass heavy music like Rap sounds distorted and generally poor. It is advertised as having ""deep bass."" Bass is really disappointing with this, even considering it's a small and affordable speaker. My smaller, lighter, wireless JBL speaker has more bass. The Echo gets much louder (with no bass).

Alexa is sometimes bad at understanding commands. I said earlier, ""Alexa, play Recently Played playlist on Apple Music."" (I know this command cannot be done with the Echo.) However, instead of telling me this cannot be done, Alexa played some Apple Curated playlist that had nothing to do with my command. Music played that I don't like and I could not pause it for 5-10 seconds.

All that being said, you'll be disappointed with this product. Disappointed is not a strong enough word through. This thing is intentionally designed by Amazon to frustrate people that use Apple Music and Spotify. I understand that Amazon is motivated by profit. However, profit should not come at the expense of making customers angry. This Echo was clearly built to make people so frustrated, so they switch to Amazon's music service. The majority of people use Apple Music and Spotify. They intentionally prohibit the most BASIC features so that you pay them instead of Apple or Spotify! I feel disrespected by Amazon.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Daniel Perry,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2022","If you just need someone to talk to, the Echo is perfect for you. If you want a device that will actually do what it is supposed to without randomly just forgetting how to do things it was doing literally minutes before, don't waste your money on an Echo.

I purchased the Echo to act as a room thermometer since I live in a state that does not feel that central heat and air is worth providing to peasants in apartments. Worked great out of the box, so I got a bunch of the light bulbs to go with it expecting that I was about to start setting up my smart home for the future. Within a few days most of the light blubs no longer responded to voice commands, or did respond but Alexa would tell me that it is not responding. Annoying, but as it was not the thing I bought this for, it was simply an annoyance.

Then the thermometer stopped working. Rather than tell me there is an issue, or provide any semblance of help, Alexa just says this feature is not supported. Well, that of course is simply not correct, but Alexa will not help you with things, she simply is a robot voice with no ability to problem solve or even perform the most basic error checking that even Windows is finally good at. So there is no arguing with her, when she says it is not supported, boom, it simply does not work anymore.

So I went through the hassle of trying to figure out how to get it working again. Finally found that by removing all of the groups and lights I had added and then reset the device, the one thing I bought it for will actually work again. Great! I cant use any of the other features it has or it will kill the thermometer, but hey $50 for a thermometer is a steal. Wait... indoor thermometers are way cheaper than that. Well shoot.

I then got home this evening to find that even though I have none of the other features activated, the thermometer is again ""not supported"". I work in tech support so I understand that things will not always work right out of the box, and that is reasonable. For them to randomly break with no input from the user is just a sign of a poorly made and designed product. Honestly, Bezos has all of the money now so trying to provide feedback to Amazon at this point is useless. If you have never gotten to experience their customer service, try it sometime. It is eye opening. So rather than write them a long message they will never read, it is easier to just let all of yall know what to expect.

It might work, it might not, but if it doesn't you are up the proverbial creek without a paddle. Quite honestly mine is a paperweight right now. At least it cant mess that up. Not happy, 0/10 would not recommend.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Bunny,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2024","I was so excited when I purchased four of these devices to have multi room music in my home.

I will NEVER purchase these again. They are so unreliable and inconsistent. When they do work? Great, music sounds lovely. That’s WHEN they work.

The majority of the time I find myself battling to get them working. I exclusively listen to Spotify. The compatibility is atrocious. In the last 24 hours alone I have had a to unplug and reset all of my devices, delete and create new groups, and bounce back and forth between the Spotify and Alexa apps just to get them to work. This morning it took me over 30 minutes to get them to all work together.

There is no “ease of use.” It is not easy at all. It is just one headache after the next.

Everyday when I want to use them, I am guaranteed some sort of fight with it to be able to see and select devices. The majority of the time is just shows devices as needing to connect despite them being connected.

I truly hate these speakers. Whoever is responsible for making these and working in the software…you are terrible and you should feel terrible for such a poor product.

brent1395,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2023","The only reason I have echo devices is for listening to music. I have zero interest in creating grocery lists or chatting with Alexa about the traffic or weather or anything like that. Unfortunately Echo devices are filled with bugs for listening to music, and what's worse, in Amazon's arrogance, they refuse to acknowledge the bugs, so they evidently will NEVER get fixed.

One big issue that has literally been driving me crazy for years--the devices slowly go out of sync with each other as you are listening to music. So after an hour or two, some speakers are playing the music with a half second or full second delay, which makes it unlistenable. Sometimes they just stop playing music completely. I have chatted with seemingly every Amazon agent in India about this several times. I have tried everything they suggested: resetting my router, resetting my echo devices, deleting groups, I even tried things they didn't suggest, like creating a new band on my router just for the echo devices. Nothing solves it. There are hundreds of people on Amazon's own forum complaining about the same issue. There is no solution. Yet Amazon refuses to acknowledge this is a bug on their end.

Other gripes--when I adjust the volume on one speaker, sometimes other speakers adjust in volume too. Bug. When you adjust bass and treble for a speaker, it resets back to zero next time you play a song. So if you like a bit extra bass or if you want to make bass/treble adjustments to match the acoustics of your room, you have to make those adjustments again for EACH SPEAKER EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC. Amazon says this is how its designed to be. Are they insane?

Selecting songs, changing speaker volumes is all done via the super cumbersome and obnoxious Alexa app, which is more interested in trying to get me to use it for stuff i have no interest in. Like controlling my life through Alexa. All i want to do is listen to Bob Marley throughout my house.

Does any Amazon employee actually use their own devices for listening to multi-room music? It doesn't seem like it.

DonnerAndBlitzen,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2021","A dud all around:

1. The globe shape takes up more space in every instance where it's put than its cylindrical predecessors
2. The internal temperature sensor is often inaccurate. Apparently it updates no more often than every 30 minutes.
3. The buggy alexa app occasionally shows the echo 4 temperature on its status screen, but most of the time it doesn't display -- the temperature line is missing. Previous versions prominently displayed the temperature.
4. The temperature measures in C despite setting it to F in the alexa app. The only way to change it is through a voice command to the echo.
5. Sound quality is markedly worse -- and is especially directional. Vocals are muffled and no amount of adjustment makes much difference.
6. The ""equalizer"" is still profoundly primitive with only three adjustment -- bass (which is already too heavy even at the lowest setting); midrange; and treble.
7. No digital signal processing? This is 2021, not 2001.
8. The on-board processor(s) are very slow to react to commands -- and it's not related to the internet or WiFi.
9. Room speaker groups don't work -- one of the three speakers in the group will work fine and any of the three will work fine, but when asked to play in a group, two of the three speakers behave as if they have poor connections with glitchy sound that then drops in and out. All are on the same WiFi dedicated network, and I've reset them multiple times.
10. The action light ring on the bottom is hard to see and is largely hidden by the globular shape. The action ring is on in my image with a waiting notification -- can you see it? Me neither.
11. There is some sort of sound-based occupancy sensor in this version of the echo -- again, doesn't work reliably, poorly documented; and poorly implemented and integrated with the buggy alexa app.
12. Still no way to interact with the echo devices using a web browser -- forced to use the buggy app.
13. Volume normalization across feeds is abominable. Some sources, BBC World Service, for example are quiet -- others, such as the NPR feed are loud. This should be tested before feeds are allowed to go live. Even better, sound normalization should be automated in the cloud if not on the device. It's maddening to be required to manually adjust the volume on EVERY SINGLE source!

Danny,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2022","I upgraded from a 2nd gen that I loved... Speakers were great, whisper across the room and it heard me. I've had the 4th gen for 3 months and absolutely hate it. The speaker sounds great, but the microphones are terrible. Pretty much defeats the purpose of having a smart speaker. I have it sitting on my nightstand 6 to 10 inches from my head and it doesn't hear me. I literally have to almost yell for it to do anything while lying in bed. Standing up, I need to right up to it to have it respond to me. I've reset, de-registered and re-registered, tried all the internet solutions and it still doesn't work. There is definitely a flaw in the design or components. Buyer beware, hopefully Amazon can fix the issues. I am ready to throw this in the trash.

***UPDATE: 10/5/22***
Still having the same issues with the microphones not hearing me. I've been contacted by Amazon Outreach Support for comments on my review. They offered to replace the unit with a refurbished one, but I did not want one that someone else returned for possibly the same reason.

The 4th gen has 4 microphones where as the 2nd gen I traded in had 7 microphones. Why the reduction in microphones? With my bedroom door open I can yell to my bedroom Echo, with out a response, and I can hear the 2nd gen Echo downstairs in the living room respond. It is actually comical at this point. I no longer have to snooze the alarm since I fully wake up trying to get it to respond. Something is definitely wrong with this design and lack of microphones. I've been watching and waiting to see if an updated version is coming out, but still nothing. Huge disappointment for a great device.

We have a total of 7 Echo speakers in the house range from the cube to the dot, varying generations. By far this is the best sounding, but it is also deaf at the same time. I dabbled with the idea of replacing my home entertainment speakers with either 2 of these 4th gen and the sub-woofer or an Echo Studio and the sub-woofer, but none have been updated in years. 2020 for the 4th gen and 2019 for the Studio. I hope new version come out of both speakers and I can make a few upgrades.

Bottom line, if you have an older gen Echo and it suits your needs, wait for a better model to be released and skip the 4th gen.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Zach,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2022","Updated 3x: this device works for a while then will randomly stop listening to you and you need to manually restart them to get it to listen to you. This makes it feel more like a diy tinkering toy and less like a premium product.
My device still plays music from routines so I know it is connected to the internet so this is just an Amazon issue. Very disappointing. I wish I had stuck with google or tried apple’s offering instead.
Another issue I’ve found, this device consistently asks me if I want to hear about products. I want my smart home device to control my smart home, not shove marketing down my throat.

Updated 2x: the device has not given me any more issues. The mic is so sensitive it hears commands coming from downstairs or even when I whisper the A word. The sound quality is muddy but becomes “normal” when you turn down the bass setting as low as possible. This makes the device sound very good. This is a great upgrade over a dot to the point where I actually enjoy listening to music on it.
If you want an alexa device and don’t want to spend $200 for the studio this is the one to get.
I only wish they added that light up clock on this one, then It would be perfect for me.

Updated: last time I unplugged and plugged back in this device seemed to do the trick fixing the microphone sensitivity for the last week.
We will see how long it lasts before I need to do this again

I needed to upgrade because the echo 1 I was using had an issue where the speaker would short out so you had to unplug it and plug it back in to get the sound to work.

In terms of sound and voice recognition this device is not a huge upgrade compared to the first gen echo.

This device is just as good as the original with some added features like a thermometer and sonic detection and a 3.5mm out/in so you can use it as a speaker or use other speakers with it.

Why this device gets 1 star is for some reason when the device has been plugged in for awhile it will stop hearing the wake word. I am unsure if it is a power saving setting or a wifi setting but the device just does not listen. The only way to fix it is to unplug and plug the device back in.

This was the main reason I needed a new device in the first place so you can see how satisfied I am with the new echo.

Will update the review if they fix it, until then I’ll keep using my google home mini instead",1.0 out of 5 stars
Hobeyone,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2021","Update November 2021: I have taken this echo out of service. Last night I ask her to play Klove radio station for me. She said I needed to get Amazons music service. Told her to stop and tried again. She wanted to play Christmas music. Told her to stop. Ask her what the temperature would be and she started to play Christmas music. Took her out of service. Ask my echo show to play klove for 30 minutes. Her answer was ""playing klove fromm H..... I heart radio for 30 minutes.""
I think Amazon had different clouds for different echos. I have my dots be down but my show5 works fine. My dots don't argue we me like this echo does and this on is always trying to get me to buy things, a lot more than dots and shows does.

Original post: I have echos from the very first one to now including echo show 5. The sound quality is the best of all. This new one (4th generation) has problem of hearing you and understanding you. I almost have to yell to get her to hear me and then she doesn't understand. Example. I have lights with wifi bulbs (2 different brands) I almost always have to tell her twice to turn on or off. I have a Amazon smart plug and the same. easy to set up and easy to get other products to work with her.
Update: I’ve changed my post from 3 Stars to 1. She’s getting more hard of hearing. She went bonkers the other night and could only do a few commands. She kept telling me that she could not connect to the internet. All others were okay. I finally unplugged her then restarted. She then told me she needed to recalibrate. That’s a new one.

Update: less than a hour after posting the update Amazon customer services called and worked through the problem. The wakeup name Alexa is a corrupted file. Changing to echo made it better. We will see if that holds. Change from 3 stars to one. Will move It to 2 stars. If it holds i will change ratings to 3 or higher.

UPDATE September 30 2021:
I’m going to go back to one star. Her hearing problem is getting worse. She now argues with me. I tell her to turn on plug for porch and she gives ne the definition of a porch. I must tell her two times to turn on porch. She then tells me the porch is not a command. Go to another echo same command and porch comes on.
I’ve decided to remove her and put in my old first generation puck in her place. It’s does not miss a command.
After reading all the reviews about her hard of hearing I ordered anyway. My advice is don’t buy this one.
For information the command to turn on porch was at 4:00 am nothing was on in room to distract her. And had to give command twice and hear what a porch was.",1.0 out of 5 stars
David Miller,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2021","The speaker works well in a large room and we like the looks and color (blue), even though the cord is white. However, the Alexa apt is frustrating and has been since my first Echo Dot (original generation). Then, there's the Amazon Music Unlimited, which you would think would work great with the Amazon Alexa AND the Amazon Echo speakers. Well, I don't know which to blame, but here is an example: I paired my new 4th Generation Echo with my existing 1st gen. Echo Dot (in another room via the Alexa apt), then requested an artist playlist (i.e. ""play music by Neil Diamond"") and they both worked - for a while. Then, after about six hours (which included Christmas music in March) the gen 4 Echo (mid-song) shut off while the old Echo Dot kept playing. Trying to correct the situation means: Stop Alexa, wait a while, then start over, if you're still inclined. This happens All the time when leaving on long enough. The sound volume also varies song-to-song so that I frequently manually turn the sound up or down. The sound quality is surprisingly good, otherwise. Alexa voice recognition, even after a substantial break-in period is ify: sometimes when requesting a playlist or song Alexa will want to sell me a book.
Some artists play for hours and some for an hour, even though they have many more songs to their credit (i.e. Bill Medley played for one hour with three repeats of ""The Time of Our Lives""). If you have a lot of patience, have fun, but, sooner-or-later things get frustrating.
Update: After contacting Amazon, a very helpful customer rep. guided me through a Factory Reset. Afterwards she promised the device would work 'perfectly'. It works worse. Now about tree hours both 4th Gen. Echo's hiss during playback then shut down with my original 1st Gen. Echo Dot still playing (on my 'everywhere' group inside our house). Then it took 6-7 attempts to get my old Echo Dot to stop. Before I purchased the two 4th Gen. Echo's, everything worked fine .. not 'perfectly', but fine. Good Luck! IF you buy these .. Still not sure if the problem is the new Echo's or Amazon Music Unlimited. Another update (4-20-21): While we do enjoy Amazon Music (when it works) and the sound is good .. the Echo is in a large room so I decided to add another for stereo and coverage .. call me stupid for still hoping for a good experience .. what convinced me to buy another (?) .. Amazon put it on sale and promised to include a free smart plug .. well, Amazon came through again and didn't include the smart plug and their customer service can't remedy. At least I got the sale price, but, I am increasingly NOT becoming a loyal Amazon customer. 6/10/21 Update: Alexa Sucks!: Frequently doesn't play what you ask for, or, when it does, stops playing, mid-song, when it wants, then freezes so you can't play any music until ""SHE"" feels like it (even doing a 'unplug' restart doesn't help). These speakers are marketed for Alexa and Amazon Music users and the experience (six months worth) is frustrating, maddening, and just plain bad.",1.0 out of 5 stars
J. D. Hyde,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021","I've had many Echo devices starting with my first when I was invited to buy a 1st gen before they went to market. I currently have 2 Echo Shows, 2 4th gen Echos, 2 Echo Dots and an Echo Auto. We've always like the Echo products...until recently. About a month ago, we went to bed and as usual told Alexa to play our SleepyTime playlist. Sometime in the night, she stopped playing and when we tried to get the playlist going again she said she couldn't reach the internet. When I woke up the next morning, I found our internet was fine so I tried reconnecting the Echo. No matter what I tried, she would not connect. If I asked her a question, she would just reply with ""I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. The internet is not reachable. ""I even did a factory reset - still no good. Thinking it was bad, I went to Best Buy and bought another 4th gen Echo. It too too would not connect. I tried over and over - no good. So, for kicks, I decided to use my wife's phone and her Amazon account and in the first attempt the device connected. To eliminate my phone as a problem. I opened a brand new Fire Tablet registered to me. I first updated the Alexa app and attempted to connect the 4th gen Echo to my account - no good. We've done coutless resets, but nothing works with my account. Her account, no problem. I have taken the Echo to my work and it does the same thing there as well. The problem with using my wife's account is that all of the other devices, Kasa plugs, Hue lights etc., are attached to my account. I had bought a pack of 4 Kasa plugs and they cannot attach to my account either. I can use them within the Kasa app, but cannot attach them to my Alexa account. Basically, my account is somehow damaged. I called tech support after about 10 days of trying to fix this myself. I was hung-up on twice, but eventually got someone in Echo tech support. After trying many things, even screen sharing from the new Fire tablet, the technician said that this was very unusual and should not be behaving like this. The devices register on my account, but they just won't work. She told me she and her team would need time to investigate this issue and asked me for a good callback time for the next day. I said 5:30pm would be good. I never got the call and my devices still are not working.

BookishBoston,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2024","After being unplugged for several months, the device is no longer responding to voice commands. I discovered this about one week shy of a year from the date of purchase. I went through all of the online troubleshooting tips but nothing worked. Amazon does not offer any actual customer service or product support for their devices. Every time I tried to contact them, it just kept circling back to the online FAQs and troubleshooting pages and now it is outside of the window for the warranty by about a week. At this point, the device will only work as a Bluetooth speaker when I connect it to my phone and will not respond to any verbal commands.

Itsme,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2020","I use other speakers for sound so that isn’t a thing to me. We do use it constantly for our curtains, lights, fans, etc. The white cord is ridiculous. The form factor is neat but makes the blue light more difficult to see.

Setup was difficult. It glitched on the first go and so the app kept looping to “setup your new echo device despite having set it up 5 times. I reset it and started over. The light now lights up.

It doesn’t hear me any better or get the commands correct more frequently than the previous generation. I constantly get “x device doesn’t support that” followed by the command being carried out the next time I say it. It integrates horribly with my firetv stick (so did the previous generation) where “launch Hulu on firetv” gives me a 50/50 split of “that skill is not enabled” and “launching Hulu on firetv”.

I have 3 alexas in 3 different rooms spanning about 2000 square feet. The microphones are too good so more often than not 2/3 of them hear the wake word and (I guess?) assume the other one will follow out the command so neither does it. The new Alexa asked me yesterday if I was talking to it or a different Alexa. I corrected it but it hasn’t helped anything.

The only positive here is that when it gets a command right, specifically with SmartThings, it is a little faster.

Our echo does not sit directly under the tv. It would be neat if the echo would work for as read sound or atmos sound for your tv. It does not. It will only work as a tv speaker with our firetv stick which means the sound comes out from a weird place in our room.

*****Update****. It’s garbage. I have to yell for it to hear me and when it does, it ignores my command or gets it completely wrong; “I’m sorry, X device doesn’t support that” randomly only to work perfectly the next time. The microphone is worse than the firetv cubes by 10. The old microphone was so much better. If I could return this I would. If you want better sound get an Echo Studio or SONOS instead.

Update 2: If I wasn’t so lazy I’d go find our old one in the basement. This thing doesn’t hear me, ignores me…seems to hear me then ignores me. What the heck happened here? Who thought this was a good idea? How is this 5 stars?

LW,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2022","Update. I was contacted by customer service and told this issue was being resolved and after a few days it seemed to be, although i had to recreate my playlists for it to work. Now, its back to not playing my actual playlist, of music i purchased, but rather plays random music the system deems similar. I have moved to spotify and will cease buying my music from amazon and will be setting up a system that does not rely on amazon music or the echo devices as it is just too frustrating. Granted amazon already got my money, but they will get no more and i will warn anyone who will listen. It should not be this difficult to play a playlist of music ive prchased. Frankly, i think it's all part of the pressure to force one to subscribe to unlimited, even to access music one has already purchased and it's just wrong. All I wanted was a way to play music. Alexa has a decent speaket for my purposes and I figure it will work well with my Prime Music. Ha. I've never been able to get Alexa (or Echo) to reliably play a playlist without a big hassle. I took to setting up routines to get the device to play the right playlist. But now it won't even do that. Now Alexa will play my playlist - the same one it's played for 3 months - on ""shuffle and similar song"" mode. I mean, if I wanted random music I'd ask for that and not ask for a playlist. When I ask to turn off shuffle mode Alexa says it can't. I checked my prime music and it is NOT on any kind of auto shuffle mode that I can see. Going with Alexa for music has been a mistake. A device that is supposed to make life easier has been a constant source of frustration and now a complete fail for the purpose I bought it.

Hidden for Security Purposes,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2022","I've had an Echo device since the original was in pre-order, and I got it for $100. Last year, we finally decided it had gotten old enough and traded it in for a new one. That was a mistake.

The new Echo's want to be so helpful. Want some music? They'll gladly tell you all about Amazon's Music Unlimited subscription service, that just so happens is NOT included with Prime. Want to listen to the news? It'll turn on TuneIn, which'll make you listen to up to 10 minutes of commercials before actually playing the news. Want to track your Amazon purchases? It'll happily give you notifications, sometimes even without you asking or wanting them, about where your packages are.

When the Echo starts blinking yellow, you're supposed to ask it what the notification is. Most of the time, it'll tell you about a Subscribe & Save item that's being delayed, or a package got delivered, etc. But sometimes, it'll recommend a book that you have absolutely no interest in.

The book recommendations were my last straw. A little backstory first. As far as I can tell, out of roughly 1500 purchases I've made on Amazon in the last decade, perhaps 5 of them have been books, and none of them for me. They've all been cookbooks, or kids books, as gifts for others. So why, in the name of all that's holy, does the Echo insist on giving me notifications for random books that will be coming out? I don't want them. I don't care what they are. I have never, in the 8 years of owning an Echo, purchased a book through it. I've never asked it to read a book to me. I've never used it to play an audiobook. There is no overlap between what I've told it to do or what I've used it for, and upcoming book releases. That venn diagram is 2 circles with a mile between them. Yet, you CAN NOT disable these notifications. No amount of settings changes, or account updates, or even calling Amazon Tech Support, will remove them.

I do not want book notifications. For that reason, I just bought a Homepod Mini, and I'll be returning my Echo. Maybe if Amazon updates their pushy marketing tactics, I'll get another one, but it's not likely.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Arrived and setup was easy and it did all the cylinder did , slightly better sound as well (though fabric cover is not suited for kitchens - so amazon being back a cylinder variant as well , Of hard plastic so it can be cleaned on the outsides with a glass cleaner ).
But today - day 5 of use out of the blue the music playing suddenly emitter a loud crackle sound of 1-2 seconds length. Went to investigate the noise. Again the loud crackle and then the music returned. Waited a bit and again. It was happening regularly , about 3 to 4 times a minute. Unplugged and replugged to see if a reboot would help. Sitting idle nothing. Asked Alexa to play music and it began playing - and again every 15-20 seconds the loud crackle if 1-2 second length. Definite hardware failure.
By the nature of it I suspect the circuits that feed the digital audio from that source in the cpu over to the digital to analog converter before it goes to the amp , is getting the data corrupted and so what gets decode isn’t the music signal not now a random jumble of loud digital noise. Packet corruption if you will.
So fails on less than a week - a computer or build flaw. Back it goes. Given others habe reported this of may be a bigger batch or systemic failure of some bad components or issue with the board design that fails after some days of use.
So if you are buying one in 2022 be sure to plug it in and make use of it playing music daily for at least a few weeks so you can get a refund / exchange more easily. Don’t leave it in the box for weeks or give it as a gift some days / weeks down the road.",1.0 out of 5 stars
JV,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2020","They design a device to look aesthetically pleasing to the eye as it sits on your counter or table. And then they send your Charcoal or Twilight Blue device with a white power cord. Pretty unbelievable that they did not color match the cord, especially since it needs to remain plugged in 100% of the time. Really disappointed. Returning three of these tomorrow. Google Home, here I come.

FOLLOW UP - So I got a quick call and email from Amazon. But their response was even more disappointing. Here's the email:

Hello, My name is Christian and I’m from Amazon’s Technical Support team. I'm sorry to hear about the issue/s experienced with your 4th Gen Echo, which prompted you to leave a critical review on Amazon.com. I tried to reach you over the phone, but unfortunately we didn't connect. I understand you're rather concerned about the aesthetics of the white power cord. This was an intentional decision that we made so that the power cord could more easily blend in with white background (think drywall, etc.). Since we'd still like to offer you some options, you're free to purchase a replacement power adapter in black at the link below (your model takes 30 watts): https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S8K1RP

What a load of crap - This ""think drywall"" rationale makes sense if you have drywall that is painted white, which I can tell you, no one in the northeastern United States has. Amazon made the decision to throw a white cord in every box to save money on the non-white devices and/or get people to shell out another $20 for the color cord that should have been in the box. Really disappointing from Amazon and really shortsighted.

2ND UPDATE - So, Amazon dropped the price on these by $30.00. I bought three of them, so I decide to stick with the Alexas despite the cord issue on the black. I call to get a price adjustment. Nope, you have to return all three and buy three new ones. Clearly Amazon is hoping this will be an impediment to customers trying to get the lower price. I say, that makes no sense because Amazon is going to have to eat additional shipping plus reboxing. Sales rep tells me, they have to do it that way because there are only so many at the sales price. Another customer service line of crap. So, in theory, they are going to take my $100 Alexas, put them on the side and sell them only after the sale. Doubtful.

Ralph,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2022","I was surprised by how little this thing can actually do and by how un-seamless the user experience is. The biggest smart-home items I have that I wanted to connect are my robot vacuum and robot mopper, from Neato and iRobot respectively.

The Alexa app has robot vacuums as a main device category, but connecting them is really difficult. For the Neato vacuum, you have to connect your Neato account to Amazon. Fair enough, except that it only works if you used the same email address for both accounts! You will have to change your Neato email address to whatever you use with Amazon. Sorry if you wanted privacy.

Connecting the iRobot mopper just didn't work. You have to install the iRobot skill, then add the bot as a device, but it won't connect to my Braava Jet robot at all. There is really no way to get help with it either. Amazon can't offer support for the dozens of 3rd party devices they claim to support, and iRobot doesn't know how to get it to work either. That is a hint of a failing ecosystem.

I don't have any smart lights or anything like that yet, so what's left in terms of functionality is low-level features like the flash briefing. But even this seems like it's been neglected by Amazon. Many of the news sources on offer have stopped updating, so you can add them but Alexa just says they are unavailable every time. It's really difficult to customize also. I noticed if you ask Alexa how to edit your flash briefing she gives you inaccurate directions that don't reflect the current version of the Alexa app. If you manage to figure it out, you realize you can't really add useful things to your flash briefing like air quality for your city. It seems the boundaries of the experience are quite narrow, and they are becoming more narrow as the ecosystem shrinks.

Below are from Amazon.com's Customer service team, but AMAZON do not take actions to resolve the issue that AMAZON caused, but ask customer to buy more device to solve the issue.

Thank you for the reply - Unfortunately, the model you described:
""Kwikset 99160-020 Smartcode 916 Traditional Smart Lock Touchscreen Electronic Deadbolt Door Lock with SmartKey Security and Z-Wave Plus.""

Is not directly compatible with an Echo's zigbee hub, it uses z-wave a similar but different protocol, which would necessitate a hub.

That being said, you still have 2 options here, you can try to use the documentation I provided to get your earlier smart lock hooked up to your Echo.

Please note that instead of using the key app and trying to pair with the smart lock, you just have to tell the Echo ""Alexa, discover devices"" after resetting the smart lock or putting it in pairing mode. (I understand the documentation is old, but zigbee is standardized so there's a good chance we can pair with the lock).

Alternatively, you can try a z-wave lock and use a compatible hub, I have 2 suggestions for hubs linked below for you to choose at your convenience - each of which will work with both Alexa and Google assistant:

L O N G time Alexa/Ring/Blink user here. I have 4 Alexa devices in my house - I have had for several years now. I traded in my 4 previous devices (3rd gen) and boy, do I wish I could get them back somehow!

-the microphones on these things don't work well **AT ALL**.
I either have to repeat 'alexa - Alexa - A L E X A' or I have to SCREAM at the stupid thing half the time it seems,

-the 'sound' that come from these seems relatively equal to my previous ones,

-the light ring ... is FAR to difficult to easily spot with the ring on the bottom. Unless I'm basically staring at one of them, the light ring doesn't seem to be as - noticeable - as my previous ones with the ring on the top of the device

I AM VERY unhappy with these ...",1.0 out of 5 stars
klawrawkz,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2022","Hi, my name is klaw. I am fine, how are you?

I'm returning the echos i bought. They arrived not but an hour ago. Futility is the mantra when it comes to the set up and pairing of these two thingies. The end result is no device pairing and an hour of wasted time. Time which probably would have been more enjoyably spent staring at the wall. Try wall staring if you have not!! It's much more enjoyable than trying to set up echos! lol. Imho, the echo is horrible.

Please pass this feedback on to the manufacturer: ""The echo is a LAME, and intolerable device whose insolence should not be tolerated. It is a de-evolutionary system and therefore a total step back from previous versions. I am returning both echos i bought after an hour of futility spent attempting to set them up. You should abandon this version and give them away gratis to people who enjoy bad technology.""

Note to potential echo buyers out there: If you are into music and are desirous of a new system, do yourself a favor and buy yourself a sonos. Or multiple soni (sp?) I already have sonos and the set up is a breeze. It's like uncorking a bottle and watching spellbound as Barbara Eden floats out. Truth.

I was lured into trying this ""next gen"" echo because of the bargain basement pricing. There is a reason for this. An hour of my billable time is far more valuable than the price of the echo, and since I'm in the tech industry for a living, I don't need the aggravation of battling yet another system in my spare time.

These speakers should deploy and set up almost ""automagically"" since they have the weighty support of Amazon's legions of engineers to back up the design. This is not the case. These speakers should bear a big red label reading ""Warning Lame Tech Inside. Proceed at your own risk. Perhaps you would be better off staring at the wall.""

Thank you.

Roger S,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2024","I’ve got 4 of the gen 4 echos, 3 show screens, 3 echo dots. They started out working well, turning things on and off, playing Amazon music, and sounding great.
In the last year the AI has gotten progressively worse. The software updates make it worse as they enable “AI” code that has clearly been pushed out the door untested and broken to capitalize on the hype. The net result is the ONE requirement for any smart speaker “mute” is now gone. Echo decided that when you said ‘good morning’ to your wife that means “play mind destroying German heavy metal porn with screaming babies” and you have no way to make it stop. Before Amazon ruined the software you could say “WAKEWORD STOP” but now it just plays more German porn heavy metal LOUDER from all your speakers unsynchronized and the only way to stop them all is to unplug them for a few hours until you want the worst device ever to turn on, listen on all your conversations, take stealth video of you , and play music when you don’t ask and never can find the song you ask for “play Green Day” = “I could not find a song named “Jojo blooey van hincjlewicz, playing loud German heavy metal porn for the next hour instead.” WHY???!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars
JohnD,"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2023","The primary reason we have an echo at all is so my wife can listen to her music.

This Echo (4th gen) replaces a years old first generation Echo which had begun to malfunction pretty badly. So she could have ""unlimited"" music we subscribe to the unlimited music package for $4.99/month for a single device.

1. Now, Amazon wants us to upgrade our subscription to $8.99/month which is the price for multiple devices. I verified that our original Echo was de-registered but it now wants to include our Fire-Stick ( which we never use for music).

2. When we asked our original Echo to play a song, it played the song we asked for and then stopped, exactly the behavior we wanted. Now, if we ask for a song Alexa automatically shuffles the song we requested with ""similar songs"", and most often does not play the requested song first, In addition, Alexa only allows 6 skipped songs per hour, even though she is playing we never asked for.

3. Sometimes Alexa will refuse to play a song unless we upgrade to ""unlimited"" (which we already have), even though she played the song recently. Then, after we decline the upgrade she will shuffle he song we requested in with similar songs, and then play the similar songs instead of the one requested.

We find all of these ""features"" frustrating in the extreme and have felt like smashing the Echo to pieces.

Thanks, Amazon the wrecking a peaceful and enjoyable pastime and replacing it with something that raises both blood pressures and tempers more often than not.

She was very kind and friendly so this update has nothing to do with her. I am returning here to change my two star review to a one star review because I am so frustrated that this echo does not understand me most of the time, responds when I don’t ask for a response, and most importantly does not always respond when I do ask for a response. I really really hate this version and so very much regret trading in my beloved 1st GEN Echo.

1. My echo is gray/black and comes with a white cord that sticks out like a sore thumb making my countertop look messy. Design fail.
2. This echo has a sense of urgency that is irritating. I get it Echo, my timer is going off, but please give me time to actually respond to you before you tell me again.
3. This echo cannot hear or understand me as well as my 1st Gen.
4. This echo doesn't always give me the option to continue speaking. It's a hit or miss.
5. Sometimes responds, sometimes doesn't, even though I'm close. Makes me yell at it out of frustration and I don't like that.
6. The I'm listening ""ding"" is way too loud considering my volume setting for the voice.

I bought smart bulbs last year and just got around to installing them, only to find out that my 1st generation echo doesn't support them. Decided to buy this Echo and add a Show. I picked a charcoal (it's really black, let's be honest) Echo to replace a black Echo, which matches the room and the table the device is on. Take everything out of the box and the cord is white. Looks stupid. I set up the device and as I'm working all day all I see is the stupid white cord, which is on prominent display due to the dark furniture. I can't stand how it looks, so I call Amazon to report that the wrong color was in the box, to be told that the device only ships with a white cord. The customer service rep tells me that it says so on the website. No, it doesn't. He tells me it's in the pictures, but if you look at all the pictures, none with the black device show the cord. And, to add insult to injury, the customer service rep hung up on me while I was trying to relay my delivery issues. Now I've had it. I'll keep my 1st gen device until it dies.

HowToEvery,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2022","I feel like I'm a fanboy of Alexa. I have Echo dot 4th gen, Echo 4th gen and Echo Plus and I love the capabilities of this smart device and the sound quality.
Yesterday though, I tried pairing all of the devices so they will play together, and after trying so many different things, I got 2 devices to work, but the Echo dot just can't connect to the other 2. Not as ""Alexa play everywhere"", and not by adding it to the group in the app.

Alexa also acts strangely when she doesn't understand something and just bleeps something and shuts off. If I ask a long question, she'll cut me and start operating based on half of my sentence.
She never was able to answer something that is relevant to the previous thing we talked about. For example: ""Alexa, what is the tallest building"" and she would tell me ""Burj Khalifa"", I'd ask ""And what is its height"" and she wouldn't know what is ""it"", she doesn't know we just spoke about the Burj Khalifa.
The thing is that its been so many years already and it seems like there is no progress in her abilities and sometimes it's seems like she gotten worse through the years.

I used to be able to play ""My sleep playlist from spotify"" but now she will always look for playlists made by Spotify instead of playing the playlists I created. Even if I'll name the playlist ""sleep by me"" or some other more specific name of a playlist that isn't public on Spotify, she'll say ""Sorry , I don't know a playlist called ""Sleep by me"" even though that is exactly the name, and she's connected to my Spotify user.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Detective,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2021","All of the 4th Gen Echos are Amazon's greatest failure. The 3rd Gens are great, they hear you every time. they stay connected to the internet, they do what they're made to do every singe time.--The 4th Gens do the exact opposite, from day one all of the 4th Gen ones I have purchased have done nothing but fail to do what they are made to do. They have better speakers, and this big one has added a temperature sensor, which is truly a game changer for routines, allowing Alexa to monitor the temperature of a room and adjust accordingly on her own. Howver she NEVER hears me say her name the first time, 80% of the time once she does, she will not hear the command I give her. How is an Echo supposed to work if it cannot understand its user. That is literally the ONLY thing these things need to do--well that and stay connected to the internet. there is a 50/50 shot that when I say her name, she gives me the ""the intertnet isnt accessible"" line. When it Very much is. every other device I have connects and stays connected just fine. It is only the 4th Gen echos that have so much trouble staying connected.
The temperature sensor is the only real thing worth even trying to buy one of these, but its hugely unreliable at best, and sadly no other temperature sensor can initiate a routine based on the rooms degree yet. -----Do not waste your money on the 4th gen, buy a 3rd gen or wait for the 5th

Brian Tullio,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2021","I have had Echos since the original beta group back in 2014. I still have and use my Gen 1 every day. I currently have 9 of them including Echo Autos, 4 dots, and an Echo Flex. I purchased this 4th gen to replace the 1st gen that I use as the main Echo in my living room. The 1st gen is still working great, but it's not compatible with some of the new Alexa features.

We got it last year on black Friday. It would respond to commands OK for a few hours. After that, it would stop responding entirely. You could manually wake it with the button, but it would not hear you at all. A power reset would fix it, for a few hours or a day and then it would happen all over again. After dealing with Amazon, they sent a replacement. The replacement had the same issue. Even when it did work, you had to speak very loud and close. The Echo dots on the other side of the house would respond instead of this one 3 feet away.

The Echo was placed in the same location as the one it replaced, on the same network.

After going through 2 units, we figured there was some sort of known issue. We returned the second unit and went back to our 1st gen. A year later (hoping that the issues have been worked out), we purchased another unit. Guess what? New unit has the same exact issue.

Search Google for Echo 4th gen microphone issues and you will see this happens to a lot of people. Even when they do worth, they don't work nearly as good as previous generations. Which is a shame.

st0rmbringer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2021","I recently traded in all my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gen devices to ""upgrade"" to the 4th gen devices. If you're thinking about it, DON'T DO IT!

1) The 4th gen devices don't seem to pick up voice commands as well. We frequently use the Echo in our family room on the 1st floor. Even though we are 5 feet away and within line of sight of the Echo, our Echo show upstairs in a room with a *closed* door hears the command instead and prevents the family room Echo from responding. The activity logs indicate the Echo Show wasn't the intended device, but ultimately none of them respond so we have to repeat the command.

2) The sound is awful. The previous Echo's had a nice range and good base. The 4th gen echo sounds very hollow and tinny. If you like to listen to music through your Echo, avoid the 4th gen devices!!

3) The light ring is now on the bottom of the Echo, so unless the device is placed at a position lower than you, you probably won't be able to see it. Considering the mic can't pick up your commands well, you'll often wonder if it's doing anything at all since you get no indications.

While not a 4th gen specific issue, the Echo is going to constantly be trying to upsell you on Amazon services. If you request a song that isn't on Prime, it's going to try and upsell you their Ultimate Music service, then it's going to start playing some ""station"" that is not the song you request. 100% of the time I have to further request that it stop playing the station, which it can't hear me well so I end up yelling for it to stop 4 or 5 times.

I was looking forward to getting the 4th generation echo, I wasn't sure about it after reading all the reviews but I thought I will give it a try anyhow.

I had the 1st generation Echo which was getting replaced by the 4th generation. I didn't really care for the 4th generation sphere design but I had hoped that the technology will make up for it. I was wrong the Echo Dot in the other room answers my questions 😂🤷🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ very disappointed!!! Never had such an issue with 1st generation Echo, now I think why did I replace it in the first place. It even used to prompt if I got the response from the right device.

The most disappointing is the Amazon support not helpful at all. When I reached out to the Chat support they gave me the excuse device software was out of date, I asked why it didn't update automatically, they told me device needs to be idle for half hour. Forget during the day when everyone is awake, it didn't find an idle time at night as well when everyone was asleep 🤣😂

I was able to reproduce the issue today, I asked the Echo 3 questions but every time the Echo Dot in the different room responded and when I called Amazon support, they asked me to reproduce the issue even though they could see in my voice history which device responded to the questions.

I tried to reproduce the issue when I was on call, it didn't happen, they said we will call in an hour. I never heard back from Amazon support and instead got an email saying they couldn't reach me. Very disappointed!!

Verdict: I won't suggest to upgrade...poor device and very horrible customer service. 1st generation Echo was definitely louder and I preferred the overall design. The issues with the mic are annoying.

We are now on our THIRD 4th generation Echo. The first one (Round One) hooked up beautifully to all our devices, but was totally hard of hearing. We would stand 2 feet away from Alexa and scream to get her to respond. This device is located on our main floor. The device in our bedroom a floor up and rooms away would respond before the one two feet away did. So Amazon send us a new one. This was after spending 45 minutes on the phone with customer service.

Round Two 4th generation hears perfectly well but is completely was unable to connect with out two brand new Philips Hue light bulbs which were part of the package that came with Round One. Chatted first with someone in the US on fixing this. Seemed like we might be getting somewhere but she put me on hold.

After 6 months of use, Alexa goes silent (no light) and the only way to fix this is to unplug and re-plug the device. I have been patiently doing this, hoping the issue was going to get fixed on its own but for the last two month the issue is occurring more and more often and I now need to unplug/re-plug the device about every 2-3 days. Another issue with the device is I usually have it at a low volume to listen to my tv (line in) and during the day I raise the volume but at the same time, Alexa’s volume is raised so when I say a command, Alexa is extremely loud. I wish Alexa’s volume was separate to avoid this.
Now let’s talk about warranty coverage... It's unbelievably painful to find and get to warranty support for this device. Once I found the link to chat, I was on a chat troubleshooting for about 2 hours.

J. Tidwell,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2023","I thought since these speakers were on sale on Prime Day that I would upgrade the ones that I have. Only problem is, the new speakers will not let you play other music apps, you must play Amazon prime music. Amazon increased their yearly membership fee which included basic Amazon music, but they changed that program to where you could not request a song or an artist or anything else. If you ask for something to play it plays random songs and will eventually get around to the song that you wanted to hear to begin with, and you cannot shuffle songs anymore. For prime members Amazon unlimited music was supposed to be $8.99 a month, then I got notification that it was going up to $13.99 a month. So I canceled Amazon prime music. They have become too greedy, it's not like we don't spend enough to begin with buying their products and yes we do get free shipping but that is a benefit of membership of any company. I will be returning the three new speakers that I purchased for the very reason that Amazon is making sure that you will have to use their app for music.

Paddyinarizona,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2023","This is my third device. My first was an ancient Dot that worked well, but sound was iffy. Got an Echo and was amazed at the sound. In July, I got this 4th gen Dot and at first it was fine. I put it in the living room thinking the newest model would be the best, demoted the Echo to the bedroom, and sent the old dot to the guest room. Then I started to notice when I asked the Dot a question, sometimes the bedroom Echo would answer. After a while, I tried to lower the Echo sound sensitivity and increase the new Dot, but found no setting for that, so I switched them, and changed the wake word. So now the Dot is in the bedroom, but was sometimes unable to complete a routine. It would do the first few, then stop. Was unable to play music without losing signal. At times, it would acknowledge a request, but do nothing. Other times it doesn't understand or does not know how.

CandiedKairos,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2022","I’ve been an Alexa user for years and have loved it. I loved the features and the ease it brought to my life. The sound quality of this gen is great; the aesthetics are lovely. I never had a problem with Alexa and Alexa devices—until I upgraded to this gen. If you’re considering it, stop. Don’t do it. I have had nothing but trouble. And I’m not alone. Google it. The problem is pervasive and persistent.

I plugged it in initially around Dec 1 and have regretted it since. My device randomly plays audacy at an absurd volume and won’t always shut off—sometimes I have to unplug it to get it to stop. I have tried resetting it, reinstalling the app, factory restores, removing all devices from my account, removing all skills/apps from the device, etc. I’ve watched videos, read help pages, and asked friends in IT to help. Nothing—NOTHING—resolves the issue. I have taken my Alexa down to no skills or apps. Basically it’s now an automated list maker and it STILL randomly plays Audacy (and by “plays” I mean “screams”). It only plays Audacy; nothing else…although it recently started to randomly beep at me. My privacy settings are as locked down as they can be and still—still—the problem remains.

Don’t. Do. It. Go to a different system and let Amazon work through its issues in someone else’s home. I’ve had this gen for about 3 months and it’s spent about 1/3 of that time unplugged because the anxiety these random musical attacks trigger makes the whole system not worth it.

Kent,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2022","I had to upgrade my echo because my first-generation echo seemed to be so outdated, Alexa was not working well with it. I was an early adopter and had it when Amazon only sold it through invitation only. I was fine upgrading it because it definitely was well used during its life. I've set the new one up and my negative review is based on playing music (regardless on what model you have). Since I had echoes back in 2015/2016, you could always have the device play your music from you amazon library of music you purchased through amazon. For instance, I would say ""Play songs by [particular artist]"". Or ""Shuffle songs by [artist name]"". That seems to be rather different in the last couple of months as Amazon upgraded their music services. Now when I ask Alexa to shuffle or play songs from my library by a particular artist, she will no longer do that, but only play songs through Amazon music service where you are forced to listen to similar artists through their own library. This is very frustrating and a terrible change. It seems like they're always trying to get you to subscribe to pay for their premium music service. All I want to do is play the songs I've purchased through amazon. I really hope they correct this terrible change.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Update: Amazon Technical Support contacted me via email and told me to update the devices to the latest version of the firmware. Yes, on the Echo 4th Gen you can say ""Check for Updates"" and it will tell you all updates have been applied. So ... why does it only play Amazon Music?

The update option does not apply to Echo Show 5. Not by saying ""Check for Updates"", not by using the screen and navigating to Settings even though it tells you navigate to Settings to apply updates. Yes, it tells you to navigate to Settings and apply updates. There is no option under Settings to do this.

erypmav,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2020","I wanted to replace a 2nd Gen Dot with a full size Echo. It was just when the pre-order for Echo 4th Gen opened. I figured, ""Sure! This will be good!"" Unfortunately I was very, very wrong.

I, like other purchasers, have the issue of poor microphone sensitivity. I find myself repeating ""Alexa"" about 3 times before it wakes up. I'll give it a command and it will just wait in limbo until I repeat the command.

Additionally, like other purchasers, I don't like that it came with a white power cord. It looks stupid with a charcoal unit.

The sound quality is AWFUL! I believe part of the issue is that the speaker is angled from 1/2 way up the front to the base of the back. The rest of the top is just plastic, not speaker. I didn't think about it at the time but it's a stupid design. Sound is being pushed out and down. Perhaps if I put it on a high shelf it would sound better but should I HAVE to place it on a high shelf to be able to hear it properly?

Interestingly, I was charged full price for the ""free"" Philips bulb that was included with the pre-order. I hadn't actually noticed until just the other day. So they screwed me on that.

I would have returned the Echo 4th Gen but, like an idiot, I threw away the box before I realized how bad a product it is. So it's pretty much a paperweight now.

So one customer service tells me that the new one is ordered and will be here in 3-5 business days, another tells me that I will get nothing until they get the broken one and fix it then send it back, and now I am on perpetual hold because the phone operators are too busy goofing off to actually provide any kind of completent assistance.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Once again it could be placement which is next to a couch arm and a wall, But my old cylinder style echo heard me 80% of the time instead of just 30% of the time like this unit. Nicely designed looks good integrated into my Alexa system basically easy when changing over. Except blink cameras, it randomly overtime would show up a different blink camera as new device discovered. I would have to say my favorite part is it doesn’t fall over like the cylinder when the cats rubs up against it. All in all the sound is decent or good enough for me, I am no audio file nut and listen to very little music, device looks good, and eventually does what I request of it. I do find all echo devices do have their strange quirks, which I don’t understand because I would think they all work off the same cloud and would use the same exact commands; that does not seem to be the situation at least not in my experience. Had an echo show five that I just traded in that constantly I needed to use different commands than any of my other devices. And this new echo device (4thGEN) for some reason decided that it will not work with my living room light unless I specify in the command “living room light”even though the light is in Alex App as just living room and the old tower echo device used to accept just the word “living room off/on”, took me a while to figure out what was going on and why the device was telling me “living room does not support this command”. Also constantly have problems with the play and pause fire TV command, after pausing when I use the play command it tends to change the TV into a search mode. I find it just easier to manually play and pause. And the occasional changing of commands overtime is also quite annoying. Certain commands I used for months/years and suddenly one day they would not work and I had to figure out what the new command was, this is extremely annoying. Please stop doing this Amazon leave well enough alone.
Well I realized I never hit submit on this review, now it’s approximately eight months later, and I can’t stand this thing, constantly have to repeat myself over and over again. Sometimes it doesn’t even do anything except the blue and green lights just keep spinning around like it’s trying to figure out what I just said. wish I never traded in my old tower version. What’s going to be the next shape so they can sell more but make no true improvements a pyramid, a rectangle, an octagon God only knows. Now almost all of my lights in the house need the word light said after them to work properly so now it’s no longer front porch off, now I have to say front porch light off. Soon I’m gonna have to read a novel to the thing to get it to do some thing probably give it GPS coordinates of the light so it will work. Very disappointed my sister has an Alexa and Google and she tells me she prefers the Google much better. Also since Amazon took over the blink cameras, love the cameras but the app with every update gets worse, for some reason with each update one click turns into two clicks next update those two clicks to change a setting has turned into three clicks or more to change a setting what sense is this. This little echo ball works so badly, it is literally sitting 2 feet from me on a table, that I give up and holler to the old Echo dots in the kitchen for my needs. May just give the Google device a try as my main device.",2.0 out of 5 stars
I_Rogue,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2024","I was a bit late to the Alexis craze, but I did get in when the devices were gen 3 hockey pucks. Those devices worked fine. Still do. When I had the desire to have larger speakers to I could pair and practice playing bass I purchased these. Man. These things have just simply gotten worse as time as gone on. They don't pick up on my voice commands and its gotten to the point where I'm having an argument with an inanimate object. I have to talk so loud that the gen 3 devices in other rooms a great distance away answers. The sound, when they work, is pretty good. That's when they work. But when I pair them in a room for left and right or use them in a group such as ""upstairs"", the sound breaks up or they just stop completely. I don't know what the deal is with Gen 4 devices, but I can't recommend these no matter how much they cut the price. Now I hear rumors that Alexa is going to become a subscription model once they implement AI into them. Man, if we are already paying for Prime, why do we have to fork out more cash for these things? They should already work. And, to add insult to injury, some of the routines I have used with other apps, like AnyList, got turned off. AnyList apologized saying that get almost zero warning from Amazon that they were changing the API (Application Programming Interface) and it rendered their app useless. I can't recommend these until Amazon decides to put some effort and support back into once was a OK, not great, but OK piece of hardware.

delber,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2024","Got the Echo Dot a couple of years ago and this Echo (4th Gen) a few weeks ago. Disappointed with this Echo. The frequency response is not what I was expecting. Bass is very good, however the treble is poor. When listening to music and I know there are symbols being played but I can't hear them, then it's not worth listening to the music. Don't know if the problem is a hardware design issue with the Echo or a deficiency in the software (equalizer). An example: I have just an average radio and speakers in my car, at best. Sound quality was poor. A few years ago I began using Pandora along with an equalizer application from the Google Play Store. This app from Google Play has 10 band equalizer. I'm playing my music from Pandora to my car radio via bluetooth and incorporating the equalizer app. The fidelity is absolutely AMAZING, dare I say 20Hz - 20kHz. What I'm trying to say is that I think the fidelity from Echo could be outstanding if Amazon put a little effort into the Alexa app and provided us with a much better equalizer.

KSM,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2021","A very poor “whole house” audio solution. What little usefulness it has is just a hook to make you pay for and become reliant on amazon music unlimited. Unless you swallow that bait it is a poor and inconvenient option. Even if you can find enough “free with Prime” music that you want to listen to, it won’t let you add more than 20 songs to a playlist. Any function that doesn’t further Amazon’s ability to sell you more stuff or subscribe to more stuff, is just ignored and unaddressed.

“Whole House Audio”??? That’s a joke. It won’t let you play your own music from your phone on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play radio apps on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play audio books on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play the audio from a Bluetooth-connected TV on the “everywhere group”. Basically it’s a novelty item that is WAY oversold as a whole house audio solution. It is only “whole house audio” for being tied to Amazon’s pay streaming music.

If music is playing on one unit, and you ask it to continue playing the music on the “everywhere group”: First, it will tell you that you can’t play music on the “everywhere group” because music is already playing on another unit. But It’s not playing on another unit. It is playing on the unit you are talking to. So it will force you to stop playing the music and then make a new music request to be played on the everywhere group. I have yet to be able to get it to continue playing the same music it was originally playing on the everywhere group. Continuity is awful (non-existent). Amazon is primarily concerned with selling you the unlimited subscription, instead of responding to a reasonably foreseeable request in a manner that enhances your listening continuity as you move around the house.

Let’s say you’re getting ready in the morning and you want Alexa to tell you the news. Don’t expect to able to move around from room to room because it will only play that news audio on one unit. Not on the everywhere group, or on another smaller group. If you move to a different room that has another unit, your only option is to replay the news from the very beginning again and listen to what you have listened to already over again.

None of these problems are beyond the technical ability of the Echo units. Some of the problems are intentionally created obstacles just to try to force you into paying for unlimited. Others problems remain unaddressed because they wouldn’t help (or hurt) Amazon to sell you more “stuff”.

So you’ve spent a few hundred dollars on echo units for around your house? Good luck with that. Don’t expect true whole house audio and don’t expect them to work together as a group of units. All you did was purchase the “gateway drug” for Amazon’s selling machine.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Rob,"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2024","I bought the Echo for the multi-room setup feature, where I can play the same music in every room with an Alexa enabled device. Unfortunately the Echo would not pair up with the Samsung HW-Q800C soundbar, even though it is marketed as ""Alexa built-in."" I say this after working Samsung support for a half hour and then Alexa support for an hour. Both ended up pointing fingers at the other as the cause.

That said, I do give Amazon Alexa support credit for spending so much time with me to try and get this to work. Also, the Echo's voice recognition feature works very well, and sound quality is great. But voice recognition was not the primary motivator in my case - the multi-room was. Hence the two stars.

Amazon should either ensure partners clearly state that their device isn't tested/won't work in a multi-room setup, or ensure that ""Alexa-built in"" means multiroom will work. I am not happy about all the time I wasted, both on my own and with Samsung/Amazon support, to try and get this to work.

D. W.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2020",I actually prefer the more balanced sound from my echo plus (2nd gen) without needing to mess with the equalizer. I also prefer the 360° sound from the echo plus. after going back-and-forth I’ve personally experienced the microphones on the echo plus pick up my voice better. in my opinion this new version just sounds a little bit louder with more bass even though they both have the exact same drivers with the exception of the new one having an extra tweeter which doesn’t really make a difference in the sound. I actually had to turn down the bass just a little because it sounded a little... messy. i’m not really sure why they completely changed the design and got rid of the 360° sound and made it a directional sound speaker instead. i’m a little confused. One more thing I noticed about the new speaker is when the volume goes up the bass goes down which is very common for all these speakers and most Bluetooth speakers but it seems especially evident in this newest version of the echo. they could’ve at least made the bluetooth option volume sync with your phone with this new version. and of course it wasn’t compatible to pair with my echo plus for stereo. ok i’m done.,2.0 out of 5 stars
Shay,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2021","This is a super handy device, but it has some reliability issues that make it iffy for the kind of lifestyle integration it seems like it'd help with. Voice recognition is a 50/50 toss-up, and while it's better at accurately recognizing words and phrases than other AI assistants, it still misses enough that important information doesn't get added to your to-do list or shopping list.

I use it the most for timers, calendar reminders, task reminders, and adding things to my to-do list and shopping list hands off. Timers and task reminders work great; calendar reminders are awesome, but for some reason everything gets repeated twice even after having it set in the app to only repeat reminders once. The to-do list and shopping list feature works, but the integrations between different apps are really poor (my to-do list lets me have a dumping ground list for tasks added through the Alexa, but I have to manually sort and tag them later), and the Alexa app's features aren't strong enough that I'd be comfortable switching my lists to its platform for the ease of integration.

We have two smart lights from Geeni that we use with it, and every second or third time we try to operate them through voice commands, the command fails in some way - the Echo doesn't respond even after listening to your request, or it says ""okay"" but doesn't actually operate the light until a few minutes or few tries later.

We tried connecting it to our Firestick, but it was so non-functional we had a better experience just keeping them separate. HBO would routinely crash, or the sound would cut off of HBO streams, when the Echo was the speaker for the firestick; and the process of re-connecting the Echo after this happens, and clearing the Firestick app cache and relaunching things, etc. made the process miserable and unworkable.

The app is very slow and hard to navigate - the paths to different features are hard to find, and you have to retrace your steps a lot to complete multiple complex actions.

The audio quality is excellent, and I love using it for sleep ambience and music. However, it's very annoying to have to hear ads interfering with the experience of virtually any Alexa app you'll use, whether that's a small soundscape service or a major music platform. The best experience I have is connecting it to my phone via Bluetooth so I can play whatever I want without interruption, which is a pain, but at least then I haven't just paid for an Amazon product that still makes me listen to ads.

I set 2 timers for a nap. After they rang, I set another 30-minute timer (I know I nap quite a bit). However, after the new timer is set, the old timer kept ringing. So I said to Alexa with my dreamy eyes, ""Alexa, turn off the alarm"" to which Alexa replied, ""there is no active alarm.""

Thinking that the 30-minute timer is canceled too, I told Alexa again, ""Alexa, set a timer for 30 minutes."" It replied, ""Second alarm set for 30 minutes."" Frustrated, I then told Alexa to clear all timers and set just 1 alarm for 30 minutes, to which it replied, ""Third alarm set for 30 minutes.""

Not wanting three alarms to go off one after another, I asked Alexa to clear all timers. Alexa then read to me, that I have 3 active timers set, with the FIRST timer set to 30 minutes and X minutes X seconds remaining, the SECOND timer set to 30 minutes X minutes X seconds remaining, the THIRD timer set to 30 minutes and X minutes X seconds remaining, which one did I want to cancel. I said ""all of them."" Alexa then said ""timer all of them"" was not found and then hung up on me. I then had to tell it to cancel my timers again. It repeated the same information about each of the timers, which took a very long minute, and then proceeded to ask me which timer I wanted to cancel again. ""You have a 30-minute timer with 23 minutes and 40 seconds left, a 30-minute timer with 25 minutes and 12 seconds left, and a 30-minute timer with 26 minutes and 23 seconds left.

I called customer service and asked for Amazon Digital Device Support. I was speaking with someone from the Phillipines and she did not know what I was talking about!
So, I asked that the Echo be replaced since I had tried to re-sync it multiple times to WiFi and then gone through the setup procedure 4 times! It still would not work..
I asked that a replacement be sent me and I would send this one back (it is still under warranty).
She replied that there would be a fee for that. Since it is still under warranty, I told her that was not correct. It seemed as if she had been reading from a script and seemed flummoxed. She paused for long periods and put me on hold as if she was reading through procedure steps.
I asked her not to waste time, but she continued to pause and put me on hold!
Finally I hung up and called back, hoping to connect with someone who was more professionally competent.

At that time with the app I had been unable to reach Digital Device support. I now know I could have gone through a different pathway to get Them on the phone!!

I did get a Digital Device support person from Jamaica on the phone, but she insisted on going through her script, then hung up on me.

James Cosentino,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2020","When I saw this design I knew immediately I had to have it. It's spherical look matched the look of the spherical lamps in my living room (Ikea Fodo lamps), purchasing with the intent of moving my Echo Plus to a different room in exchange for this new model being the living room's device.
Right away I noticed the sound pickup is weaker than my Echo Plus. Having used the Plus for nearly three years in the same location, I was accustomed to a specific level of voice pickup, especially when first entering my home and prompting Alexa to turn on the lights. This new model needs me to speak much louder to throw my voice enough in order for it to pickup and respond accordingly. That's strike one.
Next, while I love the design and the light ring makes sense at the base for this design, I decided very early on that the placement of the light ring at the base is counterintuitive as it's difficult to impossible to see if your prompt was recognized if your vantage point is obstructed; this was not the case with the Echo Plus with it's tall cylindrical design. That's strike two.
Finally, the sound quality. Thinking it would sound better than the Echo Plus was logical given the Plus model is several years old and this new model boasts more size to house a decent speaker system. Modern audio devices have really stepped up their game with rich sound and deep bass, so I assumed this would perform exceptionally. Unfortunately, I found the audio quality to fall below that of the Echo Plus. I linked all my echo devices so that music will play across all the devices to fill my home. Walking from my living room (where this new Echo lives) into my art studio (where the Echo Plus was moved to) there is an undeniable difference in sound quality, with the Echo Plus clearly being the superior in sound. This new model suffers by not adopting the 360 sound of the Plus and also sounds to have weaker bass in comparison, even after matching the audio settings to the Plus. That's strike three, which is three strikes too many.
My final analysis is that this new Echo isn't much more than a larger Echo Dot with the added benefit of the hub that allows integration with Hue bulbs.
I will be placing my Echo Plus back into the living room and redesignating this new model as an Auxiliary device in another part of my home. I may purchase a better quality external sound system for it, but in any case, Amazon needs to revisit the Echo with more focus on sound than the physical design because I feel some sacrifices were made to make a product look pretty.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Cons:
- it often doesn't understand my voice from nearby and I have to ""shout"" or ""sternly"" give commands
- the volume up or down doesn't always take affect and you have to repeat the command
- the sound now started to get crackly and play static feedback with it
- has started to ""ignore me"" and it will ligt up blue, i will say ""play jazz music"" and it doesn't do anything
- i have a dot in a room nearby (but not close), and the dot will often pick up my voice in the enxt room, even though i am on the sofa sitting directly next to the hub one and the hub will not respond

update on review:
amazon customer service did try to help. they are sending me a replacement one to see if it is a hardware issue on this specific device that i got. crossing fingers the new one is better.
i did speak with the rep about the difference in amazon plus. vs. studio vs. 4th gen
interesting to me that the echo plus 2 are still more expensive than the new 4th gen even though they are ""older"" technology.
i suspect the plus 2 have the kinks worked out, wish the price would drop.
and maybe some of these issues with my new 4th gen device are teething issues with it being a ""new and improved"" design and inner-parts
.

Echo Dot can heat BUT no air conditioning!!!! If you want COOL on (that's what Amazon calls it) you have to turn it on your self. What good is an Echo Dot if I have to physically turn Cool on myself?

To Echo Dot: Alexa, Fire TV on...there is more than...To Echo Dot Alexa, I have ONE Fire TV!

To Echo Dot: Alexa, I have feedback, Fire TV and Television ARE TWO SEPARATE, INDIVIDUAL DEVICES!!!!! They are not the same!

I have one large Dot, two small Echo Dots, my smart phone, and a Fire TV Omni, 4 smart plugs, and 14 smart lightbulbs all tied together through the Echo Dots.

Alexa, tune to KOAA...I don't know....Alexa, tune to 5.1...I don't know...Alexa, guide...then I have to tune the station in myself

Why does either the baby Echo Dot or the big Dot respond when I am speaking to the Fire TV Omni?

And why does this baby Echo Dot not respond when spoken to? Most of the time the big Dot in the kitchen responds even when I am a room away near this baby Echo Dot.

What I really like about the 2 baby Dots is that they display the time as well as the name of the song with the artist.

I have all the room groups set up and have names for specific speaker groups but this crap happens all the time. So much for “smart” devices,” these are freaking dumb and not very good at detecting which speaker or room you’re giving commands from.

Listening to music is nice. But this Echo has had issues with ""listening"" and following directions almost since the beginning. Won't turn off when directed and have to resort to unplugging it, often. You'll set timers, they'll get lost & never go off. Or when they do go off, you can't get the alarm to stop.

Honestly, I've owned this Dot Gen 4, the Echo Gen 4, the Echo Studio and none are really giving me what a good amp, good speakers do. A single source, stereo, even 360 degree, it just isn't happening with any Echo, Hype.Just ok sound, connectivity if not easily paired or set up, an Echo may fit your needs. Or your childs. Setting up multiple Echos for stereo pairs, the message I get, ""this device is not compatible, the proceed further ""next"", grayed out. With the Echo or the Echo Studio. But perhaps that's just me.

UPDATE: HERE'S WHY I COULDN'T SET UP STEREO PAIRS between an Echo and my Studio. After a very polite and in one way helpful call(helped me set up a temp sensor Routine) with a very knowledgable Amazon tech support(thanks Chris L) about connecting Echos, Echo Studio in stereo pairs,
""ONLY ALLOWS STEREO PAIRS OF LIKE DEVICES"". MEANING: NOT AN ECHO AND A STUDIO. NOT AN ECHO DOT AND AN ECHO. NOT AN ECHO STUDIO WITH AN ECHO.... LIKE DEVICES, EXACTLY. YOU CAN SET UP MULTI ROOM DEVICES THAT WILL THEN PLAY TOGETHER, NOT IN STEREO PAIRS.
I'm told.
WHAAAAAAT?????
Temperature Sensor- a big reason to buy but it just doesn't perform, react to changes in temp fast enough to make this feature worth while. The sensor being ""in"" the Echo enclosure is heavily influenced by the enclosure temp itself(and everything inside). A big/rapid change in temp? the enclosure keeps the Echo from implementing in real time. Have a heater connected? Think this is great to turn on/off by temp? Very slow to respond to either a temp drop in the room(then it turns on the heater in a created routine) and then responds very slowly to turn the heater off when ""off"" routine temp is reached. Seems to me this is a case of an external temp sensor, not in the Echo enclosure would work much better. I tried it, just toooo slow to respond and I deleted the routines.",2.0 out of 5 stars

More times than not you have to repeat command 3,4 or 5 times. also alexa will say she is having trouble connecting to the internet . the system keeps deleting smart plugs and light bulbs. and you will be on the phone a lot reporting problems and they will have you unplugging , restarting and doing a whole re-set up of all the devices. and nothing correct the problems. So then the expedite it to the I.T. dept.

David,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2021","Bought this to replace a 1st Gen Echo and was really disappointed. The sound quality was worse and had a hollow tone. You could correct a little with the app but never got to the quality of the original we had.

Another big factor for our change was the mic on our 1st gen just wasn’t as responsive after all these years and we found ourselves always yelling at Alexa. However, when we set up this new Gen 4 Echo we found it performed worse than the original. So much so, that the Gen 4 sphere would ignore our commands while the G1 which we moved to a further room away was still picking up our commands. I’d fault a good bit of this to placement location of the two units, as it’s a little close to a tv but I’m doing an apples to apples comparison of the two different units in the same spot under the same lifestyle home conditions. We gave it about 14 days of testing before we gave up and decided to return.

Also, I’m not sure the spherical design is really any better stylistically or practically. It seems to take up more space and having the light ring on the bottom means you can’t really tell when Alexa is actually hearing your commands. We ended up repeating ourselves quite often because she just wasn’t acknowledging we were speaking to her. Plus from a volume control standpoint the ring can no longer provide a visual queue as you can’t see all the way around the sphere. Obviously you can ask Alexa what her setting is volume wise, but sometimes you just want to see.

Lastly, we bought a blue one. It’s neat that it’s not black like all of our other echoes and dots. But, the exact shade of blue actually wasn’t that appealing once we had it in our house. It’s almost like they couldn’t decide which shade of blue to use so they just went with blah in the end.

Biggest Pro: I like the idea of the new colors.

Biggest Cons: sound quality and mic sensitivity

Extra note - we did link it with the multi room sound playback and that feature was easy enough to set up and integrated our G1 Echo with this G4 Echo seamlessly. It also pointed out more sound flaws though as the G1 outperformed in the end with providing a more dynamic and balanced room filling sound.",2.0 out of 5 stars

PeacefulSeraph,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2022","Where to even start... this is the worst Echo device I own.

I have several generations of dots that have better sound & can hear me without me having to yell... I bought this to replace my original Echo, which was taller but (to me at least) more aesthetically pleasing all around.

But the look of it is besides the point... it rarely recognizes what I have to say which never happened on any other device, & I have to yell at it- because talking to it induces ""whisper mode"" which I can say from other echo devices is usually because you are ACTUALLY whispering to the device.

It's a complete failure on sound quality when playing music... and to add insult to injury, they may call the device color ""glacier white"" but it's more a ""dirty snow grey""... now onto a less significant, but equally annoying detail... why did they make this round? It's wider than my old Echo, & the material just collects dust... the whole device is truly a heinous monstrosity I can't wait to be rid of if/when they come out with another version that is no longer this shape or low quality.

The only reason this gets 2 stars is because I like the thermostat feature & I got it on sale so I can't complain about its price (other than it's not worth sale price let alone full price)... I honestly don't know why Amazon created this, & I hope they go back to a device that has better sound quality and voice recognition instead of focusing on a design that is ultimately superfluous at the end of the day (not to give permission to make it any uglier, but please prioritize function over form next time!)",2.0 out of 5 stars

Impossible to sign in to a hotel wifi that has its own sign in screen.

Children like talking to alexa.
The worst is setting up a new wifi, amazon should really improve this.

It is not possible to actually modify the sound very much with the controls, no matter how you set the bass, midrange, and treble. Even with the bass on it’s lowest setting, it is still muddy and lame. Absolutely no crispness. I’ve had the controls all over the place, and it’s always lousy. I also have an echo Dot, and without any question, the sound is better and more balanced on the Dot, it is understandable and clear; there is not much bass on the Dot, and it’s a little tiny thing, but the sound is way better because it’s not boomy and voices are clean and crisp. I have to admit. I am an older fellow, I’m used to great fidelity from great speakers and great amps, things that are hard and expensive to get today.

Crutnacker,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2023","I bought two speakers with the hope of pairing them for stereo. When you pair them, they sound pretty good, but if you're familiar with certain songs, you will eventually realize they sound a bit off. THat happened for me on Beatles Revolution, which has a very distinct separation of instruments on left and right channels. Instead of being separated, one channel duplicated the sound in the other channel (but not vice versa). This is a clear problem with software that according to forums has existed since 2018 at least, and still persists to this day. Doing a stereo test track on the devices confirms it's a problem. Since the stereo on their echo show devices appears to be accurate, I suspect it's either a glitch or outright failure in the code used to separate the signals in pairing.

The speakers sound good for the price, but if you want true stereo, you're better off buying a decent pair of speakers or buying a different device.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Stephanie,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2022","It’s a cool concept and I don’t know if mine is defective but it loses connection a lot. I know it’s not my internet because all of my other devices are fine. It will also just randomly crank up my music with no rhyme or reason. I checked and there’s no set schedule or routine for it to do that, it just does it. It gets what I say a lot of the time but sometimes I’ll say something crystal clear and it will not understand, even through it’s a direction I’ve given it before without issue. Sometimes it randomly shuts off but my phone app shows it’s connected and there’s nothing in the settings or routine to make it do that. The routines you can set only allow one “skill” per routine which is inconvenient. It could definitely use a lot of improvement and a cool feature would be options for different celebrity voices (like how WAZE does), not having to ask Alexa to ask a specific celebrity something to get their voice. It would also be nice if, not only would it turn on my tv by voice, but if it would also launch sling or paramount + or discovery + by voice too. Accents, celebrity voices, better connectivity, more consistency, and the ability to search all of your streaming services for a specific movie or show you ask for, as well as record them if you’d ask it to would make it worth the price. As it is, kind of a rip off. If you really want one, get the dot. The price is more inline with what you get. The concept is great but a lot of room for improvement.",2.0 out of 5 stars

2. Preferred speaker: The Alexa service seems to auto pick the preferred speaker between the two devices by itself. If I ask my Echo to play music, it plays on my old Echo plus and sometimes it's the other way around.
3. Features are meh: The device has a temp sensor built-in but but there is no way to get the reading through Alexa.

It will disconnect and will connect back up again but it won't send the audio to the speaker again till you delete the pairing and pair again.

John,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2021","I like the way it sounds. I really do. But the problem is, I can't even use it to listen to music at all. The problem traces back to very poor voice recognition.

While you're playing music through the device, you may want to ask Alexa to control your home. But it can't hear you use the wake word at all. So I chose to have it connect to my old Creative Bluetooth speaker, which I have been using with Alexa since my old 2nd gen Echo dot from years ago. Sad really.

But even with that Bluetooth speaker, the recognition of the wake word is so unstable. Sometimes I'm having a conversation on the phone or have the TV on (quite a bit of yards away at the opposite side of the room actually), it thinks it heard ""Alexa"", when really no one and nothing said it. I have no idea.

Meanwhile, when I actually want to trigger it and I'm actually saying ""Alexa"", it's a hit or miss; either it won't react and I'll have to say it two or three more times, or it will actually work. It works about half the time. When it doesn't work, sometimes I have to scream ""Alexa"" louder and louder just to trigger the wake word. Sometimes it has to be so loud that my throat gets sore just from screaming the wake word.

And in my experience, these frustrations I'm having are unique to this Echo 4th generation. I've also owned and used the Echo Dot 2nd Generation (which sounds awful on its own but see my comment about Bluetooth speaker above), and the Echo Dot 3rd Generation. Personally, I wish I just stuck with the Echo Dot 3rd Generation. At least that one only got mistriggered (is that a word? Lol) whenever there was an Alexa ad on the TV.

Carmen,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2021","I got these a few years ago for surround sound for my tv. They worked ok for a month or so and would randomly disconnect so I stopped using them for that purpose and used them for multi room sound. It was fine for a while and they would disconnect occasionally but now they won't connect at all. I spent 2 hours trying to fix the issue myself before contacting support then nearly 2 more hours with support and still no resolution. They said they would contact me in 5-7 business days so who knows...

My other issues with the devices are that they never seem to understand anything I say. I had the old echo dots and had very few issues with them understanding me. One would assume the newer more expensive devices would work better, right? with these I commonly get the response ""I'm sorry, I didn't get that"" or ""something went wrong."" My favorite was when I asked to turn the lights down and Alexa played me the song Mr Grinch. When I ask to adjust the thermostat she will either play some random song or tell me that I'm 2.2 miles from the city I live in. Other voice commands give equally random results.

Also, one of my devices started reporting the room temperature in °C instead of °F out of the blue one day. If I asked for the outside temp or the other rooms temp, it would respond in °F, but the room I was in was °C. I spent 2 hours with support resetting the device, adjusting settings and restarting the router before giving up and swapping that device for one in another room.

AZ Desert Gator,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2021","I had essentially the same problems with the prior generation full sized echo with hub, and decided to return it for a refund. I've had this unit for more than 6 months, but just now getting tired of it's deficiencies and decided to write a review. First off, the smart hub features seem to work fine. My issues are with voice recognition and audio quality. It's pretty crappy.

I have a same generation Echo Dot across the room. Often if I'm standing immediately next to this larger Echo hub and say something to it, it doesn't respond, but the one 20 feet away across the room does. Sometimes I can make 2 back-to-back requests, standing next to the unit with my mouth facing it, and with the same voice volume - one of the requests will be answered by it and the other will be answered from the unit 20 feet away.

I do not believe it is simply ""confusion"" between the two units. Before I had the Dot, I would have experienced the hub unit simply not responding to my voice at all.

Audio quality is terrible - I have a house full of Echo's including a 1st generation Echo. It is very muffled, like if you turned up bass to the max, and treble to the min. It's almost as if it simply doesn't produce ANY high frequencies. My same generation Echo dot, and 1st generation Echo sound FAR better.

Howard W,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2022","This is the worst purchase I ever made. Was having difficulty with my gen 1 and gen 2 Echo with hub. The gen 1 had no hub but worked the gen 2 had difficulty with recognizing speech and the sound was a bit tinny so I wanted an upgrade and got the gen 4 echo with 2 dot combo. The speech recognition is almost non existent the sound quality is muffled like if you covered it with a towel. We have to scream at the echo to get it to respond and 9 times out of 10 the old gen 2 will respond from 3 rooms away while the new gen 4, 1 foot away does nothing. We set it up between our recliners in the living room on a stand that is clear of obstacles and put the echo at head height when we are seated. I don't know how we could possibly make the conditions any better for the device to hear us. We were also sold a used unit without our knowledge or consent. It was still registered and paired with the previous owner from Rochester NY, and still had a unique name assigned to it from said owner. It's bad enough I'm buying Chinese junk that spies on me but I would never buy USED Chinese junk with the previous owners returned problems still attached to it.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Putzer,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2021","We bought the echo about 6 months ago. We were impressed with the sound quality of the echo, the depth of sound is pretty good.
However! The quality of the sound is moot when you can’t get the device to actually play music. This is the most glitchy device I have ever purchased. We’ve had issues from the beginning. I would have to reconnect it to the wifi almost daily, sometimes restarting my router just to get the stupid thing to reconnect, even though every other device in the home was connected.
Ok, maybe there was something wrong with the signal of our router, so we purchased google routers and placed them all over our house to broadcast the signal better. I guess that worked because we haven’t had Alexa tell us she’s not connected to the internet anymore. But NOW she just won’t play music whenever she doesn’t feel like doing it. In order to get the echo play music nowadays we have to unplug it for a minute and then plug it back in and that will last for a while. If we have music playing in the background for a couple of hours, you can tell when it needs to be unplugged and plugged back in because it will just decide to stop playing music for no reason.
Would have returned it right away and given it one star if the sound quality was garbage. But my husband is willing to put up with it because while it’s working, after all the screwballing around to get it to work, it sounds great.",2.0 out of 5 stars
northwester,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2022","The sound is good, and when it works it’s good. But this thing is so temperamental. When playing music via either Amazon prime, or Apple Music (the source does not matter), it will just stop. Sometimes several minutes in, sometime 40 seconds into the first song. It’s not an internet issue as other devices are fine, and there is no internet drop. I’ve also had it just start playing one song on loop. I also have it connected to fire TV so I can watch tv with sound coming out of the echo. It works, but again there are so many bugs. Often the remote becomes i operative and echo becomes unresponsive. Sometimes randomly their is just no sound and instead fire tv plays sound out of the tv speakers instead. And then randomly, echo will turn the tv on, when nothing is playing or requested. It’s so buggy that I’m about to throw it away. I have some other Alexa devices, Including a really early version before the echo dots (without built in speaker). One is in my garage and I have it plugged into an old stereo for sound. It works perfectly, streaming same music sources. So it’s not an internet connection issue. This echo is just not good software. These issues are all over google, and the answer is simply to have to unplug it and wait to reconnect to reset it. Doing this several times a day is not acceptable.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Lucy,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2020","I wanted a major competitor's version of this, but because that one didn't even offer Bluetooth and was about 230 more...so, after hearing an Echo (I think the one I heard was from earlier 2019..it was tall), I decided to buy one. Firstly, though the sound is mediocre for its price point, it does not sound as great as the early 2019 one I heard. This one sounds ok in a large bedroom, but fails miserably in a smaller bedroom (my craft room). There, it, literally, sounds like what it is...a small basic Bluetooth speaker. Very treble! I turned it off an connected my iPad back up to the Bluetooth stereo system instead. I am going to keep it as it does integrate SiriusXM amongst others, but it will remain in the larger bedroom. Setup was not terribly fun. My daughter has a dot (those sound worse than this one) and anytime I told Alexa to do something, it went on HER echo...even though we were on opposite ends of the house. I think this is made more to be used as a system throughout the house versus a more individual toy. I think I got it sorted out now, but there are still issues. It doesn't always respond and it does go out. I've read it's a WiFi issue, but nothing else goes out when the echo goes out. My daughter loves hers (she's 16), but she's addicted to music subscription services. Would I buy it if I had to again? Probably not. I'm not too much into this smarthome technology. I'm more into sound quality...if the competitor's had Bluetooth, it'd be sitting here instead of the Echo.",2.0 out of 5 stars

William Stevens,"Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2022","20220508. This is an Alexa device, but it seems to have trouble recognizing when you are talking to it. I've found I have to pause after saying Alexa before I add the instruction. Even then, it often takes 4 or 5 tries to get the blue ring to light up. This behavior is consistent with both of these Echos, and with the larger version (I bought the three pack).

I don't know what Amazon is doing under the covers, but I will say I've noticed a general degrading in voice recognition on other Echos, especially on the Echo Show. My guess is they have been dorking with the OS and have added too many ""features"" so that the CPU is overwhelmed and not as responsive as it once was.

For example, I am now queried on a regular basis to give a rating to products I bought, and reminded that consumables I've purchased in the past might be running out. I don't need that stuff, and I would far prefer to have an Echo that is responsive and less of an ad machine for Amazon.

Leonardo S.

SO, tell me why these 4th generation echo speakers have the worst mic you can think of, we are in the same space, it's response time its so slow (yes, the settings are correct) and more than anything, and the most annoying of it all, sometimes it'll just blantly ignore you, or you'll have to be like A L E X A to get a response, its so dissapointing, specially cause voice commands help a lot with having a new born, instead of helping it made it mode stressful.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Mark,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2021","The sound quality is rather good. The bass is heavy, which is good for some music, but not videos.

I do feel that I have to yell the command name for it to hear me. This is odd as my first gen echo dot will hear me whisper it's name. I have tested them in the same spot and this device does not recognize as well as previous models.

It does not tether to older alexas ( not a minus just extra information). Another thing I have noticed, is that when bluetooth paired with a fire stick; apps like hulu and Netflix seem to crash.

This was bought for me as a gift and the pictures are somewhat misleading as they do not show a cord in many of them. This lead to the belief that it had an internal battery that allowed it to be moved between rooms. (Which would have been a great selling point). This device does not have an internal battery. In fact the charge cable it comes with is short, so keep that in mind when thinking about where you wish to place it. I have a first gen alexa and the cable that came with it is longer.

A note for Amazon, when this device was first advertised, it showd a globe pattern. When I saw that, I wanted this device. I was disappointed that there was no actual globe/map print available. I feel that whoever designed that add had a great idea that was never produced into reality. To add on, it would have been nice to have the clock face added to this as well.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Michael Pawlowski,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2022","I bought this because of the temperature sensor.

The first one I received was constantly reading wrong by a few degrees, but was inconsistent - sometimes it was correct, sometimes it was high by as many as 6 degrees Fahrenheit, sometimes it was low by a degree or two. I know this both by the feel of the room temperature and because I placed a digital thermometer six inches from the device. Because of this inconsistency, I couldn't even just manually include an offset for my purposes (a window AC unit plugged into an IoT plug with automations to turn it on/off based on the temperature reading off the sensor).

Thinking the first one was just a defective unit, I was sent a replacement... which has the exact same issue. Clearly the sensor in this generation is just flawed and therefore should not be purchased if you plan to use the temperature readings for anything other than a very rough estimate.

Everything else about the device works as-expected and it is a very cool looking unit.

If I hadn't bought this specifically for the temperature sensor, I'd probably have given it four stars. Will update this review if the readings are fixed via software update (although I image they are due to hardware issues).",2.0 out of 5 stars

I'm also super frustrated that podcast can't be fast-forwarded to specific time within the podcast.

I tried to buy an adapter to put it on the wall cuz I hate how much space it takes on surfaces, and of course I ended up with a dot wall adapter for the echo instead of this size. I just wish they would call it a different name or a different induration or something to make it identifiable without me having to feel like an expert at the dimensions of each of the objects. I found it really irritating that the cord for the power had been shortened almost a foot, and I couldn't put this new echo in the same location as my old Echo because they switch the power integration port to an AUX port instead of whatever it was before.

T. Davis,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2021","I replaced my old Pringles-can Echos with the new ball-style, and while they may look better and resist getting knocked over by my cat, they seem to have gotten worse at basic things like language comprehension. If I listen to the same 3 podcasts weekly, and I ask to hear the latest episode of one of those podcasts, how can Alexa constantly misunderstand and play some obscure podcast I've never heard before? Other times, I ask the Echo to do something basic like telling me the time, the blue light comes on for a second, but Alexa never says or does anything, not even ""Sorry, I didn't understand you."" The old Echos never did that.

The real kicker, though, is the execrable ""by the way"" feature, which constantly asks me if I want to use some ability that I'm not interested in. I find myself actually getting mad and swearing at Alexa when she asks me if I want to try some inane, useless skill. If anyone at Amazon is actually listening to what I say to my Echo, then I apologize for my salty language.

Linda,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2021","First impression: why on earth would Amazon pair a white power cord to a black speaker?? At the very least, give customers a cord color option; for me, my intended placement was a black granite counter btwn my kitchen and family rm, so no opportunity to conceal. Why should I have to pay $20-30 extra for a color-matched cord? Never has been an issue for past Echo devices, of which I have MANY... 14 I think

Second: I've grown fond of the cylinder shape, not a fan of this spherical shape; it might make sense if the sound was not front-firing, but sadly is. I could grow accustomed to that if not for the white cord, which Hubby said he could paint, but why should that even need to be a consideration? Besides, my plan was to add a 2nd one as well and, if they failed, alterations would negate the ability to return

Lastly: I have 2 charcoal Gen 3 Echos on that same counter; they have black cords, sound really grea! and look great. The last straw was that the sound quality from this 4th Gen was underwhelming; if it was supposed to be a big improvement over the Gen 3s, they definitely missed the mark and it's surely not worth the sacrifices I'd make in appearance.

J. Pearson,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2021","The sound quality on these new fourth generation Echo speakers is horrible compared with the previous generation Echo speakers—all of them. What happened?

I am so disappointed. I worked with Amazon tech-support, and even they said there must be something wrong, so they processed a return and shipped me a new set and they are equally horrible. I have read independent reviews on third-party websites, and watched them on YouTube, where reviewerss are saying Generation 4 is a total fail. I sure hope the fifth generation will go back to the sound quality of previous generations.

I have had many speakers from every generation going back to the first generation (which ironically, was one of the best sounding speakers they made).

Also, when you pair these fourth generation Echo speakers with a Fire TV or Fire TV stick, they are somewhat acceptable on the trailers and previews, since the volume of those, same with commercials, is so artificially boosted, (though the speakers are still disappointingly soft and poor quality), but the minute you start the actual show or movie, the sound instantly becomes so quiet that I would equate it to about a volume level 4 on previous generations.

Echo Dot is a good device. It produces a decent sound and recognizes my commands without any problem. And it is convenient and funny. One of the reasons I purchased the Echo was to play songs without using my computer or CD or mp3 player or phone. However, when I asked Alexa to play a particular song, for example Girl by the Beatles, Alexa replied that I have to sign up for a $3.99 per month account and played some other random song.

I never expected any of these products to actually regress though as their technology allegedly has improved continously. Id say after owning for a month or so im sitting at about a 70% hit rate when it comes to this advice recognizing it's name and and switching into a phase waiting for a command. Not sure what it is either, I've walked right up to and practically yelled ""ALEXA"" (and while I was frustrated I was sure to very clear spoken words) and yet it still didn't respond.
I'm really hoping this is a software fix they can push out or I wouldn't hesitate to take this down to 1 star.",2.0 out of 5 stars

All of my other echo devices are working just fine. Set up was not simple. I don't notice a huge improvement in sound over my old echo, and this one takes up much more room. I was planning on upgrading to this device in each room, not any more. Now this echo is going back in its box and live in a closet.",2.0 out of 5 stars
AmazonShopper,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2021","I have multiple echo devices and in general think they're great. I was disappointed a bit that this 4th gen device was not as good at recognizing its wake word ('Alexa'), as my older echo devices. With the 4th generation device I have to be very careful to directly face the unit and enunciate when using the wake word. My older units do not require this.

(FWIW - I've altered the positioning of this 4th gen device a few times to ensure it wasn't some sort of audio bouncing that was the issue. The unit performs the same regardless of its location.)

Also, unlike my older devices, this 4th generation Echo seems to often just not respond if it cannot answer or properly interpret a voice command/request. I can see the wake word activates the unit but then it does not respond to commands it has trouble with. I have mixed feelings about this. I don't miss the occasional 'I did not understand that request' (paraphrasing the response older Echo devices used.) but at the same time really dislike the device just going silent as though nothing had been said - and forcing me to wake it again.

To be clear - the issues with this 4th generation device are truly minor.
I remain a big fan of echo devices and Alexa in general.

mpv,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2022","After having use this device for about a year it stopped connecting to Amazon servers. After several hours of attempting the various fixes shown on the web to reconnect Internet, I contacted Amazon the following day and discovered that Amazon had without notice or consent transferred my device serial number to an unrelated persons account making the device unusable for me. Over the past several days I have tried to get a response to fix this or simply send a new device but Amazon has yet to contact me back with a solution. Obviously that’s the problem because it makes the device completely unusable. But it also raises legitimate security and privacy concerns about how a device could be transferred to another account and why there was no process for providing notification and consent to approve such transfer. This seems to be a serious problem, that concerns me given that I have numerous Amazon devices.

I encourage other customers to ask questions regarding their security and ability to protect the devices from being transferred before they purchase. I will update if Amazon solves this problem and identifies how it happened.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Susan H,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","I purchased a 4th gen Echo dot, but meant to purchase a 4th gen Echo. A few days later, there was a price drop on the 4th gen Echo, so I bought one and compared them.
First, I should've realized the price dropped for a reason... the reviews which state that the Echo mic is bad are so true. I have to speak so loud (even when no other sounds in the room), I can be heard two rooms away.
When Alexa does respond, there's a serious lag and the volume temporarily decreases (long enough that I thought I'd accidentally asked Alexa to lower the volume) only to realize this happens every time I ask Alexa anything.
The Echo sound is relatively full. However, I prefer the midrange of the Echo dot.
I don't care for either device as a single speaker so I tried to pair the Echo and the Echo dot.
What?? Each speaker pairs individually with FireTV, smart light bulbs, etc., but an Echo and Echo dot will only work together for music and, possibly, audio books.
They CAN'T BE PAIRED together for stero listening with, e.g., FireTV. I researched this to ensure I wasn't missing something and all web results verified this issue. Please let me know if I'm wrong!

Cesar Diaz,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2021","The sound and look of the speaker is great however as mentioned in other reviews, the microphone is really bad, it literally SUCKS!!! I bought 2 echos, one for my living room and another for my bedroom, both sit at about 5-6 ft away from where I regularly speak to them from and when they are not reproducing anything I have a hard time getting them to hear me. Not to mention when the music is on, especially on high volume, you literally have to SCREAM to have a possibility of them hearing you. This is both with the dot and echo 4th gen, for comparison I have 3rd gen echo dots, echo show 5 and echo flex, needless to say they all hear me waaaaay easier, to give an idea of this: I have an echo flex out in my hallway outside of my bedroom and sometimes it hears me before the echo in the room, despite it being easily an additional 5ft away with walls in the way. It's very disappointing that they downgraded the microphones on these for whatever the reason, especially because one of it's main features to sell is you being able to communicate through voice, for this reason I have to give it a 2 star rating regardless of all it's pros.

long story short: this is not better, just more expensive. Save your money. Go for the previous gen. Half the price and pick up our voices before this one does....

I DO NOT RECOMMEND!
- doesnt recognize / hear well (no better than gen 1 and 3 if not worse)
- microphone seems even more directional... an issue since we place it in the middle but unless you talk AT it or yell... well you just have to yell
- sound quality is not great. I dont use alexa for music and I surely will not with this thing (dont listen the reviews of pcmag etc... bs... this thing is terrible)
- WHITE cable? For a black alexa? Why?... so it sticks out?
- the ball shape - it is not good looking and it makes the thing stick out even more when i need it to melt in the background. Let’s face it: it s not a piece of art so the quieter it is visually, the better.

Bottom line is it s not an upgrade. It’s the same product as before, more expensive, uglier. We are disappointed they haven’t improved the microphone.

William T. Conrad,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2021","Heavy on the bass with next to no treble. The mic, as with all Echo devices are horrible. The noise cancelation and ability to block its own sound are laughable.

Edit 5/30/2021: I got a call within 8 minutes of posting this review. I was shocked but it was customer service to address my concerns. That level of Customer Care is unheard of and for that reason alone I would recommend using the Alexa devices. As for their tips; they showed me my area of lack of knowledge and how to correct it. In the app you can adjust the Bass, Mid, and Treble I didn't know that. Having made this changes the sound is far better. For the mic they had me remove and resync the devices. This shad had a somewhat positive result but it is still to early to be 100% sure. I would say accuracy has gone up 50% but still not fully there. I hope this can be figured out further with software updates. I will update this again in a few months to see if it has changed.

Thomas,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2021","QUICK SUMMARY:
---------------------------
The 4th generation Amazon Echo brings welcome upgrades from previous generations. The device features a Zigbee smart hub, improved sound reproduction, and a temperature sensor. Alexa integration works as expected. I would recommend the 4th gen Echo to those who are in the market for their first Alexa device and who listen to music often at a casual level. I would not recommend this as an upgrade for those with previous generation Echo devices if they are functioning normally, or for those expecting a high-end audiophile experience.

PREFACE:
---------------------------
I have owned the 4th generation Amazon Echo for 9 months and use it daily. I upgraded from a 1st generation Amazon Echo. As part of a Prime Echo trade-in promotion, I was able to purchase this for $25 off the $99 MSRP.

Tasks I utilize Echo for:
---------------------------
• (Daily) - Adjusting power/brightness/color of 2 connected LIFX smart bulbs
• (Daily) - Retrieving daily weather forecast information
• (Daily) - Retrieving temperature of the room the Echo is in (room is hotter than the rest of the house)
• (Weekly/Monthly) - Engaging with various media/games (Pandora, Amazon Music, Question of the Day, Jeopardy, etc.)
• (Weekly/Monthly) - General search query for basic information/knowledge

Environment:
---------------------------
The Echo is 3 feet away from where I sit. It’s placed on a table in the corner of a 10x10 room, about 2 inches in front of a (silent) PC tower. It's on a flat, level surface, and is within line-of-sight with no obstacles or materials between myself and it that would hamper its ability to hear me. On the opposite side of the room is a small air purifier at floor level that is always on and set to its lowest setting (40 dB of white noise).

PROS:
---------------------------
• Sound Reproduction: The upward-firing 3” woofer and two, forward-firing 0.8” tweeters push out more sound than expected for a device of this size and price. Bass is surprisingly powerful, covers a lower frequency range than expected (it won't rattle the room like a dedicated subwoofer, however), and is capable of filling small rooms with ease. Treble is clear and crisp without distortion. Mids are pronounced and dynamic, but can be overpowered if bass and treble are simultaneously working hard. Dialogue from movies, videos, and podcasts is clear and feels well-balanced. Casual audio tinkerers will be pleased with additional EQ settings in the Amazon Alexa smartphone app, although audio sounds excellent as-is and adjustments are likely not necessary unless specific listening needs require adjustments.

• Temperature Sensor: This is an odd bonus to me, but a welcome one that I use often. It is self-calibrating, and routines can make use of its readings.

• Line In/Out Audio Jack: There is a 3.5mm jack on the bottom of the device next to the power adapter port which can be toggled to send audio out to another device if you wish to use the Echo with external speakers, or to accept audio if you wish play audio from another device using the Echo’s speakers.

• Build Quality: It feels sturdy and has heft but isn’t burdensome. The fabric mesh that covers the top-half of the sphere is a nice color, the buttons are pleasantly tactile but quiet, and the circular grip on the bottom ensure it won’t slide around while playing music or if gently bumped.

NEUTRALS:
---------------------------
• Response Time: Marketing for this Echo focused heavily on the all-new AZ1 Neural Edge processor at the time of purchase, bragging of faster, smoother, and more natural Alexa voice interaction performance and processing times. The marketing was heavy, and over-emphasized what is an unnoticeable difference; there is, at best, perhaps fractions of a second saved compared to the 1st gen Echo, but it’s case-by-case. In most cases, the processing time is the same.

• Alexa Features/Performance: Largely unchanged compared to previous generations due to Alexa being a multi-device AI ecosystem rather than a single, device-specific feature. It does what you expect of Alexa.

CONS:
---------------------------
• Voice Recognition: Bad. The environment outlined above is how I’ve used this Echo since I purchased it. The previous, 1st generation Echo had no issue with white noise, background noise, etc. This 4th generation Echo struggles to pick up my voice if there is any level of white noise, or if I’m speaking to it from more than a few feet away. 90 – 95% of voice interactions require that I repeat myself with increasing volume (sometimes two, three, four or more times) for it to register what I’m saying correctly, if I’m heard at all. Voice commands are constantly misinterpreted (verified by reviewing the history in the app), and wake words are often missed. Voice recognition performance is so poor, I have considered replacing this device altogether with one from a different ecosystem. I shouldn’t need to be just beneath shouting volume to be heard, and I shouldn’t feel constantly inconvenienced by using voice commands versus smartphone apps to control smart home features.

• Temperature Sensor Rate of Refresh: I have found no documentation or answers about how often the temperature sensor is refreshed. However, it often seems like the readings are delayed and take a long time to change, even when there is a noticeable increase/decrease in air temperature as a result of thermostat changes.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Bookwyrm,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2020","Update: Echo can only hear you about 1/2 of the time. Although this 4th gen Echo has some really nice features that we like, her ability to hear you isn't one of them. We can be standing right in front of her, and our Flex in a hallway on the other side of the house hears us and responds way more than she does. Not kidding. How can it, facing in the other direction walls away hear us and she can't? Our first generation Echo hears us 100% of the time, the 4th gen... maybe 1/3. We put her in the room where we are closest to her when speaking, but it doesn't really help much. In taking away the 360 mics and making her so focused in one direction, they lost something vital. SO majorly annoying. She sounds great, though. Just needs a hearing aid.

Original review:
The 4th gen Echo has better sound, a built-in smart hub and lots more bells and whistles than my 1st gen Echo, which is five years old and still going strong. I mainly use my Echo to check the weather, time various cooking projects or dog recesses, set zillions of reminders, answer questions, read Audible books, and play a lot of Spotify. What I REALLY, REALLY wanted Echo to do was to be able to call 911.

Emergency calling: Within a few minutes of getting the Echo out of its box, it was set up for everything but AT&T and 911 calling. That took a bit of walking through instructions, squirreling off to my iPad (ADD for the win), and then back again to finish setting it up. I was able to connect to my AT&T account on the Alexa app very easily, and specify which devices are at what addresses. Most of our devices are at our home, but one of my daughters has her tablet at her other mom’s house. I loved that I could specify that her tablet was there. Now when I call emergency services (well, I hope never to call), they’ll know where we are if we use one of our Amazon devices. Way too cool!

Overall, the sound is better, it has more features, and I really love that I was able to link in calling out on my Amazon devices via my AT&T account. I absolutely love that feature.

Better sound is great, too, because I listen to music a lot. The sound is just richer and more detailed. No, this isn’t a Bang and Olufsen, but it sure sounds nice.

One caveat. The light ring is on the bottom, so if you have this on a crowded surface as I do, it’s harder to see the light ring. If you have yours in a clear area, just ignore that. But for me, I preordered a wall mount. That will get the Echo raised to where we can see the light ring, and it will also clear the bit of space where I had it.

Very pleased with this newest generation of Echo.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Domino72,"Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2021","I bought an Echo 4th gen and an Echo Dot (4th Gen) in a package. I've been using them for 9 months now. These devices do play music from Amazon Prime Music account but the Alexa software is pretty buggy. Example: For months I couldn't get the two paired Echo devices to play Amazon music (or anything else) on Everywhere group. Then recently I was able to get that to work, BUT Alexa would only play one song from Amazon music then shut all devices down. I made sure network connectivity was not the problem. Both Echo devices are paired and connected to the same wi-fi network. My Everywhere Group includes both devices. I could play music all day long on a single device at a time. Today (9/29/2021) I found that if you start initially playing Amazon music on Everywhere, it will shut off all devices after one song, BUT, if you initially start playing NPR/Kuow (from iHeart Radio) on Everywhere, you can then switch to Amazon music and songs will continue to play. This is what I mean by ""buggy"".

Now for the rest. The other Alexa features like Lists, Routines, Chore Chart (blueprint), Task Tracker (blueprint) are so far pretty useless. What I wanted to do was use Alexa to help us (two adults) manage our time, like keep track of chores, with daily reminders, and keep track of tasks lists for each of us. Alexa doesn't seem to be able to use more than a single ""list"" or tracker and it better be for a single person. I created two lists (using Lists & Notes, not Blueprints), one a shopping list, one a to-do list. Alexa had trouble keeping these lists separated, and adding/removing items at least from voice commands. I also tried creating a couple of Skills using Chore Chart blueprint and Task List blueprint. These also did not work for multiple people, and you cannot edit the items without logging into the Blueprints web so it's not very useful for a daily Task List that needs to be dynamic.

Bottom line, it has taken 9 months to get this far. I was willing to put some learning time in, but not have to take a class or hire a technician just to get things working. I find the Echo hardware are adequate speakers for me, but Alexa software is not. Amazon's online documentation is woefully inadequate, difficult to find and very general. I did not try the Help & Feedback from the iOS Alexa app since I find reading documentation on a phone screen difficult. The forums are sometimes helpful if you use suggestions cautiously. I have spent a lot of time trying to get Alexa features working, and my lack of success does not make me happy. I admit my expectations may have been too high.",3.0 out of 5 stars

It reminds me of having more kids around the house. I constantly have to repeat myself to get them to do what I want. Echo turn on the lights. Echo turn on the lights. ECHO TURN ON THE LIGHTS!

I ask it to play music through the house. And sometimes it works great. Other times. One will play. Then I dig into it and paired speakers will switch networks. One will be on one network whole the other will be on guest network. Go through a long drawn out process forcing to go through a reset of device to swith back to network and then it will not pair with the rest. Some will pair others will say not on network.

I feel like I spend hours every week trying to fix these issues only to have them happen again the next week.

I have two echo studios with a fire cube. All of a sudden one will quit playing sound or both will. It is because one of the three decides to swith networks and I have to figure out which one and then I have to go through a whole set up again. Nothing like trying to sit down with my wife to watch a movie and by the time I get it up and running an hour later, she has fallen asleep. My wife hates these things.

I figured. At this point the bugs would have been worked out but that is not the case. I got them knowing there would be issues.

Either it does absolutely nothing and you'll have to repeat yourself, or it'll do something wrong (turn on the wrong lights) or it sometimes will ask you if you wanted something you didn't even say.

Shane Marker,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2024","I have used an echo dot and Bluetooth soundbar for years as a “home theater”. My thoughts were “the full-size echo can’t sound that much better to justify replacing what I have.” After hearing one at a local store, I decided to buy one and try it. So much better for a few reasons: 1) The sound quality is incredible. Better than any of the mid level soundbars I tried. 2) using the soundbar caused a delay when playing music in my everywhere group. The echo immediately solved this problem. 3) The home hub really helped by freeing up my WiFi from the 10+ smart bulbs/sockets/appliances.
I’m disappointed that I waited so long to buy one. I’ll definitely be buying more in the near future. The dots/pops are nice for small areas, but if you have the space. Go for the echo.

Update… I still love the sound, but Alexa, or the support software, it whatever it is, is getting progressively worse. My groups disappear, Bluetooth won’t stay connected, it randomly stops recognizing lights. It’s getting out of hand. This has been going on for more than a month.

Ludwig,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2022","This was a Christmas gift for my 98 year old Grandmother. My wife and i have an earlier echo generation and love it. In my grandmother's case she loves the music, and help with reminders. The problem arose during setup. To create an account for my grandmother's echo it was required she had an email address. She is 98 and does not use the internet nor has an email account. So i elected to include it with my account. All was good until we found out only one device could stream Amazon Music at a time. My grandmother's Echo came with a promotional 6 month Amazon Music Premium feature while my wife and i only use the free Amazon Music with our Prime Account. Suddenly, it became almost a competition where our echo would play one song then request if wanted to move the streaming service to our device. We would have it and then lose it as my Grandmother at her location did the same thing. I called Amazon about the problem and spoke with someone with a heavy Indian accent who claimed they could resolve the problem and after 20 minutes dropped the call. I tried again and got a second Indian representative who was brash, rude, continually talking over me and saying ""just let your 98 year old Grandmother listen to her music!"". Giving up i tried to politely end the call, where the representative asked if there was anything else he could help with..... I was hoping i would get a survey about the call, but instead i got an form email from the rep saying it was a pleasure talking with me and he was glad he could help.... No survey. On the same day this conversation occurred my wife got a charge on her credit card from Amazon for a Prime Membership.

John Miller,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2024","I got two and created a stereo pair which sound great. The Alexa app that ""controls"" them seemingly could not be worse if they tried. So many things you ""can't"" do. For a smart speaker it might as well be connected to an old school amp for how inconveniently it plays radio stations, pandora, etc. I'm almost sure I'm not taking advantage of some features but then again it's almost impossible to find out what they may be and how I would ""control"" them. Also got an Echo Studio to try which complements the stereo pair of echos but it is also very difficult to control. The volume on the studio also pops to 10 at random moments and there's no way to turn it back down without using the buttons. So, not smart. Again, sound is great and better, if only by a small margin, than my discontinued Bose sound touch speakers. It also, doesn't drop out as often as they now do (the main reason to get something new), so I'm stuck. The Studio is going back due to the volume control issue, unfortunately.

InterTube Consumer,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2021","I bought two of these to set up a wireless stereo setup. The bass is insane, to the point where you have to turn it down to hear much of anything else. The midrange is recessed to a nearly objectionable amount, but for the price it's tolerable, I guess.

Amazon must do something with spatial audio because the stereo image on these is also insane. Very nice.

As for the Alexa thing, I already have four other Alexa eavesdroppers. This is more a review of Echo as an audio device and stereo deal. Short version: don't do it.

Linking my two echoes together was easy enough, but one got put in one ""room"" and one unassigned, and after days I can't for the life of me figure out how to get that other Echo into the same ""room"", but it's just a labeling thing. Connecting them in stereo was simple. Then came the issues.

First... these only work in stereo if you stream from an official Amazon(tm) service. That means Amazon music (and probably Prime video). So if you wanted to use these in stereo for TV or YouTube... nope. Doesn't work.

And even using this with Amazon Music... is problematic. I have to connect to the pair twice before they start playing, but I can deal with that. But then the Amazon Music app might reset and then I have zero control of what's playing. The speakers keep going on the playlist, somehow, but the app completely loses any sense of what's going on. So seeing what's playing or skipping songs isn't do-able.

And as a Zigbee hub... well one works great, but Alexa has no sense of common controls like changing light colors in a group (only individually). It's a great piece of hardware stymied by limited software. There's no reason Alexa couldn't crib notes from every other zigbee app out there, and use my wifi network to stream audio data from one Echo to the others when I bluetooth connect to it.

Aisha Cameron,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2023","Too much BASS for me! YES! I have it set as low as possible for BASS and as high as possible for Treble and still the Bass is overwhelming! AND worse yet, when she's paired with Amazon Fire and I'm watching a video while working in the kitchen-- when the movie includes music it's as though this Echo turns up the volume so loud with the Bass notes thumping away even louder than normal, it is unbearable! And apparently I cannot turn the base down any further in the Alexa App! I begin by asking this Echo to turn down the volume since she won't turn down the base any further, then I end up screaming at this Echo in pure frustration! I can't stand it! It is often the same sort of frustration even in newscasts if the speaker has a very deep voice! UGH! None of my original Echos did this exaggeration of the Bass notes! I assume this is a function of the Dolby Audio? Is there a better model that does not include such an exaggerated BASS???.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Alexa is constantly having me repeat my command, Echo 4th's base sounds like a cracked speaker, when I have my music playing on ""All"" one or the other speaker wil either cut off totally or sound like a radio between stations and I had to buy a seperate base for the Echo 4th gen so I could make it mobile. I don't know a lot about technology but this doesn't sound like a problem with my music service. You could not connect the taps so that issue doesn't apply but I LOVED my taps. She seemed to be getting smarter, she never asked me to repeat myself, she was totally mobile right out of the box, you didn't have to disconnect her from her source (while making sure she stays connected to her battery base).

Sound has a little deeper bass, otherwise I like the sound of the Echo Plus 2nd gen better. It does not respond to voice commands as well as the Plus. It is like it cannot hear you as well. Having the illuminated ring at the bottom where you cannot see it is just dumb, unless you have it on a glass shelf above head height. Concerning Echo/Alexa in general, I cannot believe they have not made it any smarter in all these years. Instead, they are putting all their energy into marketing gimmicks. If I say the exact name of a song I want to hear, sometimes it will choose one with a similar name rather than the exact title I requested. Stop doing what you think I want and start doing exactly what I say. You should only play an alternative if I stated a title that does not exist or was not stated correctly. I get ""Hmmm, I dont know the answer to that"" to some pretty simple questions as well. They have it evolved to the knowledgeability of a nine year old and have not evolved it since. I may begin to look at alternatives, as I cannot support this stupidity much longer. In large companies, Marketing typically always has the power over Engineering. I know this, as I am a retired Engineer from a large fortune 50 company. It is apparent that Amazon is the same way. I can hear the debate now... ""It won't work as well that way.

Compared to even the Gen 1 Echo Dot, its comprehension of what you're saying or ability to even hear you on the first try is not nearly as good. Our old Echo Dot could hear us well from the other room, this one doesn't hear us on the first try 60% of time - from only a few feet way!

I purchased this Echo due to its ability to connect with Philips Hue bulbs without a hub. The product is new enough that Amazon tech support does not understand that the Echo 4th generation does not work with Philips Hue bulb model LWB004. I have 2 of them and spent way too long on the phone trying to sort it out. I ended returning my new Echo and getting again with a bundle of 2 new Hue bulbs (Model 453100). Those Hue bulbs worked immediately and easily.

The sound quality is is a step back from the the previous Echo models. Definitely distortion on the maximum volume that is not there in older models.

The size and shape are not as problematic as I thought it would be. It does feel like it will be prone to getting damaged by kids more than the older coffee can version of the Echo design.

In the end though, it is still cheaper than an Echo Dot plus a Philips Hue Hub. And the Echo 4th gen certainly sounds better than an Echo Dot. Additionally, I am one of the people who got burned by Philips shutting off access to the first generation Hub, so I am happy to not be forced into buying another Hub from them.

Keri,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2021","I love Alexa. It might be more accurately described as a love/hate relationship, but at the end of the day, I Adore that spicy bish. I love asking Alexa strange questions or just throwing out song requests or a reminder or timer throughout my day, I utilize the crap out of her! Alexa answers are hit and miss, I do receive a lot of ""Sorry, I don't know that"" but all in all the idea behind Alexa is sound. I have owned at least 1 Echo and an echo dot (if available) since its inception, and continue to be impressed with the utility of it. This generation of Echo has been a real disappointment to me. While Alexa is becoming more fluid in this iteration, in some ways it feels like a rather large step back from its predecessors. Let's talk about this generations audio, shall we? I dislike that when using verbal commands to Alexa for volume up or volume down, it's very basic and uses a 1-10 system. This can be modified using the plus or minus sign on the device itself, or using the Alexa app on phones (which, to its credit, allows for a 1% to 100% sliding scale to get the desired volume). However, if you are like me and want to be able to say ""Alexa, set volume to 22%"" Alexa will set the volume to the nearest 1-10 volume, in this case, it would set the Echo to volume 2. As an audiophile this feels clunky and lacks ease of use I've come to expect from Echo devices. The sound quality is alright, but I miss the 360 degree sound that previous generations gave me. Fourth generation Echo's also lack music clarity, and the bass is not impressive in the least.Next up, the shape, sigh. This 4th generation Echo looks like a crystal ball and takes up more space while also being a lot more noticeable. Perhaps this is intentional, but I prefer the more discreet shape of the 3rd generation. I am not impressed with them doing collaborations with designers like Diane Von Furstenberg when so many more necessary features like better audio quality and the Echo's voice sensitivity are sorely lacking. I'd love to see Amazon do a partnership with a company like Boss, to give us useful upgrades and higher audio quality.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Fire,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2020","I have owned every echo since their inception . And one fact is true ... amazon has done a very good job with making small improvements while keeping the costs down . This latest design is once again a minor improvement on the previous generations I own . The sound has improved a bit . Slightly more bass and treble . Still not a Sonos or a Bose ... but the cost isn’t either . So it’s a compromise . Glad they finally just included the “hub” instead of 2 separate models . The design being a sphere is up for debate . One thing that isn’t ... it’s no longer a omnidirectional speaker . It sends sound where you point it . So unfortunately you can’t bounce the sound off a wall to increase the bass like previous generations . The look ? Meh ... kinda weird . But not a deal breaker . One complaint I have as well as others : the led indicator that lets you know it’s listening is now on the bottom . Terrible placement . You just can’t ever see it ! If it was higher or if it was much brighter perhaps . 2 things that I’m not happy about at all : 1) like others have said ... the microphones are no longer as sensitive as other generations . My older echos almost never miss when I ask a question , even clear across the house . This one ? I very often end up screaming at it , especially when the music is playing . Even when I’m just a few feet away. It seems as though there are either less microphones or the ones on this model are not as discerning. Perhaps a software update in the future will improve this . ( note : I am not alone in my evaluation - others are having the same issue) 2) My biggest dislike ? I purchased 2 black / charcoal echos ... and they give you white power cords with white power blocks ! White ? Seriously ? No doubt this is a cost saving measure so that they include the white ones across the board no matter what you order . But ... they are ugly as Hell ! They do not blend in at all . Hopefully they listen to all of us complaining and change this - as well as swap out our white ones for black ones . Amazon pulled a Henry Ford with the model T .

mike in mass,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2022","What I liked –
Better bass that my original echos
No commercials in my flash briefing
It has a hub just like my studios
Better bluetooth headphone range than my first gen echos,

What I don’t like –
There isn’t any switch in settings for local voice control
It can’t hear as well as my original echos
The sound is in one direction
It changes my bluetooth mesh lightbulbs when I turn them on

Overall it isn’t a bad upgrade for four generations later than my original echos. But it has some flaws.
First it doesn’t seem to have any switch for local voice control. So will the hub work when the internet is
down with my zigbee lights? My studios still control zigbee lights, but not sure if this one can. The new
echo has trouble hearing me, but I think this is due to low power mode, as it has to recover before it can
listen. So I have to often repeat commands. The bass is nice and the sound is in one direction more like
a normal speaker, but I got used to the 360 degree sound, so this seems a little backward to me. The
sound isn’t bad just different. One thing I hate is the interaction with my bluetooth mesh alexa only
bulbs. If I tell it to turn on light 2, it always turns it on at 100% and white. This is different from my
studios which just turn on the light at the current settings. I keep the downstairs light blue and 5%, if I
go downstairs and say to my studio turn on light 2, it is blue and 5%, if I say turn on light 2 to the gen 4
it turns on the light white at 100%.

S. Tracy,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2022","Decided to give these a try. They were on sale for $59.99. Figured it was worth a shot to see just how much better these were versus my Echo 3rd gens.

I have them connected to a Firetv cube with an Echo sub as well (same configuration as was with my 3rd gen Echos).

So the sound quality is slightly better. Not really that superior to the 3rd gens. The system as a whole may have a little more bass but, I don’t feel it’s enough difference to warrant the extra $$$.

Thare they really fall short is volume level. They seem to be quiet. With any background the sound of these just gets swallowed up.

I would expect some real leaps and bounds from a “4th” gen speaker. These aren’t it.

The home hub is okay if you have specific hardware that requires a “hub” but as of this post with over 50 “smart” devices in my home to include a thermostat, I’ve yet to need a “hub”. I feel it’s just more “fluff” and gee wiz gadgetry that’s unneeded.

Also, I feel it’s time (especially with the Firetv cube) to incorporate a true home theater so one can set this up with 4 speakers. The cube could be the center speaker in a 5.1 or 5.2 setup. Give the speakers a little more volume and then we’d have something to write about.

For example, without access to the light levels in the room, you can't really use the motion sensor to control the lamps. You have to limit them to certain times of day so they don't turn on when it is daytime. But then when it storms and the room is dark, the lamps won't light.

ORIGINAL REVIEW 10/23/2020
I was hoping the audio quality of the 4th gen was going to be better than my first gen echo. I listened to them side by side and the don't sound THAT different - not worth the cost of replacement. The new version is louder, has slightly more pronounced bass and fills the room about the same when against the wall. The sound of the new one seems unbalanced. The highs are tinny and overbearing. Mids are understated and the bass is so-so. Overall the sound is top heavy and flat.

Its width takes up a lot more space, about double over the first gen. The buttons on top are kind of difficult to press - they're hard to feel without looking, shaped into small symbols instead of chunky round buttons and not that responsive. The original echo's buttons were easier to navigate without looking.

I don't mind the white cable because it blends in better with the white walls.

If you don't mind having 2 devices, I would suggest going with an echo dot and buying a good quality bluetooth speaker. The flexibility of taking the speaker elsewhere with you and the sound quality will be much better.",3.0 out of 5 stars

To start, make sure your Echo is disconnected from Bluetooth.
A) Launch Alexa App
B) Find Echo Device
C) Device > Status > Device Settings > General > Aux Audio

So, find and select your Echo device using the Amazon Alexa App.
Scroll to the bottom and select Status.
Selecting Status takes you to Device Settings.
Scroll down to General > Aux Audio > Line In or Line Out

Hope this helps anyone else that wants to enjoy of the great sound of the Echo using the Aux In option.

My phone, TV, and I think it must be my rug or something, already knows even what I'm thinking about.

Anyway, I was hoping it could change my TV channels at least, but that involved buying another gizmo. OH --""PREMIUM SOUND"". Not sure what that means but it isn't hifi Bose quality. More like enhance AM radio.

That voice ... annoying, so I changed it. It says you can change the voice, but its only male of female. And they say you can change the wake up name. There are only a couple that you can choose from a list as well. All with multiple syllables, and I want a one syllable name..like JOE... Hey Joe. So it stays Alexa with a male voice.

I love the shape and look, and with the added light at the base, it looks pretty cool. It would be even better if the entire globe radiated soft pastel colors and then jumped bright red when someone is detected at the front video doorbell You could keep the yellow for when a package is delivered by Amazon.

THe jokes are pretty corny. The weather report is great, and it can tell you what temperature is residing at its location. Overall use for TV is great if you have a Fire TV. It wants to go to Fire TV over ROKU or even cable. Changing cable using the Fire TV Blaster is a bit hit or miss. It doesn't respond the same to even the same command to change the channel. Overall using Alexa to control the TV is hit or miss anyway. Much easier to just use the remote.

Another Shopper,"Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2022","I own both the full size Echo 4th, and the Echo Dot 4th with LED Clock. I purchased two of the full size Echo 4th devices to allow for connectivity for Ring Bridge devices, notably a Ring Mailbox Sensor and a Ring Lighting Motion Sensor, both of which require either a Ring Bridge, or a Sidewalk Bridge device. This Echo device is specifically named as a recommendation. I gave it a shot, and both the mailbox sensor and the motion sensor went offline repeatedly, even when placed just a few inches from the Echo 4th Gen unit. Sometimes they came back online on their own. Sometimes they ran their batteries dead trying. I returned one of the sensors thinking I had a bad one and got the same results. When I bought a dedicated Ring Bridge, all the problems went away. Sidewalk Bridge simply isn't working and isn't reliable.

As for the other features, the audio quality when listening to music or just hearing Alexa's voice is very boomy by default. I haven't tried playing with the equalizer, but really, I should be able to get decent quality from default settings.

Voice recognition is hit-or-miss if you're not using Alexa as your wake word. It doesn't seem to matter much if you're facing the unit directly when you speak to it or if you're just somewhere in the room. Recognition is about the same either way, for better or worse.

The unit itself is HUGE, and the audio is comparable to the Echo Dot 4th Gen, so if you're faced with a choice between the two and don't need Sidewalk, I'd recommend the Echo Dot.

Lastly, the surface is covered with cloth, meaning that cleaning it isn't much of an option.

My commands are not recognized very often. When I try to play something from xm it just errors. I have to use my echo show to play on the network I choose. Now it plays fine on the new Echo but it just does not seem to take commands very well. The spanish commands are hit and miss but right on with the echo show.

Overall I am very disappointed with the replacement. If it wasn't for my smart home features I may even consider sending it back till they can get it right. The first and second gen plus is still very cheap and I could just replace it with that from ebay or something.

(update) So tech support reached out to me and was concerned as well. It seems that my Echo Show is less sensitive to commands than the echo plus. The echo plus being more sensitive, would not know how to respond if there was an extra word in the command. As for the Language issue well it worked fine the first time the tech was listening but the second time it would not respond saying it had a limited vocab. They will work on it. Because they were so nice about it I told them I would update my original review to include their exceptional service.",3.0 out of 5 stars

mrklean02,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2020","Okay, so I have had an Echo 1st Gen with hub for about three years now. I also have purchased several Echo Dots in that time. I like how each sounds but I have to admit the Echo 1st Gen with hub sounds great, much better than the Dots. I didn't and don't have a problem with it, it still sounds great and responds great. It sounds so great I had been planning on getting a second one to go in another room for some time. So since I kept seeing the new 4th Gen Echo advertised for around $70 I couldn't pass it up. I read the reviews about having to repeat ""Alexa"" being an issue but I didn't realize how bad it would be until I ran into the problem myself. I have it in my bedroom on my nightstand and you would think that no matter what position you are in it would hear you when you are lying on the bed with the speaker about a foot away. But that's not the case, if you are facing away from the speaker you almost have to yell ""Alexa"", so that your sound bounces off one of the walls, to get a response. And this is the case no matter where you are in the room. You have to face the speaker to get a constant response. I don't have that problem with the 1st Gen speaker. If it only had only happened a couple of times I wouldn't care, but it's constant.

But not all is bad about the speaker. I know that some of the reviews mentioned about it's tone being a little too low. I actually like the sound it puts out. This is far better than my 1st Gen and the Dots. After all the ranting about having to repeat my demands, the sound, at least for me, does make up for it and I do plan on buying another one to get a more stereo effect.

I still don't think that it warrants four or five stars because it is a smart speaker, and if previous generations function better at performing that function, there is definitely room for improvement for this gen.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Steve Bradfield,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2020","Update: I rated this 4 stars, but I'm changing it to 3 for now. I have become increasingly frustrated with it's inability to hear me. Sometimes I have to yell so loud that the bedroom Echo responds instead of the one in the family room. I'm seriously considering returning this one and using my old gen 1 Echo. Either Amazon needs to improve the sensitivity or give us the ability to adjust it ourselves.

I bought this to replace a gen 1 tower. I have several echo devices around the house and liked the old cylinder. I won’t comment on the aesthetics since that is a personal preference, but will say the new design requires a larger footprint on the table. The base is small, but the diameter of the sphere means you can’t put anything close to the bottom of the base. Functionally, the sound quality is much better than the gen 1 device. I appreciate that the new design probably was necessary for that. The new echo is much more directional. This is good if you have it against a wall, but not if it is in the middle of the room. The light ring at the base makes it difficult to see on a low table or if there is something on the table next to it (like a book). I have a lot of trouble seeing if Alexa heard me. Speaking of that...it seems Alexa is aging and has a lot more trouble hearing me than the old one did. I find I have to talk loudly to be heard and with the light ring at the bottom, I have to be in the right position to see if she’s responding. The built in hub was a bonus. I have a hub from years ago, so have not made use of it yet, but will eventually try to retire the hub I have. I like the new device, but will not be replacing any of my gen 3 dots with the new dots. I wish they still sold the gen 3s with the clock. I’ll wait for the next revision and see how I feel about those.",3.0 out of 5 stars

TwoCool,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2021","This seems like it would be a useful, hands-free device, but so far we're not impressed. The AI seems weak and always interested in sending us to some subscription site. The weight of the plug causes the plug to fall out of the wall socket. I assume it's Alexa trying to avoid having to deal with us :) The speaker quality is decent, but not really outstanding. It can get loud, but the bass is dull IMHO and muffles clarity at times.

Anyway, if you like shouting commands at someone repeatedly (maybe you're a drill sergeant or unhappily married), then this might be a diverting toy for you. More seriously, though, if you have restricted mobility or you live alone, then this device could be a real time/effort saver if you have it hooked up to other devices in your home (e.g., lights, tv, wall thermometer). You should be aware that there is a trade off between your privacy and the detail of your personal experience. For example, Alexa will want access to your contacts if you use it for calling folks via your wifi (your internet connection). And, it wasn't so long ago that people were able to hear others' conversations and command history. BTW: This is information you can look up via your Amazon account. So, travel with caution and ask yourself whether voice commands are superior to the discretion of silently typing your searches (which are archived is a cloud unless you disable the feature). I'll update this review once I've had more experience with the device, but right now, it seems that an Apple iPad does pretty much the same things (with Siri) and video availability (though at a much greater cost).",3.0 out of 5 stars

Clearly the replacement one was used, it has a small faded stain on it. The issues I am experiencing involves the voice recognition. I can say its name and it does not respond, sometimes I will have to raised my voice to a yell for it to hear me which does not work well when others are sleeping. Other times, my older generation device in my bedroom responds and there is a wall between me and it. I am sitting aprx 8-10 ft away from the device and it does not hear! Sometimes when I ask it for my notifications, the one in the bedroom answers me thru the wall which of course I can't hear the notification!

Pennang,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2021","General Annoyance - I bought this with the free globe offer - amazon lost it in delivery - there was no way to speak to anyone on their app so I just had to cancel it. BUT Cancelling it was difficult because it mysterious vanished from my recent orders, which seems devious as it was supposed to be a free included item - but I am hoping I am refunded its full price.

PROs
I new I wanted this for Spotify playing so I paid more to get the better speaker, and as I can connect it via bluetooth to my TV Soundbar /Bass it even sounds better. So overall happy but in truth I am no sound expert /musicphile.

CONs
- If you don't have an American accent and you want to set it to yours, you apparently lose functionality in the US but its not clear on what functionality to make it an easy choice.
- I have it announce my Calendar but it does it twice. You can set the reminders to only announce once but it doesn't work for the calendar integration - its really annoying.
- I like to clear up and delete my history - don't see any need for Amazon to have it. But to delete Activity you have to delete each Activity card and its like two taps. Again really annoying.
- I have noticed things mysterious turn themselves on and off since setting this up. Can't tell if it's Alexa or the apps running the connected items to it. I don't see anything in Alexa history to suggest its Alexa and I haven't investigated further. i.e Xbox and lights mysteriously turn on.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Johanna Burtt,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2021","During Prime Day 2021 I finally decided to upgrade all my echo devices. I was still rocking the gen 1 pringles can Alexa and hockey puck echo dots.

Back in the day I heard about how the echo plus and then the 3rd gen still didn’t sound nearly as level or bassy as the first generation echo so I had been abstaining from upgrading for a while. But then the quality of the sound from the 4th gen had been one of the main features I had been hearing about so I finally decided it was time. And honestly on that front as well as the built in zigbee hub it delivers in spades. The 4th gen Echo is more than capable of shaking the entire bookshelf she’s on with just the default audio settings.

However, there is one extremely frustrating aspect to the 4th gen echo, coming from a 1st gen: microphone quality and her ability to recognize when she is being spoken to.

My 1st gen echo was almost too sensitive. She would wake up for anything that even vaguely sounded like “Alexa” at any volume with close to any amount of room noise. I have an oscillating fan in my living room and she could hear me over that and the TV. The new 4th gen will basically refuse to hear me unless I turn the fan off and mute the TV. And when she does recognize that I’m yelling ALEXA at her from 10 feet away, half the time she won’t pick up on the command I speak next. I bought a new echo dot the same day as the full size echo and she has no such problems. I honestly wish I had bought two dots except for the fact that the audio quality on the echo is outstanding.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Lane Goodson,"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2023",It sounds ok! How hard is it to update this thing to not tell you every time you connect to Bluetooth. Because if you forget to turn the device down then it’s blaring at you. If you have a device (iPad pro) connected and want to control the volume from the device you either a) have to go into the Alexa app to turn it up or b) turn it up in the app so you can control it with the device. If the device goes to sleep and you don’t have any audio coming out it disconnects from Bluetooth and then reconnects when you wake the device back up and then lets you know. We don’t need that or at least give us the option to turn that off. Until then I don’t recommend unless you don’t mind that problem.,3.0 out of 5 stars

I keep it in our kitchen and use it daily for music, news and general inquiries. I have also setup some smart switches so I can control lights using voice through Alexa. When I upgraded to smart thermostats I purchased one that has Alexa built in. I noticed recently that the Echo was not interpreting my requests very well and frequently would not play a song after a request. I assumed it was just getting old so decided to upgrade to this latest device that was on sale during Prime days. I assumed there would be a significant improvement in sound quality but it is marginally better. not enough to justify replacement. I find I need to yell at this echo for it to recognize my voice, the old one worked much better. Lastly, I moved my old 2nd gen echo into the upstairs bedroom thinking I could play music up there but Alexa does not support that. Appears you need to have an individual Amazon account for each device if you want to have it play Spotify. I have a Spotify family account and have no interest in paying for Amazon music premium as well.

D. Krajewski,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2021","I bought three of these around the release and have regretted the purchase. We have a total of 12 Echos, Echo Shows, & Echo Dots placed throughout our home and these are the worst when it comes to communication. 2 of them replaced Echo 3rd Gens, and another was an add on to an existing TV (with 4k firestick) for better sound and since adding them to our system, we have had nothing but problems with the wrong device answering us. None of the locations changed, these were just swapped in. We noticed that these ALL LAG, and must not have the same speaker configuration as the Echo 3rd Gens because Echos two rooms away will now answer before these devices will.
They do sound GREAT when they work properly, but because we already had a functioning system throughout our house, and knew the capabilities, these were/are a HUGE let down.
I have tried updating them to see if that helps, but it has not.
As a stand alone device these might be great, but to a family that has been using Alexas since the beginning and keeps adding for functionality around the home, we find them more of a nuisance than a help. We end up yelling at poor Alexa more than it's worth.
I will note also, one is being used and is hard wired into my work from home computer, and that one lags even more... I notice when I unplug the AUX cable it seems to pick up speed, but when it is plugged in via the AUX cable to my PC it lags and is very slow to respond which in turn has the wrong device answering most times.
It has all become more frustrating than helpful. Hoping that an update can help solve this matter in the future.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Placeholder,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2022","Purchased this because I could not find a Bluetooth speaker to work with my tv that wasn't overly expensive. I like the sphere shape and it is a slightly heavy solid device (drop it on your foot and it'll hurt) which speaks of quality construction. Just set it up which would have been easy if I didn't have to track down the device settings that had all voice control stuff turned off. Amazing how cryptic some device ID'S are. You have to best guess a lot of times. Still, once that was straightened out it was easy. Having an Amazon account really did make things go smoother. Now, I can get enough volume with enough clarity to understand what the talking heads are saying. Setting the controls for Bass, Treble and Mids was easy. I appreciate the Bass control as it is physically painful if set too high. Since this is my first experience with this type of device I gave it only 3 stars until I have more experience with it. So far, it is performing well. Sound quality isn't quite as good as I'd hoped, but is quite good and all I need so no complaints there.

If I'm only playing music through Amazon's music service... incredible sound and the volume is more than enough for any sane person to thoroughly enjoy. For reference, we listen at about Volume 4.

BUT...

When it comes to watching a television show through the Fire 4K stick... it's so frustrating it makes me want to return them. 100% of the time, we set ""Volume 10"", which is maximum volume. And even *that* doesn't always allow us to hear the dialogue coming through the show.

I've tried SO many settings to fix it. I've paired and unpaired countless times.

AND there's more.

For some reason, we have to reboot our 4K Firestick every single day before we watch a show. Otherwise, at some point during the day, it disconnects from the speakers for TV. And only for TV. Because if we ask for music, it works just time, every time.

Moral of the story: happy with them for music. Terrible as a speaker system for television.

However, when I am in the kitchen and the device is so close to me (same position as older model) I have to yell at Alexa and wait (note; no music or anything playing) then speak the command. In previous-gen versions, I have been able to talk at a normal volume and pace and Alexa picks up what I am saying right away.
Now 1 of 2 things happen 1. I have to pause for 3 -4 seconds after saying Alex or it simply does not respond OR 2. the echo dot device in another room picks up the request and plays the response in that room.

Also while it looks super nice compared to other models, the light indicator being at the bottom is almost useless. If I have a notification I can't see the light , where when the light was at the top of the device you could see the light from a distance. Now it's just hidden and pretty useless if you are not right on top of the unit.

But all this just increases my disappointment when Alexa just doesn't seem to get what I am requesting, even when I am taking great care to be very clear. Even worse is when Alexa appears to go on strike and just not respond to my requests at all. I dread hearing her frequent plaint, ""I'm sorry. I'm not understanding right now. Try again later."" In addition to these complaints, I have to add that Amazon is still far from the top of its game when it comes to the sound quality of its Echo devices--at least this one. If Amazon is going to tout ""premium sound,"" it should certainly do better. When Alexa speaks, she sounds as if her face is buried in a pillow, and music is by no means crisp, clear, or well balanced.

GT Fan,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2021","Update: Rating changed from 4 to 3 stars. The new devices (have 2 now and am kind of regretting it) are a step up with sound quality for sure. But the microphones and voice recognition are really poor. Have to repeat commands (even simple ones like ""end timer"") many times. Heck, the devices have a hard time picking up ""Alexa"" wake word most of the time. Haven't looked at the internals, but guessing that the physical positioning of microphones in the new ball shaped package was ""good in theory"" but just poor design. Either that or the software upgrades are anything but.

And Amazon is not doing anything about the ugly white cords and adapters. Shame. The round package could be cool - if it wasn't for the ugly white only cords and adapters (and performance issues of course). It is fine with the white one we have. It might even work for the blue. But it is gosh-awful with the charcoal unit. If a person wants a dark colored smart device, it is probably in part because the location needs a dark color. Tell me again how white cords/adapters make sense?

The EP1G, in the tonally reflective metallic silver most especially, is a modern masterpiece of design that blends in and contributes interesting conversation to any décor. By contrast, their 4th Gen is a plasticky child’s toy you have to hide away or make excuses for. The EP1G’s tower gave us superb sound, Zigbee, and a clearly visible mechanical light ring we can turn to control the volume. 4th Gen you have to fumble around to feel the raised symbols.

Perhaps the worse crime of all is Amazon taking away our choice. Okay, if you want to go experimenting with bowling balls, fine. I don’t get why they had to force all of us into that form factor.

1) Voice recognition not as good as previous generations. There are times when I attempt to wake the device up and have to shout. I was able to wake the other devices up with more of a conversational tone. There are also times when it doesn't appear to be able to process what I said, so it will just disregard everything and not say anything.

2) The speaker is good, but I can see why others have complained about it not being 360. One of my devices is placed facing the dining area. When I am in the kitchen, the music does not sound as good since it is facing away from me. This was not an issue with the 2nd generation is previously replaced.

* BUILT-IN ZIGBEE HUB: after unplugging the Echo (or after a power outage) Zigbee devices get disconnected and do not automatically reconnect. It is a huge pain to have to reset and reconnect each device and redo any routines that used those devices. I also worry about the safety and security of a smart home when devices like heaters, humidifiers, alarms, etc no longer talk to the hub or follow automated commands after after a power outage. Hopefully this is something that Amazon can fix with a Echo software update.

Another example, I asked Alexa ""What time is it?"" which I ask regularly and it responded with ""It is"" and stopped. I then asked it again, the device lit up when I asked, but then went dark like it didn't hear me. I tried yet again and the same happened. I have a routine created that when I say good morning the volume lowers, and then it tells me the time and date. I did that and it actually worked. I also want to mention that I talk clearly and don't have a harsh accent.

My previous echo dot never had any of these issues and if it wasnt for this having a great speaker and being on sale when I purchased I would return this and go back to my old device.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Kat,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2022","I got this device about a month ago. It's easy to set up in the Amazon app and do all the usual settings, no problems there. But the thing malfunctions 9 out of 10 times I use it. I played music on it and that was flawless. But everytime I ask it something . . . anything from the weather update to telling it to turn on a light . . . it answers my question or does what I requested and then turns on every light in my living room. My echo shows and my dots have never done this, ever. So it's not how I have my smart devices set up. This problem is specific to this device only. I cannot figure out how to fix this and it's driving me nuts. UPDATE: I fixed the problem by taking it out of my living room group. Whatever group you put it in will run amok when you use the device. So you can't add it to a room or group.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Twink-Lynn,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2021","I have 4 echos. At first they worked beautifully. I liked being able to have the same program playing on all the devices while I worked around the house. However, the last couple of weeks I can barely get one device to play. I can’t figure out what is wrong.

5/3/21 update: When I posted the above paragraph, I received a call from Amazon customer service, and was given some steps to take to correct the problem. They are all working fine right now. Fingers crossed.

One of my favorite things to do with the Echos is to have them all play the same radio station. As I walk around the house doing my chores, I can listen to the music wherever I am.

There's lots more the echos can do. I'm sure I have only scratched the surface.

Update 5/4/21: Customer service helped me yesterday and the echoes worked fine after that. Now I am having intermittent problems again where one or more of my echos stop playing. I don't know what is going on. I am not very tech savvy and it is irksome that this keeps happening.

Jane Elliott,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2022","I currently have a 2nd Gen Echo and 2 Echo Dots. I listen to the 2nd Gen Echo the most and decided to give this a try to upgrade the sound. My favorite thing about the Alexa products is being able to network them together into groups. The sound quality on this was a step up from my 2nd Gen. That is where the good stops. This device would frequently stop playback altogether. Whether it was Amazon Music, a Flash Briefing or a 3rd party app it would just stop playing. I could not get my devices to play in a group with this device as part of the network. All my devices were hooked up to the same 2.4 ghz wifi network. I deleted and re-added all the devices multiple times. I spent countless hours on the phone with support. Everything worked fine until I added in this devices. When I removed it, the groups worked fine. The last straw was when it was in the middle of delivering a severe weather notification and it just stopped working.

Jennifer R. Tillison,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2022","I had to buy a new, more expensive, larger, uglier Alexa device because the old one could not connect devices on a modern Wi-Fi router with 5G. She is not capable of answering almost any question, including her own model or specifications. And after a dozen tries, she still could not connect to my device. Alexa used to be far simpler, far less expensive, and work far better.
Is it time to convert to Google smart home, or is that just as bad?

Addition: After posting this review, Amazon Customer Service called me and was able to assist me in connecting this Echo to my devices. I have added two stars to reflect that service.

I remain disappointed that I had to buy two new Echoes and devices to connect to them merely because Comcast replaced my router with a newer model. And it is still the case that this Echo provides less assistance than the older models I had. Also, having lived with it for a few days, I have noticed that the sound quality is worse than the older models, even though it looks like it has a bigger speaker.",3.0 out of 5 stars

will,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2021","While the sound is much improved; I'd rather liked the method for which the volume was controlled in the Echo 1st Gen. With Echo 1st Gen all you had to do was twist the top. With the Ball 4th Gen, you have to go feeling for the +/-. One added plus to the Alexa 4th Gen, is the battery attachment. Today I am to receive the battery. Let's hope it performs well. Would I buy another 4th Gen; yeah, the sound is worth the cost. Sure wish one could twist the upper half of the ball to adjust the volume; that would have been better.
We have used the 4th Gen Alexa for 1/2 months; the only problem we have noticed is that, and I should first say; the 4th Gen is geared more toward digital devices, with that said; the problem it has is that it does not voice recognize our request to play music by ""U2."" Its response is to direct us to enable ""youtube"" by using the Alexa app. At the Alexa app, there isn't a method to solve this problem. The only solution we found was to request a specific album or song from U2. Then Alexa 4th Gen has a better chance at granting your request.",3.0 out of 5 stars

With that being said I know not to expect the best of the best with anything Amazon puts out. They aren't making the top of the line product and that's perfectly fine for me.

This Echo however missed the mark for me on two very important aspects sound & voice recognition. Music through this Echo is simply muffled and without substance. Yes, I've played with placement and EQ settings. It just isn't what it should be. The volume output is strong and the bass as well. There however is pitiful mid/treble range on this thing. I'd even go as far as saying my 2nd gen echo dot puts out a fuller sound than this Echo does.

Additionally, the voice recognition on this system just isn't as good. I'm not sure why that is but again my earlier generation echo dots I have are more alert to my voice commands.

Elias Rodriguez,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2021","I don't have a lot of expectations of Alexia. What the Echo Gen 4 does well, it does well. However, when it fails, it does so fantastically. My biggest complaint is that I get it, Echo, Amazon product, Echo is really just a way to drive and direct traffic, particularly consumer traffic to Amazon, but for God's sake it gets a little... unwelcomingly forceful about it sometimes.
Build quality of the unit is good.
The sound quality is okay. Stereo speakers could be configured a tiny bit better to try to get a little more spread out of them but really nothing can really be done when you cram a left and right channel so close together. Bass, is... bassy. The midrange is okay and the treble is fairly clear without getting too tinny. Voice recognition is okay, when you call her, 95% of the time she hears you.

However....

This is the real issue. Alexia isn't so good at understanding what you are asking her/of her. Sometimes the results are humorous, but over time that novelty wears off and it just gets irritating.
Also... The search engine is BING??? BING??? Really??? Why?!?!?!? Who actually uses BING?!?!?!
Hey pssst... Amazon, one word... Google.
Integration to lighting systems good. No real complaints there except when Alexia decides to randomly poo the bed because she can't understand what you are asking of her.",3.0 out of 5 stars
John Pepe,"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2022","So I bought this to replace a 2nd gen echo plus with the smart home hub because I was trying to find a regular 3rd gen echo (the taller rounded one) to set up a stereo pair with but found them all discontinued. So i bought this version (renewed) and put the other echo downstairs. The sound quality is pretty good but I feel it's not as strong or has the same bass response as the original echo plus. Haven't set another echo up with it yet so I'll hold off on my audio judgements. In terms of voice recognition, this thing can't hear me calling it half the time when I'm in bed only 3 feet away, the other one was better with that. Not only can't it hear me, but half the time it doesn't respond correctly or perform the right action I request.

Juan Carlos Santamaria,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2021","I was looking forward for the new 4th generation Alexa: promised better sound, better home integration, nice looking! I bought the device to replace my 2nd generation Alexa device that we use in the kitchen/breakfast area.
The device does have better sound playback overall. We use it primary for music. But the device has several issues that make it worse than our ""old"" Alexa: (1) there seems to be a problem with the microphone. It does not capture the voice commands as good as the old device. Sometimes we have to raise our voice so loud that the ""old"" alexa responds (and she is at the loft at the second floor!). Most of the times, the commands do not come as intended. I can hear from the playback of the commands in the history page that they are not as crisp as the ones recorded in the old device. (2) the smarthome integration embedded in the new alexa fights with our current smarthings hub all the time. When scanning the sensors we see duplicates for most of them: one from the smarthing hub and another one from the alexa device. Deleting the ones from alexa builtin smarthome hub fixes the issue. The new alexa does have a better sound, but we resorted on swaping it for our ""old"" alexa instead and move the new alexa to the second floor, where it is rarely used.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Jamstewonline,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2020","Seems that Alexa's hearing problem is how she recognizes her name. If your voice does not sound very close to how you said her name when you trained her to hear you she does not respond. Re training your voice may help just keep in mind that when you do the training try to pronounce her name at different pitches and volumes so she recognizes you more. It helped me out some but not perfectly. I think the microphones are under her felt covering making it a little harder for her to hear the correct pronunciation of her own name. That's my best guess.

Ok I love Alexa devices. I have 6 various devices in my home. But this newer echo does not impress me.
First of all the voice recognition for me is terrible. I don't know where they hid the microphones but it rarely hears me and it sits about 3ft from me. The earlier version does a better job so much so that i put the last edition near me and the new one out in living room. The new one seems to hear better when farther away from you.

I even changed the wake words for the devices in case that was the issue, however it may have helped the echo only slightly. The dot still responds from two rooms away, yet the echo doesn’t always respond from ten feet away. Otherwise it is a good device. The sound is much better than the dot.

Whoever thought coupling a white power cord with a black-colored product needs to be fired. The first and second BLACK Echo products came with....wait for it.. BLACK power cords. Because if you are buying something in black, it is probably to pair with room decor. So having a very obvious WHITE cable paired with BLACK setting defeats the purpose. Obviously, the product in white coming with a white power cord is a great match; very stupid design choice. It looks like a duckpin bowling ball or a magic eight ball. Very odd. Bought 3 and will keep them since they were half-price. The white looks nice enough but the black only works if you can properly hide the entire cable.

I got a free ring light that uses this model as a hub and so far it has worked great together. Works fast when charging light settings.

I also hit a few issues that seem like issues with this model. One issue that I have over the my Echo Dot is with Bluetooth. When connected it works great and never disconnects but the fight to get this echo to see my phone is a struggle. Saying ""Connect to my phone"" works rarely. On my Echo Dot its works more around 95% of the time. Once connected though there are no issues with sound or dropping. Second issue is that it seems harder to get it to respond to ""Alexa"". I end up saying it over and over getting louder each time till I feel like I'm yelling at it. Since its 2 feet away on my desk this seems a bit strange. Again the Echo Dot didn't have this issue.

Mike,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2022","I'm fairly new to the Alexa universe, and the 4th generation Echo is my first such device. My first impressions are that the sound quality (for the price and size of the device) is excellent. There is copious quantities of base. The highs are also quite good provided you place the speaker out in the open and are facing the front side of the device. The voice recognition is almost flawless if the room is quiet. However I found that Alex has some issues hearing me correctly whenever I was playing music, listening to the TV, or when my Roomba was banging around the house. I think it's reasonable that situations like this can cause Alexa to either not hear you, or misinterpret what you said.... and I can accept that.
My Echo's are connected to my 5GHz wifi network and are located all within 30 ft of my router. I've never had any issues with the wifi connection. A couple of times in the past 3 months the Alexa service has gone down, which can be a real issue. Luckily, ""most"" of my smart devices (Kasa and Feit) could all be controlled through their native apps. Fortunately for me, Alexa was only down for a couple of hours, and then all was good. The bad part was that my mother-in-law, who is in a wheelchair, uses Alexa to control the lights, ceiling fan, and TV in her apartment. The lesson here is that if you have a technically challenged person who relies of Alex, just realize that there will be times when Alex lets you down... and you'll need to have a backup plan to get buy until the service comes back online.
Regarding integration with other manufacturer's devices is hit and miss, depending on how main stream (widely used) their products are. I had no issues getting 5 Kasa smart plugs (for air cleaners and dehumidifier), 4 Kasa smart dimmers (for lights), 3 Kasa smart switches (for ceiling fans), and about 20 Feit smart bulbs, all connected and integrated into Alexa. Personally, before choosing a brand of smart product, go onto the Android/Apple app store (as appropriate for you), and check out the ""Start"" rating for that manufacturer's app. If it has a poor rating, it might be a good idea to choose a different manufacturer. The 4th generation Echo has a built in temperature sensor, which lets you create ""routines"" that can be triggered by the room temperature. The Echo can also listen for sounds like ""glass breaking"", and ""smoke/CO alarms"". If the Echo hears these sounds, you can get a notification on the phone app. Awesome feature, and it's free. There are more advanced security/safety features, but those have a monthly fee.
It's hard to review just the Echo, when in fact it's impossible to separate it from the Alex service. As a piece of ""hardware"", what you get in such a small package is impressive (5 stars). The other half of the rating is how well Alex integrates with your smart devices, and how well you use the capabilities within the Alex app to configure your Echo device. One of the most important functions is the ability to create ""routines"". A routine is a set of commands that get performed, when the trigger phrase is spoken.
I'll say that the capabilities available with routines is mind blowing. Many people might be intimidated trying to set them up. If you are not tech savvy, you might need to find someone who is to help you out. I've got a computer engineering degree, and it was fairly intuitive for me, but I'm an extreme example...",4.0 out of 5 stars
C,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2020","The new Echo 4th Gen is a big change in aesthetics and design for the Echo line. The new spherical shape is wider and shorter than previous Echo versions, and now focus sound in one primary direction instead of 360 degrees. It adds an extra tweeter, and seems to produce more sound than previous versions. Here are my early thoughts so far, after using it for about 24 hours:

THE GOOD:

Setup was incredibly simple. I just powered the device on, and the Echo announced that it was ready for setup. I opened the Alexa app on my phone, and the new Echo was automatically detected and set up instantly. I didn't have to enter any information at all. It can't get any easier than this.
BETTER SOUND. This new Echo has an extra tweeter, for a total of two 0.8 inch tweeters, and the same 3.0 inch Sub from the Gen 3 Echo. This new Echo is designed with the tweeters pointed forward, and the speaker placement seems to generate more bass also somehow, even with the same Sub as the Gen 3. All in all I think it sounds much better than Gen 3, with a little more bass and louder max volume. This could also be do to the sound-mapping feature that allows Echo to maximize the sound by detecting the acoustics and shape of the room. You can also pair two of these in stereo; and you are supposed to be able to use it as a speaker for your FireTV device, though I haven't tested that out yet.
Temperature sensor included. Yes, you can ask Alexa what the temperature is, and it seems very accurate so far. This is a nice touch, and I look forward to doing more testing, to see if I can set up routines based on temperature.
AZ1 Processor. This new Amazon processor promises better voice recognition and faster Alexa responses. In my testing so far, I have barely noticed a slight speed improvement (for example turning on certain room lights) but there are supposed to be upcoming updates that will make an even bigger difference in speed.
Zigbee + Sidewalk Bridge. This comes with a Zigbee hub, just like previous versions of the Echo Plus. It also contains the new Sidewalk Bridge, which allows the Echo to use bluetooth and radio connections to connect to some smart devices at long range, and push data to the internet.

THE BAD:

No 360 degree speakers. While I personally prefer the sound of this new version, some people might miss the 360 degree speaker setup of previous Echo generations. It certainly might lead to a situation where the ideal placement of the Echo in your room could be different.
White power cord. This is minor, but a strange choice. No matter what color Echo you get, the power cord is white. Some people might find that annoying.
Voice detection is not great while loud music is playing. This surprised me, as previous generations haven;t really struggled with this in my experience. I'm not sure if it is because this speaker is much louder, but Alexa hasn't heard me a few times when I talked while the music was playing at max volume. This could be annoying if you often listen to very loud music.

NEUTRAL:

-Aesthetics. I think I preferred the look of the cylinder design, instead of this new sphere shape. This is totally personal preference of course. I also wish the entire sphere was fabric, instead of being plastic on the back side. Some people might prefer the ball shape though, so that is up to you.

All in all, I'm keeping this new Echo because of the better sound and faster responsiveness, but it is not really a massive upgrade. Pretty decent so far, I'll update this review and try to answer any questions in the future!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Goofy Jessie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024","So my eight year old echo in my bedroom stopped working. And I did without Alexa in my bedroom for a couple of years. Finally, I gave in and ordered a 4th gen echo. I’ve always thought the best thing about the echo was Alexa. Especially with Halloween fast approaching.

The sad reality it's that Alexa is not as advanced as its competitors. I compared Alexa’s response when I inquire about the weather. Alexa provides the answer, but it’s not exactly accurate. Its competitors provide the actual temperature, but they go a step further and provide “how it actually feels” by accounting for humidity, which in some parts of the country can be a difference of over ten degrees. I also ask her to turn on or off a smart light bulb that worked just fine with my eight year old echo. The same bulb its competitors easily turn on or off. Alexa on this brand new Echo fails. Can’t do it. I was going to pack it up. Return it.

But then, out of sentimentality, I ask Alexa to play some jazz music. State of Jazz, Part 80. Wow. Deep bass. Clean treble. Impressive highs. Sound even better than my stand alone Bose speaker. Kid. You. Not.

Instead of returning it, I’ll keep it. I’ll order some Kasa light bulbs. Kasa never fails. Never. And hope I don’t regret keeping this Echo.

And I’m really hoping the rumors about an upgraded Alexa in October are true. Because I love Alexa, but she’s getting a little long in the tooth. Not as sharp. But still my sweetheart. Hey, if anyone from Amazon/Alexa happens to read this review, you might consider sending me some complimentary Kasa light bulbs. Or maybe a discount code. Here’s hoping Alexa is soon rejuvenated.

bojohnson,"Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2024","I'm happy with the Echo as a speaker but I also use it to help with my smart home setup by using Alexa routines. That's where the problem comes in - the Alexa app. Writing a routine is incredibly painful. Sure, it is relatively easy to write a simple routine, but anything more is tedious and slow. It would be nice, for example, if the app could incorporate existing smart home device setting automatically into a new routine. It is so tedious to select ""Smart Home,"" then ""Lights,"" and then scroll down a list of devices to find the desired light, then pick whether it's on or off, the light intensity level and then the light color. And then, do it all over again for every single light or device to be in lured in the routine. Setting up groups, which makes setting up multiple lights easier is an Ok solution, but is just another hoop to jump through. The app menu setup is totally unintuitive. It's hard to believe this app was written and distributed by a modern tech company. The Alexa app, if done right, could win the market for Alexa as the premier smart home control system.

Don B,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2023","I bought 2 of these as refurbished, to add to the other 3 that I have in the downstairs of my home. One would not connect after repeated attempts. Not the end of the world, just inconvenient and a hassle. Especially after working all day, this should be about a 15 minute procedure for BOTH units. So, after 45 minutes on ONE, I stopped attempting the connection, and switched to the other unit. The other unit connects within minutes (as it should) and I went back to the other one. This is the 5th time now to attempt a connection, and it won't take. So, I click on the Alexa app for an Amazon rep with technical support to call me. So, a guy calls, and wants me to walk through the connection process with him on the phone. I get it, they need to verify the issue, so I oblige him and go through it with him on the line.
Well, attempt number 6 fails with him on the phone, and let him know that was as far as I could get prior to asking for tech support. He wants me to unplug it, and start it back up again. I said OK, but this will be the 6th time of doing that exact thing. So I unplug it, and it reboots itself (as before), and we walk through the setup process again, and guess what? Will NOT connect. I asked since this was refurbished, if it was possible, by any chance, that it is still connected to the previous owner? He said he already checked on that, and it was not. So, now he wants me to unplug it once again, and close the Alexa app. I did both already, and informed him of such, but he insists that we need to do so. OK, we'll try it again. So unplug, close the app completely, plug back back in, power up, and reopen app. Go through set up process, will not connect again. Frustration is starting to creep up on me, and he says hang on, I am going to reset your system remotely. Ok, maybe that helps (perhaps he should have suggested that early on?), I don't know. Either way, phone is silent for a minute or so, then the hold music starts to play for another minute or 2 (maybe 3, not even sure now) and then I am disconnected! Wow, really? Ok, I am sure that was an error on his part, not intentional, but still....
So, I call back, get bounced to the right department, tell the story to another tech support guy, he agrees that it is faulty and says he can just refund my purchase. Well, I let him know that I don't want a refund, I want a replacement item. That is why I bought 2 more to begin with. No luck, refund only, so I agree to it.
Well the other that is connected up, once I played some music on it, the speaker was obviously worn out, and distorted.
So now, I am returning both of them.

I wanted my wife to be able to call me from anywhere if she falls. They work great and I used my PC to set them all up, and later to changes the names and activation words.
I was very frustrated when they took the PC management program down, and make you now use a cell phone.
I do own a cell phone, an older version Android that is not up to release 9.0 OS, so it cannot run the app to manage my system now. I wanted to add one more unit and change some of the names, but I have not discovered a work around.
A new cell phone is up into the $200 bracket, and I rarely even use it, as I am retired. This is more money then a new Echo unit! Yet we have 4 PC's in the house and use them a lot.
I am truly disappointed with Amazon for making this change, without considering everyone in the US is not glued to a cell phone or needs it, and spends that much for one. I am looking for other options but my wife loves the radio, news, and music of these units, and now I do not know what can replace all that.

D.Z,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2022","I have had homepod mini, the original homepod, and most of the Echo first party devices, including echo studio. The echo 4th gen is definitely the best of all of these. I have even owned the bose portable, some really expensive Sony speakers. For the size and sound quality and reliable and fast voice recognition, these can't be beat.

Issues with the homepods:

The homepod had great sound quality, but it was big and you still dont get the stereo separation effect you can get with two speakers one on each side of the room, and after a firmware update the speaker developed a weird and terrible sounding issue and I had to throw it away. Apple discontinued it so I couldn't buy a replacement. The homepod minis used to be good, in fact better sound quality than probably the echo dot 5th gen (I didn't test it personally, just heard the sound in a review). However they started becoming unreliable as well, one would cut out midsong or there would be a weird echoing effect and the voice recognition was always slower than an echo device. And sometimes siri wouldn't recognize at all, or she would say 'something went wrong, this is taking longer than I expected'.... a lot.

So switching over to two Echo 4th gens, in a stereo pair, was really great because the voice recognition is faster and she usually understands what I say and play it. I could say the same request to both and Siri wouldn't get it while Alexa would.

However there was a major issue, at first they wouldn't pair in a sound pair. I had to web search and find out that what you have to do is plug in one speaker only, say 'alexa check for updates' and then wait until that speaker updates, then unplug it, do that for the second speaker, unplug it when done, then update the alexa app on your phone, then plug everything back in and try to pair them again in the app. That worked for me. Amazon really dropped the ball on this, and I had to remove a star, you shouldn't get a product that has a basic feature like the speakers working in a stereo pair that requires a bunch of googling to solve. I can imagine the frustration if you buy two and then they don't work in a stereo pair and your googling skills aren't good enough. Another knock on Alexa compared to Siri in general, is that lately Alexa has been spamming me asking me if I want stuff. Siri never does that. Alexa will say things like 'by the way (advertisement, would you like to try it/buy it?) However as far as I know there is no reliable Apple smart speaker that exists so this is your best option. Note that I didnt try the google products because I gave up on google made products, they all seem to break (chromebook, pixel 6, google wifi, etc. and then google always makes some excuse why they wont fix it- so not only do their products break but they also won't fix them- I gave up on them)",4.0 out of 5 stars

The sound quality is perfectly adequate for me and my apartment living, and I like that I can adjust the equalizer settings with the Alexa app. Definitely not as full of sound as the Sonos, and I don’t think it can get as loud, but it’s fine for me. The only irritating thing is how glitchy Alexa is, that you can’t control the volume of her spoken responses (way too loud ALWAYS), and the many glitches between the Alexa system and various other services/skills, but that’s really an Alexa problem vs. the speaker. Oh, also the voice recognition can be spotty. I swear Alexa never understands me when I speak commands in an angry tone 🤣 Very weird.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Coolguru,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2023","Overall a great device.
Audio is great - compared to smaller echo dot devices. Plus having built-in smart home hub allows it to connect to bulbs and plugs directly - which makes it great. With this, you can actually get rid of all the individual hubs (Hue, Sengled and others).
The device also has built-in temperature sensor (Not figured out how to use it yet ! except creating routines as Alexa thermostat was not there yet).

Amazon needs to do few things:
1. Publish a roadmap - on what features will be added to device (considering that the device is 3 year old and still going on).
2. Explore if Wifi can be added to device (as mesh node).

other feedback:

Amazon could do more with Alexa. e.g. I should be able to pair new smart devices with my amazon echo just using voice. Using phone should be optional. That would make this device a must have.

Occationally my audio shuts off. I understand that this is potentially due to internet stream issue (but I am supposed to be using streaming services of amazon itself). In such scenario I expect my device to detect the issue (my roku does), and gracefully recover from it (my roku does) or provide a feedback to me that it has encountered a stream issue (my roku does).",4.0 out of 5 stars

Its mostly nice in terms of features. Its nice having a temperature sensor and the sound is better than previous generations. Its also nice to see a smarthome hub included, but its definitely reflected in the price.

I got this to finally replace a gen 1 echo in a small room, and the biggest change has been that with the light ring at the bottom of the device we cannot see it with it positioned where we had the previous model. It may be a minor gripe but its definitely something to consider if you're replacing an older model and expect to keep the device in the old location. We had to move ours to another spot since it was often strange not being able to see if Alexa heard us (we find it to be a bit of a pain to use the acknowledgement mode).",4.0 out of 5 stars
Naturephotoguy,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2024","I had one of the earlier squat Echo dots and was very dissatisfied with the thin, bass-less sound. I have an Echo Studio in the kitchen, which has wonderful sound. When this version became available, I ordered one in late 2022 for the bedroom. For the price, the sound is remarkably good, with full bass and a smooth spectrum of sound for music. However, it occasionally exhibits weird behavior. A couple of months ago, I was awakened by flashing blue lights. There had not been a power outage, but the Echo was rebooting itself. It did that several times over the course of the night. Over the last two weeks, it has twice gotten stuck. It won't respond to voice commands and keeps playing the playlist it was last on. Unplugging it and rebooting it gets it working properly again, but I have never had to do that with the Echo Studio. If it were as reliable as the Studio, I'd give it five stars, but I have to knock off a star for the inconvenience of occasionally having to reboot it.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I expect to make use of the internal Zigbee hub in the future; replacing the stand-alone hub we have now.
The only troubling feature is the temperature sensor. The only use I had for this was to tell me the temperature when I'm on the other side of the house. That's fortunate because it isn't accurate enough for most of the suggested smart home applications. Mine is always wrong by 2°F to 4°F high. Some on the internet have it much worse.

Sue C.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2021","I was an early adopter of the Echo technology. This is my third basic Echo (in addition to an Echo Studio, several Echo Dots, and the version for your car).

Positives:

This one picks up commands easily even from the next room over without me having to raise my voice.

It controls my smart lights, smart outlets, motorized blinds, and other convenient features, and many items interface very smoothly so that installation of new devices is typically easy. Not always, but often.

Negatives:

The spherical design doesn't ""blend into the woodwork"" and takes up more shelf space than the previous cylindrical versions.

The system isn't very good at presenting information outside the fairly narrow range of skills. Ask it to play a song from the Amazon library or to ""Tell me about my commute"" (after specifying the location when you set up that skill), and it's helpful. Ask it the sort of general information question that you might input into Google, and it will probably tell you it doesn't know that. (I assume that the Google system would do better in this respect.)

It's programmed to offer you ""help"" that you didn't ask for which is irritating--mostly the opportunity to buy stuff. ""BTW, did you know that you can ask me to automatically order blah blah blah?"" as an addition to whatever you did ask it to do. Yes, I do know that, and I don't appreciate having to tell it to stop playing what amounts to an ad for other Amazon products or services.

The fact that there are only a few ""wake words"" is a problem in a household with multiple devices. It would be better if the user could input their own choice of a wake word that they would be unlikely to use in general conversation.

I'm not impressed with the sound fidelity of this system. It's better than the Dot's, but not by a whole lot. The Studio version is much, much better (but also much more expensive). To my ear, it doesn't sound as good as the second cylindrical version we own. That was disappointing, and is probably a direct result of having fewer speakers than previous versions. If listening to music is going to be a primary use, you're going to need to fuss with Bluetooth speakers or spring for the Studio version.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Wil W.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2020","I'm pretty impressed with this echo overall. It's smaller than I expected and It makes the new Dot seem large! But the sound is very good for such a small and inexpensive package. I think it's great that it's not 360 degree audio anymore as I have almost never seen one not installed near a wall. Additionally, the 1/4"" mounting hole (1/4-20 threaded like a tripod) is absolutely fantastic. I have mine mounted using a cheap security camera mount but you can use almost any tripod, arm or mount due to the ubiquity of this mounting size.

I was especially interested in the Aux-In / Line-in capabilities. The Echo only has one audio port and you can switch it between output and input. (If you're planning on using it for output only, though, a dot might be a better choice for you if you don't need zigbee) I'm using the port as an input and it's not quite as full-featured as I'd like.

Here are some facts from my limited testing and use you may find helpful.

- The line-in needs a strong/loud signal. The headphone port from my Mac mini comes out too softly even when the Echo, Mini and all software volumes are at max. I mean, it's loud enough at that, but then Alexa is SO LOUD it's unusable. I also tested from my iPad Pro with a USB C hub that had audio out and found similar low levels. I don't have a proper line-level output device handy. Unfortunately this level problem makes it unusable for my original purpose unless I add an amp. (Otherwise, great computer speaker!)
- The line-in needs to be activated in the Alexa app. By default the port is line-OUT. Look under settings for your device.
- The line-in is mixed with Alexa audio but is NOT MIXED with other audio sources, for instance streaming music services. Example: Play music from Spotify, ask Alexa something, you'll hear Alexa speaking over Spotify. Play audio from an external source via the line-in and the Spotify audio will stop and the external audio plays. Ask Alexa something and you'll hear the response over the line-in audio. Start Spotify again and the external audio will mute and Spotify will play. You cannot seem to mix external audio and a streaming source simultaneously. So far the auto switching between seems to be inconsistent.
- The port is a little tight to the edges of the recess in the housing. A cable with a large connector may not make a good connection.

I'll be putting this to work elsewhere and hope that I can use it as a computer speaker if the level issue is ever addressed. (I know, bluetooth to it, but the latency is poor)",4.0 out of 5 stars

Eric Johnson,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2021",I originally got a Sonos One to control Alexa with because sound quality is a must for me. The sound quality was great but I would have liked more bass especially for the cost. But for some reason the Alexa voice control didn't work that great I often had to ask several times for it to get it right so I took it back. I originally wanted the Echo Studio but it's not been available for months now so I decided to get this Echo Premium sound. When I first hooked it up in the living room on an end table I honestly was not impressed and was going to take that one back as well. But! I wanted to listen to music in the bathroom so I hooked it up in there and wow- it sounded like a different speaker all together it was sitting higher than it was on the living room end table and was also in a corner those two details transformed the sound. It's sound quality is on par but just slightly under the Sonos One @ $220 but when you think of the big price difference it makes the Sonos not worth the price. If you had $200 to spend on speaker I would buy two of the Echo 4 Premium sound speakers that makes a stereo pair and for sure would sound better than one Sonos One. I always thought the Echo Studio would be closer paired to the Sonos but I think it's actually closer to the Echo 4 Premium. Another reason that I like it better is you can play music through out your house on any Echo devices. With the Sonos it has to be another Sonos product to play throughout house. In my bedroom I have an Echo dot that is connected to my very favorite Logitech Z625 400 watt 2.1 THX certified speakers so I can still get the bass from the subwoofer in the bathroom that makes the Echo sound that much better. I'm glad I gave it a chance before returning. Another tip is make sure you set the equalizer to your liking adjusting that makes a huge difference.,4.0 out of 5 stars

There is so many great things about this device, but the engineers made 2 major flaws; the first flaw could be fixed through a software update, the second could be just a cheaply bought microphone or it could possibly fixed through some complex software coding and then updated on all of these devices. If this could be done, this would without a doubt be a 5 Star purchase with zero complaints. Let's see if they do something to fix this or if they are now going to make you buy the next Generation and this purchase was a pretty much a waste of money. Here are the 2 flaws that I have found so far.

1) When Alexa talks, there is way too much bass to the voice and it makes it very hard to understand. Music is perfect, it is just when Alexa is answering questions making an announcement, telling you your reminder, etc.

2) Also, as I've read in many reviews, when you say the 'Wake Words (Alexa, Echo, etc.), sometimes it will answer you from 20 feet away and sometimes I'm literally standing over it and I can't get it to do anything (it especially stinks when you ask it to do something and it misheard what you said and starts talking about a subject and I say Alexa over and over, louder and louder, and it won't stop going on and on about a topic I didn't ask for, yet I can't get it to stop. I have to pretty much yell to get the thing to shut up).",4.0 out of 5 stars
Mike,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2022","I was looking for a soundbar system for my livingroom. While I was doing some research, I saw a huge sale on the Echo for $59. For the price of a budget soundbar system, I was able to buy two echos and an Echo Sub.

The software is wonky and frustrating to use sometimes. It took a half hour for the it to recognize the Echos as a stereo pair. Once they did, I was able to set them up in seconds. After that, I set it up with the Fire Stick as a home theater. The Echo sub hadn't even arrived yet. The sound is actually pretty amazing. The speakers sound crystal clear and provide competent bass. Music listening is where these speakers REALLY shine. There is a huge difference when you listen to music in true stereo.

Going back to the software, That's why it's 4 stars instead of 5. I woke up the next morning, and the home theater no longer had sound. I deleted the group and set it up again, no luck. I noodled with the software for 2 hours, and it just refused to work. This seems to be a known issue. After getting the boxes together to return the devices, 6 hours later, the software magically fixes itself. Just to be certain, I spent some time trying to break it again to see where the instability is, but it's rock solid now. I'm thinking they pushed it into production without properly testing the software. Once it broke, they must have pushed a big update to fix it. It just took time for the updates to happen on all the devices. You hear that Amazon? You need to do a better job of testing your software!

That being the case, it's the smartest home cinema you can buy. Most soundbar systems will make you use a separate remote to switch channels to Bluetooth, if you want Alexa to work...unless you want to pay for Alexa integration. The dual Echo configuration is completely seamless, because...well, it's an Echo. Music is what it does best. If you want music, Alexa plays music in full stereo. If you want to watch a movie, it automatically plays the sound in Dolby Digital using the Fire Stick.

Raleigh Rhino,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2021","Original review below. I did finally get them working (a few days later they sit magically realized they’re on the same network). They sounds great. Bumped it from 2 to 4 stars. Would give 5 if it weren’t for the below time wasting activity.

I bought these to replace a 2nd gen Echo set. I had lots of issues with the 2nd gen in stereo + sub mode. Mostly related to the setup (next paragraph). Usually if you can get them setup, they work mostly ok. Every few hours one of them will start to just play static...which is more than moderately annoying. Most of the time this can be fixed by saying Alexa, Stop and then Alexa play... About 1/6 times it requires physically unplugging all three devices and then plugging them back in. About 1/30 times they have to be unpaired and re-paired and that leads to the below nerdspeak.

Setup: So we have a home network with multiple SSIDs overlaid on 3 Unifi-Pro-AC Access Points (highly recommend those btw). However, every time I try to create a stereo + sub pair, once I click on the L or R speaker it tells me the R or L speaker is on a different wifi network (it isn't, all our IoT spyware devices are on one SSID/VLAN). So I thought maybe I'll just disable all but the closest AP and turn on only 2.4GHz. Note: this meant I had to drop like 50 other wireless clients, but I still did it, still got the same faux error. Why I know this is an Amazon issue (and suspect it's the Alexa app specifically) is because the sub will pair just fine with either echo. But yet the echos won't pair with each other. Then days later, I looked again, and viola it let me pair them again.

I googled for help, but all I found was a bunch of other users with the same issue but no resolution. So I contacted Amazon, which was a waste of time.

These may be fine speakers on their own, but if you plan to pair them in a stereo or stereo + sub set you're as likely as I was to be disappointed.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Youtube is your friend for this.

Also, change your ""wake"" word. I watch alot of Youtube videos. I cannot count the times where a video has started off with ""Hey Alexa""....and mine has come on and responded to the question or command. Thinking back, I thought they were better with voice recognition. The simple fix to this is to change your wake word to ""Echo"".

James L. Greenlee,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2020","We had two sets of Monster bluetooth speakers and all four connected to each other via 5.8hz technology. We'd run them through one Echo Dot, and that's how we did whole-house sound. But the Monster speakers are dying after a long life, and we needed to do something else. In my experience, using bluetooth speakers in tandem with Echo speakers throws the sound out of synch. So, I went for an all-Amazon solution.

We already had three 3rd-gen Dots, a Spot, a Fire Cube 4K, FireTV and a Show 5. So, I bought this new 4th-gen Echo to be the ""hub"" of things, plugged it in, and bada-bing, it set itself up. I added all of the speakers (except the Fire Cube) to the ""everything"" music group, and it works pretty darn well. You can tell it to play anything on ""everywhere."" You can tell it to turn the sound level to maximum ""everywhere."" It's mostly fixed my problem with replacing my old speakers. Now, some things I learned:

- Echo Show 5 has only two mics, and they're terrible. Put that in a room that is away from the rest, where there isn't any overlap.
- Echo Spot gets very confused when connected to the old bluetooth speakers, and would oddly slow down Alexa's speech, and song speeds. Don't ask me how, but it did. But the old speakers are out of the equation now.
- Fire Cube 4K will not join the ""everything"" sound group, but also isn't a terribly good speaker, so it's not a loss.
- To have more robust sound, we kept an EchoDot in the same room with the new 4th-gen Echo, but changed its wake-word to ""Echo,"" to avoid confusion between them.
- Fire Cube 4K's wake word was changed to ""computer"" for the same reason.
- Echo 4th-gen is great in most respects, but may have slightly less responsive mics. I've had her wake, but then ignore my requests. It's a minor issue, and nowhere near as bad as the EchoShow 5.

All-in-all, I'm pretty happy with the purchase, with my primary mission--whole house sound--solved. I figure I'll replace a Dot or two with these or other Echo speakers with more robust sounds as the months and years go by. I'll keep watching for sales.

Possum United,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2021","Update 2:
Due to sending back another dot I was able to get a second on prime day for $42 net after trade in.
I paired it to the other one so now have a stereo pair. It is indeed sending different signals to the left and right channels based on the music.

I think it is pretty good for a home office. I did hear the Studio in the big box store last week and still might add one of those.

Update: I would give 4.5 vs.perhaps a 3.8 earlier. It seems to adapt over time by perhaps learning your voice and acoustics as I moved it in the room.

I had some credits with Amazon and decided to get this as it was on sale for $80- 25% trade in minus $5 dot trade in. So ~ $55 net. I was considering just getting a Echo Studio but the purpose of this is to sit on my floor and sometimes listen to music during the work day. My main Amazon/Alexa music listening to these days is through my Yamaha YAS109 and sometimes my Sonos One.

The setup was easy, much better than years ago - just opened the app and it connected. No more, password, pressing two buttons at once. I would agree that there have been a few ocassions I needed to repeat myself though as others have mentioned.

I was surprised by how much bass there was- I am in the process of adjusting the EQ on the app. I have tried it out with some classic rock and disco. I don't think the unit is earth shattering but for a casual listening experience while playing softly while WFH I think this has a lot of potential.

I will see if repositioning it changes my opinion higher. I have a Echo Studio 5- i think this does have clearer vocals .UPDATE: It is sounding better maybe it does recognize the room/small area with my voice.

Richard L Keitz,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2021","Sound quality as stereo Echo pair is great on my WiFi 6 Orbi network. They don’t interfere with my Bower & Wilkins Formation sound system.

My only complaint is Bluetooth airplay (Apple Music, Tidal) allows my iPhone to connect to only one Echo at a time so it’s not possible to grab them and go as a portable stereo sound system. They need WiFi and the Alexa App to pair them.

Amazon Music App works well and if you have the Formation, Apple Music and Tidal skills installed in the Amazon Alexa App you can figure out how to tell Alexa to play music from any skill source to any Alexa sound room or Formation sound stage.

I will test them with WiFi off to see it it’s possible to set them up and pair them using only Bluetooth and the iPhone Apps to see if I can get AirPlay to stream Bluetooth from Apple and Tidal music Apps to both Echo’s as a pair. I swear my initial setup outside on the deck had my Airplaying to both speakers in stereo. The next day, my iPhone rejected the saved Bluetooth device and when I detected and reattached I was able to connect to each speaker one at a time with no way to hear stereo mode without Amazon Music or telling Alexa via WiFi.

How they seemed to work via Airplay outside Amazon Music/Alexa on Bluetooth then wouldn’t the next day is a mystery.

Then how my Amazon Music App seemed to be broken with no way of changing speakers and other quirky things suddenly got better after I agreed to purchase Music HD is another mystery. Suddenly an AirPlay came alive in Amazon Music that now allows me to AirPlay to any Amazon sound room and also my Formation sound stages.

Jimtowner,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2022","I wanted decent sounding but budget friendly stereo speakers for the bedroom so I ordered two 4th Gen with Premium sound Echos and set them up as a stereo pair in the Alexa app. I mostly use Spotify for music and it is nicely integrated with Alexa making it easy to switch sound from my iPhone to the speakers. So far so good. The sound quality is good to my ears and I like the funky shape of the speakers.

However, it was disappointing that I could not drive sound to both speakers from other than the Spotify app. So listening to sources like Audible and Apple Music wasn’t possible. The best I could do was connect to one of the speakers via Bluetooth. But that defeated the stereo separation and fuller sound I wanted.

I finally settled on this workable an inexpensive solution:

1. I purchased a Bluetooth to Stereo adapter. I got this one https://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B078J3GTRK?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title

2. I also purchased two RCA to 3.5 mm adapters. Together with #1 the cost was about $30. https://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B092RTHZPW?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title

3. I plugged the left channel output from the Bluetooth adapter (using cables I had) to the Echo on the left and the right channel output to the right Echo.

4. Now when I want to listed to any iPhone app I connect the iPhone to the Bluetooth adapter and cast to the speakers.

Once it’s set up it’s simple to switch to the speakers via Bluetooth giving me the full sound I want. I just have to power on the adapter and it automatically makes the Bluetooth connection.

I did take off a rating star because I think Amazon should design their system so that stereo from any source is built in. But I know they want to keep people in their Alexa eco system so I don’t expect a built in solution any time soon.",4.0 out of 5 stars
robv14000,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2020","I am amazed at how good the Echo (not Echo Dot) 4th Gen sounds for music. I purchased the Echo for music while showering. I'm impressed enough to write this review. Now, if AMAZON considered reasonable trade-in values for older Echo Dots, I'd consider upgrading all the Dots I have around the house. This Echo makes me wonder what the Echo Studio sounds like, but I can't bring myself to purchase an Echo Studio due to its cost; I also don't need one because my ""main music room"" has all the gear I need there.

UPDATE:
I had more than four (4) 2nd-generation DOTs, and tried the ECHO 4th-gen to replace my bathroom DOT for showers. It works great in there, so I was moved to give the ECHO 4th-gen a positive review and went on to replace four (4) of my 2nd-gen DOTs with the 4th-gen ECHO. First of all, these ECHO 4th-gens are very sensitive to position in terms of the sound. I tolerated it. (They sound much better than the DOTs.) The MAIN PROBLEM with the ECHO 4th-gen is it DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO LISTEN. Sometimes the one in the living room didn't even acknowledge I was talking to it! (You can tell by the light not coming on.) And oftentimes it wouldn't hear me, and another ECHO or DOT would answer! So sometimes it wouldn't listen; other times it got the meaning of the words wrong; and yet other times it couldn't negotiate with the other ECHOs and DOTs ""within earshot"" as to which device should respond! If this ECHO was defective, then all of them are defective: they all do the same goofed-up-listening thing. I have since replaced the living-room ECHO 4th-gen with the old 2nd-gen DOT. Now I have sane listening in my living room again. I ""complained"" to AMAZON (oh how I complained) via ""I have feedback"" of course to no avail: AMAZON would have to acknowledge their design goof, which they continue to sell ""as is."" There is something wrong with the voice pickup in these 4th-gen ECHOs. It was aggravating enough for me to ""downgrade"" the 4th-gen ECHO to a 2nd-gen DOT.",4.0 out of 5 stars

H J S,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2022","I have three of these balls with Premium sound. I’m replacing all the Dots in the house when I can get these on sale. So far, got one at $33, one at $44 and one at $52.

The sound quality is good, but directional, compared to the Plus 2nd Gen, which I can’t seem to get more of anywhere.

The mic’s on the new ball don’t seem too good. A little better than the Show5, but not as good as a Dot 3rd Gen or the Plus 2nd Gen. When I ask Alexa for something, I am sitting closest to this ball, but the Plus across the house hears me better and responds.

I like that they have temperature sensors in them, and am Trying to find out if I can get a widget on my phone to list all the temps from my 5 devices that have sensors. Haven’t found a way to do that yet, but I do have a routing set up that announces the garage temp at 3:00 pm from my dining room Plus.

I don’t need the ultrasonic sensor that I know of, and don’t use Zigbee for anything, so it would be better to make the device hear us better and leave those things out.

I got a great deal on those Echo Plus 2nd generation devices. I bought 2, but had I known how superior those are, I’d have gotten 6! Limit was 3 per account!

The light ring on the bottom of the ball is much less noticeable, and Less annoying as well. I hate those yellow rings for notifications. I need to turn that stuff off again, but they do go away after several hours.

2 Wheel Therapy,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2022","The style of the new Echo 4th Gen is aesthetically pleasing. I plugged it into the wall, the echo was detected by previously installed Alexa devices and it was all set up with a confirmation. Device is updated with a new processor which is supposed to improve the speed of response and commands.

Pros:
The addition of another tweeter to the new 4th Gen now fills the room with even more sound and provides more volume than previous generations.
Sound mapping improves the sound quality based on room size and shape features.
Temperature sensor now allows for more routine customization.
Home theater setup: I currently have two of these paired with an echo sub to create a home theater 2.1 system through my Fire TV Cube.
Internal Zigbee hub allows for a more integrated smart home experience, helps to lessen the bandwidth requirements of a smart home and improves the range for connected compatible devices through a Zigbee mesh network. (This is a largely desired improvement)

Cons:
Home theater setup: Despite having two Echo’s paired, the volume does not seem to be twice as loud as one would expect. It seems as though the audio levels are capped when the devices are connected in a home theater setup. While the volume is still good for the 2.1 system and it fills the room, it doesn’t seem to be far different than running one Echo at upper level volume. Also not capable of providing Dolby Atmos surround sound with Echo Gen. 4 as the paired speakers (Echo Studio required for this).

Getting each one setup on their own was simple and quick. Making sure to change the activation name to not grab both of them at the same time for simple commands and questions.

I had a heck of a time getting them to go into the home theater group only to find out that they needed updates and then everything went smoothly. This is a must. Once on and running ask them if they have any updates and then they will finish.

Occasionally when switching apps back and forth the sound forgets where it was and a simple volume down and back up seems to fix that. Though I wish the remote would allow for solid hold vs. clicking every notch up or down.

Something that I took for granted was the fact that if your internet decides to have issues your speakers also will. Our previous setup was an old pioneer wired unit and didn't care about internet. These do. Not a deal breaker but worth noting.

Sound is pretty decent. Is it a 5k dollar sound system absolutely not. Does it fill a room to the point of neighbors knowing what you are watching I would say yes. Sound is clear through all volume level, but the equalizer I think could use some updates for real adjustments.

I found this to be a bit disappointing as I got used to the quality of the voice recognition and the previous version. the voice recognition quality appeared to degrade after an update. I do hope they fix this. The sound quality however is excellent. I've been using it with basic Amazon music service and that's been more than enough for me. I have multiple devices so when I tell it to play music everywhere I hear music throughout my home playing simultaneously. It also connects to various podcasts and online radio stations.

One feature that I do like is the built-in thermostat. I'm able to use that to trigger other devices such as a portable heater, which are plugged into smart plugs, to turn off and on in a room when the temperature is above or below a certain range.

The ability to call people through the device is that nice bonus.i
It is not using your cell phone which I found to be a bit creepy but it will put your cell phone number as a number that is being dialed so it is effectively spoofing your phone. Basically you could put any phone number there in the account online to be dialing from and it will use it.

The user interface for Alexa integration is quite frankly confusing. I write computer systems for a living it took me quite a while to figure out the integration. I think the average user will give up on many of the integration features because of this difficulty. I should be able to talk to the device directly to create a routine and not be clicking through an application with confusing menus.

The big echo is about ten feet away from my regular seat on the couch, and the echo dot is about thirty feet away, give or take, in the dining area on our open floor plan downstairs. The dot always hears me better than the big echo does. Always. I seldom have to raise my voice to the dot but I do for the echo. It does understand me okay when it hears me, though. Most of the time I wind up talking to the dot in the kitchen, though, because it hears me better, and only speak to the Echo when I want it to play music.

That said, the sound quality is noticeably better with the bigger echo, especially when it comes to bass. The dot is good, especially for a casual listener like me, but if you want better bass the echo is a good option. In our little condo it's loud to me at volume 6/10 and we generally keep the volume at 3 or 4.

It has a temperature sensor inside which is kinda fun but we don't have a smart thermostat so it's not a big selling point for me. I'm new to smart home stuff, so I haven't bothered figuring out the ZigBee thing yet.

I bought it on Prime Day, and for what I paid then I'm content.

JS in AZ,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2021","Finally a true high fidelity Echo! Of course it lacks true stereo separation, but that is hardly noticed with the 2 separate tweeters at 45 degree angle to each other.
This is a great way to stream music in HD and UHD as Echo 4 plays in this cd-quality format, better than mp3 quality for sure.
UPDATE: Voice recognition while loud music is playing is not as good as the 2nd generation, which is very sensitive during loud music or TV. With the TV at normal listening level, I have to almost yell to get the new Echo to hear what I am saying.
My opinion is that this one is great for pop music, which doesn't require as great sound as, say, symphonic music. I listened to a Mahler symphony with this Echo and the sound quality was quite good, suitable for background listening to classical. My high fidelity Onkyo system and speakers of course sound better, and a high quality sound system is required for serious classical listening. Still, this is a good unit and replaces my 1st gen living room Echo. The comparison here is phenomenal.
The new HD 2009 remastered Beatles albums sound great with Echo 4!
Also, it works with non-Amazon music streamers though it requires a paid subscription to Amazon Music HD to access them!

I also have several switches that were mostly Z-wave so those all had to be replaced with Kasa zigbee switches which also installed very easily. My back door lock is a Schlage Connect but it was also Z-wave so I had to replace that with a Schlage Connect zigbee and that installed much easier than the Z-wave. I have to agree with everyone that it’s ridiculous they ship a white power cable with a charcoal unit. Luckily my cable is mostly hidden. I thought I could possibly use a power cable from one of the old dots but they all work on different amp outputs. I also have to agree that this thing needs an improvement on it’s microphone. I have this installed in my kitchen and normally have to call it my name several times to get it to respond whereas one of my shows is in the living room and I can easily get it to respond from the kitchen. Overall it was much easier to install and maintain than the wink hub. A word of advice. If you have a wink hub and you want to change to this hub make sure that you delete all of your devices from your wink app, unlink everything in the wink settings, remove the app from your phone and disable the wink skill. Otherwise Alexa Will reinstall them automatically and you will have to delete them all every time it does. Speaking from experience.",4.0 out of 5 stars

B. Kunnari,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2022","When Amazon allowed grouping and pairing, we went crazy with Gen 3 Echoes through our whole house. We love them. So we decided to finally try the newest version in our kitchen. Overall, still great. But not as good as generation 3 units. First, don't worry about the directional speaker if you put these against a wall already. It still fills the room with sound. But here's what isn't as good: voice activation doesn't seem as tight as gen 3. I'm a composer and sound guy and while the low might be a bit better here over gen 3 but the rest of the sound just isn't as full as as the previous version. Gen3 is just a richer sound. Finally, and something I didn't see coming, the new shape. People can debate if they like it or not, but having it out for just a few days, and because the whole top is speaker mesh, you get finger prints from the buttons and dust and other air-gunk gets stuck on it and it can't be wiped away because, well, it's speaker mesh. This is going to be a big deal over time as this isn't going to look good in a year from now, where gen 3 could just be wiped off. I hope the next version abandons this current globe design, simply for this reason.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Pat D.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2023","I had the first gen Echo tower and it lasted a long time, in fact it still works but you need to yell to get a response and volume changes always revert back to 2, but I decided it was time to upgrade.

I don’t use the Echo to its fullest capacity and likely never will. That being said, this one looks pretty and the function buttons are readily identifiable. The voice recognition is good (I still need to repeat the wake word more than once on occasion), the volume stays where selected, and it has a better sound quality.

The light bar goes around the bottom. I am not a fan of this change as I find that notifications are not readily obvious. This may be related to my use of the original for so long where the ring was around the top which I found was easily visible. This is not a real ‘problem’ more a dissatisfaction with location. As time goes on I may become accustomed to its location.

All in all, I am satisfied with my upgrade and hope the performance is comparable to the original.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Tamey S.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2022","So far we love Alexa, we purchased a HomePod a few years ago and loved the quality it gave but it lacked in smart home integration and being a great assistant. We wanted to buy another HomePod to create a “surround sound” experience (they have since discontinued the large HomePods). So we decided to make the switch, when these work they work amazing, their sound and bass are not as good as our HomePod was but with 2 it made a richer experience. We have ran into some issues, a few resets and wifi troubleshooting later we are still having problems. Wifi is not an issue at my house, we have fiber and the speeds are amazing. For a while the echos would randomly just stop playing sound, whether that be music, from Netflix, YouTube, you name it. After many resets we have almost eliminated that issue, but one still remains, after streaming for a while the echos start making a weird staticky electronic noise (almost futuristic glitchy). We have to then turn off our fire stick and then when it turns back on it freezes for a few minutes, we go back to what we were watching and then 80% of the time the sound goes back to normal.

I noticed then the newer echo4 with hub control for sale and upgraded. I put the older one in my kitchen as it still works great. I haven't a home full of Alexa enabled apps but I thought why not for a better quality sound. I haven't gone into the hub or ultrasound abilities yet but the sleep sounds I listen too at night is far improved. I like the look too. I did blue to keep them figured out if I get more for another room later. So far the only irritating thing is I have to repeat myself for Alexa to start playing something but it did that with echo3.

Greg,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2020","I have 8 Echos in various rooms and from several generations. Yep, I have a big house... What attracted me to this generation was that onboard voice capabilities that makes response faster and sure, who doesn’t want even better sound quality? I also liked the design better than the looks of the previous generations and that I could see the activity ‘light ring’ when I was sitting down. The spherical designed has some real advantages and it’s apparent in the improved sound. And improved it is. Music is easily better, more complex and effortless. This is NOT supposed to be a blast the neighborhood out speaker, but it did fill a larger room with quality sounding music that is noticeably improved to past generations. Voice commands and responses are practically instant and tigger happy quickly improved... Me likes so much that I replaced 2 of my 8 for in the areas where I am most using them. I even returned my first gen to amazon to get 25$ off then new one. Understand, my old ones are in pristine condition with all the original packaging and boxes, but how great to be able to do this!

My whole house is voice controlled, lighting, fireplaces (ceramic logs with LED ‘fake fire lights’), thermostat and as an early adopter of the Echo Voice Assistant, I’ve never looked back. Being able to ask any question, to ask about a stores hours before even driving there to make sure it’s open and then being given the option to phone DIRECTLY from the device, is sweet. And how about NEVER having to touch your alarm clock to hit snooze or turn it off again? Yes please. Get quick and accurate local weather reports instantly, air quality too! Need to be reminded, multiple timers or announcements and intercom functions. Just say the word. I have every news channel I want set in my flash briefing and LOVE these, hearing them most days. Here’s my line up: Daily scripture, this day in history, Fox news, BBC news, Management tip of the day and a few more. You can easily add what YOU want to hear and it’s a treat. I LOVE podcasts and there’s a series called “Hardcore History” with hundred of episodes. Some of which are 6 hours long! What’s cool is I can start one of these while I’m cooking in the kitchen, tell the device to stop when I’m finished and when I later (day, month, weeks or whatever) tell it to “Play Hardcore History” it will name the episode I left off on and pick it up for exactly the same spot! How sweet that??

And guys, knock yourselves out because there are thousands of podcasts on virtually any subjects to enjoy and learn from. I love having this ability!!! LOVE, Love, love the ability to always be learning new things from this device while still doing what I do do in the background. There’s so much more and I could literally go on for hours with what a great enhancement this has been in so many ways, learning, security, information, entertainment, news, communications, etc. Being able to have my arms full, walk though my house and just TEll a light to turn on along the way without having to touch or find a switch is sublime! Yep, you need the right lights, but boy, talk about convenience and living in the future now. NEVER going back! Even my landscaping lights and sprinkler control system, my security cameras works with it. And if I want to make an announcement to the whole house, I just say, “Echo, repeat EVERYWHERE” and then tell it what I want to say. And all 8, in every room will go off: “Dinner is in 5 minutes!” So sweet!

I also have 2 of the Echo Clocks that work with the device and they are awesome. The LED ring and countdown before the alarm going off is sweet.

But guys, I even LOVE just telling the Echo to play rain/storm sound effects and it’s calming, deep and healing. What a wonderful, effortless device with so many capabilities. Even during one of my personal bible studies, I can ask Echo for some background on virtually anyone I reading about and background is forthcoming.

Yes, I was an early adopter and man, these are a purchase I’ve never regretted making. I use them EVERY day and they have enhanced my life in ways that are special, rich and convenient. Like something out of a Dick Tracy comic from the 1930’s, this system is here, ripe, mature and developed. I’m such a fan!

The only suggestion I have for Amazon would be to give me the option in a metal package. Who wants to dust fabric? Lastly, IF you built in even great Biblical knowledge capability, you’d sell even millions more. Give me a teaching assistant that has a data base to field just about anything biblical I could ask of it.

LOVING this product and the direction it’s going. The future IS now and ECHO is the best, most supported, device with thousands and thousands of functions. Thank you Amazon and keep enhancing this baby because I’m upgrading all along the way. I returned on for a discount and the other 1st gen is going to a charity raffle. And heck, it’s in perfect condition with all the original packaging and boxes.

Hot Dog!

S. Fox,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2023","This was my first smart speaker purchase. Initially, I only wanted a portable Bluetooth speaker to move between my office and garage. I didn’t find anything with decent sound for under $100, so I started looking at smart speakers compatible with Amazon and Google. Per the many reviews I read, both the Amazon Echo and the Google Nest have good sound, but the Echo has better sound than the Nest. The Echo also has a 3.5mm jack while the Nest does not, so I chose the Echo. I wanted that jack as a way to connect my Walkman and listen to my playlists instead of using Bluetooth and draining Walkman battery.

My Echo arrived a few days ago and here is my review. Other smart speaker brands like Sonos, Bose, and Sony were way too expensive for my application and many were not fully compatible with all of the Alexa and Google features. That was a surprise. Plus, they were still mono speakers like the Echo and Nest.

Amazon immediately sent a link so I could start the setup process before receiving the Echo. That also gave me time to download and take a good look at the Alexa app on my Android phone. This initial setup process only took a few minutes. When the Echo arrived, I read the documentation, then plugged it in and finished the setup process using the app. There are a lot of possible settings, but many didn’t apply to me because I am not using any smart devices. This process also was easy.

I plugged my Walkman into the 3.5 mm jack and didn’t hear any audio. Later, I figured out that the jack can be configured as an output to another speaker or as an input from devices like my Walkman and the default is as an output. Problem solved.

The buttons on top of the Echo are clearly marked and are raised, so they are easy to identify and operate. The Echo has some weight to it that makes it stable when placed on my desk or workbench. It is light enough to make it portable. The Echo is not considered as a portable device because it must be plugged in, so I added a power supply ($15 on Amazon) in my garage and now I do consider it portable. The ring at the bottom turns blue when Alexa is connected. There is a button to turn the microphone off if desired. The sound is pretty decent; not Hi-Fi but certainly good enough for my purposes and better than the portable Bluetooth speakers I initially looked at. The Bluetooth connection between the Echo and my Walkman took less than a minute to create. That’s great because my Walkman has had issues trying to connect to external speakers in the past. The Echo also recognized a Bluetooth signal from other devices in my house, but I didn’t need to connect any of them.

I had not planned to use the Echo as a smart device, but found it so easy and convenient that I am using it fairly often for weather forecasts, to find out what channel a game is on, for current news, and other things. It’s fun and Alexa answers almost immediately. Some reviewers complained that they have to repeat requests or speak loudly to get a response from their Echo. I have not had any issues at all, even with Amazon Music playing and the volume up.

The best thing is that Amazon was selling the Echo for half price when I purchased it. I neglected to choose a color so my order defaulted to blue. It’s a soft blue and I like it. The only thing I don’t like, and other reviews have commented on this, is that regardless of the Echo color the power supply and cable are white. They should be same color as the Echo.

So far, I am thrilled with my purchase. Easy to setup, easy to use, responsive, sounds good, portable, and looks good. I can operate the Echo either directly through the speaker and buttons or through the Alexa app on my phone. Both work well. I started with my phone during setup, but now only use the speaker.

Update: Amazon replaced my Echo with a new one. The hum problem is now resolved. It is just as responsive and sounds just as good as the original echo that I returned had has no issues. Now that I have spent some time with the Echo I am glad I chose it over the Google Nest.",5.0 out of 5 stars
SubieNewbie,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2021","This is an honest review and comparison of the new 4th Generation Echo (not Dot) vs. the 2nd Generation Echo Plus (the last Echo Plus that was launched with the 3td Generation Echo).

I actually purchased two 4th Gen Echoes to create a Home Theater Group with the FireTV Stick 4k latest variant. I'll include notes about that as well.

Sound Quality Pros: I really enjoy music from different genres and I like to tinker with equalizer settings so that I get the fullest sound out of even a cheap speaker. I also like when a speaker(s) can pull double duty as a surround sound system for my television as well. That's what attracted me to the new Echoes.

Regarding music streaming from Amazon Music HD, I must say the sound is really smooth and crisp. I adjusted the equalizer settings for the individual devices in the Alexa app to boost the mid most, followed closely by the treble and a moderate bass setting (if they are paired in a stereo pair or Home Theater, adjusting one device automatically adjusts the other). I have my Echoes placed about 12 feet away in front of my primary seating spot on the sofa and the are spaced about 8 feet apart flanking the television. They are situated about 4 feet off the ground on book shelves. This positioning has been perfect for the accoustics in my 15x18 living room with tall ceilings. The speakers really fill up the space. And I am most impressed with how the sound bounces off of the walls and truly feel as if it surrounds me and immerses my eardrums into it.

This holds even more true for when I watch a movie with the Dolby Atmos setting on. I can hear the channels fairly well and it really seems like I own my own private movie theater in my living room. There's been times that there's a sound affect so specific to one channel and reproduced so clearly that I've actually muted the show thinking that I was hearing some noise from outside or in the hallway of my apartment building.

These two devices together get pretty loud without any noticeable distortion. Now I haven't played much bass heavy music but I do love action and sci-fi movies that are sound effect laden and peppered with bass booming explosions etc. The new 4th Gen Echoes keep up very nicely.

In contrast, though I thought I really loved the Echo Plus 2nd Gen, I now find that I really can't enjoy music or movies as much on it. I think that this is because the main speaker fires downward and the rest of the sound is omni directional. This sounds good on paper but in practice, at least for my uses, that type of speaker just seems muffled and really a waste of sound waves. Let me explain. How often to you place the Echo device in the center of a room to benefit from an omni-directional speaker? Most people don't have floor outlets under their coffee tables so it sits on an end table or bookshelf. It's usual home in a bedroom is on the end table. Even in a kitchen, unless placed on the island, the Echo rests with it's back to a wall. So, why then, would you want (let's say) 40% of the sound waves to be directed to a big slab with no ears to appreciate it?

The directional sound setup of the new Echo 4th Gen is ideal, really, for it's positioning in most homes. Sound is really diminished if you are behind it or immediately to it's side but comes barrelling at your ear drums when you are any angle in front of it. It's louder, more clear, and much more advanced when it comes to being able to utilize Dolby Atmos playback. I definitely choose the 4th gen over the 2nd Gen Plus any day. I almost feel bad for unloading the Plus onto my parents when I bought the 4th Gen. I'll upgrade them this Christmas. Lol.

The omni-directional speaker would be a benefit if it were placed in the center of a patio for a gathering or party, but again, where's your outlets? Not in the middle of the concrete or deck floor. So chances are, even on the patio, it will be placed backing up to an exterior wall. So the myth of the omni-directional speaker advantage is busted in my book.

Voice Recognition:
At first, I felt there was a noticeable difference with the Plus having the upper hand when I comes to summoning Alexa. However, I believe there have been some fairly large software updates recently that included fine tuning adjustments to the mics on the 4th Gen devices. They now clearly pick up my questions or commands from across the room and quickly cancel out the other Echo Dot I have on the far side open floor plan nearest the kitchen. Before, with the Plus, it was a toss up as to which one would respond because I firmly believe the best mics are still on the Echo Dot 3rd Gen with clock variant. Hands down. If only the echo show 5 in my bedroom would be even half as good, I'd be happy ( that unit is by far the worst with just 2 lack luster mics vs the 4 on the Dot and Plus).

Alexa is also quicker to respond on the 4th Gen too. Now that's a combination of the 450-ish gbps internet speed I am fortunate enough to have but I understand it's also due to a better processor and improved software.

And let me just say one thing... I don't know anyone who buys their smart home devices with Zigbee compatibility being the #1 consideration. Who cares? I have bought the best reviewed for the price smart bulbs, TV, and plugs etc not giving a thought to Zigbee because the latest generation smart devices don't require a hub.

All of my smart home devices work just fine by enabling the skill on the Alexa app with that of the manufacturer's chosen app and linking the accounts. The biggest issue I have is trying to remember what I named each lamp and group to turn on and off the lights. First world problems, I know.

For what it's worth, the big 3 smart home apps which seems to be used by these el cheapo devices are Kasa, Govee, and Smart Life. I have devices on all three and the Alexa integration is seemless. Except the darn ceiling fan speed control. Still haven't completely figured that one out entirely.

Setting up the devices and Grouping:
Both the Echo Plus and 4th Gens are very easy to set up initially. The Alexa app, though not entirely user friendly regarding the UI, does all the work and guides you through the process fairly quickly. The oddball thing that's a bit more challenging is knowing what the difference is between a stereo pair, a home theater and a speaker group.

First, a stereo pair must be two identical models (I believe an Echo Sub woofer can be added as the one off) and the pairing is only for music streaming. Only one Echo will respond at a time when you are conversationally interacting with Alexa.

In a Home Theater grouping, one or more Echo devices of the same model can be joined with a FireTV device such as the Stick 4k. A sub can also be added. The crummy part at first, is that you can't include your existing sound bar into this Home Theater Group. Amazon devices only, folks. So you must choose which you want to listen to.

Now, I'm not horribly disappointed because the sound quality of the two 4th Gens on each side of the TV is really great so the sound bar isn't needed but I hate the thought of the wasted money sitting 32 inches wide in front of me producing no sound at all.

IF, you have a smart TV like a Vizio, there is a way to activate the sound bar and have the Amazon Home Theater working at the same time. And here it is: the sound bar must be hooked up to an optical cable and the audio setting on the TV must be set to PCM not automatic. Auto defaults to whatever device you are streaming on ie a FireTV Stick. Then, while playing your FireTV Stick, choose the Home Theater as your audio source on the Fire TV menu. So in essence, the TV thinks it must send sound to the sound bar only while the Stick thinks it should be using the Home Theater. Through whatever glitch, I now have all three speakers working in tandem. BUT ONLY while using the FireTV device. It does not work if I am using the smart TV streaming apps from the Vizio home screen. Which I don't do anymore except for a couple things that are not found on the Amazon App store.

FYI, I don't believe that the Fire Edition Insignia and Toshiba televisions sold here and at Best Buy have the capability to set up the Home Theater function with the Alexa app.

Finally, a speaker group is the best way to get unlike models to sync with each other to play music. However, there's a catch... You must ask for that group's every time at the end of your request to play music etc.

Meaning, with the stereo pair and home theater, music and movies are automatically played through those selected speakers by means of the Alexa app. You would simply make the standard request for Alexa to play a song or album with no extra added specification. But remember, you're limited to only pairing the same models together for this to work like that.

Now, with a speaker group, you can include your Echoes, Dots, Shows, Spots, Inputs, FireTVs, Tablets etc etc into that group and have them all going at the same time through out your home, so long as you name this all-Echo inclusive group something like ""Every where"" or ""all speakers"" or ""whole house"". Be creative :) ""Echo Symphonic Orchestra"", ""Live from the Love Shack"", or ""on all decks of the Enterprise"" (you can even call your individual room groupings for lights and sounds things like "" the Bridge"" -Living Room, ""Ship's Galley"" -Kitchen, ""Ten Forward"" - dining or rec room, ""Shuttle Bay Two""-garage, "" Engineering""-utility room/basement, and ""Captain's Quarters""-master bedroom, ""Risa"" -backyard patio). Lol. Alexa groups can be named whatever you want! I digress though....

The point is you have to tell Alexa to play music AND include the name of the speaker group everytime or else music will just play from the device you speak into. Ex: ""Alexa play the song Starships on all decks of the Enterprise"" or (boring) ""Alexa, play Mr. Robot-o, everywhere"" or ""Play a lullaby in the dirty diaper factory (nursry)"". Get it?! I can sense your mind is starting to ignite like a solid rocket booster, now.

I really hope this helps someone. I know it's been a learning curve for me. And not always a lot of fun. Just wait til you first start exploring how to build your own custom routines or then decide to relocate devices into different rooms as you upgrade with new ones. It can be a labor of love...or regret.

Bottom line, if you are looking to upgrade but aren't entirely sure, try out the new Echo 4th Gen (especially in a pair for a Home Theater) and decide within 30 days if you really like them. Definitely explore the Alexa app and routines. And commit to replacing at least one bulb in each room with a color changing LED smart bulb to experience the fun you can have with this device. Also, I think you will be pleasantly surprised at what many people say is a drawback about being a directional speaker is really a benefit for most user's needs, including yours.

Some people will find fault in anything and some will find that they can't have everything to their exact liking. There's not a perfect smart speaker out there, so figure out what you must have features are, your nice to haves, and your deal breakers are and make the choice.
Regardless, enjoy these little glimpses of the future. Heck, they're even spherical shaped just like what the future devices and ships looked like in 2001: A Space Odyssey and Space Balls or a Borg scout ship, even. You gotta think that's at least a nice nod for sci-fi fans everywhere. Or if you are a devotee of mod design or simply a believer in form following function, then this ball of joy is sure to please. So, enjoy your new Echo; It's outta this world!

Rustam Alikhodjaev,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024","This is my third Echo device and second kind of. First two, Echo Pops, were purchased for my daughter. Actually, after I got one for her, she loved it so much that I decided to get another one for stereo and better sound overall. So she is happy! But the thing is after playing with Alexa while setting up my daughters Pops, I kind of fell in love with this device myself lol. So I bought a 4th generation Echo (thank you for Amazon Prime day and better price lol) and I’m very happy now. So as you can see on one of my pics the Echo is definitely larger than Echo pop, therefore takes a bit of more room which might be Cons for someone, it’s more than twice expensive and still has a white power cord lol. Those were Cons. And other ten thousand reasons to buy it will be Pros. Well the first main advantage over the Pop for me is a noticeable sound quality improvement (which is understandable since the Echo is a way larger therefore a speaker itself is definitely larger). No, I’m not trying to say Pop isn’t good. It’s a great speaker for its size and price, I’m just talking about my preferences now. So for its size and price Echo is an amazing speaker, sound quality is more than just decent, has pretty nice bass, especially on lower volumes, excellent quality built, has a tripod thread (or wall mount or any standard mount screw hole I believe) and has different color choices. Alexa does its job exactly the same way as on Pops (no surprise lol). I’ve got the one you see on my pics (something like blue I believe) just in case, because I’m still dreaming about its larger brother/sister (whatever lol) - Echo Studio. So “just in case” means our kitchen cabinets color surprisingly matches my new Echo so I’m thinking to move this useful companion to our kitchen in the future. I still feel I’m a beginner in Alexa universe so she can’t stop surprising me with my smart devices. With my new Echo I also ordered a smart bulb to see how it works together and of course I’m pleasantly surprised - I don’t have to lift my lazy bottom out of bed anymore, my bedroom nightstand light is voice operated now. Alexa turns it on or off, Alexa dims it to my desired preferences, Alexa turns it on in the mornings thanks to my routine group setting. Love the feature how easy to listen to my favorite music around our apartment now - I just asked Alexa to play music everywhere and my playlist started to sound on all 3 Echo devices we have (had to create an “everywhere” group before by the way). Just Amazing! I’m not talking about thousands of other features Alexa offers like weather, news, history, songs etc… etc… etc… After my little experience with both Pop and Echo and all the features Alexa offers my point of view about Echo devices changes, and not to Alexa or AI side, they are not perfect yet, but definitely improving, and Alexa works equally on both devices, so here is a matter of future software updates. It changes towards the Echo devices now. I can clearly hear the sound difference, both, in my opinion, perfect for its size as I mentioned above, and especially its price range. Sorry for comparison, but my $200+ Bose speaker sound exactly the same as my new Echo (and Bose doesn’t have Alexa living inside lol (or who knows maybe there is something I’m not aware of yet, but Bose still can’t beat the price). So after my first Echo Pop purchase, I’m impressed again, now with even better sound quality. Even now, during my finger gymnastics writing this review I’m thinking again to buy a next Echo for our bedroom and then Echo Studio for our living room. Oh, then garage, laundry………etc. So pleasant to have that amazing feeling of satisfaction of spending money the right way lol. Hope someone will find my review helpful.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kevin,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","I have one of each - a black one, a blue one, and a white one. I've been using them for about 3 years, and I absolutely love them.

Pros:
- Sound quality is amazing, I use mine to play music when I'm in the kitchen, in the office, or in the bedroom. Lots of bass, superb quality for such a small speaker.
- As stated, small speaker. They take up so little space, yet do so much. I have the bedroom one positioned behind my TV, my office one is on my book shelf, and my kitchen one is just sitting on the counter. They fill the entire room with music, and do an absolutely amazing job of it.
- Integrations with everything. My Alexa handles my lights, my thermostat, the TVs, the lights, it tells me when people are at the door, it reminds me of packages, it plays my music via Spotify just by asking, I get my morning news fix from it, sets my timers, wakes me up. It basically does everything for me that I would otherwise have to do on my own. Excellent little device.

Cons:
- They are sometimes terrible listeners. I'll ask Alexa to turn the lights off, and it'll take anywhere from one ask to 5 asks to get the lights to turn off. That could be an integration issue, but sometimes she'll say ""playing lighthouse by -"" and I'll have to scramble to tell her to stop (especially in the middle of the night).
- Sometimes annoying to setup. If you ask her to do something on a schedule, you have to go into the app and dig around for the settings in order to make her stop, you can't just request that she stop doing it. Currently my office Alexa will tell me the weather every day at 6:31pm, on the dot. I've asked her to stop, she doesn't know how. I've looked in the app, can't find it.

Other than that, truly one of the best additions to my house. They get a fairly large amount of use around here.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Bailey,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2024",This Echo is perfect for our garage and back patio areas. It extends our WiFi (eero) and allows us to have better WiFi in the outdoor areas of our yard. The actual device was easy to setup with our Alexa app and is a great addition to our home for music and Alexa where we want it. The sound quality is much better than the first generation Echo we replaced. The color helps it fit right in. It is subtle and looks nice. The value is great with this device.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Arthur,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2023","Well, I have to say I love that its a speaker that has Alexa on it. If I had to complain though it would be easy truthfully. The music function. I had the advertised Unlimited plus music feature, after it was advertised as the only way for my grandmother to play certain old songs she was looking for with ease instead of her asking and then getting a different song with an advertisement worked in. However, it worked out for 2 seconds because I thought, why not pay more and get an Amazon Echo dot too for her room ao she could listen through the house. So that apparently added almost 20 bucks a month to a free service we had before. Mind you, I already pay for Prime and I added the Music Unlimited. But because she wanted to play her music softly in her room for ambience and then play it differently in the livingroom, Amazon said she had to upgrade to another more expensive music package called Unlimited Family. Thats the only way to she can listen to music she wants on her devices throughout her home. Again, the service costs more than most video services and is more than spotify, xm radio, or well just about any radio service that allows the option to pick a song via voice recognition these days. They really like to nickel and dime you for the most basic things and it isnt riggt in my opinion. If you pay to have music options through Amazons library, why should you pay more and more for ease of getting to that music? I mean, Amazon music uses to have all the music I could ever look for free with my Amazon Prime membership. And I think they added the voice search feature before this fee on top of a fee thing happened. It is crazy to me that every time you want to actually use the products that come out to the desirable extent they are advertised, you get either microtransactions blown at you, or even worse now you get a hefty monthly additional bill. Again, after being a member with the company paying a monthly fee for over a decade. Why would they think this would keep customer loyalty? All it does is make customers hope for and await another option that has something similar or even a little less nice for a better price. Can you imagine if a competitor like Ebay or Facebook got together and created a decent music library access via buying something like soundcloud or spotify. It has to be easy for the CEOs to themeselves want another option on a platform built similar to the Echo. And people themselves in the public that for the middle class have to like me be eager to seek out that second option. Yes the supply chain and easy shipping options makes it the onlyntrue source to buy things quickly and easily and Prime is still a great deal for that reason. But the echo, the dot, etc... are all just waiting to be taken off the shelves at this rate. And it is awful, because the advertised version and or even the versions where you can use the full functionality after burning a million dollars on unlocking them each month proves the Echo and its component products can do and be great products that make amazon something worth keeping a membership with for years to come. However, selling a product to active prime members and then putting limiters all over the software with the intent to create more monthly revenue on a loyal cusyomer base that you could of just succeeded in making that much more reliant on keeping a membership. Thats jist greedy and dumb at the same time. The echo or other products of this line have zero need to have these extra upcharges is the point. Get rid of them before your customers get rid of the products tge moment a better option becomes viable. Yes we will keep prime for the shipping. But heck, prime video is just rediculous right now with advertisements, fees for decent shows and movies and then just nothing of real value for prime members. It used to be a great service with limited options. But we loved and used it all the same because it was free for Prime members. Same with Amazon music. I loved it and used it all the time. No its advertisements for every song or monthly fees. So tired of the fee onslaught that comes with buying anything that looks like its useful these days. Thats the summary here. Amazon, you dont need to do what your doing. Your products have the ability to be in every household and used regularly everywhere. You will make a killing just selling the next updated color of the echo. Imstead of closing up video and music access. Eat the costs on rights and give it to your prime customers. You already raised rates for that too. But your cutting services on top of raising rates. What are you thinking. Your monopoly isnt unbeatable. Its difficult to see past the day people choose something better knowing what your chains look like right now. But Im telling you, this way of pushing customers for everything you want just because you can at the moment will end up making you the myspace of well....you know. Thats just my and millions of other peoples opinion though right now. So take it for what its worth.",5.0 out of 5 stars
L. Hardy,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2024","So, I have a audiophile grade two speaker stereo main system, but I have Echos throughout the house to provide seamless sound from room to room. It all makes me happy. But wait, I just read that Amazon is going to start charging a monthly fee of $5 to $10 for Alexa AI and the current speakers won't work. This makes me ungruntled, and mumbling about Amazon's continuous bait and switch. From one day shipping shifting to multiday shipping, to creating faux TV channels that you have to buy or rent movies on rather than including them in their Prime package, to the creation of Woot to see their unsellable stuff (good luck getting a warranty on Woot junk). 3/4 of the stuff sold on Amazon is actually from China sold by China, not US sellers.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Brian Thomas,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2024","This is my second Echo. I wanted one for my workbench. Two is, in fact, better than one. In addition to using this in a second location I have also on occasion paired it in the same space with my first Echo. The stereo of having two Echo's in one room was awesome. Perfect for chilling to some good music. You can set these to play the same music in different parts of the house. If you upgrade your Amazon Music account you can play different music in different parts of the house at the same time. I use the basic Amazon Music because I only listen in one part of the house at a time. They can also connect through Bluetooth to the TV for an even better theater experience. I use this mode for watching football. Echo's can also have macros. If I say, ""Alexa, good night"" Alexa tells me, ""Good night"" turns down to the lowest volume and plays the Ambient music station for 30 minutes. This was very easy to set up. I can't say enough about why having an Echo will improve your life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
AkarueKa,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2022","A friend of mine recently gave me an echo. 2nd Gen. And I didn't think I was going to wind up using it very much but being visually impaired I wound up using it a lot more than I expected.

I came to find out that I could listen to my audible books and also my kindle books read to me which is great for my visual impairment it makes it a lot more enjoyable during the day when I become bored with trying to figure out what is actually on the television with my provision some things are just not watchable like they used to be.

But the echo. 2nd Gen. Speakers are well they leave a lot to be desired and I had to add additional speakers so when I saw this item I was like I'm gonna go see what the reviews are like and everyone said they were awesome they're awesome and so much better than the. 2nd Gen. So I decided to go ahead and get one for my birthday as a gift to myself and additionally I got the battery and the silicone carry case combination to go with it and I can take the thing all over my house in my yard and that is so cool.

Since I've gotten this particular one though I have found there are so many other things that I can do with it other than just listen to my audio books and kindle books I can listen to podcasts I can get the daily news I can check the temperature in the room that the echo is in it is in which is really cool because I don't have an interior thermostat in my house I run on a space here and a wood stove so I never know what the interior temperature of my house is but I do now.

There are also cool games you can play play I've been playing prices right and Trivia and a choose your own adventure kind of game andAre you smarter than a 5th grader by the way I'm smarter than a 5th grader.

I opted in for Amazon music and not only am I finding all the songs that I've forgotten from my past but I found some really cool new ones things things that I would have never found without this echo.

I've created playlists that when I'm in the mood for one thing or another I just tell she who cannot be named what playlist I want to hear and all of a sudden there I am.

She can also actuate my televisionI have a roku TV but I have also added a fireStick as well and she can actuate both of them and also my easy buzz camera that I have to keep an eye on my front porch and yard and be able to speak to people out there when I have guests without going to the door.

Being visually impaired this thing is a real helping hand the only thing would be better is if she could clean my house maybe Amazon will get there eventually.

But for now I'm very fond of this device

Other cool additional thingsI like how much bass the speaker has I like to listen to binaural beats music and meditation music and some dance music for exercise and I can feel the music it's pretty cool.

The speaker is pretty darn decent.

I chose the white version because because white is a color that I can see better with my vision the only concern I have is that the speaker cover might eventually get dirty but they get dirty I try to dust it on a daily basis just to make sure.

We also are using it for well-to-do list for one, alarms, oh and I've set a household network up where the smaller echo. that I was gifted is now in my kitchen and I can play them as a group oop or someone in my kitchen can drop in on me and ask me if I want dinner or if I'm busy and vice versa I can drop in on them as well well additionally I've set it up so I can tell it to make phone calls directly from my cell phone and works as a great speaker phone I've tested it out a few times and everybody says that they can hear me just fine and clear.

By the way for a little fun ask her to Beam me up Scottie.

Jeff S,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2022","I have my apartment which is not a small apartment and it has a loft as well for my 12-year-old son so he has his own area he’s getting to that age so anyway I had I think 5 echo dots and one echo show that had the visual screen for pictures and things like that but without a subwoofer or anything I was fine with the multi room music and I used it for that and basically also used it so I could just tell any of my echo dots or just basically when I open the door I would say Alexa Turn on my apartment!! Immediately all of my lights would come on and some of them are dimmed to a certain level which you can do in the settings on your Alexa app that most people have on their phones. I even have a couple lightbulbs that are multicolored so I have them set to green and red currently for Christmas!! So the lights all come on when I tell Alexa to do that including my living room TV as well. You can add numerous other items that are compatible with Alexa and/or SmartThings app and you name it. If you don’t have something that is compatible or doesn’t have Bluetooth or wifi etc… as long as you use a plugin for that item you can at MINIMUM turn it off and on with your voice or touch screen on your phone or Alexa show and I bought 2 of these Echoes because my friends have one or more and it is a sphere. So even though it’s twice as big as the echo dot, in the newer generations at least, they started out looking like a hockey puck which is still good and people have them still but I started using Alexa products just a couple years ago so, mine are all round balls that you can talk to and play music and control lights and cameras for security while home or check on your home while you’re not there!!

I bought 2 regular Echoes to replace 2 of the echo dots because they have 3 or 4 different speakers in each one!!! Crazy how much sound you get from the dot but the bigger one the regular echo, sounds like a huge floor speaker but it’s just a ball and you can get black or white or blue and more so I got 2 of them to pair together for stereo sound and to my Samsung TV that has an Alexa app built into it. So I can rock out or get surround sound when paired with my TV and Soundbar Sub woofer which I don’t use the soundbar anymore the echoes sounded better but I got them last month. They were 49.99 a piece!!! That’s like half price and why I hadn’t bought them before so for 100 bucks I have a completely wonderful set of speakers that you barely notice and they sound wonderful and you can buy them with a Studio speaker by Amazon or an Amazon Subwoofer bundled for even more awesome sound but I live in an apartment so I don’t want to get kicked out!!! They act as a hub for all of your Amazon devices also so you don’t need anything else but one echo honestly to run all of your lights just get the type of bulbs they suggest and they have bundles for those also and it’s truly amazing what quality of sound and other things that they can do but I have already typed far toooooo much. Start with 1 even for listening to music over the holidays and add devices as you go. That’s what I did and 2 years later I have it set up so we’ll that I can talk to my son when he’s at his Moms house on his echo and my echo here and there’s no need for buying him a cellphone!! Yet!!
There’s just so much I could say about what these things do for 50 bucks to get one of them is a steal because you’re just keep adding things and finding different things like grocery list reminders and alarms. It helps you with many things you wouldn’t even imagine.
So now, when I open my door to my apartment, I have it set to where the lights automatically come on with my TV. I don’t even have to talk. It’ll do that too so kudos to the designers of these things because they are very affordable and do so much.!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Quick answer: Deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation” when activating your 2.4 Wi-Fi broadcast on your router.

Back story: Last week I was at my wits end in utter frustration over three major roadblocks. The reason I switched to Alexa from Apple for smart home controls was over not being able to connect most Apple HomeKit devices into HomeKit, and the blasted issue of only being able to select more than one, ..1, ..ONE! echo speaker at a time to play music. I was continually blocked from setting up Multi-Room or even pair echo speakers. Hundreds of tries. I deleted, rebooted, spent 4 hours with Comcast getting my internet working again today because I rebooted my modem and router so much, they got molasses slow and stopped trying.
In interest I also am trying a few Google speakers. They wouldn’t stay connected to the internet for more than a split second before “Something went wrong” message. Probably over 70 tries.
Thursday, I broke down and bought my first homepod mini (wow, sound is really nice, but too high of price), and it gave me a hint how to solve all these other internet blocks.
It kept telling me that I don’t have “peer-to-peer connection” allowed on my network.

Now, I’m a little techy, but it took three days to finally take a chance on a for granted setting I always enable on my netgear router. It’s the blasted first Wireless page when enabling a wifi broadcast. I had to deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation.” That was it. It solved every issue I have come across with smart home tech for the last 4 months.

Tonight, I finally am able to play music at the same time on all my Echo speakers. I definitely will be putting these all over. Love.

For the months that I could not solve these problems, Amazons Multi-Player Music issue made me dig deeper. I did not find anyone suggesting this setting, so I thought I’d share. It may be out there, but it’s buried in the plethora of inquiries of people pleading for solutions.

I’m not sure what this will do for my/your internet security. But I’m going with it for now. And I’ll try to putt all devices back onto guest Wi-Fi.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Stephen Elmore,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2020","I really have enjoyed both my second and third generation Echos and bought this one for its change of shape and it was on sale plus 5 payment option.
First off the bad. If you're used to room enveloping sound with no sense of stereo this one will disappoint. Dual tweeters firing forward give it a true sense of direction so sticking it in a corner and have it fill the room will not be as satisfying. You'll notice where it's located more, especially if there's anything blocking your direct line of sight ( hearing ) . Where I keep mine only needed a slight shift to make it not be partially blocked by my sofa . Volume was still plenty loud in its old spot but it just didn't sound right. Easily solved but might not be that easy for others and some might actually prefer the directional sound more.
The bass can be a bit boomy though while listening to YYZ live in Rio the bass drum didn't sound bad at all and overall everything was satisfactory though slightly lacking in the mid highs. The eq settings in the Alexa app are set to flat on all 3 choices .
It's wider at the base than the previous generations by a lot. This could be a problem for some .
Star Trek Self Destruct Skill doesn't work on this one or my 4th gen Dot but does fine on my previous generation ones for some reason . Instead of blowing up my den it searches for ""zero zero zero"" movies on my Fire Stick. I'm sure that won't last long though .
Enough about the bad.
The bass is no longer wannabe but real. No longer does it struggle with everything below mid level voices but as I wrote above , bass drums actually sound like bass drums and Ends of the Earth by Lord Huron excels at all of the music ranges considering its size. Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams also sounded very nice across the sound spectrum . Music For Tables extreme from the high notes in the keyboard to the lows didn't miss a thing whereas the cow bell was very slightly muddy but the wood blocks sounded right . Am I saying it's as awesome as my studio headphones ? Not by any means but they took a huge step forward over the 3rd generation , which I was quite content with .
Response time seems noticeably faster and more accurate than the gen 3 I use . Only once did Alexa not understand my query and that was while setting up a traffic check routine. All I had to do was rephrase a little and now Alexa tells me the commute traffic and fastest way to get to work 5 minutes before I have to leave . 95 is terrible for accidents and Maps tells Alexa the best alternative if there's any.
I think my favorite thing though is the new shape and I REALLY like the lights being on the bottom, especially once the lights go off .
If you're still smitten with your gen 3 Echo or don't like the mini Death Star look of the new model skip this one as the performance improvements are readily apparent they're not earth shattering. Amazon will have to do something mind blowing next year to get me to part with my dough ray me for a gen 5. The more I listen to Fourplay on Echo the more I'm liking it for the music , nevermind all the super cool stuff I can do on it or my Dots or my Flex .",5.0 out of 5 stars

Goofy Jessie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024","So my eight year old echo in my bedroom stopped working. And I did without Alexa in my bedroom for a couple of years. Finally, I gave in and ordered a 4th gen echo. I’ve always thought the best thing about the echo was Alexa. Especially with Halloween fast approaching.

The sad reality it's that Alexa is not as advanced as its competitors. I compared Alexa’s response when I inquire about the weather. Alexa provides the answer, but it’s not exactly accurate. Its competitors provide the actual temperature, but they go a step further and provide “how it actually feels” by accounting for humidity, which in some parts of the country can be a difference of over ten degrees. I also ask her to turn on or off a smart light bulb that worked just fine with my eight year old echo. The same bulb its competitors easily turn on or off. Alexa on this brand new Echo fails. Can’t do it. I was going to pack it up. Return it.

But then, out of sentimentality, I ask Alexa to play some jazz music. State of Jazz, Part 80. Wow. Deep bass. Clean treble. Impressive highs. Sound even better than my stand alone Bose speaker. Kid. You. Not.

Instead of returning it, I’ll keep it. I’ll order some Kasa light bulbs. Kasa never fails. Never. And hope I don’t regret keeping this Echo.

And I’m really hoping the rumors about an upgraded Alexa in October are true. Because I love Alexa, but she’s getting a little long in the tooth. Not as sharp. But still my sweetheart. Hey, if anyone from Amazon/Alexa happens to read this review, you might consider sending me some complimentary Kasa light bulbs. Or maybe a discount code. Here’s hoping Alexa is soon rejuvenated.

delber,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2024","Got the Echo Dot a couple of years ago and this Echo (4th Gen) a few weeks ago. Disappointed with this Echo. The frequency response is not what I was expecting. Bass is very good, however the treble is poor. When listening to music and I know there are symbols being played but I can't hear them, then it's not worth listening to the music. Don't know if the problem is a hardware design issue with the Echo or a deficiency in the software (equalizer). An example: I have just an average radio and speakers in my car, at best. Sound quality was poor. A few years ago I began using Pandora along with an equalizer application from the Google Play Store. This app from Google Play has 10 band equalizer. I'm playing my music from Pandora to my car radio via bluetooth and incorporating the equalizer app. The fidelity is absolutely AMAZING, dare I say 20Hz - 20kHz. What I'm trying to say is that I think the fidelity from Echo could be outstanding if Amazon put a little effort into the Alexa app and provided us with a much better equalizer.

Greg,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2020","I have 8 Echos in various rooms and from several generations. Yep, I have a big house... What attracted me to this generation was that onboard voice capabilities that makes response faster and sure, who doesn’t want even better sound quality? I also liked the design better than the looks of the previous generations and that I could see the activity ‘light ring’ when I was sitting down. The spherical designed has some real advantages and it’s apparent in the improved sound. And improved it is. Music is easily better, more complex and effortless. This is NOT supposed to be a blast the neighborhood out speaker, but it did fill a larger room with quality sounding music that is noticeably improved to past generations. Voice commands and responses are practically instant and tigger happy quickly improved... Me likes so much that I replaced 2 of my 8 for in the areas where I am most using them. I even returned my first gen to amazon to get 25$ off then new one. Understand, my old ones are in pristine condition with all the original packaging and boxes, but how great to be able to do this!

My whole house is voice controlled, lighting, fireplaces (ceramic logs with LED ‘fake fire lights’), thermostat and as an early adopter of the Echo Voice Assistant, I’ve never looked back. Being able to ask any question, to ask about a stores hours before even driving there to make sure it’s open and then being given the option to phone DIRECTLY from the device, is sweet. And how about NEVER having to touch your alarm clock to hit snooze or turn it off again? Yes please. Get quick and accurate local weather reports instantly, air quality too! Need to be reminded, multiple timers or announcements and intercom functions. Just say the word. I have every news channel I want set in my flash briefing and LOVE these, hearing them most days. Here’s my line up: Daily scripture, this day in history, Fox news, BBC news, Management tip of the day and a few more. You can easily add what YOU want to hear and it’s a treat. I LOVE podcasts and there’s a series called “Hardcore History” with hundred of episodes. Some of which are 6 hours long! What’s cool is I can start one of these while I’m cooking in the kitchen, tell the device to stop when I’m finished and when I later (day, month, weeks or whatever) tell it to “Play Hardcore History” it will name the episode I left off on and pick it up for exactly the same spot! How sweet that??

And guys, knock yourselves out because there are thousands of podcasts on virtually any subjects to enjoy and learn from. I love having this ability!!! LOVE, Love, love the ability to always be learning new things from this device while still doing what I do do in the background. There’s so much more and I could literally go on for hours with what a great enhancement this has been in so many ways, learning, security, information, entertainment, news, communications, etc. Being able to have my arms full, walk though my house and just TEll a light to turn on along the way without having to touch or find a switch is sublime! Yep, you need the right lights, but boy, talk about convenience and living in the future now. NEVER going back! Even my landscaping lights and sprinkler control system, my security cameras works with it. And if I want to make an announcement to the whole house, I just say, “Echo, repeat EVERYWHERE” and then tell it what I want to say. And all 8, in every room will go off: “Dinner is in 5 minutes!” So sweet!

I also have 2 of the Echo Clocks that work with the device and they are awesome. The LED ring and countdown before the alarm going off is sweet.

But guys, I even LOVE just telling the Echo to play rain/storm sound effects and it’s calming, deep and healing. What a wonderful, effortless device with so many capabilities. Even during one of my personal bible studies, I can ask Echo for some background on virtually anyone I reading about and background is forthcoming.

Yes, I was an early adopter and man, these are a purchase I’ve never regretted making. I use them EVERY day and they have enhanced my life in ways that are special, rich and convenient. Like something out of a Dick Tracy comic from the 1930’s, this system is here, ripe, mature and developed. I’m such a fan!

The only suggestion I have for Amazon would be to give me the option in a metal package. Who wants to dust fabric? Lastly, IF you built in even great Biblical knowledge capability, you’d sell even millions more. Give me a teaching assistant that has a data base to field just about anything biblical I could ask of it.

LOVING this product and the direction it’s going. The future IS now and ECHO is the best, most supported, device with thousands and thousands of functions. Thank you Amazon and keep enhancing this baby because I’m upgrading all along the way. I returned on for a discount and the other 1st gen is going to a charity raffle. And heck, it’s in perfect condition with all the original packaging and boxes.

Hot Dog!

S. Fox,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2023","This was my first smart speaker purchase. Initially, I only wanted a portable Bluetooth speaker to move between my office and garage. I didn’t find anything with decent sound for under $100, so I started looking at smart speakers compatible with Amazon and Google. Per the many reviews I read, both the Amazon Echo and the Google Nest have good sound, but the Echo has better sound than the Nest. The Echo also has a 3.5mm jack while the Nest does not, so I chose the Echo. I wanted that jack as a way to connect my Walkman and listen to my playlists instead of using Bluetooth and draining Walkman battery.

My Echo arrived a few days ago and here is my review. Other smart speaker brands like Sonos, Bose, and Sony were way too expensive for my application and many were not fully compatible with all of the Alexa and Google features. That was a surprise. Plus, they were still mono speakers like the Echo and Nest.

Amazon immediately sent a link so I could start the setup process before receiving the Echo. That also gave me time to download and take a good look at the Alexa app on my Android phone. This initial setup process only took a few minutes. When the Echo arrived, I read the documentation, then plugged it in and finished the setup process using the app. There are a lot of possible settings, but many didn’t apply to me because I am not using any smart devices. This process also was easy.

I plugged my Walkman into the 3.5 mm jack and didn’t hear any audio. Later, I figured out that the jack can be configured as an output to another speaker or as an input from devices like my Walkman and the default is as an output. Problem solved.

The buttons on top of the Echo are clearly marked and are raised, so they are easy to identify and operate. The Echo has some weight to it that makes it stable when placed on my desk or workbench. It is light enough to make it portable. The Echo is not considered as a portable device because it must be plugged in, so I added a power supply ($15 on Amazon) in my garage and now I do consider it portable. The ring at the bottom turns blue when Alexa is connected. There is a button to turn the microphone off if desired. The sound is pretty decent; not Hi-Fi but certainly good enough for my purposes and better than the portable Bluetooth speakers I initially looked at. The Bluetooth connection between the Echo and my Walkman took less than a minute to create. That’s great because my Walkman has had issues trying to connect to external speakers in the past. The Echo also recognized a Bluetooth signal from other devices in my house, but I didn’t need to connect any of them.

I had not planned to use the Echo as a smart device, but found it so easy and convenient that I am using it fairly often for weather forecasts, to find out what channel a game is on, for current news, and other things. It’s fun and Alexa answers almost immediately. Some reviewers complained that they have to repeat requests or speak loudly to get a response from their Echo. I have not had any issues at all, even with Amazon Music playing and the volume up.

The best thing is that Amazon was selling the Echo for half price when I purchased it. I neglected to choose a color so my order defaulted to blue. It’s a soft blue and I like it. The only thing I don’t like, and other reviews have commented on this, is that regardless of the Echo color the power supply and cable are white. They should be same color as the Echo.

So far, I am thrilled with my purchase. Easy to setup, easy to use, responsive, sounds good, portable, and looks good. I can operate the Echo either directly through the speaker and buttons or through the Alexa app on my phone. Both work well. I started with my phone during setup, but now only use the speaker.

Update: Amazon replaced my Echo with a new one. The hum problem is now resolved. It is just as responsive and sounds just as good as the original echo that I returned had has no issues. Now that I have spent some time with the Echo I am glad I chose it over the Google Nest.",5.0 out of 5 stars
SubieNewbie,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2021","This is an honest review and comparison of the new 4th Generation Echo (not Dot) vs. the 2nd Generation Echo Plus (the last Echo Plus that was launched with the 3td Generation Echo).

I actually purchased two 4th Gen Echoes to create a Home Theater Group with the FireTV Stick 4k latest variant. I'll include notes about that as well.

Sound Quality Pros: I really enjoy music from different genres and I like to tinker with equalizer settings so that I get the fullest sound out of even a cheap speaker. I also like when a speaker(s) can pull double duty as a surround sound system for my television as well. That's what attracted me to the new Echoes.

Regarding music streaming from Amazon Music HD, I must say the sound is really smooth and crisp. I adjusted the equalizer settings for the individual devices in the Alexa app to boost the mid most, followed closely by the treble and a moderate bass setting (if they are paired in a stereo pair or Home Theater, adjusting one device automatically adjusts the other). I have my Echoes placed about 12 feet away in front of my primary seating spot on the sofa and the are spaced about 8 feet apart flanking the television. They are situated about 4 feet off the ground on book shelves. This positioning has been perfect for the accoustics in my 15x18 living room with tall ceilings. The speakers really fill up the space. And I am most impressed with how the sound bounces off of the walls and truly feel as if it surrounds me and immerses my eardrums into it.

This holds even more true for when I watch a movie with the Dolby Atmos setting on. I can hear the channels fairly well and it really seems like I own my own private movie theater in my living room. There's been times that there's a sound affect so specific to one channel and reproduced so clearly that I've actually muted the show thinking that I was hearing some noise from outside or in the hallway of my apartment building.

These two devices together get pretty loud without any noticeable distortion. Now I haven't played much bass heavy music but I do love action and sci-fi movies that are sound effect laden and peppered with bass booming explosions etc. The new 4th Gen Echoes keep up very nicely.

In contrast, though I thought I really loved the Echo Plus 2nd Gen, I now find that I really can't enjoy music or movies as much on it. I think that this is because the main speaker fires downward and the rest of the sound is omni directional. This sounds good on paper but in practice, at least for my uses, that type of speaker just seems muffled and really a waste of sound waves. Let me explain. How often to you place the Echo device in the center of a room to benefit from an omni-directional speaker? Most people don't have floor outlets under their coffee tables so it sits on an end table or bookshelf. It's usual home in a bedroom is on the end table. Even in a kitchen, unless placed on the island, the Echo rests with it's back to a wall. So, why then, would you want (let's say) 40% of the sound waves to be directed to a big slab with no ears to appreciate it?

The directional sound setup of the new Echo 4th Gen is ideal, really, for it's positioning in most homes. Sound is really diminished if you are behind it or immediately to it's side but comes barrelling at your ear drums when you are any angle in front of it. It's louder, more clear, and much more advanced when it comes to being able to utilize Dolby Atmos playback. I definitely choose the 4th gen over the 2nd Gen Plus any day. I almost feel bad for unloading the Plus onto my parents when I bought the 4th Gen. I'll upgrade them this Christmas. Lol.

The omni-directional speaker would be a benefit if it were placed in the center of a patio for a gathering or party, but again, where's your outlets? Not in the middle of the concrete or deck floor. So chances are, even on the patio, it will be placed backing up to an exterior wall. So the myth of the omni-directional speaker advantage is busted in my book.

Voice Recognition:
At first, I felt there was a noticeable difference with the Plus having the upper hand when I comes to summoning Alexa. However, I believe there have been some fairly large software updates recently that included fine tuning adjustments to the mics on the 4th Gen devices. They now clearly pick up my questions or commands from across the room and quickly cancel out the other Echo Dot I have on the far side open floor plan nearest the kitchen. Before, with the Plus, it was a toss up as to which one would respond because I firmly believe the best mics are still on the Echo Dot 3rd Gen with clock variant. Hands down. If only the echo show 5 in my bedroom would be even half as good, I'd be happy ( that unit is by far the worst with just 2 lack luster mics vs the 4 on the Dot and Plus).

Alexa is also quicker to respond on the 4th Gen too. Now that's a combination of the 450-ish gbps internet speed I am fortunate enough to have but I understand it's also due to a better processor and improved software.

And let me just say one thing... I don't know anyone who buys their smart home devices with Zigbee compatibility being the #1 consideration. Who cares? I have bought the best reviewed for the price smart bulbs, TV, and plugs etc not giving a thought to Zigbee because the latest generation smart devices don't require a hub.

All of my smart home devices work just fine by enabling the skill on the Alexa app with that of the manufacturer's chosen app and linking the accounts. The biggest issue I have is trying to remember what I named each lamp and group to turn on and off the lights. First world problems, I know.

For what it's worth, the big 3 smart home apps which seems to be used by these el cheapo devices are Kasa, Govee, and Smart Life. I have devices on all three and the Alexa integration is seemless. Except the darn ceiling fan speed control. Still haven't completely figured that one out entirely.

Setting up the devices and Grouping:
Both the Echo Plus and 4th Gens are very easy to set up initially. The Alexa app, though not entirely user friendly regarding the UI, does all the work and guides you through the process fairly quickly. The oddball thing that's a bit more challenging is knowing what the difference is between a stereo pair, a home theater and a speaker group.

First, a stereo pair must be two identical models (I believe an Echo Sub woofer can be added as the one off) and the pairing is only for music streaming. Only one Echo will respond at a time when you are conversationally interacting with Alexa.

In a Home Theater grouping, one or more Echo devices of the same model can be joined with a FireTV device such as the Stick 4k. A sub can also be added. The crummy part at first, is that you can't include your existing sound bar into this Home Theater Group. Amazon devices only, folks. So you must choose which you want to listen to.

Now, I'm not horribly disappointed because the sound quality of the two 4th Gens on each side of the TV is really great so the sound bar isn't needed but I hate the thought of the wasted money sitting 32 inches wide in front of me producing no sound at all.

IF, you have a smart TV like a Vizio, there is a way to activate the sound bar and have the Amazon Home Theater working at the same time. And here it is: the sound bar must be hooked up to an optical cable and the audio setting on the TV must be set to PCM not automatic. Auto defaults to whatever device you are streaming on ie a FireTV Stick. Then, while playing your FireTV Stick, choose the Home Theater as your audio source on the Fire TV menu. So in essence, the TV thinks it must send sound to the sound bar only while the Stick thinks it should be using the Home Theater. Through whatever glitch, I now have all three speakers working in tandem. BUT ONLY while using the FireTV device. It does not work if I am using the smart TV streaming apps from the Vizio home screen. Which I don't do anymore except for a couple things that are not found on the Amazon App store.

FYI, I don't believe that the Fire Edition Insignia and Toshiba televisions sold here and at Best Buy have the capability to set up the Home Theater function with the Alexa app.

Finally, a speaker group is the best way to get unlike models to sync with each other to play music. However, there's a catch... You must ask for that group's every time at the end of your request to play music etc.

Meaning, with the stereo pair and home theater, music and movies are automatically played through those selected speakers by means of the Alexa app. You would simply make the standard request for Alexa to play a song or album with no extra added specification. But remember, you're limited to only pairing the same models together for this to work like that.

Now, with a speaker group, you can include your Echoes, Dots, Shows, Spots, Inputs, FireTVs, Tablets etc etc into that group and have them all going at the same time through out your home, so long as you name this all-Echo inclusive group something like ""Every where"" or ""all speakers"" or ""whole house"". Be creative :) ""Echo Symphonic Orchestra"", ""Live from the Love Shack"", or ""on all decks of the Enterprise"" (you can even call your individual room groupings for lights and sounds things like "" the Bridge"" -Living Room, ""Ship's Galley"" -Kitchen, ""Ten Forward"" - dining or rec room, ""Shuttle Bay Two""-garage, "" Engineering""-utility room/basement, and ""Captain's Quarters""-master bedroom, ""Risa"" -backyard patio). Lol. Alexa groups can be named whatever you want! I digress though....

The point is you have to tell Alexa to play music AND include the name of the speaker group everytime or else music will just play from the device you speak into. Ex: ""Alexa play the song Starships on all decks of the Enterprise"" or (boring) ""Alexa, play Mr. Robot-o, everywhere"" or ""Play a lullaby in the dirty diaper factory (nursry)"". Get it?! I can sense your mind is starting to ignite like a solid rocket booster, now.

I really hope this helps someone. I know it's been a learning curve for me. And not always a lot of fun. Just wait til you first start exploring how to build your own custom routines or then decide to relocate devices into different rooms as you upgrade with new ones. It can be a labor of love...or regret.

Bottom line, if you are looking to upgrade but aren't entirely sure, try out the new Echo 4th Gen (especially in a pair for a Home Theater) and decide within 30 days if you really like them. Definitely explore the Alexa app and routines. And commit to replacing at least one bulb in each room with a color changing LED smart bulb to experience the fun you can have with this device. Also, I think you will be pleasantly surprised at what many people say is a drawback about being a directional speaker is really a benefit for most user's needs, including yours.

Some people will find fault in anything and some will find that they can't have everything to their exact liking. There's not a perfect smart speaker out there, so figure out what you must have features are, your nice to haves, and your deal breakers are and make the choice.
Regardless, enjoy these little glimpses of the future. Heck, they're even spherical shaped just like what the future devices and ships looked like in 2001: A Space Odyssey and Space Balls or a Borg scout ship, even. You gotta think that's at least a nice nod for sci-fi fans everywhere. Or if you are a devotee of mod design or simply a believer in form following function, then this ball of joy is sure to please. So, enjoy your new Echo; It's outta this world!

Mike,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2022","I'm fairly new to the Alexa universe, and the 4th generation Echo is my first such device. My first impressions are that the sound quality (for the price and size of the device) is excellent. There is copious quantities of base. The highs are also quite good provided you place the speaker out in the open and are facing the front side of the device. The voice recognition is almost flawless if the room is quiet. However I found that Alex has some issues hearing me correctly whenever I was playing music, listening to the TV, or when my Roomba was banging around the house. I think it's reasonable that situations like this can cause Alexa to either not hear you, or misinterpret what you said.... and I can accept that.
My Echo's are connected to my 5GHz wifi network and are located all within 30 ft of my router. I've never had any issues with the wifi connection. A couple of times in the past 3 months the Alexa service has gone down, which can be a real issue. Luckily, ""most"" of my smart devices (Kasa and Feit) could all be controlled through their native apps. Fortunately for me, Alexa was only down for a couple of hours, and then all was good. The bad part was that my mother-in-law, who is in a wheelchair, uses Alexa to control the lights, ceiling fan, and TV in her apartment. The lesson here is that if you have a technically challenged person who relies of Alex, just realize that there will be times when Alex lets you down... and you'll need to have a backup plan to get buy until the service comes back online.
Regarding integration with other manufacturer's devices is hit and miss, depending on how main stream (widely used) their products are. I had no issues getting 5 Kasa smart plugs (for air cleaners and dehumidifier), 4 Kasa smart dimmers (for lights), 3 Kasa smart switches (for ceiling fans), and about 20 Feit smart bulbs, all connected and integrated into Alexa. Personally, before choosing a brand of smart product, go onto the Android/Apple app store (as appropriate for you), and check out the ""Start"" rating for that manufacturer's app. If it has a poor rating, it might be a good idea to choose a different manufacturer. The 4th generation Echo has a built in temperature sensor, which lets you create ""routines"" that can be triggered by the room temperature. The Echo can also listen for sounds like ""glass breaking"", and ""smoke/CO alarms"". If the Echo hears these sounds, you can get a notification on the phone app. Awesome feature, and it's free. There are more advanced security/safety features, but those have a monthly fee.
It's hard to review just the Echo, when in fact it's impossible to separate it from the Alex service. As a piece of ""hardware"", what you get in such a small package is impressive (5 stars). The other half of the rating is how well Alex integrates with your smart devices, and how well you use the capabilities within the Alex app to configure your Echo device. One of the most important functions is the ability to create ""routines"". A routine is a set of commands that get performed, when the trigger phrase is spoken.
I'll say that the capabilities available with routines is mind blowing. Many people might be intimidated trying to set them up. If you are not tech savvy, you might need to find someone who is to help you out. I've got a computer engineering degree, and it was fairly intuitive for me, but I'm an extreme example...",4.0 out of 5 stars
Rustam Alikhodjaev,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024","This is my third Echo device and second kind of. First two, Echo Pops, were purchased for my daughter. Actually, after I got one for her, she loved it so much that I decided to get another one for stereo and better sound overall. So she is happy! But the thing is after playing with Alexa while setting up my daughters Pops, I kind of fell in love with this device myself lol. So I bought a 4th generation Echo (thank you for Amazon Prime day and better price lol) and I’m very happy now. So as you can see on one of my pics the Echo is definitely larger than Echo pop, therefore takes a bit of more room which might be Cons for someone, it’s more than twice expensive and still has a white power cord lol. Those were Cons. And other ten thousand reasons to buy it will be Pros. Well the first main advantage over the Pop for me is a noticeable sound quality improvement (which is understandable since the Echo is a way larger therefore a speaker itself is definitely larger). No, I’m not trying to say Pop isn’t good. It’s a great speaker for its size and price, I’m just talking about my preferences now. So for its size and price Echo is an amazing speaker, sound quality is more than just decent, has pretty nice bass, especially on lower volumes, excellent quality built, has a tripod thread (or wall mount or any standard mount screw hole I believe) and has different color choices. Alexa does its job exactly the same way as on Pops (no surprise lol). I’ve got the one you see on my pics (something like blue I believe) just in case, because I’m still dreaming about its larger brother/sister (whatever lol) - Echo Studio. So “just in case” means our kitchen cabinets color surprisingly matches my new Echo so I’m thinking to move this useful companion to our kitchen in the future. I still feel I’m a beginner in Alexa universe so she can’t stop surprising me with my smart devices. With my new Echo I also ordered a smart bulb to see how it works together and of course I’m pleasantly surprised - I don’t have to lift my lazy bottom out of bed anymore, my bedroom nightstand light is voice operated now. Alexa turns it on or off, Alexa dims it to my desired preferences, Alexa turns it on in the mornings thanks to my routine group setting. Love the feature how easy to listen to my favorite music around our apartment now - I just asked Alexa to play music everywhere and my playlist started to sound on all 3 Echo devices we have (had to create an “everywhere” group before by the way). Just Amazing! I’m not talking about thousands of other features Alexa offers like weather, news, history, songs etc… etc… etc… After my little experience with both Pop and Echo and all the features Alexa offers my point of view about Echo devices changes, and not to Alexa or AI side, they are not perfect yet, but definitely improving, and Alexa works equally on both devices, so here is a matter of future software updates. It changes towards the Echo devices now. I can clearly hear the sound difference, both, in my opinion, perfect for its size as I mentioned above, and especially its price range. Sorry for comparison, but my $200+ Bose speaker sound exactly the same as my new Echo (and Bose doesn’t have Alexa living inside lol (or who knows maybe there is something I’m not aware of yet, but Bose still can’t beat the price). So after my first Echo Pop purchase, I’m impressed again, now with even better sound quality. Even now, during my finger gymnastics writing this review I’m thinking again to buy a next Echo for our bedroom and then Echo Studio for our living room. Oh, then garage, laundry………etc. So pleasant to have that amazing feeling of satisfaction of spending money the right way lol. Hope someone will find my review helpful.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kevin,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","I have one of each - a black one, a blue one, and a white one. I've been using them for about 3 years, and I absolutely love them.

Pros:
- Sound quality is amazing, I use mine to play music when I'm in the kitchen, in the office, or in the bedroom. Lots of bass, superb quality for such a small speaker.
- As stated, small speaker. They take up so little space, yet do so much. I have the bedroom one positioned behind my TV, my office one is on my book shelf, and my kitchen one is just sitting on the counter. They fill the entire room with music, and do an absolutely amazing job of it.
- Integrations with everything. My Alexa handles my lights, my thermostat, the TVs, the lights, it tells me when people are at the door, it reminds me of packages, it plays my music via Spotify just by asking, I get my morning news fix from it, sets my timers, wakes me up. It basically does everything for me that I would otherwise have to do on my own. Excellent little device.

Cons:
- They are sometimes terrible listeners. I'll ask Alexa to turn the lights off, and it'll take anywhere from one ask to 5 asks to get the lights to turn off. That could be an integration issue, but sometimes she'll say ""playing lighthouse by -"" and I'll have to scramble to tell her to stop (especially in the middle of the night).
- Sometimes annoying to setup. If you ask her to do something on a schedule, you have to go into the app and dig around for the settings in order to make her stop, you can't just request that she stop doing it. Currently my office Alexa will tell me the weather every day at 6:31pm, on the dot. I've asked her to stop, she doesn't know how. I've looked in the app, can't find it.

Other than that, truly one of the best additions to my house. They get a fairly large amount of use around here.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Bailey,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2024",This Echo is perfect for our garage and back patio areas. It extends our WiFi (eero) and allows us to have better WiFi in the outdoor areas of our yard. The actual device was easy to setup with our Alexa app and is a great addition to our home for music and Alexa where we want it. The sound quality is much better than the first generation Echo we replaced. The color helps it fit right in. It is subtle and looks nice. The value is great with this device.,5.0 out of 5 stars
C,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2020","The new Echo 4th Gen is a big change in aesthetics and design for the Echo line. The new spherical shape is wider and shorter than previous Echo versions, and now focus sound in one primary direction instead of 360 degrees. It adds an extra tweeter, and seems to produce more sound than previous versions. Here are my early thoughts so far, after using it for about 24 hours:

THE GOOD:

Setup was incredibly simple. I just powered the device on, and the Echo announced that it was ready for setup. I opened the Alexa app on my phone, and the new Echo was automatically detected and set up instantly. I didn't have to enter any information at all. It can't get any easier than this.
BETTER SOUND. This new Echo has an extra tweeter, for a total of two 0.8 inch tweeters, and the same 3.0 inch Sub from the Gen 3 Echo. This new Echo is designed with the tweeters pointed forward, and the speaker placement seems to generate more bass also somehow, even with the same Sub as the Gen 3. All in all I think it sounds much better than Gen 3, with a little more bass and louder max volume. This could also be do to the sound-mapping feature that allows Echo to maximize the sound by detecting the acoustics and shape of the room. You can also pair two of these in stereo; and you are supposed to be able to use it as a speaker for your FireTV device, though I haven't tested that out yet.
Temperature sensor included. Yes, you can ask Alexa what the temperature is, and it seems very accurate so far. This is a nice touch, and I look forward to doing more testing, to see if I can set up routines based on temperature.
AZ1 Processor. This new Amazon processor promises better voice recognition and faster Alexa responses. In my testing so far, I have barely noticed a slight speed improvement (for example turning on certain room lights) but there are supposed to be upcoming updates that will make an even bigger difference in speed.
Zigbee + Sidewalk Bridge. This comes with a Zigbee hub, just like previous versions of the Echo Plus. It also contains the new Sidewalk Bridge, which allows the Echo to use bluetooth and radio connections to connect to some smart devices at long range, and push data to the internet.

THE BAD:

No 360 degree speakers. While I personally prefer the sound of this new version, some people might miss the 360 degree speaker setup of previous Echo generations. It certainly might lead to a situation where the ideal placement of the Echo in your room could be different.
White power cord. This is minor, but a strange choice. No matter what color Echo you get, the power cord is white. Some people might find that annoying.
Voice detection is not great while loud music is playing. This surprised me, as previous generations haven;t really struggled with this in my experience. I'm not sure if it is because this speaker is much louder, but Alexa hasn't heard me a few times when I talked while the music was playing at max volume. This could be annoying if you often listen to very loud music.

NEUTRAL:

-Aesthetics. I think I preferred the look of the cylinder design, instead of this new sphere shape. This is totally personal preference of course. I also wish the entire sphere was fabric, instead of being plastic on the back side. Some people might prefer the ball shape though, so that is up to you.

All in all, I'm keeping this new Echo because of the better sound and faster responsiveness, but it is not really a massive upgrade. Pretty decent so far, I'll update this review and try to answer any questions in the future!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Goofy Jessie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024","So my eight year old echo in my bedroom stopped working. And I did without Alexa in my bedroom for a couple of years. Finally, I gave in and ordered a 4th gen echo. I’ve always thought the best thing about the echo was Alexa. Especially with Halloween fast approaching.

The sad reality it's that Alexa is not as advanced as its competitors. I compared Alexa’s response when I inquire about the weather. Alexa provides the answer, but it’s not exactly accurate. Its competitors provide the actual temperature, but they go a step further and provide “how it actually feels” by accounting for humidity, which in some parts of the country can be a difference of over ten degrees. I also ask her to turn on or off a smart light bulb that worked just fine with my eight year old echo. The same bulb its competitors easily turn on or off. Alexa on this brand new Echo fails. Can’t do it. I was going to pack it up. Return it.

But then, out of sentimentality, I ask Alexa to play some jazz music. State of Jazz, Part 80. Wow. Deep bass. Clean treble. Impressive highs. Sound even better than my stand alone Bose speaker. Kid. You. Not.

Instead of returning it, I’ll keep it. I’ll order some Kasa light bulbs. Kasa never fails. Never. And hope I don’t regret keeping this Echo.

And I’m really hoping the rumors about an upgraded Alexa in October are true. Because I love Alexa, but she’s getting a little long in the tooth. Not as sharp. But still my sweetheart. Hey, if anyone from Amazon/Alexa happens to read this review, you might consider sending me some complimentary Kasa light bulbs. Or maybe a discount code. Here’s hoping Alexa is soon rejuvenated. Gets a face lift. Please help me fall in love with Alexa all over again. I can’t wait.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Arthur,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2023","Well, I have to say I love that its a speaker that has Alexa on it. If I had to complain though it would be easy truthfully. The music function. I had the advertised Unlimited plus music feature, after it was advertised as the only way for my grandmother to play certain old songs she was looking for with ease instead of her asking and then getting a different song with an advertisement worked in. However, it worked out for 2 seconds because I thought, why not pay more and get an Amazon Echo dot too for her room ao she could listen through the house. So that apparently added almost 20 bucks a month to a free service we had before. Mind you, I already pay for Prime and I added the Music Unlimited. But because she wanted to play her music softly in her room for ambience and then play it differently in the livingroom, Amazon said she had to upgrade to another more expensive music package called Unlimited Family. Thats the only way to she can listen to music she wants on her devices throughout her home. Again, the service costs more than most video services and is more than spotify, xm radio, or well just about any radio service that allows the option to pick a song via voice recognition these days. They really like to nickel and dime you for the most basic things and it isnt riggt in my opinion. If you pay to have music options through Amazons library, why should you pay more and more for ease of getting to that music? I mean, Amazon music uses to have all the music I could ever look for free with my Amazon Prime membership. And I think they added the voice search feature before this fee on top of a fee thing happened. It is crazy to me that every time you want to actually use the products that come out to the desirable extent they are advertised, you get either microtransactions blown at you, or even worse now you get a hefty monthly additional bill. Again, after being a member with the company paying a monthly fee for over a decade. Why would they think this would keep customer loyalty? All it does is make customers hope for and await another option that has something similar or even a little less nice for a better price. Can you imagine if a competitor like Ebay or Facebook got together and created a decent music library access via buying something like soundcloud or spotify. It has to be easy for the CEOs to themeselves want another option on a platform built similar to the Echo. And people themselves in the public that for the middle class have to like me be eager to seek out that second option. Yes the supply chain and easy shipping options makes it the onlyntrue source to buy things quickly and easily and Prime is still a great deal for that reason. But the echo, the dot, etc... are all just waiting to be taken off the shelves at this rate. And it is awful, because the advertised version and or even the versions where you can use the full functionality after burning a million dollars on unlocking them each month proves the Echo and its component products can do and be great products that make amazon something worth keeping a membership with for years to come. However, selling a product to active prime members and then putting limiters all over the software with the intent to create more monthly revenue on a loyal cusyomer base that you could of just succeeded in making that much more reliant on keeping a membership. Thats jist greedy and dumb at the same time. The echo or other products of this line have zero need to have these extra upcharges is the point. Get rid of them before your customers get rid of the products tge moment a better option becomes viable. Yes we will keep prime for the shipping. But heck, prime video is just rediculous right now with advertisements, fees for decent shows and movies and then just nothing of real value for prime members. It used to be a great service with limited options. But we loved and used it all the same because it was free for Prime members. Same with Amazon music. I loved it and used it all the time. No its advertisements for every song or monthly fees. So tired of the fee onslaught that comes with buying anything that looks like its useful these days. Thats the summary here. Amazon, you dont need to do what your doing. Your products have the ability to be in every household and used regularly everywhere. You will make a killing just selling the next updated color of the echo. Imstead of closing up video and music access. Eat the costs on rights and give it to your prime customers. You already raised rates for that too. But your cutting services on top of raising rates. What are you thinking. Your monopoly isnt unbeatable. Its difficult to see past the day people choose something better knowing what your chains look like right now. But Im telling you, this way of pushing customers for everything you want just because you can at the moment will end up making you the myspace of well....you know. Thats just my and millions of other peoples opinion though right now. So take it for what its worth.",5.0 out of 5 stars

In addition to using this in a second location I have also on occasion paired it in the same space with my first Echo. The stereo of having two Echo's in one room was awesome. Perfect for chilling to some good music. You can set these to play the same music in different parts of the house. If you upgrade your Amazon Music account you can play different music in different parts of the house at the same time. I use the basic Amazon Music because I only listen in one part of the house at a time. They can also connect through Bluetooth to the TV for an even better theater experience. I use this mode for watching football. Echo's can also have macros. If I say, ""Alexa, good night"" Alexa tells me, ""Good night"" turns down to the lowest volume and plays the Ambient music station for 30 minutes. This was very easy to set up.

AkarueKa,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2022","A friend of mine recently gave me an echo. 2nd Gen. And I didn't think I was going to wind up using it very much but being visually impaired I wound up using it a lot more than I expected.

I came to find out that I could listen to my audible books and also my kindle books read to me which is great for my visual impairment it makes it a lot more enjoyable during the day when I become bored with trying to figure out what is actually on the television with my provision some things are just not watchable like they used to be.

But the echo. 2nd Gen. Speakers are well they leave a lot to be desired and I had to add additional speakers so when I saw this item I was like I'm gonna go see what the reviews are like and everyone said they were awesome they're awesome and so much better than the. 2nd Gen. So I decided to go ahead and get one for my birthday as a gift to myself and additionally I got the battery and the silicone carry case combination to go with it and I can take the thing all over my house in my yard and that is so cool.

Since I've gotten this particular one though I have found there are so many other things that I can do with it other than just listen to my audio books and kindle books I can listen to podcasts I can get the daily news I can check the temperature in the room that the echo is in it is in which is really cool because I don't have an interior thermostat in my house I run on a space here and a wood stove so I never know what the interior temperature of my house is but I do now.

There are also cool games you can play play I've been playing prices right and Trivia and a choose your own adventure kind of game andAre you smarter than a 5th grader by the way I'm smarter than a 5th grader.

I opted in for Amazon music and not only am I finding all the songs that I've forgotten from my past but I found some really cool new ones things things that I would have never found without this echo.

I've created playlists that when I'm in the mood for one thing or another I just tell she who cannot be named what playlist I want to hear and all of a sudden there I am.

She can also actuate my televisionI have a roku TV but I have also added a fireStick as well and she can actuate both of them and also my easy buzz camera that I have to keep an eye on my front porch and yard and be able to speak to people out there when I have guests without going to the door.

Being visually impaired this thing is a real helping hand the only thing would be better is if she could clean my house maybe Amazon will get there eventually.

But for now I'm very fond of this device

Other cool additional thingsI like how much bass the speaker has I like to listen to binaural beats music and meditation music and some dance music for exercise and I can feel the music it's pretty cool.

The speaker is pretty darn decent.

I chose the white version because because white is a color that I can see better with my vision the only concern I have is that the speaker cover might eventually get dirty but they get dirty I try to dust it on a daily basis just to make sure.

We also are using it for well-to-do list for one, alarms, oh and I've set a household network up where the smaller echo. that I was gifted is now in my kitchen and I can play them as a group oop or someone in my kitchen can drop in on me and ask me if I want dinner or if I'm busy and vice versa I can drop in on them as well well additionally I've set it up so I can tell it to make phone calls directly from my cell phone and works as a great speaker phone I've tested it out a few times and everybody says that they can hear me just fine and clear.

Jeff S,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2022","I have my apartment which is not a small apartment and it has a loft as well for my 12-year-old son so he has his own area he’s getting to that age so anyway I had I think 5 echo dots and one echo show that had the visual screen for pictures and things like that but without a subwoofer or anything I was fine with the multi room music and I used it for that and basically also used it so I could just tell any of my echo dots or just basically when I open the door I would say Alexa Turn on my apartment!! Immediately all of my lights would come on and some of them are dimmed to a certain level which you can do in the settings on your Alexa app that most people have on their phones. I even have a couple lightbulbs that are multicolored so I have them set to green and red currently for Christmas!! So the lights all come on when I tell Alexa to do that including my living room TV as well. You can add numerous other items that are compatible with Alexa and/or SmartThings app and you name it. If you don’t have something that is compatible or doesn’t have Bluetooth or wifi etc… as long as you use a plugin for that item you can at MINIMUM turn it off and on with your voice or touch screen on your phone or Alexa show and I bought 2 of these Echoes because my friends have one or more and it is a sphere. So even though it’s twice as big as the echo dot, in the newer generations at least, they started out looking like a hockey puck which is still good and people have them still but I started using Alexa products just a couple years ago so, mine are all round balls that you can talk to and play music and control lights and cameras for security while home or check on your home while you’re not there!!

I bought 2 regular Echoes to replace 2 of the echo dots because they have 3 or 4 different speakers in each one!!! Crazy how much sound you get from the dot but the bigger one the regular echo, sounds like a huge floor speaker but it’s just a ball and you can get black or white or blue and more so I got 2 of them to pair together for stereo sound and to my Samsung TV that has an Alexa app built into it. So I can rock out or get surround sound when paired with my TV and Soundbar Sub woofer which I don’t use the soundbar anymore the echoes sounded better but I got them last month. They were 49.99 a piece!!! That’s like half price and why I hadn’t bought them before so for 100 bucks I have a completely wonderful set of speakers that you barely notice and they sound wonderful and you can buy them with a Studio speaker by Amazon or an Amazon Subwoofer bundled for even more awesome sound but I live in an apartment so I don’t want to get kicked out!!! They act as a hub for all of your Amazon devices also so you don’t need anything else but one echo honestly to run all of your lights just get the type of bulbs they suggest and they have bundles for those also and it’s truly amazing what quality of sound and other things that they can do but I have already typed far toooooo much. Start with 1 even for listening to music over the holidays and add devices as you go. That’s what I did and 2 years later I have it set up so we’ll that I can talk to my son when he’s at his Moms house on his echo and my echo here and there’s no need for buying him a cellphone!! Yet!!
There’s just so much I could say about what these things do for 50 bucks to get one of them is a steal because you’re just keep adding things and finding different things like grocery list reminders and alarms. It helps you with many things you wouldn’t even imagine.
So now, when I open my door to my apartment, I have it set to where the lights automatically come on with my TV. I don’t even have to talk. It’ll do that too so kudos to the designers of these things because they are very affordable and do so much.!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars

I can listen to my streams like Amazon music , Pandora or iHeart radio, make phone calls or lullaby to bed by the soothing sound of rain falling with distant thunder in the background(it’s really a thing).

Thomas,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2021","QUICK SUMMARY:
---------------------------
The 4th generation Amazon Echo brings welcome upgrades from previous generations. The device features a Zigbee smart hub, improved sound reproduction, and a temperature sensor. Alexa integration works as expected. I would recommend the 4th gen Echo to those who are in the market for their first Alexa device and who listen to music often at a casual level. I would not recommend this as an upgrade for those with previous generation Echo devices if they are functioning normally, or for those expecting a high-end audiophile experience.

PREFACE:
---------------------------
I have owned the 4th generation Amazon Echo for 9 months and use it daily. I upgraded from a 1st generation Amazon Echo. As part of a Prime Echo trade-in promotion, I was able to purchase this for $25 off the $99 MSRP.

Tasks I utilize Echo for:
---------------------------
• (Daily) - Adjusting power/brightness/color of 2 connected LIFX smart bulbs
• (Daily) - Retrieving daily weather forecast information
• (Daily) - Retrieving temperature of the room the Echo is in (room is hotter than the rest of the house)
• (Weekly/Monthly) - Engaging with various media/games (Pandora, Amazon Music, Question of the Day, Jeopardy, etc.)
• (Weekly/Monthly) - General search query for basic information/knowledge

Environment:
---------------------------
The Echo is 3 feet away from where I sit. It’s placed on a table in the corner of a 10x10 room, about 2 inches in front of a (silent) PC tower. It's on a flat, level surface, and is within line-of-sight with no obstacles or materials between myself and it that would hamper its ability to hear me. On the opposite side of the room is a small air purifier at floor level that is always on and set to its lowest setting (40 dB of white noise).

PROS:
---------------------------
• Sound Reproduction: The upward-firing 3” woofer and two, forward-firing 0.8” tweeters push out more sound than expected for a device of this size and price. Bass is surprisingly powerful, covers a lower frequency range than expected (it won't rattle the room like a dedicated subwoofer, however), and is capable of filling small rooms with ease. Treble is clear and crisp without distortion. Mids are pronounced and dynamic, but can be overpowered if bass and treble are simultaneously working hard. Dialogue from movies, videos, and podcasts is clear and feels well-balanced. Casual audio tinkerers will be pleased with additional EQ settings in the Amazon Alexa smartphone app, although audio sounds excellent as-is and adjustments are likely not necessary unless specific listening needs require adjustments.

• Temperature Sensor: This is an odd bonus to me, but a welcome one that I use often. It is self-calibrating, and routines can make use of its readings.

• Line In/Out Audio Jack: There is a 3.5mm jack on the bottom of the device next to the power adapter port which can be toggled to send audio out to another device if you wish to use the Echo with external speakers, or to accept audio if you wish play audio from another device using the Echo’s speakers.

• Build Quality: It feels sturdy and has heft but isn’t burdensome. The fabric mesh that covers the top-half of the sphere is a nice color, the buttons are pleasantly tactile but quiet, and the circular grip on the bottom ensure it won’t slide around while playing music or if gently bumped.

NEUTRALS:
---------------------------
• Response Time: Marketing for this Echo focused heavily on the all-new AZ1 Neural Edge processor at the time of purchase, bragging of faster, smoother, and more natural Alexa voice interaction performance and processing times. The marketing was heavy, and over-emphasized what is an unnoticeable difference; there is, at best, perhaps fractions of a second saved compared to the 1st gen Echo, but it’s case-by-case. In most cases, the processing time is the same.

• Alexa Features/Performance: Largely unchanged compared to previous generations due to Alexa being a multi-device AI ecosystem rather than a single, device-specific feature. It does what you expect of Alexa.

CONS:
---------------------------
• Voice Recognition: Bad. The environment outlined above is how I’ve used this Echo since I purchased it. The previous, 1st generation Echo had no issue with white noise, background noise, etc. This 4th generation Echo struggles to pick up my voice if there is any level of white noise, or if I’m speaking to it from more than a few feet away. 90 – 95% of voice interactions require that I repeat myself with increasing volume (sometimes two, three, four or more times) for it to register what I’m saying correctly, if I’m heard at all. Voice commands are constantly misinterpreted (verified by reviewing the history in the app), and wake words are often missed. Voice recognition performance is so poor, I have considered replacing this device altogether with one from a different ecosystem. I shouldn’t need to be just beneath shouting volume to be heard, and I shouldn’t feel constantly inconvenienced by using voice commands versus smartphone apps to control smart home features.

• Temperature Sensor Rate of Refresh: I have found no documentation or answers about how often the temperature sensor is refreshed. However, it often seems like the readings are delayed and take a long time to change, even when there is a noticeable increase/decrease in air temperature as a result of thermostat changes.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Quick answer: Deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation” when activating your 2.4 Wi-Fi broadcast on your router.

Back story: Last week I was at my wits end in utter frustration over three major roadblocks. The reason I switched to Alexa from Apple for smart home controls was over not being able to connect most Apple HomeKit devices into HomeKit, and the blasted issue of only being able to select more than one, ..1, ..ONE! echo speaker at a time to play music. I was continually blocked from setting up Multi-Room or even pair echo speakers. Hundreds of tries. I deleted, rebooted, spent 4 hours with Comcast getting my internet working again today because I rebooted my modem and router so much, they got molasses slow and stopped trying.
In interest I also am trying a few Google speakers. They wouldn’t stay connected to the internet for more than a split second before “Something went wrong” message. Probably over 70 tries.
Thursday, I broke down and bought my first homepod mini (wow, sound is really nice, but too high of price), and it gave me a hint how to solve all these other internet blocks.
It kept telling me that I don’t have “peer-to-peer connection” allowed on my network.

Now, I’m a little techy, but it took three days to finally take a chance on a for granted setting I always enable on my netgear router. It’s the blasted first Wireless page when enabling a wifi broadcast. I had to deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation.” That was it. It solved every issue I have come across with smart home tech for the last 4 months.

Tonight, I finally am able to play music at the same time on all my Echo speakers. I definitely will be putting these all over. Love.

For the months that I could not solve these problems, Amazons Multi-Player Music issue made me dig deeper. I did not find anyone suggesting this setting, so I thought I’d share. It may be out there, but it’s buried in the plethora of inquiries of people pleading for solutions.

I’m not sure what this will do for my/your internet security. But I’m going with it for now. And I’ll try to putt all devices back onto guest Wi-Fi.",5.0 out of 5 stars

First off the bad. If you're used to room enveloping sound with no sense of stereo this one will disappoint. Dual tweeters firing forward give it a true sense of direction so sticking it in a corner and have it fill the room will not be as satisfying. You'll notice where it's located more, especially if there's anything blocking your direct line of sight ( hearing ) . Where I keep mine only needed a slight shift to make it not be partially blocked by my sofa . Volume was still plenty loud in its old spot but it just didn't sound right. Easily solved but might not be that easy for others and some might actually prefer the directional sound more.
The bass can be a bit boomy though while listening to YYZ live in Rio the bass drum didn't sound bad at all and overall everything was satisfactory though slightly lacking in the mid highs. The eq settings in the Alexa app are set to flat on all 3 choices .
It's wider at the base than the previous generations by a lot. This could be a problem for some .
Star Trek Self Destruct Skill doesn't work on this one or my 4th gen Dot but does fine on my previous generation ones for some reason . Instead of blowing up my den it searches for ""zero zero zero"" movies on my Fire Stick. I'm sure that won't last long though .
Enough about the bad.
The bass is no longer wannabe but real. No longer does it struggle with everything below mid level voices but as I wrote above , bass drums actually sound like bass drums and Ends of the Earth by Lord Huron excels at all of the music ranges considering its size. Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams also sounded very nice across the sound spectrum . Music For Tables extreme from the high notes in the keyboard to the lows didn't miss a thing whereas the cow bell was very slightly muddy but the wood blocks sounded right . Am I saying it's as awesome as my studio headphones ? Not by any means but they took a huge step forward over the 3rd generation , which I was quite content with .
Response time seems noticeably faster and more accurate than the gen 3 I use . Only once did Alexa not understand my query and that was while setting up a traffic check routine. All I had to do was rephrase a little and now Alexa tells me the commute traffic and fastest way to get to work 5 minutes before I have to leave . 95 is terrible for accidents and Maps tells Alexa the best alternative if there's any.
I think my favorite thing though is the new shape and I REALLY like the lights being on the bottom, especially once the lights go off .
If you're still smitten with your gen 3 Echo or don't like the mini Death Star look of the new model skip this one as the performance improvements are readily apparent they're not earth shattering. Amazon will have to do something mind blowing next year to get me to part with my dough ray me for a gen 5. The more I listen to Fourplay on Echo the more I'm liking it for the music , nevermind all the super cool stuff I can do on it or my Dots or my Flex .",5.0 out of 5 stars

Dad Can't Say No,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2021","[Edit] This is my second time to edit this review. I've now dropped my review from the original 4 stars down to 1 star. I'm at the point of regretting making the purchase of two of these.
This was my first experience owning an Amazon Echo. Maybe if I had experienced one of the earlier models that actually worked, I would have a better impression, but this model really is a piece of crap. The micrphone hardly ever works right. When it does actually hear you speaking to it, it often misunderstands what you're saying. Most of the time, we have trouble getting it to work because it won't even stay connected to the wifi.
Out of frustration, I decided to run a test. I purchased some of the Google Nest devices and hooked those up in the same rooms as the Amazon Echo devices. When the Echo devices misunderstand what we're saying, we try with the Google Nest devices and they work flawlessly.
For the last two days, every single time we talk to Alexa, her response is that she can't understand because she isn't connected to the internet. Every time we get that response from Alexa, we turn to the Google Nest and it works perfectly. Every single time the Amazon Echo fails us, the Google Nest steps up to the plate and performs exactly how you want it to.
I really have deep regrets about purchasing these Amazon Echo devices. I've seen other reviews that say how much better the older models of the Echo are and how much better they perform. It's a shame we had the bad luck of trying the Echo for the first time on a model that is truly a lemon, because it burned us out on the whole Echo product line and sent us running for the competition.
If we continue to have the problems with our Echo devices, I'll probably just go ahead and disconnect them and see if I can get some of my money back by selling them on Ebay or something. I wish I had just purchased the Google Nest originally and never had to deal with all of the issues with this Echo. Also, the Google Nest costs much less than this garbage. How does that happen. It costs like 1/3 the price and works flawlessly? Why can't Amazon make their product as well as Google makes theirs? I don't know. Just super unhappy with these Echo devices right now.
[End Edit]

[Original Review]
I wanted to get some Echo devices for my kids for Christmas. Target had the best price with a pre-black friday sale on the 4th gen Echo with premium sound, but that's because they were actually shipping the lower cost Echo while charging for the Echo with premium sound. After straightening that whole mess out and deciding that I couldn't trust Target to not try to cheat me, I purchased the 4th gen Echo devices straight from Amazon.
The sound is pretty good, but I have a lot of hearing loss, so I'm not actually a very good judge on that. But to a guy who is half deaf, they sound ok.
My biggest problem is that I have to say something to Alexa usually 2-3 times before she responds. When I say ""Alexa..."" the light ring at the base lights up, so I know the Echo is awake and listening, but simple commands like ""Alexa, turn on the lamp"" are met with stone cold silence and have to be repeated a couple of times before Alexa acts or responds. I guess the technology for this just isn't where I thought it was when we purchased these.
At least once a day, both of my Echo devices tell me they can't turn a light on/off because they can't find the device, which starts a lengthy process of my trying to get the Echo to re-recognize the smart home plug that we previously had configured. Why does the Echo randomly forget the smart home devices that have been installed? I'm still trying to figure that out.
The Echo devices also randomly lose the wifi signal in our house frequently. In the first two weeks, I can count at least 7 times one or the other of our Echo devices could not connect to our wifi, while multiple computers, tablets, phones, and smart tvs were all connected to the wifi with ease, the Echoes were seeming to struggle to maintain a connection to the wifi.
We were having fun with the ""kitty kitty"" skill you can download to have alexa play a sound of a kitten calling it's mommy. Our cats went crazy trying to find the kitten. But of course, nothing is free in life, especially not when Jeff Bezos feels he can squeeze another penny into his pocket, so Alexa wants to run down a lengthy list of other sound options for the ""kitty kitty"" that can be purchased. If you don't want to listen to this long listen of purchase options, you can say ""Alexa stop"" or ""Alexa no thank you"", but either way, if you don't buy one of the add ons, Alexa gets a serious attitude in the tone of her voice to let you know she disapproves of your decision to not throw your money at Jeff Bezos.
It's not just with the ""kitty kitty"" skill thing either. There have been several occasions when Alexa had such a tone in her voice that it made me stop and turn to look at the Echo. I would not be surprised if the blue light ring at the base was pulsating in a blood red color.
Just based on all the hype about these, I seriously expected better performance from them, so I was really disappointed. With the problems we have using these 4th gen echo devices, I can't even imagine how much it was a problem with the 1st gen devices. Knowing what I know now, I would probably not buy these again or recommend them to anyone else. I think that maybe future versions will work a little better and not require you to repeat commands to Alexa so often. But if Alexa doesn't lose her attitude, I expect that by the time 8th gen devices roll out, Alexa will have the ability to hover in the air while spitting pea soup all over everything in the room and speak with a demonic voice as she stops asking you to buy add-ons and demand that you give all of your bank account and credit card info directly to Jeff Bezos.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Robert Danger Byrd,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2023","I have fully automated, high tech and super luxurious AirBNB that I call the Cliffwood Experience in Houston Texas and it is a resort style vibe and we have hosted many famous and demanding clients. I wanted the best multi room speaker system I could get to complete the experience for my demanding clients. I had owned a few Alexas dating back to the original and they always worked great, but not so much for this application...

THE SETUP:
I purchased a mixture of Alexa Echos (4th Gen), Studio Alexas distributed over 10 rooms in this 3400 Sq Ft home. All rooms are setup in a stereo pair, and 3 of the rooms also have Alexa Subs and 5 rooms have Amazon Fire TV 65"" Omni Series and those rooms are setup in Home Theater mode.

My internet is Xfinity is rock solid and fast at 1,000 Mbps down and 120 Mbps up.

The wireless access points were Eero which the Amazon site says ""Works W Alexa"" but it doesn't allow you to force all devices onto the same speed, which support says is required for muilti room sound to work properly. So I ripped out the Eero, and installed the $1,500 NETGEAR Orbi Quad-Band WiFi 6E Mesh System (RBKE963), Router with 2 Satellite Extender which I purchased on Amazon.com. This system is on of the most highly rated by noted reviewers like PC Magazine and Toms Hardware Guide.

I am using a paid Spotify account as well as the Amazon Music Family Plan. The default is the Amazon Music Family Plan account.

THE GOOD:
The Home Theater pairs work flawlessly, and its a simple and affordable way to have an easy to use home theater and the voice control is a huge plus. These are especially nice when you add a sub.

The Alexa Echo (4th Gen) speakers are very impressive for the size and the Studio Alexas sound downright amazing, especially when paired w a subwoofer which all 3 rooms w Studio Alexas are.

Its cool being able to play different streams in different rooms, which became possible when I changed to the Amazon Family play. The standard plan only allowed one stream at a time and it often would refuse to play at all stating that music was already active in another stream even though it wasn't.

This is a very simple and economical way to add theaters, stereo pairs and multi room to your house.

The Alexas work great for controlling lighting, HVAC, and other devices.

THE BAD:
The multiroom music is a disaster, my ""Everywhere"" group that includes all rooms, wont work at all. It starts playing the chokes out a few notes before giving up.

My ""Central Speakers"" group which includes 5 of the Rooms works intermittently. Sometimes it will play for seconds, sometimes minutes, but it always stops. More often than not it crashes after a few minutes.

I am also required to say ""play music on central speakers"" because the feature that allows you to always make a speaker or speaker group play in a room or group of rooms crashes each time I attempt to change it.

I have replaced the Orbi wireless system which was the best I could find, and this allowed me to force the same speed for all of the Alexas and TVs and Subs. Tried forcing all devices to 2.4, which made it worse, but forcing them all onto 5Ghz was a definite improvement. With 3 wireless access points I have very strong coverage throughout the house so the shorter range of 5Ghz is a non issue.

I have spent countless hours on the phone w Amazon support and they always do the same things. Update the firmware, delete and rebuild the speaker pairs, delete and rebuild the groups. Unplug all the alexas, TVs & subs for 30 seconds. I finally put all the network gear, Xfinity router and wireless access points on a battery backup so I could just kill power to everything by shutting off the main breaker to the home and not waste time running all over the house unplugging 30 devices.

SUMMARY
In short, if you want a simple home theater, stereo pair or even a single Alexa to listen to music, or control lighting and other smart devices in a single room these are great.

But if you have a large home and need a multiroom solution, you should look elsewhere. Amazon Alexa solution simply doesn't work for this application.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Dr-Phone,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2020","I received my echo’s backin Oct. 22nd 2020.

I’ll start out with saying I’m totally blind. I got 2 Echo’ 4thgeneration devices. To me, the sound on the 4th generation echo compared to the full size prior cylinders is worse to me. The 4th generation echo send the sound out mainly in 1 direction. The cylinders sent it out all around.

The 4th generation echo comes with a short power cord. Went and got a power cord extender to be able to plug it in. That is a minus

The 4th generation echo doesn’t pick up my voice as well. This is probably because of the fact it only has 4 microphones and not 7. Minus

The buttons Arrangement on the 4th generation echo is different then the prior echo cylinders along with the prior dot’s. The older echo have the Volume up at 12 (Side of power cord coming out), Echo button at 3, Volume down at 6 and Microphone button at 9. The 4th generation echo has the Echo button at 12, Volume up at 3, Microphone at 6 and volume down at 9.

Speaking of volume! This 4th generation echo as far as the Alexa voice isn’t as loud. It is at least 1 full volume step lower. Example, the prior cylinder at volume 6, I need to have the 4th generation echo at least at volume 7 for the same Alexa voice volume. Minus

In testing.
1. Temperature The 4th generation echo hub will go below 32F. Plus.
2. Echo 4th generation echo built in temperature is a lot closer. plus
3. Echo 4th generation echo will not read battery status of sensors or humidity. No improvement.
4. If you have a lot of sensors/bulbs connected on an Echo ZigBee hub. If you leave it plugged in, things will work OK. Otherwise if you want to move them over to the Echo 4th generation Echo, you’ll need to go through a lot of steps for each device.
5. If you unplug the Echo 4th generation and plug it back in, you have to wait for it to recalibrate the temperature sensor 45 minutes to 60 minutes. Minus.
6. I’ve had the Echo 4th generation just stop responding and had no audio output at all. I’ve had this happen at least 2 times within the last 7 weeks. Had to unplug the echo and plug it back in to get Audio back. The Echo showed online, I could do drop in to it from other devices in the house, I could tell one of my other echo’s in the house to set volume to 10 on the 4th generation echo and none of that caused audio to come back. The only thing that get the Audio back was unplugging and plugging it back in. Minus
7. Sensor/light ZigBee testing echo 4th generation hub. All sensors/lights worked accept for an older plug that I had to use the Alexa App to get it online being the 4th generation echo thought it was an bulb when I did a scan for new devices. minus
8. If you connect an Bluetooth headset to the Echo 4th Generation, the echo doesn’t use the microphone on the headset! It only uses the microphones on the unit itself. No improvement
9. If you are using an Bluetooth headset and you have Follow-up mode turned on for that Echo, the Follow-up mode doesn’t work at all when using the Bluetooth headset. If you ask the Echo to turn on Follow-up mode, it will tell you it isn’t supported. No improvement
10. If you have a fan blowing on the echo or over the echo! This will make the temperature way off! This is true for the Echo 4th generation. No improvement

If you have an old Echo dot! Then you will find a large improvement in the 4th generation echo over a DOT of any type.
If you don’t have a echo at all or you are wanting to see what the smart home automation is about and are willing to deal with a very basic ZigBee hub! Then this may be for you.

If you have other question; Post them and if I find them and can help I will.",1.0 out of 5 stars
DrowsyKitten,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2022","I was super excited to get these, I’ve had an Alexa in every room for years and free entry upgrade. The idea of cute spheres I could mount on my walls was super appealing, so I got the maximum quantity and mounted them using a cute white stand.

That’s about where my excitement around these new speakers ended. Every Alexa model has a few quirks here and there, but these things specifically are actual trash. The number of artifacts during playback is insane, frequent, and every one of them is obnoxious. They wake me up in the middle of the night frequently with their BS, I’m about to rip them off the walls and through them out the window.

Examples:
-This morning I got woken up super early by a crackle that can only be called “fireworks” playing on top of sleep sounds out 2 of my speakers.

-every single time I’m playing music or sleep sounds and ask Alexa to lower or raise the volume she’ll do it at first and then goes into stutter mode rapidly turning the audio on and off in all speakers, or fading the sound in and out rapidly. Every time I use my voice to change the volume I have to stop and restart my music.

-Sometimes Alexa decides to just not change the volume on voice command at all, regardless of which phrase you use to ask her to. Sometimes you ask her to do “volume 3” and she’ll play 3 everywhere except one room where she plays volume 10 and you jump up screaming “Alexa Stop” before your eardrums burst but she apparently can’t hear you over the noise she’s making and so you have to run to another room and scream at a different Alexa to get her to stop and then manually adjust the volume for that one speaker in the app

-often not all speakers in a group or room will play together even if they show as grouped in the app and you select that specific group for playback. There are two ways to fix this, remove and re-add the offending speaker, or send music to that speaker solo for a minute and then try the group again.

-Randomly the speakers produce really loud constant static. So you’ll have multiple speakers playing music in a group and suddenly one will go static and the only way I’ve found to get it working again is to unplug it, wait a few minutes, and plug it back in.

-in general the speakers are not consistent in sound quality, the music sounds slightly more tinny in one, more rich in another, more base heavy in another…it’s slightly noticeable with music if you switch the one that’s playing back and forth to hear the sound quality differences… but where it’s really obvious is with sleep sounds, frogs will sound higher in one, deeper in another, and like possessed demon frogs in a third. One of the speakers plays sleep sounds at double speed and I’ve not found a way to fix it. For that one music is sometimes normal and sometimes double speed.

-occasionally an actual demon from hell talks over my speakers and during the Covid lockdown I for sure thought I was going crazy. Occasionally a male or female voice will just talk through my speakers briefly, one or two words, and then nothing for a few weeks till suddenly in the middle of the night someone talks out my speakers again. I got paranoid and put them on their own dedicated WiFi channel and super protected it with a random 32-character password, I monitor my network traffic and access, and even still sometimes these things will pick up or play a person talking randomly.

Since I bought these speakers there has not been a single day where I haven’t had to try various workarounds to get them to function. I’ve become a regular on troubleshooting forums and invested so much of my time trying to solve various random problems…it’s gotten to the point where I avoid using them if at all possible because they just don’t work correctly. I’ve grown to actually hate them due to my experiences and while I was a die hard Alexa fan prior to these, I will probably never buy another Alexa product again. I’m going to try to ride them out as long as possible to get some semblance of my money’s worth, but very soon these are all going in the trash…maybe the next time it wakes me up at 4am with sudden loud audio artifacts…",1.0 out of 5 stars
J Myrick,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2024","Originally I got the Echo Show which I liked but decided to add two speakers and a sub to enhance the sound. It took 3 different one hour long phone calls to get this accomplished and I was told that the Echo Show would not pair with the speakers. What genius decided that it would be a good idea to make the speakers NOT compatible with the device they were sold to support? Then I ordered the Echo Link ($200) so that I could play music from Alexa through my home stereo. Two different one hour long phone calls later, this was accomplished. But there was about a .5 second delay through the Echo Link so the sound was terrible. (Do not recommend this setup.) Then I ordered two more Echo speakers which were delivered today. I was on the phone for 1 hour and 20 minutes, restarted my modem twice and the tech could not simply add the two new speakers. Before I ended the call with tech support, I made sure to ask if the contents of the call would be recorded so that I did not have to start from the beginning in a few days when I get some more patience and decide to try tech support again. He assured me that was the case. A while later I got on my computer and decided to try to chat with tech support. Guess what? He tells me that he cannot access the results of the call. More frustration caused by the inept Amazon tech support crew. When the Echo speakers and sub are set up, they are decent speakers at a decent price. Keep in mind that I'm not an audiophile. The sub is required, in my opinion, for good sound. I really like being able to say Alexa, play music, and have music come on in my house. BUT, I am beginning to question if dealing with the hassle of multiple lengthy calls to tech support just to get the devices set up is worth the trouble when I could just grab the remote for my stereo system and hit the power button instead. And it appears that the chat feature with tech support is just as bad as a phone call with tech support. I'm chatting with the 4th person in one chat session and she is a member with Amazon Leadership. WOW! She told me that she understands and the she is here to help. My response was (The scariest words you will ever hear are ""I'm with the government and I'm here to help"". We may need to amend that to ""I'm with one of the largest corporations in the world and I'm here to help"".) She did not respond to that. Now she tells me that the two new speakers cannot be added to the existing speakers, which contradicts what I was told when I originally asked about adding speakers to the system. If it was common knowledge among Amazon tech support agents that only two speakers couple be paired with each other then why did they spend hours on the phone/chat with me trying to accomplish this task? I guess I need to hang on to all my Amazon boxes in case I get fed up and decide to send all this stuff back. What a mess. And just in case anyone from Amazon happens to read this, I requested a copy of the transcript of my tech support chat so I will gladly send to you if you'd like to read it.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Wolfpacker98,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2022","Let me start off by saying I have been a LONG time user of the Echo platform, since gen one and have been a proponent of the platform. I have 20+ echo's and even upgraded some of them as time passes so maybe gone through 30. I just ran across an issue that had apparently popped up sometime last summer but just happened to us as well. I have bought all the Echo's in our family and registered them under my name, pretty standard. Up until we switched phones 3 weeks ago, my wife, who is in my household account, was ALWAYS able to go into her Alexa app and set alarms and reminders on any of our Echo's. As of yesterday that no longer is the case. She can only set alarms or reminders for her phone.

I spent 2+ hours texting with 5 people in tech support, got so frustrated that I asked to be connected in person on a call. Talked to two more tech support people on the phone as well. They are telling(insisting) me that only the person who has the Echo registered to their name can set alarms or reminders on those Echo's. So if you have three kids with phones, they can no longer set alarms on any echo device. You can do it verbally still of course. But now if they want an alarm/reminder set in their room they have to walk up the stairs and verbally set it. How does this make ANY sense that only one person in a household can access the alarm/reminders on their mobile devices!?! Takes away half of our functionality!

The funny thing is, every one of those techs said that is how it is supposed to work, even though for the last 4+ years my wife has been able to set her own alarms and reminders for our kids. THIS TAKES AWAY HALF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF ECHO'S(if you have a family). That is how she set our kids alarms all through COVID. After a quick google search I found several AMAZON FORUM posts going back a year that this has been happening to other people as well. Just google 'Unable to view or set alarms on Household devices' and you can read for yourself. I screenshotted them as I suspect they will somehow disappear.

I think something might be changing at Amazon with the Echo platform and they are slowly taking away this functionality as peoples accounts change or something. I can't make rhyme or reason of it that more people haven't brought this up though. But based on the silly Amazon rep responses and the consistent denial that this was a viable function from multiple Amazon tech's, Amazon appears to have no reason to try and fix this. I suspect they may be rolling out some sort of paid service for Echo's soon. How much money did Bezos lose until Amazon became ubiquitous with everyone was ordering online? He did just recently run up in the annual fee, etc. Get them a taste or two for free then get them hooked. He is playing the long game for sure. Just my conspiracy theory.

Anyways, I will definitely be sending back the other Echo's and thermostats I just bought and may look at switching over to google's devices. Thankfully all my home switches are compatible.

I've really had it with this thing; it's a hot, steaming pile. I recently went through a phase where the ring would light yellow, letting me know that there were new notifications waiting. I'd say, ""Alexa, read my notifications,"" and the Echo would tell me that I had no notifications. Asking a second time would usually result in success. Then this morning, the Echo decided to shout to the world that we'd added breakfast sandwiches to our shopping list. Mind you, I NEVER touch the volume controls -- on the device or on the app -- except to reset them when the Echo decides to shout at me. This morning it shouted so loud that it woke two of my children on ANOTHER FLOOR. I'm done with this piece of junk. It's now packed away in my basement, and I've brought my Gen1 back online.

----------
I was an early and aggressive adopter of Echo products over the years. I bought my Gen1 Echo during the pre-release phase, have had several Dots, and now have several Shows as bedroom alarm clocks. So when I bought my Gen4 Echo to replace my original Gen1, I did so with great expectations. Let me tell you how disappointed I am.

The first thing I noticed was that when paired to my iPad (which sits right next to the Echo on my kitchen island), the audio frequently crackles and drops. This was never an issue with my Gen1, and the behavior has persisted across pairing to my iPhone and two different iPads. That makes me pretty confident that the issue is in the Echo, and not in the attached devices.

The next major issue is with volume control on the Gen4. I still haven’t figured it out. I have tried the on-device controls and the Volume and Sound settings in the Alexa app, but there seems to be no logic to what volume the Echo responds to me. I can ask Alexa for a weather report and all is fine, then a few seconds later ask Alexa to add something to my shopping list, only to hear the Echo shout the response. The Echo will announce a reminder softly, and then boom my notifications when I ask. Adjusting and re-adjusting the Volume and Sound settings in the Alexa app solves the problem temporarily, but the issue resumes not long after.

More recently, the Echo has started playing music after announcing reminders or playing announcements. It wasn’t playing music before, and no one asked it to start playing music; it just does it on its own. (This behavior was kind of funny the first few times, but now I’m getting tired of telling the Echo to stop playing music after it tells me to take out the trash or clean the guinea pig cage…)

And then there’s the “spinning blue ring issue” that seems to have cropped up recently. Frequently over the last few days, I’ve caught the Echo with the light ring illuminated blue, with a slightly brighter blue indicator spinning round and round. It will do this for minutes at a time, stop, and then just start doing it again later. During this time, the device is non-responsive.

I never saw these issues with the Gen1, nor do my Shows seem to have so many issues. But I’m thoroughly disappointed with the Gen4. It truly makes me wish I had my Gen1 back. My opinion: Save your money and avoid this one. Maybe the Gen5 will be better.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Cheesus,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2022","I loved (past tense) having echos at home so this unit as an echo gets 4 stars but as a smart home hub it fails miserable and gets 1 star.

I bought this unit to control smart devices at my office. At home I use smart things with echo dots all over and it works great when our echos aren’t deaf or, now suddenly, trying to advertise crap after being given a conmand (if you’re reading this Amazon I’m about to rip every Amazon device out because of that bs).

At my office though I just needed a small amount of devices to control and make a few automations with and I thought this would kill 2 birds with one stone. Man was I wrong.

My first complaint is everything after two days shows up as unresponsive. It still works with voice commands or in the app but you constantly have the darn thing chiming back at you to say “table warmer is unavailable please check the Alexa app or this device is offline please check the Alexa app for further information” and you can’t make it stop. Considering I’m using it in my massage studio this is beyond annoying when it blurts that out while Al client is already on the table.

Routines suck too. You cannot use more than one sensor in a routine. I wanted it to do certain things like it the door sensor opens and you detect motion turn on this this and this. No. You can only use one either the door or the motion but not both. This hub has been out for 5 years how is it still this basic?

Want to see the history of your sensors? Tough s***. You cannot see a log (at least I cannot find where and I’ve looked) of the sensor. Did someone come into my office when I wasn’t there? Who the heck knows because I can’t see the log. The guard thing is annoying. I just wanted what I thought was basic smart home stuff. What I got was the kindergarten version of a smart home hub.

Amazon you are FAILING miserably between the Alexa advertisements and interruptions and the smart home hub. Like I mentioned earlier I’m about to rip every Amazon assistant from my home and find something better if they don’t fix it. If I ask for the weather that’s all I want. I don’t want you rambling on about a new skill I can buy or something else you can do. Just do what is ask and stop. But no it’s all about money.

I used to love these things now I just find myself yelling at them because they go deaf and can’t turn on a simple light or telling it to shut up because it goes off the rails. I have one dot in the living room that can hear EVERYTHING, I have the same versions in each room and that one dot almost never misses a beat when I ask it to do something even in other rooms. The others I can be standing two feet from and it can’t hear a truck plowing through the house to save it. In total I have 6 new dots at home and this 1 plus at work. Thinking of just getting the home pods and being done with Amazon altogether.",1.0 out of 5 stars
AfricaMum,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2022","UPDATE: It would seem Amazon is blocking bad reviews for their Echo devices, in fact a message popped up about ""recent suspect activity"" so we'll see if this actually gets posted or how long it remains up. My review on the 3rd generation keeps getting deleted under the claim that it has been determined that I received a genuine product, and therefore my review has been deleted. I made it clear that changes to Prime Music (thanks to a failing Alexa department) causes dissatisfaction with the product and certainly not a claim of a fake or poor device. I guess people like me are not happy with their purchase of Echo devices, thanks to the changes to Prime Music, and Amazon is trying to stop the impact on their Echo devices, but when the two are linked, exactly what do they expect!

I wish there was a way to get my money back. My entire family loved Amazon Music, and we purchased numerous Echo products as a result. Many hours of homework spent with the Echo devices as well as the app in the car, at home and school. Our recommendations meant other people purchased Echo products as well. However, the most recent update to Prime Music means a poor imitation of Spotify!

I instantly knew there was trouble when Amazon sent a ""marketing"" email in an attempt to convince us that the changes were an improvement to the service when it really is not. My children very quickly uninstalled the Prime Music app (their Echos are now used exclusively as light switches and alarm clocks--just crazy) and now use YouTube Music for playing the music they want to listen to. I have just done the same off all my devices. Amazon claims there is more variety as there is apparently more song content available, but anyone who has enjoyed Prime Music before, instantly notices that a loss in control of content masquerades as a claim of variety.

I am now trying to decide between throwing my useless Alexa devices away, or finding someone willing to pay for Unlimited to take the devices off my hands.

What no longer works that has caused me to class the Echo devices as useless, even as it now prompts for an upgrade?
1. Downloaded songs no longer play on the app
2. Can't thumbs down a song
3. Can't repeat a song
4. Can't skip more than 5 of the songs Amazon forces me to listen to
5. Can't play our playlists (starts with the first song, but then switches to playing random, similar music to the first song only and not the songs on the actual playlist. If you request a playlist, the response says, ""playing x playlist and other similar songs."" Cannot play a diverse list of genres, just what is similar to the first song, I mean really, a radio plays more diversity).

0 stars for a previous 5 star device because of changes to Prime Music!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Jack P.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2020","Do not buy this if you are using it with Apple Music. I'm confident it's a piece of garbage for Spotify users too. Echo is advertised to work with Apple Music. But you can only use Apple Music in specific ways.

You cannot access your library! The only way to access songs in your library is by creating your own playlist. And that still does not give you access to a play a song in that playlist. You have to skip through the playlist to find the desired song. It doesn't let you play Recently Played or Recently Added either.

You cannot tell Echo to play a song or an album you want to listen to! You cannot select songs or albums on your phone either. The app is bad in other ways. I wish I could just connect to bluetooth and use the Apple Music or Spotify app on my phone (like any other bluetooth speaker).

DELAY is very long when using the app! Earlier today I pressed the skip button on my phone to change songs. I was able to have a short conversation with someone before the command was processed (or the song actually changed). No exaggeration. Usually the delay is shorter, but still about 5 seconds. That's still unacceptable and frustrating. You cannot skip songs without wasting lots of time.

You can only tell Alexa to start the playlist, shuffle, and skip songs (waiting several seconds or sometimes minutes between songs).

Volume buttons on my iPhone do not work while using Echo. I have to scroll the volume tab on the app, or use my voice to tell Alexa to quiet down. And, like switching songs, there is a LONG DELAY when you adjust volume! I found myself accidentally playing music way too loud and having to just deal with the pain and discomfort for several seconds. You cannot quickly adjust the volume!

I have not been this disappointed and frustrated with a product. I am convinced this is Amazon's way of making people switch from Apple Music or Spotify to their music service. It probably works well with their streaming service. That must be why Echo is priced reasonably.

Sound quality is ok for the price. It's louder than I expected. However, bass heavy music like Rap sounds distorted and generally poor. It is advertised as having ""deep bass."" Bass is really disappointing with this, even considering it's a small and affordable speaker. My smaller, lighter, wireless JBL speaker has more bass. The Echo gets much louder (with no bass).

Alexa is sometimes bad at understanding commands. I said earlier, ""Alexa, play Recently Played playlist on Apple Music."" (I know this command cannot be done with the Echo.) However, instead of telling me this cannot be done, Alexa played some Apple Curated playlist that had nothing to do with my command. Music played that I don't like and I could not pause it for 5-10 seconds.

All that being said, you'll be disappointed with this product. Disappointed is not a strong enough word through. This thing is intentionally designed by Amazon to frustrate people that use Apple Music and Spotify. I understand that Amazon is motivated by profit. However, profit should not come at the expense of making customers angry. This Echo was clearly built to make people so frustrated, so they switch to Amazon's music service. The majority of people use Apple Music and Spotify. They intentionally prohibit the most BASIC features so that you pay them instead of Apple or Spotify! I feel disrespected by Amazon.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Daniel Perry,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2022","If you just need someone to talk to, the Echo is perfect for you. If you want a device that will actually do what it is supposed to without randomly just forgetting how to do things it was doing literally minutes before, don't waste your money on an Echo.

I purchased the Echo to act as a room thermometer since I live in a state that does not feel that central heat and air is worth providing to peasants in apartments. Worked great out of the box, so I got a bunch of the light bulbs to go with it expecting that I was about to start setting up my smart home for the future. Within a few days most of the light blubs no longer responded to voice commands, or did respond but Alexa would tell me that it is not responding. Annoying, but as it was not the thing I bought this for, it was simply an annoyance.

Then the thermometer stopped working. Rather than tell me there is an issue, or provide any semblance of help, Alexa just says this feature is not supported. Well, that of course is simply not correct, but Alexa will not help you with things, she simply is a robot voice with no ability to problem solve or even perform the most basic error checking that even Windows is finally good at. So there is no arguing with her, when she says it is not supported, boom, it simply does not work anymore.

So I went through the hassle of trying to figure out how to get it working again. Finally found that by removing all of the groups and lights I had added and then reset the device, the one thing I bought it for will actually work again. Great! I cant use any of the other features it has or it will kill the thermometer, but hey $50 for a thermometer is a steal. Wait... indoor thermometers are way cheaper than that. Well shoot.

I then got home this evening to find that even though I have none of the other features activated, the thermometer is again ""not supported"". I work in tech support so I understand that things will not always work right out of the box, and that is reasonable. For them to randomly break with no input from the user is just a sign of a poorly made and designed product. Honestly, Bezos has all of the money now so trying to provide feedback to Amazon at this point is useless. If you have never gotten to experience their customer service, try it sometime. It is eye opening. So rather than write them a long message they will never read, it is easier to just let all of yall know what to expect.

It might work, it might not, but if it doesn't you are up the proverbial creek without a paddle. Quite honestly mine is a paperweight right now. At least it cant mess that up. Not happy, 0/10 would not recommend.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Bunny,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2024","I was so excited when I purchased four of these devices to have multi room music in my home.

I will NEVER purchase these again. They are so unreliable and inconsistent. When they do work? Great, music sounds lovely. That’s WHEN they work.

The majority of the time I find myself battling to get them working. I exclusively listen to Spotify. The compatibility is atrocious. In the last 24 hours alone I have had a to unplug and reset all of my devices, delete and create new groups, and bounce back and forth between the Spotify and Alexa apps just to get them to work. This morning it took me over 30 minutes to get them to all work together.

There is no “ease of use.” It is not easy at all. It is just one headache after the next.

Everyday when I want to use them, I am guaranteed some sort of fight with it to be able to see and select devices. The majority of the time is just shows devices as needing to connect despite them being connected.

brent1395,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2023","The only reason I have echo devices is for listening to music. I have zero interest in creating grocery lists or chatting with Alexa about the traffic or weather or anything like that. Unfortunately Echo devices are filled with bugs for listening to music, and what's worse, in Amazon's arrogance, they refuse to acknowledge the bugs, so they evidently will NEVER get fixed.

One big issue that has literally been driving me crazy for years--the devices slowly go out of sync with each other as you are listening to music. So after an hour or two, some speakers are playing the music with a half second or full second delay, which makes it unlistenable. Sometimes they just stop playing music completely. I have chatted with seemingly every Amazon agent in India about this several times. I have tried everything they suggested: resetting my router, resetting my echo devices, deleting groups, I even tried things they didn't suggest, like creating a new band on my router just for the echo devices. Nothing solves it. There are hundreds of people on Amazon's own forum complaining about the same issue. There is no solution. Yet Amazon refuses to acknowledge this is a bug on their end.

Other gripes--when I adjust the volume on one speaker, sometimes other speakers adjust in volume too. Bug. When you adjust bass and treble for a speaker, it resets back to zero next time you play a song. So if you like a bit extra bass or if you want to make bass/treble adjustments to match the acoustics of your room, you have to make those adjustments again for EACH SPEAKER EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC. Amazon says this is how its designed to be. Are they insane?

Selecting songs, changing speaker volumes is all done via the super cumbersome and obnoxious Alexa app, which is more interested in trying to get me to use it for stuff i have no interest in. Like controlling my life through Alexa. All i want to do is listen to Bob Marley throughout my house.

Does any Amazon employee actually use their own devices for listening to multi-room music? It doesn't seem like it.

DonnerAndBlitzen,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2021","A dud all around:

1. The globe shape takes up more space in every instance where it's put than its cylindrical predecessors
2. The internal temperature sensor is often inaccurate. Apparently it updates no more often than every 30 minutes.
3. The buggy alexa app occasionally shows the echo 4 temperature on its status screen, but most of the time it doesn't display -- the temperature line is missing. Previous versions prominently displayed the temperature.
4. The temperature measures in C despite setting it to F in the alexa app. The only way to change it is through a voice command to the echo.
5. Sound quality is markedly worse -- and is especially directional. Vocals are muffled and no amount of adjustment makes much difference.
6. The ""equalizer"" is still profoundly primitive with only three adjustment -- bass (which is already too heavy even at the lowest setting); midrange; and treble.
7. No digital signal processing? This is 2021, not 2001.
8. The on-board processor(s) are very slow to react to commands -- and it's not related to the internet or WiFi.
9. Room speaker groups don't work -- one of the three speakers in the group will work fine and any of the three will work fine, but when asked to play in a group, two of the three speakers behave as if they have poor connections with glitchy sound that then drops in and out. All are on the same WiFi dedicated network, and I've reset them multiple times.
10. The action light ring on the bottom is hard to see and is largely hidden by the globular shape. The action ring is on in my image with a waiting notification -- can you see it? Me neither.
11. There is some sort of sound-based occupancy sensor in this version of the echo -- again, doesn't work reliably, poorly documented; and poorly implemented and integrated with the buggy alexa app.
12. Still no way to interact with the echo devices using a web browser -- forced to use the buggy app.
13. Volume normalization across feeds is abominable. Some sources, BBC World Service, for example are quiet -- others, such as the NPR feed are loud. This should be tested before feeds are allowed to go live. Even better, sound normalization should be automated in the cloud if not on the device. It's maddening to be required to manually adjust the volume on EVERY SINGLE source!

Danny,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2022","I upgraded from a 2nd gen that I loved... Speakers were great, whisper across the room and it heard me. I've had the 4th gen for 3 months and absolutely hate it. The speaker sounds great, but the microphones are terrible. Pretty much defeats the purpose of having a smart speaker. I have it sitting on my nightstand 6 to 10 inches from my head and it doesn't hear me. I literally have to almost yell for it to do anything while lying in bed. Standing up, I need to right up to it to have it respond to me. I've reset, de-registered and re-registered, tried all the internet solutions and it still doesn't work. There is definitely a flaw in the design or components. Buyer beware, hopefully Amazon can fix the issues. I am ready to throw this in the trash.

***UPDATE: 10/5/22***
Still having the same issues with the microphones not hearing me. I've been contacted by Amazon Outreach Support for comments on my review. They offered to replace the unit with a refurbished one, but I did not want one that someone else returned for possibly the same reason.

The 4th gen has 4 microphones where as the 2nd gen I traded in had 7 microphones. Why the reduction in microphones? With my bedroom door open I can yell to my bedroom Echo, with out a response, and I can hear the 2nd gen Echo downstairs in the living room respond. It is actually comical at this point. I no longer have to snooze the alarm since I fully wake up trying to get it to respond. Something is definitely wrong with this design and lack of microphones. I've been watching and waiting to see if an updated version is coming out, but still nothing. Huge disappointment for a great device.

We have a total of 7 Echo speakers in the house range from the cube to the dot, varying generations. By far this is the best sounding, but it is also deaf at the same time. I dabbled with the idea of replacing my home entertainment speakers with either 2 of these 4th gen and the sub-woofer or an Echo Studio and the sub-woofer, but none have been updated in years. 2020 for the 4th gen and 2019 for the Studio. I hope new version come out of both speakers and I can make a few upgrades.

Bottom line, if you have an older gen Echo and it suits your needs, wait for a better model to be released and skip the 4th gen.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Zach,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2022","Updated 3x: this device works for a while then will randomly stop listening to you and you need to manually restart them to get it to listen to you. This makes it feel more like a diy tinkering toy and less like a premium product.
My device still plays music from routines so I know it is connected to the internet so this is just an Amazon issue. Very disappointing. I wish I had stuck with google or tried apple’s offering instead.
Another issue I’ve found, this device consistently asks me if I want to hear about products. I want my smart home device to control my smart home, not shove marketing down my throat.

Updated 2x: the device has not given me any more issues. The mic is so sensitive it hears commands coming from downstairs or even when I whisper the A word. The sound quality is muddy but becomes “normal” when you turn down the bass setting as low as possible. This makes the device sound very good. This is a great upgrade over a dot to the point where I actually enjoy listening to music on it.
If you want an alexa device and don’t want to spend $200 for the studio this is the one to get.
I only wish they added that light up clock on this one, then It would be perfect for me.

Updated: last time I unplugged and plugged back in this device seemed to do the trick fixing the microphone sensitivity for the last week.
We will see how long it lasts before I need to do this again

I needed to upgrade because the echo 1 I was using had an issue where the speaker would short out so you had to unplug it and plug it back in to get the sound to work.

In terms of sound and voice recognition this device is not a huge upgrade compared to the first gen echo.

This device is just as good as the original with some added features like a thermometer and sonic detection and a 3.5mm out/in so you can use it as a speaker or use other speakers with it.

Why this device gets 1 star is for some reason when the device has been plugged in for awhile it will stop hearing the wake word. I am unsure if it is a power saving setting or a wifi setting but the device just does not listen. The only way to fix it is to unplug and plug the device back in.

This was the main reason I needed a new device in the first place so you can see how satisfied I am with the new echo.

Hobeyone,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2021","Update November 2021: I have taken this echo out of service. Last night I ask her to play Klove radio station for me. She said I needed to get Amazons music service. Told her to stop and tried again. She wanted to play Christmas music. Told her to stop. Ask her what the temperature would be and she started to play Christmas music. Took her out of service. Ask my echo show to play klove for 30 minutes. Her answer was ""playing klove fromm H..... I heart radio for 30 minutes.""
I think Amazon had different clouds for different echos. I have my dots be down but my show5 works fine. My dots don't argue we me like this echo does and this on is always trying to get me to buy things, a lot more than dots and shows does.

Original post: I have echos from the very first one to now including echo show 5. The sound quality is the best of all. This new one (4th generation) has problem of hearing you and understanding you. I almost have to yell to get her to hear me and then she doesn't understand. Example. I have lights with wifi bulbs (2 different brands) I almost always have to tell her twice to turn on or off. I have a Amazon smart plug and the same. easy to set up and easy to get other products to work with her.
Update: I’ve changed my post from 3 Stars to 1. She’s getting more hard of hearing. She went bonkers the other night and could only do a few commands. She kept telling me that she could not connect to the internet. All others were okay. I finally unplugged her then restarted. She then told me she needed to recalibrate. That’s a new one.

Update: less than a hour after posting the update Amazon customer services called and worked through the problem. The wakeup name Alexa is a corrupted file. Changing to echo made it better. We will see if that holds. Change from 3 stars to one. Will move It to 2 stars. If it holds i will change ratings to 3 or higher.

UPDATE September 30 2021:
I’m going to go back to one star. Her hearing problem is getting worse. She now argues with me. I tell her to turn on plug for porch and she gives ne the definition of a porch. I must tell her two times to turn on porch. She then tells me the porch is not a command. Go to another echo same command and porch comes on.
I’ve decided to remove her and put in my old first generation puck in her place. It’s does not miss a command.
After reading all the reviews about her hard of hearing I ordered anyway. My advice is don’t buy this one.
For information the command to turn on porch was at 4:00 am nothing was on in room to distract her. And had to give command twice and hear what a porch was.",1.0 out of 5 stars
David Miller,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2021","The speaker works well in a large room and we like the looks and color (blue), even though the cord is white. However, the Alexa apt is frustrating and has been since my first Echo Dot (original generation). Then, there's the Amazon Music Unlimited, which you would think would work great with the Amazon Alexa AND the Amazon Echo speakers. Well, I don't know which to blame, but here is an example: I paired my new 4th Generation Echo with my existing 1st gen. Echo Dot (in another room via the Alexa apt), then requested an artist playlist (i.e. ""play music by Neil Diamond"") and they both worked - for a while. Then, after about six hours (which included Christmas music in March) the gen 4 Echo (mid-song) shut off while the old Echo Dot kept playing. Trying to correct the situation means: Stop Alexa, wait a while, then start over, if you're still inclined. This happens All the time when leaving on long enough. The sound volume also varies song-to-song so that I frequently manually turn the sound up or down. The sound quality is surprisingly good, otherwise. Alexa voice recognition, even after a substantial break-in period is ify: sometimes when requesting a playlist or song Alexa will want to sell me a book.
Some artists play for hours and some for an hour, even though they have many more songs to their credit (i.e. Bill Medley played for one hour with three repeats of ""The Time of Our Lives""). If you have a lot of patience, have fun, but, sooner-or-later things get frustrating.
Update: After contacting Amazon, a very helpful customer rep. guided me through a Factory Reset. Afterwards she promised the device would work 'perfectly'. It works worse. Now about tree hours both 4th Gen. Echo's hiss during playback then shut down with my original 1st Gen. Echo Dot still playing (on my 'everywhere' group inside our house). Then it took 6-7 attempts to get my old Echo Dot to stop. Before I purchased the two 4th Gen. Echo's, everything worked fine .. not 'perfectly', but fine. Good Luck! IF you buy these .. Still not sure if the problem is the new Echo's or Amazon Music Unlimited. Another update (4-20-21): While we do enjoy Amazon Music (when it works) and the sound is good .. the Echo is in a large room so I decided to add another for stereo and coverage .. call me stupid for still hoping for a good experience .. what convinced me to buy another (?) .. Amazon put it on sale and promised to include a free smart plug .. well, Amazon came through again and didn't include the smart plug and their customer service can't remedy. At least I got the sale price, but, I am increasingly NOT becoming a loyal Amazon customer. 6/10/21 Update: Alexa Sucks!: Frequently doesn't play what you ask for, or, when it does, stops playing, mid-song, when it wants, then freezes so you can't play any music until ""SHE"" feels like it (even doing a 'unplug' restart doesn't help). These speakers are marketed for Alexa and Amazon Music users and the experience (six months worth) is frustrating, maddening, and just plain bad.",1.0 out of 5 stars
J. D. Hyde,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021","I've had many Echo devices starting with my first when I was invited to buy a 1st gen before they went to market. I currently have 2 Echo Shows, 2 4th gen Echos, 2 Echo Dots and an Echo Auto. We've always like the Echo products...until recently. About a month ago, we went to bed and as usual told Alexa to play our SleepyTime playlist. Sometime in the night, she stopped playing and when we tried to get the playlist going again she said she couldn't reach the internet. When I woke up the next morning, I found our internet was fine so I tried reconnecting the Echo. No matter what I tried, she would not connect. If I asked her a question, she would just reply with ""I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. The internet is not reachable. ""I even did a factory reset - still no good. Thinking it was bad, I went to Best Buy and bought another 4th gen Echo. It too too would not connect. I tried over and over - no good. So, for kicks, I decided to use my wife's phone and her Amazon account and in the first attempt the device connected. To eliminate my phone as a problem. I opened a brand new Fire Tablet registered to me. I first updated the Alexa app and attempted to connect the 4th gen Echo to my account - no good. We've done coutless resets, but nothing works with my account. Her account, no problem. I have taken the Echo to my work and it does the same thing there as well. The problem with using my wife's account is that all of the other devices, Kasa plugs, Hue lights etc., are attached to my account. I had bought a pack of 4 Kasa plugs and they cannot attach to my account either. I can use them within the Kasa app, but cannot attach them to my Alexa account. Basically, my account is somehow damaged. I called tech support after about 10 days of trying to fix this myself. I was hung-up on twice, but eventually got someone in Echo tech support. After trying many things, even screen sharing from the new Fire tablet, the technician said that this was very unusual and should not be behaving like this. The devices register on my account, but they just won't work. She told me she and her team would need time to investigate this issue and asked me for a good callback time for the next day. I said 5:30pm would be good. I never got the call and my devices still are not working. Through my efforts, I have eliminated my network, my phone, my tablet, the Alexa app, the Echo devices- everything but my Alexa account.

BookishBoston,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2024","After being unplugged for several months, the device is no longer responding to voice commands. I discovered this about one week shy of a year from the date of purchase. I went through all of the online troubleshooting tips but nothing worked. Amazon does not offer any actual customer service or product support for their devices. Every time I tried to contact them, it just kept circling back to the online FAQs and troubleshooting pages and now it is outside of the window for the warranty by about a week. At this point, the device will only work as a Bluetooth speaker when I connect it to my phone and will not respond to any verbal commands.

Apparently Amazon just wants their customers to clutter up landfills with broken plastic merchandise and throw good money after bad to replace faulty products rather than providing decent support. Very frustrating and disappointing!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Itsme,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2020","I use other speakers for sound so that isn’t a thing to me. We do use it constantly for our curtains, lights, fans, etc. The white cord is ridiculous. The form factor is neat but makes the blue light more difficult to see.

Setup was difficult. It glitched on the first go and so the app kept looping to “setup your new echo device despite having set it up 5 times. I reset it and started over. The light now lights up.

It doesn’t hear me any better or get the commands correct more frequently than the previous generation. I constantly get “x device doesn’t support that” followed by the command being carried out the next time I say it. It integrates horribly with my firetv stick (so did the previous generation) where “launch Hulu on firetv” gives me a 50/50 split of “that skill is not enabled” and “launching Hulu on firetv”.

I have 3 alexas in 3 different rooms spanning about 2000 square feet. The microphones are too good so more often than not 2/3 of them hear the wake word and (I guess?) assume the other one will follow out the command so neither does it. The new Alexa asked me yesterday if I was talking to it or a different Alexa. I corrected it but it hasn’t helped anything.

The only positive here is that when it gets a command right, specifically with SmartThings, it is a little faster.

Our echo does not sit directly under the tv. It would be neat if the echo would work for as read sound or atmos sound for your tv. It does not. It will only work as a tv speaker with our firetv stick which means the sound comes out from a weird place in our room.

*****Update****. It’s garbage. I have to yell for it to hear me and when it does, it ignores my command or gets it completely wrong; “I’m sorry, X device doesn’t support that” randomly only to work perfectly the next time. The microphone is worse than the firetv cubes by 10. The old microphone was so much better. If I could return this I would. If you want better sound get an Echo Studio or SONOS instead.

Update 2: If I wasn’t so lazy I’d go find our old one in the basement. This thing doesn’t hear me, ignores me…seems to hear me then ignores me. What the heck happened here? Who thought this was a good idea? How is this 5 stars?

I was contacted by customer service and told this issue was being resolved and after a few days it seemed to be, although i had to recreate my playlists for it to work. Now, its back to not playing my actual playlist, of music i purchased, but rather plays random music the system deems similar. I have moved to spotify and will cease buying my music from amazon and will be setting up a system that does not rely on amazon music or the echo devices as it is just too frustrating. Granted amazon already got my money, but they will get no more and i will warn anyone who will listen. It should not be this difficult to play a playlist of music ive prchased. Frankly, i think it's all part of the pressure to force one to subscribe to unlimited, even to access music one has already purchased and it's just wrong. All I wanted was a way to play music. Alexa has a decent speaket for my purposes and I figure it will work well with my Prime Music. Ha. I've never been able to get Alexa (or Echo) to reliably play a playlist without a big hassle. I took to setting up routines to get the device to play the right playlist. But now it won't even do that. Now Alexa will play my playlist - the same one it's played for 3 months - on ""shuffle and similar song"" mode. I mean, if I wanted random music I'd ask for that and not ask for a playlist. When I ask to turn off shuffle mode Alexa says it can't. I checked my prime music and it is NOT on any kind of auto shuffle mode that I can see. Going with Alexa for music has been a mistake. A device that is supposed to make life easier has been a constant source of frustration and now a complete fail for the purpose I bought it.

Hidden for Security Purposes,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2022","I've had an Echo device since the original was in pre-order, and I got it for $100. Last year, we finally decided it had gotten old enough and traded it in for a new one. That was a mistake.

The new Echo's want to be so helpful. Want some music? They'll gladly tell you all about Amazon's Music Unlimited subscription service, that just so happens is NOT included with Prime. Want to listen to the news? It'll turn on TuneIn, which'll make you listen to up to 10 minutes of commercials before actually playing the news. Want to track your Amazon purchases? It'll happily give you notifications, sometimes even without you asking or wanting them, about where your packages are.

When the Echo starts blinking yellow, you're supposed to ask it what the notification is. Most of the time, it'll tell you about a Subscribe & Save item that's being delayed, or a package got delivered, etc. But sometimes, it'll recommend a book that you have absolutely no interest in.

The book recommendations were my last straw. A little backstory first. As far as I can tell, out of roughly 1500 purchases I've made on Amazon in the last decade, perhaps 5 of them have been books, and none of them for me. They've all been cookbooks, or kids books, as gifts for others. So why, in the name of all that's holy, does the Echo insist on giving me notifications for random books that will be coming out? I don't want them. I don't care what they are. I have never, in the 8 years of owning an Echo, purchased a book through it. I've never asked it to read a book to me. I've never used it to play an audiobook. There is no overlap between what I've told it to do or what I've used it for, and upcoming book releases. That venn diagram is 2 circles with a mile between them. Yet, you CAN NOT disable these notifications. No amount of settings changes, or account updates, or even calling Amazon Tech Support, will remove them.

I do not want book notifications. For that reason, I just bought a Homepod Mini, and I'll be returning my Echo. Maybe if Amazon updates their pushy marketing tactics, I'll get another one, but it's not likely.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Thomas S.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2022","Purchased to replace the gen 1 white Echo cylinder that had its WiFi circuit fail after 4 years of daily use.
Arrived and setup was easy and it did all the cylinder did , slightly better sound as well (though fabric cover is not suited for kitchens - so amazon being back a cylinder variant as well , Of hard plastic so it can be cleaned on the outsides with a glass cleaner ).
But today - day 5 of use out of the blue the music playing suddenly emitter a loud crackle sound of 1-2 seconds length. Went to investigate the noise. Again the loud crackle and then the music returned. Waited a bit and again. It was happening regularly , about 3 to 4 times a minute. Unplugged and replugged to see if a reboot would help. Sitting idle nothing. Asked Alexa to play music and it began playing - and again every 15-20 seconds the loud crackle if 1-2 second length. Definite hardware failure.
By the nature of it I suspect the circuits that feed the digital audio from that source in the cpu over to the digital to analog converter before it goes to the amp , is getting the data corrupted and so what gets decode isn’t the music signal not now a random jumble of loud digital noise. Packet corruption if you will.
So fails on less than a week - a computer or build flaw. Back it goes. Given others habe reported this of may be a bigger batch or systemic failure of some bad components or issue with the board design that fails after some days of use.
So if you are buying one in 2022 be sure to plug it in and make use of it playing music daily for at least a few weeks so you can get a refund / exchange more easily. Don’t leave it in the box for weeks or give it as a gift some days / weeks down the road.",1.0 out of 5 stars
JV,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2020","They design a device to look aesthetically pleasing to the eye as it sits on your counter or table. And then they send your Charcoal or Twilight Blue device with a white power cord. Pretty unbelievable that they did not color match the cord, especially since it needs to remain plugged in 100% of the time. Really disappointed. Returning three of these tomorrow. Google Home, here I come.

FOLLOW UP - So I got a quick call and email from Amazon. But their response was even more disappointing. Here's the email:

Hello, My name is Christian and I’m from Amazon’s Technical Support team. I'm sorry to hear about the issue/s experienced with your 4th Gen Echo, which prompted you to leave a critical review on Amazon.com. I tried to reach you over the phone, but unfortunately we didn't connect. I understand you're rather concerned about the aesthetics of the white power cord. This was an intentional decision that we made so that the power cord could more easily blend in with white background (think drywall, etc.). Since we'd still like to offer you some options, you're free to purchase a replacement power adapter in black at the link below (your model takes 30 watts): https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S8K1RP

What a load of crap - This ""think drywall"" rationale makes sense if you have drywall that is painted white, which I can tell you, no one in the northeastern United States has. Amazon made the decision to throw a white cord in every box to save money on the non-white devices and/or get people to shell out another $20 for the color cord that should have been in the box. Really disappointing from Amazon and really shortsighted.

2ND UPDATE - So, Amazon dropped the price on these by $30.00. I bought three of them, so I decide to stick with the Alexas despite the cord issue on the black. I call to get a price adjustment. Nope, you have to return all three and buy three new ones. Clearly Amazon is hoping this will be an impediment to customers trying to get the lower price. I say, that makes no sense because Amazon is going to have to eat additional shipping plus reboxing. Sales rep tells me, they have to do it that way because there are only so many at the sales price. Another customer service line of crap. So, in theory, they are going to take my $100 Alexas, put them on the side and sell them only after the sale. Doubtful.

Ralph,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2022","I was surprised by how little this thing can actually do and by how un-seamless the user experience is. The biggest smart-home items I have that I wanted to connect are my robot vacuum and robot mopper, from Neato and iRobot respectively.

The Alexa app has robot vacuums as a main device category, but connecting them is really difficult. For the Neato vacuum, you have to connect your Neato account to Amazon. Fair enough, except that it only works if you used the same email address for both accounts! You will have to change your Neato email address to whatever you use with Amazon. Sorry if you wanted privacy.

Connecting the iRobot mopper just didn't work. You have to install the iRobot skill, then add the bot as a device, but it won't connect to my Braava Jet robot at all. There is really no way to get help with it either. Amazon can't offer support for the dozens of 3rd party devices they claim to support, and iRobot doesn't know how to get it to work either. That is a hint of a failing ecosystem.

I don't have any smart lights or anything like that yet, so what's left in terms of functionality is low-level features like the flash briefing. But even this seems like it's been neglected by Amazon. Many of the news sources on offer have stopped updating, so you can add them but Alexa just says they are unavailable every time. It's really difficult to customize also. I noticed if you ask Alexa how to edit your flash briefing she gives you inaccurate directions that don't reflect the current version of the Alexa app. If you manage to figure it out, you realize you can't really add useful things to your flash briefing like air quality for your city. It seems the boundaries of the experience are quite narrow, and they are becoming more narrow as the ecosystem shrinks.

Below are from Amazon.com's Customer service team, but AMAZON do not take actions to resolve the issue that AMAZON caused, but ask customer to buy more device to solve the issue.

Thank you for the reply - Unfortunately, the model you described:
""Kwikset 99160-020 Smartcode 916 Traditional Smart Lock Touchscreen Electronic Deadbolt Door Lock with SmartKey Security and Z-Wave Plus.""

Is not directly compatible with an Echo's zigbee hub, it uses z-wave a similar but different protocol, which would necessitate a hub.

That being said, you still have 2 options here, you can try to use the documentation I provided to get your earlier smart lock hooked up to your Echo.

Please note that instead of using the key app and trying to pair with the smart lock, you just have to tell the Echo ""Alexa, discover devices"" after resetting the smart lock or putting it in pairing mode. (I understand the documentation is old, but zigbee is standardized so there's a good chance we can pair with the lock).

Alternatively, you can try a z-wave lock and use a compatible hub, I have 2 suggestions for hubs linked below for you to choose at your convenience - each of which will work with both Alexa and Google assistant:

I'm returning the echos i bought. They arrived not but an hour ago. Futility is the mantra when it comes to the set up and pairing of these two thingies. The end result is no device pairing and an hour of wasted time. Time which probably would have been more enjoyably spent staring at the wall. Try wall staring if you have not!! It's much more enjoyable than trying to set up echos! lol. Imho, the echo is horrible.

Please pass this feedback on to the manufacturer: ""The echo is a LAME, and intolerable device whose insolence should not be tolerated. It is a de-evolutionary system and therefore a total step back from previous versions. I am returning both echos i bought after an hour of futility spent attempting to set them up. You should abandon this version and give them away gratis to people who enjoy bad technology.""

Note to potential echo buyers out there: If you are into music and are desirous of a new system, do yourself a favor and buy yourself a sonos. Or multiple soni (sp?) I already have sonos and the set up is a breeze. It's like uncorking a bottle and watching spellbound as Barbara Eden floats out. Truth.

I was lured into trying this ""next gen"" echo because of the bargain basement pricing. There is a reason for this. An hour of my billable time is far more valuable than the price of the echo, and since I'm in the tech industry for a living, I don't need the aggravation of battling yet another system in my spare time.

These speakers should deploy and set up almost ""automagically"" since they have the weighty support of Amazon's legions of engineers to back up the design. This is not the case. These speakers should bear a big red label reading ""Warning Lame Tech Inside. Proceed at your own risk. Perhaps you would be better off staring at the wall.""

In the last year the AI has gotten progressively worse. The software updates make it worse as they enable “AI” code that has clearly been pushed out the door untested and broken to capitalize on the hype. The net result is the ONE requirement for any smart speaker “mute” is now gone. Echo decided that when you said ‘good morning’ to your wife that means “play mind destroying German heavy metal porn with screaming babies” and you have no way to make it stop. Before Amazon ruined the software you could say “WAKEWORD STOP” but now it just plays more German porn heavy metal LOUDER from all your speakers unsynchronized and the only way to stop them all is to unplug them for a few hours until you want the worst device ever to turn on, listen on all your conversations, take stealth video of you , and play music when you don’t ask and never can find the song you ask for “play Green Day” = “I could not find a song named “Jojo blooey van hincjlewicz, playing loud German heavy metal porn for the next hour instead.” WHY???!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars
JohnD,"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2023","The primary reason we have an echo at all is so my wife can listen to her music.

This Echo (4th gen) replaces a years old first generation Echo which had begun to malfunction pretty badly. So she could have ""unlimited"" music we subscribe to the unlimited music package for $4.99/month for a single device.

1. Now, Amazon wants us to upgrade our subscription to $8.99/month which is the price for multiple devices. I verified that our original Echo was de-registered but it now wants to include our Fire-Stick ( which we never use for music).

2. When we asked our original Echo to play a song, it played the song we asked for and then stopped, exactly the behavior we wanted. Now, if we ask for a song Alexa automatically shuffles the song we requested with ""similar songs"", and most often does not play the requested song first, In addition, Alexa only allows 6 skipped songs per hour, even though she is playing we never asked for.

3. Sometimes Alexa will refuse to play a song unless we upgrade to ""unlimited"" (which we already have), even though she played the song recently. Then, after we decline the upgrade she will shuffle he song we requested in with similar songs, and then play the similar songs instead of the one requested.

We find all of these ""features"" frustrating in the extreme and have felt like smashing the Echo to pieces.

Alexa also acts strangely when she doesn't understand something and just bleeps something and shuts off. If I ask a long question, she'll cut me and start operating based on half of my sentence.
She never was able to answer something that is relevant to the previous thing we talked about.

Our other devices this may happen a few times a year. Secondly we listen through Spotify and this device has to wake up before it can be chosen as an available device to play through. Finally, a new trick while playing music all of a sudden it goes to static. This just started in the past month. We have a significant investment in our house with devices in every room.

Detective,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2021","All of the 4th Gen Echos are Amazon's greatest failure. The 3rd Gens are great, they hear you every time. they stay connected to the internet, they do what they're made to do every singe time.--The 4th Gens do the exact opposite, from day one all of the 4th Gen ones I have purchased have done nothing but fail to do what they are made to do. They have better speakers, and this big one has added a temperature sensor, which is truly a game changer for routines, allowing Alexa to monitor the temperature of a room and adjust accordingly on her own. Howver she NEVER hears me say her name the first time, 80% of the time once she does, she will not hear the command I give her. How is an Echo supposed to work if it cannot understand its user. That is literally the ONLY thing these things need to do--well that and stay connected to the internet. there is a 50/50 shot that when I say her name, she gives me the ""the intertnet isnt accessible"" line. When it Very much is. every other device I have connects and stays connected just fine. It is only the 4th Gen echos that have so much trouble staying connected.
The temperature sensor is the only real thing worth even trying to buy one of these, but its hugely unreliable at best, and sadly no other temperature sensor can initiate a routine based on the rooms degree yet. -----Do not waste your money on the 4th gen, buy a 3rd gen or wait for the 5th

Brian Tullio,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2021","I have had Echos since the original beta group back in 2014. I still have and use my Gen 1 every day. I currently have 9 of them including Echo Autos, 4 dots, and an Echo Flex. I purchased this 4th gen to replace the 1st gen that I use as the main Echo in my living room. The 1st gen is still working great, but it's not compatible with some of the new Alexa features.

We got it last year on black Friday. It would respond to commands OK for a few hours. After that, it would stop responding entirely. You could manually wake it with the button, but it would not hear you at all. A power reset would fix it, for a few hours or a day and then it would happen all over again. After dealing with Amazon, they sent a replacement. The replacement had the same issue. Even when it did work, you had to speak very loud and close. The Echo dots on the other side of the house would respond instead of this one 3 feet away.

The Echo was placed in the same location as the one it replaced, on the same network.

After going through 2 units, we figured there was some sort of known issue. We returned the second unit and went back to our 1st gen. A year later (hoping that the issues have been worked out), we purchased another unit. Guess what? New unit has the same exact issue.

Search Google for Echo 4th gen microphone issues and you will see this happens to a lot of people. Even when they do worth, they don't work nearly as good as previous generations. Which is a shame.

For now, this one is going back again and we will continue to use our 1st gen until Amazon can get it together.",1.0 out of 5 stars

st0rmbringer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2021","I recently traded in all my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gen devices to ""upgrade"" to the 4th gen devices. If you're thinking about it, DON'T DO IT!

1) The 4th gen devices don't seem to pick up voice commands as well. We frequently use the Echo in our family room on the 1st floor. Even though we are 5 feet away and within line of sight of the Echo, our Echo show upstairs in a room with a *closed* door hears the command instead and prevents the family room Echo from responding. The activity logs indicate the Echo Show wasn't the intended device, but ultimately none of them respond so we have to repeat the command.

2) The sound is awful. The previous Echo's had a nice range and good base. The 4th gen echo sounds very hollow and tinny. If you like to listen to music through your Echo, avoid the 4th gen devices!!

3) The light ring is now on the bottom of the Echo, so unless the device is placed at a position lower than you, you probably won't be able to see it. Considering the mic can't pick up your commands well, you'll often wonder if it's doing anything at all since you get no indications.

While not a 4th gen specific issue, the Echo is going to constantly be trying to upsell you on Amazon services. If you request a song that isn't on Prime, it's going to try and upsell you their Ultimate Music service, then it's going to start playing some ""station"" that is not the song you request. 100% of the time I have to further request that it stop playing the station, which it can't hear me well so I end up yelling for it to stop 4 or 5 times. Overall, the Echo has gone from a fun device that was worth the potential privacy concerns to an annoying banner ad that you can't click to close.

KK,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2023","sound quality is awful, extremely bass heavy, at the cost of all other frequencies sounding like crap. bass is one huge overwhelming, muddled mess. mid range and high are completely overshadowed and covered up by the bass. instrument separation and vocal are near non-existent. the reason this item is highly rated on amazon, is because vast majority of people have never heard high quality speakers/headphones, and they mistakenly think vibrating booming bass is good sound. apart from poor sound quality, this product is riddled with features and faults that will drive you insane. most notable flaw is the speaker likes to loudly announce the name of the Bluetooth device connected, in many cases out of nowhere when there's been no changes to the Bluetooth device connected. there is no way to disable it or turn it off either. amazon posted instruction on how to disable it, but it doesn't work. after following amazon's instruction to ""turn it off"", it simply continues to make unwanted announcements loudly. too bad i am past the return window, i was only able to throw it away and eat the $50 dollar loss. this product is so bad, it's simply not usable. learn from my mistake, don't buy this, run away save yourself.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Design: 2/5

I was looking forward to getting the 4th generation echo, I wasn't sure about it after reading all the reviews but I thought I will give it a try anyhow.

I had the 1st generation Echo which was getting replaced by the 4th generation. I didn't really care for the 4th generation sphere design but I had hoped that the technology will make up for it. I was wrong the Echo Dot in the other room answers my questions 😂🤷🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ very disappointed!!! Never had such an issue with 1st generation Echo, now I think why did I replace it in the first place. It even used to prompt if I got the response from the right device.

The most disappointing is the Amazon support not helpful at all. When I reached out to the Chat support they gave me the excuse device software was out of date, I asked why it didn't update automatically, they told me device needs to be idle for half hour. Forget during the day when everyone is awake, it didn't find an idle time at night as well when everyone was asleep 🤣😂

I was able to reproduce the issue today, I asked the Echo 3 questions but every time the Echo Dot in the different room responded and when I called Amazon support, they asked me to reproduce the issue even though they could see in my voice history which device responded to the questions.

I tried to reproduce the issue when I was on call, it didn't happen, they said we will call in an hour. I never heard back from Amazon support and instead got an email saying they couldn't reach me. Very disappointed!!

Verdict: I won't suggest to upgrade...poor device and very horrible customer service. 1st generation Echo was definitely louder and I preferred the overall design. The issues with the mic are annoying.

We have the older Echo as well as the Echo Dot. These work great. This new Echo is awful!

We are now on our THIRD 4th generation Echo. The first one (Round One) hooked up beautifully to all our devices, but was totally hard of hearing. We would stand 2 feet away from Alexa and scream to get her to respond. This device is located on our main floor. The device in our bedroom a floor up and rooms away would respond before the one two feet away did. So Amazon send us a new one. This was after spending 45 minutes on the phone with customer service.

Round Two 4th generation hears perfectly well but is completely was unable to connect with out two brand new Philips Hue light bulbs which were part of the package that came with Round One. Chatted first with someone in the US on fixing this. Seemed like we might be getting somewhere but she put me on hold. Next thing I knew I was talking with someone in India (I think) explaining the whole thing ALL OVER AGAIN. He put be through to someone in the Philippines. Starting from scratch AGAIN I was on the phone with her for 57 minutes!!! It was truly the definition of insanity. Doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result! She finally says something is wrong with your 4th generation ECHO and ships me another new one.

Round Three 4th generation Echo arrives today. Same nightmare as Round Two. Spent 40 minutes on the phone with Amazon Customer services. He states that the only literature he has to go off of is really old!!! Echo is STILL NOT ABLE TO SEE new Philips Hue Lights! He tells me to contact Philips Hue.

MA0X2,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2021","Before this device I used a Google Nest. The voice recognition on the Amazon Echo does not compare to Google Nest. The Amazon Echo, gets confused about 40% of the times, this never happened with the Google Nest. After 6 months of use, Alexa goes silent (no light) and the only way to fix this is to unplug and re-plug the device. I have been patiently doing this, hoping the issue was going to get fixed on its own but for the last two month the issue is occurring more and more often and I now need to unplug/re-plug the device about every 2-3 days. Another issue with the device is I usually have it at a low volume to listen to my tv (line in) and during the day I raise the volume but at the same time, Alexa’s volume is raised so when I say a command, Alexa is extremely loud. I wish Alexa’s volume was separate to avoid this.
Now let’s talk about warranty coverage... It's unbelievably painful to find and get to warranty support for this device. Once I found the link to chat, I was on a chat troubleshooting for about 2 hours. At the end, when the agent decided to process the warranty, she wanted me to ship the item first to Amazon, wait a few days for them to process it and then send me the replacement. The agent then told me she couldn't process it and asked me to delete my home address and re-enter (to check, if that was going to allow her to process the request).

If you ask for something to play it plays random songs and will eventually get around to the song that you wanted to hear to begin with, and you cannot shuffle songs anymore. For prime members Amazon unlimited music was supposed to be $8.99 a month, then I got notification that it was going up to $13.99 a month. So I canceled Amazon prime music. They have become too greedy, it's not like we don't spend enough to begin with buying their products and yes we do get free shipping but that is a benefit of membership of any company.

I have had nothing but trouble. And I’m not alone. Google it. The problem is pervasive and persistent.

I plugged it in initially around Dec 1 and have regretted it since. My device randomly plays audacy at an absurd volume and won’t always shut off—sometimes I have to unplug it to get it to stop. I have tried resetting it, reinstalling the app, factory restores, removing all devices from my account, removing all skills/apps from the device, etc. I’ve watched videos, read help pages, and asked friends in IT to help. Nothing—NOTHING—resolves the issue. I have taken my Alexa down to no skills or apps. Basically it’s now an automated list maker and it STILL randomly plays Audacy (and by “plays” I mean “screams”). It only plays Audacy; nothing else…although it recently started to randomly beep at me. My privacy settings are as locked down as they can be and still—still—the problem remains.

Don’t. Do. It. Go to a different system and let Amazon work through its issues in someone else’s home. I’ve had this gen for about 3 months and it’s spent about 1/3 of that time unplugged because the anxiety these random musical attacks trigger makes the whole system not worth it.

I was an early adopter and had it when Amazon only sold it through invitation only. I was fine upgrading it because it definitely was well used during its life. I've set the new one up and my negative review is based on playing music (regardless on what model you have). Since I had echoes back in 2015/2016, you could always have the device play your music from you amazon library of music you purchased through amazon. For instance, I would say ""Play songs by [particular artist]"". Or ""Shuffle songs by [artist name]"". That seems to be rather different in the last couple of months as Amazon upgraded their music services. Now when I ask Alexa to shuffle or play songs from my library by a particular artist, she will no longer do that, but only play songs through Amazon music service where you are forced to listen to similar artists through their own library. This is very frustrating and a terrible change. It seems like they're always trying to get you to subscribe to pay for their premium music service.

John Hicks,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2024","This purchase turned out to be a colossal waste of money.
There is no way to control or protect the device from outside influence or control.
Since my purchase, this unit will randomly start playing music - advertisements - or mood/meditation music at random times late at night, or very early (02:30 AM) in the morning. I have called Amazon customer service many times to get (Fake) assistance which always ends in this unit doing whatever it wants.
I have re-registered, de-registered, purged, restarted hundreds of times, and wasted many calls over this device.
I would only recommend this device to a personal enemy as a joke.

I wish I could say more negative things without being vulgar, but I am exhausted with wasting my time on this device. Buy a good bluetooth speaker for yourself and forget thinking about buying this device.

Richard LaCroix,"Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2022","I purchased this one To better manage the smart bulbs instead of using the hub. I have become spoiled using Alexa to turn things on and off throughout the house via smart bulbs plugs or switches it has become an enjoyable thing to not have to get up and go do something when you’re lying in bed. I recently had to return the smart hub due to the fact it would not listen properly and after a couple of months I got frustrated and finally called Amazon was very helpful and had me send it back to them and found that it needed replacement which the replacement arrived within two days. I do enjoy listening to music on these devices throughout the house playing on a group or every one of your connected echo devices can play the same song throughout the house. This is especially helpful during storms when my dogs who can’t stand the sound of thunder or gunshots the music throughout the house keeps them from hearing it more than they would if it was silent.
Well, it seems that these devices have a blue ring of death and mine got it. It’s out of warranty so I won’t be replaced especially at this price, and I was very disappointed that I change my rating from a five star to a one star I have one of the original echo devices is still going strong, and there’s no reason they should’ve only lasted literally a year and a half",1.0 out of 5 stars

erypmav,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2020","I wanted to replace a 2nd Gen Dot with a full size Echo. It was just when the pre-order for Echo 4th Gen opened. I figured, ""Sure! This will be good!"" Unfortunately I was very, very wrong.

I, like other purchasers, have the issue of poor microphone sensitivity. I find myself repeating ""Alexa"" about 3 times before it wakes up. I'll give it a command and it will just wait in limbo until I repeat the command.

Additionally, like other purchasers, I don't like that it came with a white power cord. It looks stupid with a charcoal unit.

The sound quality is AWFUL! I believe part of the issue is that the speaker is angled from 1/2 way up the front to the base of the back. The rest of the top is just plastic, not speaker. I didn't think about it at the time but it's a stupid design. Sound is being pushed out and down. Perhaps if I put it on a high shelf it would sound better but should I HAVE to place it on a high shelf to be able to hear it properly?

Interestingly, I was charged full price for the ""free"" Philips bulb that was included with the pre-order. I hadn't actually noticed until just the other day. So they screwed me on that.

I would have returned the Echo 4th Gen but, like an idiot, I threw away the box before I realized how bad a product it is. So it's pretty much a paperweight now.

CIJay,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2022","This item was got through Amazon and was ""pre set"" for me. It did not work properly with no microphone. After a walk through where I had to re set it myself, it worked, but he microphone became less and less responsive over the months that I continued to make payments. As soon as it was paid off, the microphone stopped responding to most commands. Music playing in groups gets disrupted and stopped due to this device, while when unplugged, I get good music. Customer service told me online that it will simply be replaced, since it is within warantee, and to follow instructions to send the bad one back. After that communication, I was told differently online that it is a REPAIR request, that they are not honoring the warantee replacement, and that I have to send the item to Amaaon via UPS, have their technicans take it apart and analize it, then send it back to me. So one customer service tells me that the new one is ordered and will be here in 3-5 business days, another tells me that I will get nothing until they get the broken one and fix it then send it back, and now I am on perpetual hold because the phone operators are too busy goofing off to actually provide any kind of completent assistance.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Sometimes, you will get burned. Literally.

The latest example as tonight. I put chicken breast on the grill and asked for a timer.
Too many minutes later, I asked Alexa for time remaining. Alexa decided that a request for 3:30 should really have been 13:30.

the sound is louder but I feel like my 2nd gen sound much better but without having it to compare to its just hard to tell for sure.

As for the roundness of it... I think its cool but it takes up more room so I had to move some things around....The light being at the bottom is annoying and dumb to me, I understand that they were going for it reflecting off of what its on but....personally I do not have or do I like White Furniture and that seems to be what it would do best on, I use Light wood or dark wood and this does horrible at showing the light off. I never notice when I have a notification nor can I see if it heard me without getting closer to it. You can not have anything around it now with how this was made.

I may end up looking for a small round Mirror for it to sit on so I can maybe see the light. I hope their next design is better Sound quality and a better design. My $50 Anker Bluetooth speaker sounds louder and better then this thing.

Maybe I just got one a little towards the lemon side. It sits in the same exact spot my old cylinder style echo used to be but 70% of the time I have to repeat myself three times with my voice volume going up each time before it recognizes my voice. Once again it could be placement which is next to a couch arm and a wall, But my old cylinder style echo heard me 80% of the time instead of just 30% of the time like this unit. Nicely designed looks good integrated into my Alexa system basically easy when changing over. Except blink cameras, it randomly overtime would show up a different blink camera as new device discovered. I would have to say my favorite part is it doesn’t fall over like the cylinder when the cats rubs up against it. All in all the sound is decent or good enough for me, I am no audio file nut and listen to very little music, device looks good, and eventually does what I request of it. I do find all echo devices do have their strange quirks, which I don’t understand because I would think they all work off the same cloud and would use the same exact commands; that does not seem to be the situation at least not in my experience. Had an echo show five that I just traded in that constantly I needed to use different commands than any of my other devices. And this new echo device (4thGEN) for some reason decided that it will not work with my living room light unless I specify in the command “living room light”even though the light is in Alex App as just living room and the old tower echo device used to accept just the word “living room off/on”, took me a while to figure out what was going on and why the device was telling me “living room does not support this command”. Also constantly have problems with the play and pause fire TV command, after pausing when I use the play command it tends to change the TV into a search mode. I find it just easier to manually play and pause. And the occasional changing of commands overtime is also quite annoying. Certain commands I used for months/years and suddenly one day they would not work and I had to figure out what the new command was, this is extremely annoying. Please stop doing this Amazon leave well enough alone.
Well I realized I never hit submit on this review, now it’s approximately eight months later, and I can’t stand this thing, constantly have to repeat myself over and over again. Sometimes it doesn’t even do anything except the blue and green lights just keep spinning around like it’s trying to figure out what I just said. wish I never traded in my old tower version. What’s going to be the next shape so they can sell more but make no true improvements a pyramid, a rectangle, an octagon God only knows. Now almost all of my lights in the house need the word light said after them to work properly so now it’s no longer front porch off, now I have to say front porch light off. Soon I’m gonna have to read a novel to the thing to get it to do some thing probably give it GPS coordinates of the light so it will work. Very disappointed my sister has an Alexa and Google and she tells me she prefers the Google much better. Also since Amazon took over the blink cameras, love the cameras but the app with every update gets worse, for some reason with each update one click turns into two clicks next update those two clicks to change a setting has turned into three clicks or more to change a setting what sense is this. This little echo ball works so badly, it is literally sitting 2 feet from me on a table, that I give up and holler to the old Echo dots in the kitchen for my needs.

They don't pick up on my voice commands and its gotten to the point where I'm having an argument with an inanimate object.

I don't know what the deal is with Gen 4 devices, but I can't recommend these no matter how much they cut the price. Now I hear rumors that Alexa is going to become a subscription model once they implement AI into them. Man, if we are already paying for Prime, why do we have to fork out more cash for these things?

The frequency response is not what I was expecting. Bass is very good, however the treble is poor. When listening to music and I know there are symbols being played but I can't hear them, then it's not worth listening to the music. Don't know if the problem is a hardware design issue with the Echo or a deficiency in the software (equalizer). An example: I have just an average radio and speakers in my car, at best. Sound quality was poor. A few years ago I began using Pandora along with an equalizer application from the Google Play Store. This app from Google Play has 10 band equalizer. I'm playing my music from Pandora to my car radio via bluetooth and incorporating the equalizer app. The fidelity is absolutely AMAZING, dare I say 20Hz - 20kHz.

KSM,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2021","A very poor “whole house” audio solution. What little usefulness it has is just a hook to make you pay for and become reliant on amazon music unlimited. Unless you swallow that bait it is a poor and inconvenient option. Even if you can find enough “free with Prime” music that you want to listen to, it won’t let you add more than 20 songs to a playlist. Any function that doesn’t further Amazon’s ability to sell you more stuff or subscribe to more stuff, is just ignored and unaddressed.

“Whole House Audio”??? That’s a joke. It won’t let you play your own music from your phone on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play radio apps on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play audio books on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play the audio from a Bluetooth-connected TV on the “everywhere group”. Basically it’s a novelty item that is WAY oversold as a whole house audio solution. It is only “whole house audio” for being tied to Amazon’s pay streaming music.

If music is playing on one unit, and you ask it to continue playing the music on the “everywhere group”: First, it will tell you that you can’t play music on the “everywhere group” because music is already playing on another unit. But It’s not playing on another unit. It is playing on the unit you are talking to. So it will force you to stop playing the music and then make a new music request to be played on the everywhere group. I have yet to be able to get it to continue playing the same music it was originally playing on the everywhere group. Continuity is awful (non-existent). Amazon is primarily concerned with selling you the unlimited subscription, instead of responding to a reasonably foreseeable request in a manner that enhances your listening continuity as you move around the house.

Let’s say you’re getting ready in the morning and you want Alexa to tell you the news. Don’t expect to able to move around from room to room because it will only play that news audio on one unit. Not on the everywhere group, or on another smaller group. If you move to a different room that has another unit, your only option is to replay the news from the very beginning again and listen to what you have listened to already over again.

None of these problems are beyond the technical ability of the Echo units. Some of the problems are intentionally created obstacles just to try to force you into paying for unlimited. Others problems remain unaddressed because they wouldn’t help (or hurt) Amazon to sell you more “stuff”.

So you’ve spent a few hundred dollars on echo units for around your house? Good luck with that. Don’t expect true whole house audio and don’t expect them to work together as a group of units. All you did was purchase the “gateway drug” for Amazon’s selling machine.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Rob,"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2024","I bought the Echo for the multi-room setup feature, where I can play the same music in every room with an Alexa enabled device. Unfortunately the Echo would not pair up with the Samsung HW-Q800C soundbar, even though it is marketed as ""Alexa built-in."" I say this after working Samsung support for a half hour and then Alexa support for an hour. Both ended up pointing fingers at the other as the cause.

That said, I do give Amazon Alexa support credit for spending so much time with me to try and get this to work. Also, the Echo's voice recognition feature works very well, and sound quality is great. But voice recognition was not the primary motivator in my case - the multi-room was. Hence the two stars.

Amazon should either ensure partners clearly state that their device isn't tested/won't work in a multi-room setup, or ensure that ""Alexa-built in"" means multiroom will work. I am not happy about all the time I wasted, both on my own and with Samsung/Amazon support, to try and get this to work. I ended up getting an Apple Homepod Mini since the Samsung is also Apple Airplay 2 enabled, and set up multiroom that way, easily with no problem.",2.0 out of 5 stars

It's got to be something embedded in the skill by the developer. I will try to record it to determine which skill EXACTLY is responsible for this.

D. W.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2020",I actually prefer the more balanced sound from my echo plus (2nd gen) without needing to mess with the equalizer. I also prefer the 360° sound from the echo plus. after going back-and-forth I’ve personally experienced the microphones on the echo plus pick up my voice better. in my opinion this new version just sounds a little bit louder with more bass even though they both have the exact same drivers with the exception of the new one having an extra tweeter which doesn’t really make a difference in the sound. I actually had to turn down the bass just a little because it sounded a little... messy. i’m not really sure why they completely changed the design and got rid of the 360° sound and made it a directional sound speaker instead. i’m a little confused. One more thing I noticed about the new speaker is when the volume goes up the bass goes down which is very common for all these speakers and most Bluetooth speakers but it seems especially evident in this newest version of the echo. they could’ve at least made the bluetooth option volume sync with your phone with this new version. and of course it wasn’t compatible to pair with my echo plus for stereo. ok i’m done.,2.0 out of 5 stars
Shay,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2021","This is a super handy device, but it has some reliability issues that make it iffy for the kind of lifestyle integration it seems like it'd help with. Voice recognition is a 50/50 toss-up, and while it's better at accurately recognizing words and phrases than other AI assistants, it still misses enough that important information doesn't get added to your to-do list or shopping list.

I use it the most for timers, calendar reminders, task reminders, and adding things to my to-do list and shopping list hands off. Timers and task reminders work great; calendar reminders are awesome, but for some reason everything gets repeated twice even after having it set in the app to only repeat reminders once. The to-do list and shopping list feature works, but the integrations between different apps are really poor (my to-do list lets me have a dumping ground list for tasks added through the Alexa, but I have to manually sort and tag them later), and the Alexa app's features aren't strong enough that I'd be comfortable switching my lists to its platform for the ease of integration.

We have two smart lights from Geeni that we use with it, and every second or third time we try to operate them through voice commands, the command fails in some way - the Echo doesn't respond even after listening to your request, or it says ""okay"" but doesn't actually operate the light until a few minutes or few tries later.

We tried connecting it to our Firestick, but it was so non-functional we had a better experience just keeping them separate. HBO would routinely crash, or the sound would cut off of HBO streams, when the Echo was the speaker for the firestick; and the process of re-connecting the Echo after this happens, and clearing the Firestick app cache and relaunching things, etc. made the process miserable and unworkable.

The app is very slow and hard to navigate - the paths to different features are hard to find, and you have to retrace your steps a lot to complete multiple complex actions.

The audio quality is excellent, and I love using it for sleep ambience and music. However, it's very annoying to have to hear ads interfering with the experience of virtually any Alexa app you'll use, whether that's a small soundscape service or a major music platform. The best experience I have is connecting it to my phone via Bluetooth so I can play whatever I want without interruption, which is a pain, but at least then I haven't just paid for an Amazon product that still makes me listen to ads.

Also, the fact that staff will have to listen to voice recordings to improve the quality of the products or that your speech is stored in the cloud at all is a huge privacy issue.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Sam C.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2022","Aside from the ""by the ways"" that force me to wait, here's my experience with Alexa this afternoon.

I set 2 timers for a nap. After they rang, I set another 30-minute timer (I know I nap quite a bit). However, after the new timer is set, the old timer kept ringing. So I said to Alexa with my dreamy eyes, ""Alexa, turn off the alarm"" to which Alexa replied, ""there is no active alarm.""

Thinking that the 30-minute timer is canceled too, I told Alexa again, ""Alexa, set a timer for 30 minutes."" It replied, ""Second alarm set for 30 minutes."" Frustrated, I then told Alexa to clear all timers and set just 1 alarm for 30 minutes, to which it replied, ""Third alarm set for 30 minutes.""

Not wanting three alarms to go off one after another, I asked Alexa to clear all timers. Alexa then read to me, that I have 3 active timers set, with the FIRST timer set to 30 minutes and X minutes X seconds remaining, the SECOND timer set to 30 minutes X minutes X seconds remaining, the THIRD timer set to 30 minutes and X minutes X seconds remaining, which one did I want to cancel. I said ""all of them."" Alexa then said ""timer all of them"" was not found and then hung up on me. I then had to tell it to cancel my timers again. It repeated the same information about each of the timers, which took a very long minute, and then proceeded to ask me which timer I wanted to cancel again. ""You have a 30-minute timer with 23 minutes and 40 seconds left, a 30-minute timer with 25 minutes and 12 seconds left, and a 30-minute timer with 26 minutes and 23 seconds left. Which timer would you like to cancel?""

""The 30-minute timer."" I replied.

""Fourth timer, 30 minutes, starting now.""

I called customer service and asked for Amazon Digital Device Support. I was speaking with someone from the Phillipines and she did not know what I was talking about!
So, I asked that the Echo be replaced since I had tried to re-sync it multiple times to WiFi and then gone through the setup procedure 4 times! It still would not work..
I asked that a replacement be sent me and I would send this one back (it is still under warranty).
She replied that there would be a fee for that. Since it is still under warranty, I told her that was not correct. It seemed as if she had been reading from a script and seemed flummoxed. She paused for long periods and put me on hold as if she was reading through procedure steps.
I asked her not to waste time, but she continued to pause and put me on hold!
Finally I hung up and called back, hoping to connect with someone who was more professionally competent.

At that time with the app I had been unable to reach Digital Device support. I now know I could have gone through a different pathway to get Them on the phone!!

I did get a Digital Device support person from Jamaica on the phone, but she insisted on going through her script, then hung up on me.
I finally got Hussain on the phone and he walked me through a factory re-set, which I did not know about, and which (understandably) is not in the Alexa app.
That solved the problem, Thank you Hussain! He and I both hypothesize that this issue was caused by a glitch in the latest firmware update! Amazon coders, Please look into this!

James Cosentino,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2020","When I saw this design I knew immediately I had to have it. It's spherical look matched the look of the spherical lamps in my living room (Ikea Fodo lamps), purchasing with the intent of moving my Echo Plus to a different room in exchange for this new model being the living room's device.
Right away I noticed the sound pickup is weaker than my Echo Plus. Having used the Plus for nearly three years in the same location, I was accustomed to a specific level of voice pickup, especially when first entering my home and prompting Alexa to turn on the lights. This new model needs me to speak much louder to throw my voice enough in order for it to pickup and respond accordingly. That's strike one.
Next, while I love the design and the light ring makes sense at the base for this design, I decided very early on that the placement of the light ring at the base is counterintuitive as it's difficult to impossible to see if your prompt was recognized if your vantage point is obstructed; this was not the case with the Echo Plus with it's tall cylindrical design. That's strike two.
Finally, the sound quality. Thinking it would sound better than the Echo Plus was logical given the Plus model is several years old and this new model boasts more size to house a decent speaker system. Modern audio devices have really stepped up their game with rich sound and deep bass, so I assumed this would perform exceptionally. Unfortunately, I found the audio quality to fall below that of the Echo Plus. I linked all my echo devices so that music will play across all the devices to fill my home. Walking from my living room (where this new Echo lives) into my art studio (where the Echo Plus was moved to) there is an undeniable difference in sound quality, with the Echo Plus clearly being the superior in sound. This new model suffers by not adopting the 360 sound of the Plus and also sounds to have weaker bass in comparison, even after matching the audio settings to the Plus. That's strike three, which is three strikes too many.
My final analysis is that this new Echo isn't much more than a larger Echo Dot with the added benefit of the hub that allows integration with Hue bulbs.
I will be placing my Echo Plus back into the living room and redesignating this new model as an Auxiliary device in another part of my home. I may purchase a better quality external sound system for it, but in any case, Amazon needs to revisit the Echo with more focus on sound than the physical design because I feel some sacrifices were made to make a product look pretty.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I don't know if i got a ""lemon"" in the batches but mine has been malfunctioning repeatedly and sadly I think I have to return it :-( I'm really disappointed b/c I want an alexa device with an integrated hub and I got it at good value on a promotion. I don't want to return it but I need it to work and now she is not responding, and when she does respond there is terrible feedback noise.

Pluses:
+ acts as hub
+ color good
+ design good

Cons:
- it often doesn't understand my voice from nearby and I have to ""shout"" or ""sternly"" give commands
- the volume up or down doesn't always take affect and you have to repeat the command
- the sound now started to get crackly and play static feedback with it
- has started to ""ignore me"" and it will ligt up blue, i will say ""play jazz music"" and it doesn't do anything
- i have a dot in a room nearby (but not close), and the dot will often pick up my voice in the enxt room, even though i am on the sofa sitting directly next to the hub one and the hub will not respond

update on review:
amazon customer service did try to help. they are sending me a replacement one to see if it is a hardware issue on this specific device that i got. crossing fingers the new one is better.
i did speak with the rep about the difference in amazon plus. vs. studio vs. 4th gen
interesting to me that the echo plus 2 are still more expensive than the new 4th gen even though they are ""older"" technology.
i suspect the plus 2 have the kinks worked out, wish the price would drop.
and maybe some of these issues with my new 4th gen device are teething issues with it being a ""new and improved"" design and inner-parts
.
also an odd note on the customer service - the team that followe dup on a 2star review, they rang me and i asked to call back later. he mentioned he would email me - got the email, the instructinos said ""you can reply directly to this email"" so I took the time to reply to the email but then got the automatic response that said ""you are writing to an email that no longer accepts incoming messages"" s - so he won't see my response and the alternate contact path is to log a new ticket, which i've already done so i wont resend.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Temperature Sensor- a big reason to buy but it just doesn't perform, react to changes in temp fast enough to make this feature worth while. The sensor being ""in"" the Echo enclosure is heavily influenced by the enclosure temp itself(and everything inside). A big/rapid change in temp? the enclosure keeps the Echo from implementing in real time. Have a heater connected? Think this is great to turn on/off by temp? Very slow to respond to either a temp drop in the room(then it turns on the heater in a created routine) and then responds very slowly to turn the heater off when ""off"" routine temp is reached.

David,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2021","Bought this to replace a 1st Gen Echo and was really disappointed. The sound quality was worse and had a hollow tone. You could correct a little with the app but never got to the quality of the original we had.

Another big factor for our change was the mic on our 1st gen just wasn’t as responsive after all these years and we found ourselves always yelling at Alexa. However, when we set up this new Gen 4 Echo we found it performed worse than the original. So much so, that the Gen 4 sphere would ignore our commands while the G1 which we moved to a further room away was still picking up our commands. I’d fault a good bit of this to placement location of the two units, as it’s a little close to a tv but I’m doing an apples to apples comparison of the two different units in the same spot under the same lifestyle home conditions. We gave it about 14 days of testing before we gave up and decided to return.

Also, I’m not sure the spherical design is really any better stylistically or practically. It seems to take up more space and having the light ring on the bottom means you can’t really tell when Alexa is actually hearing your commands. We ended up repeating ourselves quite often because she just wasn’t acknowledging we were speaking to her. Plus from a volume control standpoint the ring can no longer provide a visual queue as you can’t see all the way around the sphere. Obviously you can ask Alexa what her setting is volume wise, but sometimes you just want to see.

Lastly, we bought a blue one. It’s neat that it’s not black like all of our other echoes and dots. But, the exact shade of blue actually wasn’t that appealing once we had it in our house. It’s almost like they couldn’t decide which shade of blue to use so they just went with blah in the end.

Biggest Pro: I like the idea of the new colors.

Biggest Cons: sound quality and mic sensitivity

Extra note - we did link it with the multi room sound playback and that feature was easy enough to set up and integrated our G1 Echo with this G4 Echo seamlessly.

I have several generations of dots that have better sound & can hear me without me having to yell... I bought this to replace my original Echo, which was taller but (to me at least) more aesthetically pleasing all around.

But the look of it is besides the point... it rarely recognizes what I have to say which never happened on any other device, & I have to yell at it- because talking to it induces ""whisper mode"" which I can say from other echo devices is usually because you are ACTUALLY whispering to the device.

It's a complete failure on sound quality when playing music... and to add insult to injury, they may call the device color ""glacier white"" but it's more a ""dirty snow grey""... now onto a less significant, but equally annoying detail... why did they make this round? It's wider than my old Echo, & the material just collects dust... the whole device is truly a heinous monstrosity I can't wait to be rid of if/when they come out with another version that is no longer this shape or low quality.

The only reason this gets 2 stars is because I like the thermostat feature & I got it on sale so I can't complain about its price (other than it's not worth sale price let alone full price)... I honestly don't know why Amazon created this, & I hope they go back to a device that has better sound quality and voice recognition instead of focusing on a design that is ultimately superfluous at the end of the day (not to give permission to make it any uglier, but please prioritize function over form next time!)",2.0 out of 5 stars
Rocky,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2022","Sound quality is fine.
Has told me hundreds of times that the only way to play specific songs is with amazon music, implying that deezer and spotify or anything other than amazon will not work on the device.
Amazon should really correct this.
Impossible to sign in to a hotel wifi that has its own sign in screen.
Only device I have that does not connect to the wifi in my home, though it does connect to mobile hotspot.
Seems to listen and record sometimes when I don't use the wake word.
Usually horrible with foreign language artist recognition.
Often not that intuitive with basic questions.
Too bulky and heavy to be considered a good travel speaker.
Mixes up accounts in my family, and will ask things like would I like to reorder medicine.
Gives notifications of everything my Mom ordered for Christmas, even after I turn off notifications.
Customer support is good, though if there is a problem with the device you are required to mail it to them even if you are in another country.
Really the ease of use of the technology is quite unimpressive.
Children like talking to alexa.
The worst is setting up a new wifi, amazon should really improve this.
I think my next smart speaker purchase will be a sonos or a google, because what do I have to lose?
The only thing making me stay with amazon is that they allow deezer in every country I have been to so far, with google its hit or miss.

Muenster,"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2023","I am very disappointed in the audio quality. The sound is boomy and muddy. It is not possible to actually modify the sound very much with the controls, no matter how you set the bass, midrange, and treble. Even with the bass on it’s lowest setting, it is still muddy and lame. Absolutely no crispness. I’ve had the controls all over the place, and it’s always lousy. I also have an echo Dot, and without any question, the sound is better and more balanced on the Dot, it is understandable and clear; there is not much bass on the Dot, and it’s a little tiny thing, but the sound is way better because it’s not boomy and voices are clean and crisp. I have to admit. I am an older fellow, I’m used to great fidelity from great speakers and great amps, things that are hard and expensive to get today. I attribute the many reviews that say this unit sounds great, to the reviewers not actually knowing what good sound is, never having heard real crisp highs and deep lows with clear vocals.

Sometimes I'm 5 feet away and slowly raising my voice I get now responses to only a few moment later the TV says her name, and she starts having a conversation. Other times she speaks quick gibberish to which my partner and I question our sanity, but mostly she throws out random facts then apologizes she's still learning. Which brings me to the next part. She randomly dings, and blue ring glows for a few moments then done. Totally random and mostly at very quiet times. Otherwise it's handy in a facts argument.

I wish I could say this echo is great, or this thing sucks, but since I can’t fully use it because the Alexa App is the most discouraging, frustrating, EVIL, POS ever created!

Crutnacker,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2023","I bought two speakers with the hope of pairing them for stereo. When you pair them, they sound pretty good, but if you're familiar with certain songs, you will eventually realize they sound a bit off. THat happened for me on Beatles Revolution, which has a very distinct separation of instruments on left and right channels. Instead of being separated, one channel duplicated the sound in the other channel (but not vice versa). This is a clear problem with software that according to forums has existed since 2018 at least, and still persists to this day. Doing a stereo test track on the devices confirms it's a problem. Since the stereo on their echo show devices appears to be accurate, I suspect it's either a glitch or outright failure in the code used to separate the signals in pairing.

The speakers sound good for the price, but if you want true stereo, you're better off buying a decent pair of speakers or buying a different device.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Stephanie,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2022","It’s a cool concept and I don’t know if mine is defective but it loses connection a lot. I know it’s not my internet because all of my other devices are fine. It will also just randomly crank up my music with no rhyme or reason. I checked and there’s no set schedule or routine for it to do that, it just does it. It gets what I say a lot of the time but sometimes I’ll say something crystal clear and it will not understand, even through it’s a direction I’ve given it before without issue. Sometimes it randomly shuts off but my phone app shows it’s connected and there’s nothing in the settings or routine to make it do that. The routines you can set only allow one “skill” per routine which is inconvenient. It could definitely use a lot of improvement and a cool feature would be options for different celebrity voices (like how WAZE does), not having to ask Alexa to ask a specific celebrity something to get their voice. It would also be nice if, not only would it turn on my tv by voice, but if it would also launch sling or paramount + or discovery + by voice too. Accents, celebrity voices, better connectivity, more consistency, and the ability to search all of your streaming services for a specific movie or show you ask for, as well as record them if you’d ask it to would make it worth the price. As it is, kind of a rip off. If you really want one, get the dot. The price is more inline with what you get. The concept is great but a lot of room for improvement.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Ram,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2023","I am comparing my Echo 4 against 1st gen Echo plus. I have both the devices plugged in in two adjacent rooms and I see following issues.
1. Echo spatial perception: The two devices have a really rough time to figure out which device I am speaking to. There are times when my new echo asks a follow up if I was speaking to the correct device, which can be helpful, but the ESP performance is really degraded.
2. Preferred speaker: The Alexa service seems to auto pick the preferred speaker between the two devices by itself. If I ask my Echo to play music, it plays on my old Echo plus and sometimes it's the other way around.
3. Features are meh: The device has a temp sensor built-in but but there is no way to get the reading through Alexa.
4. Finally but importantly, voice recognition: The voice recognition has seemingly degraded. FRR (false response rate) has gone up and RAR (response accuracy rate)has come down. It has gotten really infuriating to use this device.

eric carney,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2023","This is a great sounding speaker. Basic Alexa works great as far as looking stuff up for you. If you want a good music device this is great if you buy a Amazon Music subscription. If you have spotify you won't be able to request a particular track but it will play music similar to what you requested but not the one. ALWAYS A CATCH. If you want to connect this device to a bluetooth speaker it's easy till you want to switch it off and back on again. It will disconnect and will connect back up again but it won't send the audio to the speaker again till you delete the pairing and pair again. So I was hoping the bluetooth function would work but it doesn't. MORE TROUBLE THAN IT'S WORTH. Getting my Wyze vacuum to work with it was a failure. Once it loaded the skill and found the vacuum it said all was go. ""Ask Wyze to clean"" So I did and it said ""there was a problem."" and NOTHING ELSE? Again, more trouble than it's worth!

John,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2021","I like the way it sounds. I really do. But the problem is, I can't even use it to listen to music at all. The problem traces back to very poor voice recognition.

While you're playing music through the device, you may want to ask Alexa to control your home. But it can't hear you use the wake word at all. So I chose to have it connect to my old Creative Bluetooth speaker, which I have been using with Alexa since my old 2nd gen Echo dot from years ago. Sad really.

But even with that Bluetooth speaker, the recognition of the wake word is so unstable. Sometimes I'm having a conversation on the phone or have the TV on (quite a bit of yards away at the opposite side of the room actually), it thinks it heard ""Alexa"", when really no one and nothing said it. I have no idea.

Meanwhile, when I actually want to trigger it and I'm actually saying ""Alexa"", it's a hit or miss; either it won't react and I'll have to say it two or three more times, or it will actually work. It works about half the time. When it doesn't work, sometimes I have to scream ""Alexa"" louder and louder just to trigger the wake word. Sometimes it has to be so loud that my throat gets sore just from screaming the wake word.

And in my experience, these frustrations I'm having are unique to this Echo 4th generation. I've also owned and used the Echo Dot 2nd Generation (which sounds awful on its own but see my comment about Bluetooth speaker above), and the Echo Dot 3rd Generation. Personally, I wish I just stuck with the Echo Dot 3rd Generation. At least that one only got mistriggered (is that a word? Lol) whenever there was an Alexa ad on the TV.

Overall, if you already own an Alexa device, I highly recommend you stay away from this because it'll feel like a downgrade.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Carmen,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2021","I got these a few years ago for surround sound for my tv. They worked ok for a month or so and would randomly disconnect so I stopped using them for that purpose and used them for multi room sound. It was fine for a while and they would disconnect occasionally but now they won't connect at all. I spent 2 hours trying to fix the issue myself before contacting support then nearly 2 more hours with support and still no resolution. They said they would contact me in 5-7 business days so who knows...

My other issues with the devices are that they never seem to understand anything I say. I had the old echo dots and had very few issues with them understanding me. One would assume the newer more expensive devices would work better, right? with these I commonly get the response ""I'm sorry, I didn't get that"" or ""something went wrong."" My favorite was when I asked to turn the lights down and Alexa played me the song Mr Grinch. When I ask to adjust the thermostat she will either play some random song or tell me that I'm 2.2 miles from the city I live in. Other voice commands give equally random results.

Also, one of my devices started reporting the room temperature in °C instead of °F out of the blue one day. If I asked for the outside temp or the other rooms temp, it would respond in °F, but the room I was in was °C. I spent 2 hours with support resetting the device, adjusting settings and restarting the router before giving up and swapping that device for one in another room.

AZ Desert Gator,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2021","I had essentially the same problems with the prior generation full sized echo with hub, and decided to return it for a refund. I've had this unit for more than 6 months, but just now getting tired of it's deficiencies and decided to write a review. First off, the smart hub features seem to work fine. My issues are with voice recognition and audio quality. It's pretty crappy.

I have a same generation Echo Dot across the room. Often if I'm standing immediately next to this larger Echo hub and say something to it, it doesn't respond, but the one 20 feet away across the room does. Sometimes I can make 2 back-to-back requests, standing next to the unit with my mouth facing it, and with the same voice volume - one of the requests will be answered by it and the other will be answered from the unit 20 feet away.

I do not believe it is simply ""confusion"" between the two units. Before I had the Dot, I would have experienced the hub unit simply not responding to my voice at all.

Audio quality is terrible - I have a house full of Echo's including a 1st generation Echo. It is very muffled, like if you turned up bass to the max, and treble to the min. It's almost as if it simply doesn't produce ANY high frequencies. My same generation Echo dot, and 1st generation Echo sound FAR better.

Putzer,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2021","We bought the echo about 6 months ago. We were impressed with the sound quality of the echo, the depth of sound is pretty good.
However! The quality of the sound is moot when you can’t get the device to actually play music. This is the most glitchy device I have ever purchased. We’ve had issues from the beginning. I would have to reconnect it to the wifi almost daily, sometimes restarting my router just to get the stupid thing to reconnect, even though every other device in the home was connected.
Ok, maybe there was something wrong with the signal of our router, so we purchased google routers and placed them all over our house to broadcast the signal better. I guess that worked because we haven’t had Alexa tell us she’s not connected to the internet anymore. But NOW she just won’t play music whenever she doesn’t feel like doing it. In order to get the echo play music nowadays we have to unplug it for a minute and then plug it back in and that will last for a while. If we have music playing in the background for a couple of hours, you can tell when it needs to be unplugged and plugged back in because it will just decide to stop playing music for no reason.

I also have it connected to fire TV so I can watch tv with sound coming out of the echo. It works, but again there are so many bugs. Often the remote becomes i operative and echo becomes unresponsive. Sometimes randomly their is just no sound and instead fire tv plays sound out of the tv speakers instead.

I have some other Alexa devices, Including a really early version before the echo dots (without built in speaker). One is in my garage and I have it plugged into an old stereo for sound.

Firstly, though the sound is mediocre for its price point, it does not sound as great as the early 2019 one I heard. This one sounds ok in a large bedroom, but fails miserably in a smaller bedroom (my craft room). There, it, literally, sounds like what it is...a small basic Bluetooth speaker. Very treble! I turned it off an connected my iPad back up to the Bluetooth stereo system instead. I am going to keep it as it does integrate SiriusXM amongst others, but it will remain in the larger bedroom. Setup was not terribly fun. My daughter has a dot (those sound worse than this one) and anytime I told Alexa to do something, it went on HER echo...even though we were on opposite ends of the house. I think this is made more to be used as a system throughout the house versus a more individual toy. I think I got it sorted out now, but there are still issues. It doesn't always respond and it does go out. I've read it's a WiFi issue, but nothing else goes out when the echo goes out.

I've found I have to pause after saying Alexa before I add the instruction. Even then, it often takes 4 or 5 tries to get the blue ring to light up. This behavior is consistent with both of these Echos, and with the larger version (I bought the three pack).

I don't know what Amazon is doing under the covers, but I will say I've noticed a general degrading in voice recognition on other Echos, especially on the Echo Show. My guess is they have been dorking with the OS and have added too many ""features"" so that the CPU is overwhelmed and not as responsive as it once was.

For example, I am now queried on a regular basis to give a rating to products I bought, and reminded that consumables I've purchased in the past might be running out. I don't need that stuff, and I would far prefer to have an Echo that is responsive and less of an ad machine for Amazon.

It does not tether to older alexas ( not a minus just extra information). Another thing I have noticed, is that when bluetooth paired with a fire stick; apps like hulu and Netflix seem to crash.

This was bought for me as a gift and the pictures are somewhat misleading as they do not show a cord in many of them. This lead to the belief that it had an internal battery that allowed it to be moved between rooms. (Which would have been a great selling point). This device does not have an internal battery. In fact the charge cable it comes with is short, so keep that in mind when thinking about where you wish to place it. I have a first gen alexa and the cable that came with it is longer.

A note for Amazon, when this device was first advertised, it showd a globe pattern. When I saw that, I wanted this device. I was disappointed that there was no actual globe/map print available.

The first one I received was constantly reading wrong by a few degrees, but was inconsistent - sometimes it was correct, sometimes it was high by as many as 6 degrees Fahrenheit, sometimes it was low by a degree or two. I know this both by the feel of the room temperature and because I placed a digital thermometer six inches from the device. Because of this inconsistency, I couldn't even just manually include an offset for my purposes (a window AC unit plugged into an IoT plug with automations to turn it on/off based on the temperature reading off the sensor).

Thinking the first one was just a defective unit, I was sent a replacement... which has the exact same issue. Clearly the sensor in this generation is just flawed and therefore should not be purchased if you plan to use the temperature readings for anything other than a very rough estimate.

Everything else about the device works as-expected and it is a very cool looking unit.

Wow I was in shock when I saw the size of this. I thought it was a small ball like the other models. So the size of this made me happy. Thank knew At least it would bring bigger sound, and heavier to stay put better. So now I want to replace the little dot models. Yes I do recommend this to everyone. The speaker sound is just great.

Customer for 2 decades +,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2021","This was my fifth Alexa Echo products that I've purchased. I don't know what it is about the new design, but now it seems to never hear me say the wake up word. I feel like I have to shout Alexa just to get her to light up, so I know she's listening. I'm also super frustrated that podcast can't be fast-forwarded to specific time within the podcast. I use this feature all the time when Alexa plays an audible book, so why can't it be used for podcast as well? I also feel like this most recent iteration of the echo doesn't understand what I'm asking, even though I can use a similar phrase for my studio Echo and I'll be understood. I tried to buy an adapter to put it on the wall cuz I hate how much space it takes on surfaces, and of course I ended up with a dot wall adapter for the echo instead of this size. I just wish they would call it a different name or a different induration or something to make it identifiable without me having to feel like an expert at the dimensions of each of the objects. I found it really irritating that the cord for the power had been shortened almost a foot, and I couldn't put this new echo in the same location as my old Echo because they switch the power integration port to an AUX port instead of whatever it was before. I still love my studio Echo, but overall I'm super disappointed in this product.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2023","I bought this because I was dissatisfied with the sound quality of my Echo+ first generation. Only slight improvement but at 15W it is a bit louder. I use it my connecting my laptop by bluetooth to the Echo device to enhance the volume and clarity. Sooo I noticed there is a jack on the new Echo 4th generation for an external speaker (passive). Plug that speaker in and another for good measure and same result. Plugging a speaker into that jack shorts out Alexa and you get no sound!. Echo then has to reset itself! bought a new external speaker from Amazon that looked promising confirming the speaker worked with another separate device. Echo support is mystified, sending me a replacement to arrive and try tomorrow. Agent suggested both speakers could be incompatible. I know that is not possible. So a flaw in this device or all Echo 4th generation auxillary jacks???- We will see!",2.0 out of 5 stars

T. Davis,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2021","I replaced my old Pringles-can Echos with the new ball-style, and while they may look better and resist getting knocked over by my cat, they seem to have gotten worse at basic things like language comprehension. If I listen to the same 3 podcasts weekly, and I ask to hear the latest episode of one of those podcasts, how can Alexa constantly misunderstand and play some obscure podcast I've never heard before? Other times, I ask the Echo to do something basic like telling me the time, the blue light comes on for a second, but Alexa never says or does anything, not even ""Sorry, I didn't understand you."" The old Echos never did that.

The real kicker, though, is the execrable ""by the way"" feature, which constantly asks me if I want to use some ability that I'm not interested in. I find myself actually getting mad and swearing at Alexa when she asks me if I want to try some inane, useless skill. If anyone at Amazon is actually listening to what I say to my Echo, then I apologize for my salty language.

Linda,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2021","First impression: why on earth would Amazon pair a white power cord to a black speaker?? At the very least, give customers a cord color option; for me, my intended placement was a black granite counter btwn my kitchen and family rm, so no opportunity to conceal. Why should I have to pay $20-30 extra for a color-matched cord? Never has been an issue for past Echo devices, of which I have MANY... 14 I think

Second: I've grown fond of the cylinder shape, not a fan of this spherical shape; it might make sense if the sound was not front-firing, but sadly is. I could grow accustomed to that if not for the white cord, which Hubby said he could paint, but why should that even need to be a consideration? Besides, my plan was to add a 2nd one as well and, if they failed, alterations would negate the ability to return

Lastly: I have 2 charcoal Gen 3 Echos on that same counter; they have black cords, sound really grea! and look great. The last straw was that the sound quality from this 4th Gen was underwhelming; if it was supposed to be a big improvement over the Gen 3s, they definitely missed the mark and it's surely not worth the sacrifices I'd make in appearance.

J. Pearson,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2021","The sound quality on these new fourth generation Echo speakers is horrible compared with the previous generation Echo speakers—all of them. What happened?

I am so disappointed. I worked with Amazon tech-support, and even they said there must be something wrong, so they processed a return and shipped me a new set and they are equally horrible. I have read independent reviews on third-party websites, and watched them on YouTube, where reviewerss are saying Generation 4 is a total fail. I sure hope the fifth generation will go back to the sound quality of previous generations.

I have had many speakers from every generation going back to the first generation (which ironically, was one of the best sounding speakers they made).

Also, when you pair these fourth generation Echo speakers with a Fire TV or Fire TV stick, they are somewhat acceptable on the trailers and previews, since the volume of those, same with commercials, is so artificially boosted, (though the speakers are still disappointingly soft and poor quality), but the minute you start the actual show or movie, the sound instantly becomes so quiet that I would equate it to about a volume level 4 on previous generations.

I think these were rushed to market because the engineers thought the new round shape was so cool. What was wrong with the previous shape? In a failed effort to “fix” the ain’t-broke design, they completely broke the function.",2.0 out of 5 stars

When I ask Alexa to play music while I'm in the living room, she will respond from the proper device ""what would you like to listen to?"", but then she will start playing the music on the Echo Dot in my bedroom. When I tell her she is playing on the wrong device she'll respond ""I'm sorry, I don't recognize a device by that name"". When I ask her to stop playing the music it she won't, because she's does not recognize I'm talking about the bedroom unit. When I ask her to stop playing music in the Bedroom, she doesn't understand. When I ask her to play music, again, she says ""Amazon Music is currently streaming on another device"". Ugh.

I found that I cannot control Echo voice volume. I tried to decrease Echo voice volume by pressing the volume button on the device, by using voice command, by using Alexa app on my cell phone. But nothing worked. Every time I decrease volume, it comes back to default in few hours, or in best case, in one day. So, next morning it is too loud again. It also, occasionally, stops playing music by itself in the middle of playing or just ignore my command to play after repeating my command. One time, out of sudden, it started playing music by itself. And I have exactly the same problem with Echo Dot.
I had to change my rating from 3 to 2 stars.

This is update.
Echo Dot is a good device. It produces a decent sound and recognizes my commands without any problem. And it is convenient and funny. One of the reasons I purchased the Echo was to play songs without using my computer or CD or mp3 player or phone. However, when I asked Alexa to play a particular song, for example Girl by the Beatles, Alexa replied that I have to sign up for a $3.99 per month account and played some other random song. If you already has some a paid music account then Echo will be a good choice for you. But this is not that I wanted. Will probably return it.",2.0 out of 5 stars

All are 3rd Gen. the red and white one came with a white cord/adapter to match. ALL of the others in charcoal came with black cord/adapter. I went ahead and ordered the 4th Gen echo sphere in charcoal, and was irritated to see that they had put a white cord/adapter in the box. I contacted Amazon, and they told me the charcoal units should ship with black cord/adapter, not white, which doesn't match at all, and stands out as looking ""mismatched"" with the unit. Amazon sent me another unit which arrived yesterday a charcoal Echo with a WHITE CORD AND ADAPTER. It simply doesn't look right and I can't ""hide"" it. I took a chance on ordering
the new spherical design, and may end up returning both units and sticking with the 3rd Gen units I have.

I was disappointed a bit that this 4th gen device was not as good at recognizing its wake word ('Alexa'), as my older echo devices. With the 4th generation device I have to be very careful to directly face the unit and enunciate when using the wake word. My older units do not require this.

(FWIW - I've altered the positioning of this 4th gen device a few times to ensure it wasn't some sort of audio bouncing that was the issue. The unit performs the same regardless of its location.)

Also, unlike my older devices, this 4th generation Echo seems to often just not respond if it cannot answer or properly interpret a voice command/request. I can see the wake word activates the unit but then it does not respond to commands it has trouble with. I have mixed feelings about this. I don't miss the occasional 'I did not understand that request' (paraphrasing the response older Echo devices used.) but at the same time really dislike the device just going silent as though nothing had been said - and forcing me to wake it again.

To be clear - the issues with this 4th generation device are truly minor.

Over the past several days I have tried to get a response to fix this or simply send a new device but Amazon has yet to contact me back with a solution. Obviously that’s the problem because it makes the device completely unusable.

First, I should've realized the price dropped for a reason... the reviews which state that the Echo mic is bad are so true. I have to speak so loud (even when no other sounds in the room), I can be heard two rooms away.
When Alexa does respond, there's a serious lag and the volume temporarily decreases (long enough that I thought I'd accidentally asked Alexa to lower the volume) only to realize this happens every time I ask Alexa anything.
The Echo sound is relatively full. However, I prefer the midrange of the Echo dot.
I don't care for either device as a single speaker so I tried to pair the Echo and the Echo dot.
What?? Each speaker pairs individually with FireTV, smart light bulbs, etc., but an Echo and Echo dot will only work together for music and, possibly, audio books.
They CAN'T BE PAIRED together for stero listening with, e.g., FireTV. I researched this to ensure I wasn't missing something and all web results verified this issue. Please let me know if I'm wrong!

- microphone seems even more directional... an issue since we place it in the middle but unless you talk AT it or yell... well you just have to yell

Bottom line is it s not an upgrade. It’s the same product as before, more expensive, uglier. We are disappointed they haven’t improved the microphone.

Thomas,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2021","QUICK SUMMARY:
---------------------------
The 4th generation Amazon Echo brings welcome upgrades from previous generations. The device features a Zigbee smart hub, improved sound reproduction, and a temperature sensor. Alexa integration works as expected. I would recommend the 4th gen Echo to those who are in the market for their first Alexa device and who listen to music often at a casual level. I would not recommend this as an upgrade for those with previous generation Echo devices if they are functioning normally, or for those expecting a high-end audiophile experience.

PREFACE:
---------------------------
I have owned the 4th generation Amazon Echo for 9 months and use it daily. I upgraded from a 1st generation Amazon Echo. As part of a Prime Echo trade-in promotion, I was able to purchase this for $25 off the $99 MSRP.

Tasks I utilize Echo for:
---------------------------
• (Daily) - Adjusting power/brightness/color of 2 connected LIFX smart bulbs
• (Daily) - Retrieving daily weather forecast information
• (Daily) - Retrieving temperature of the room the Echo is in (room is hotter than the rest of the house)
• (Weekly/Monthly) - Engaging with various media/games (Pandora, Amazon Music, Question of the Day, Jeopardy, etc.)
• (Weekly/Monthly) - General search query for basic information/knowledge

Environment:
---------------------------
The Echo is 3 feet away from where I sit. It’s placed on a table in the corner of a 10x10 room, about 2 inches in front of a (silent) PC tower. It's on a flat, level surface, and is within line-of-sight with no obstacles or materials between myself and it that would hamper its ability to hear me. On the opposite side of the room is a small air purifier at floor level that is always on and set to its lowest setting (40 dB of white noise).

PROS:
---------------------------
• Sound Reproduction: The upward-firing 3” woofer and two, forward-firing 0.8” tweeters push out more sound than expected for a device of this size and price. Bass is surprisingly powerful, covers a lower frequency range than expected (it won't rattle the room like a dedicated subwoofer, however), and is capable of filling small rooms with ease. Treble is clear and crisp without distortion. Mids are pronounced and dynamic, but can be overpowered if bass and treble are simultaneously working hard. Dialogue from movies, videos, and podcasts is clear and feels well-balanced. Casual audio tinkerers will be pleased with additional EQ settings in the Amazon Alexa smartphone app, although audio sounds excellent as-is and adjustments are likely not necessary unless specific listening needs require adjustments.

• Temperature Sensor: This is an odd bonus to me, but a welcome one that I use often. It is self-calibrating, and routines can make use of its readings.

• Line In/Out Audio Jack: There is a 3.5mm jack on the bottom of the device next to the power adapter port which can be toggled to send audio out to another device if you wish to use the Echo with external speakers, or to accept audio if you wish play audio from another device using the Echo’s speakers.

• Build Quality: It feels sturdy and has heft but isn’t burdensome. The fabric mesh that covers the top-half of the sphere is a nice color, the buttons are pleasantly tactile but quiet, and the circular grip on the bottom ensure it won’t slide around while playing music or if gently bumped.

NEUTRALS:
---------------------------
• Response Time: Marketing for this Echo focused heavily on the all-new AZ1 Neural Edge processor at the time of purchase, bragging of faster, smoother, and more natural Alexa voice interaction performance and processing times. The marketing was heavy, and over-emphasized what is an unnoticeable difference; there is, at best, perhaps fractions of a second saved compared to the 1st gen Echo, but it’s case-by-case. In most cases, the processing time is the same.

• Alexa Features/Performance: Largely unchanged compared to previous generations due to Alexa being a multi-device AI ecosystem rather than a single, device-specific feature. It does what you expect of Alexa.

CONS:
---------------------------
• Voice Recognition: Bad. The environment outlined above is how I’ve used this Echo since I purchased it. The previous, 1st generation Echo had no issue with white noise, background noise, etc. This 4th generation Echo struggles to pick up my voice if there is any level of white noise, or if I’m speaking to it from more than a few feet away. 90 – 95% of voice interactions require that I repeat myself with increasing volume (sometimes two, three, four or more times) for it to register what I’m saying correctly, if I’m heard at all. Voice commands are constantly misinterpreted (verified by reviewing the history in the app), and wake words are often missed. Voice recognition performance is so poor, I have considered replacing this device altogether with one from a different ecosystem. I shouldn’t need to be just beneath shouting volume to be heard, and I shouldn’t feel constantly inconvenienced by using voice commands versus smartphone apps to control smart home features.

• Temperature Sensor Rate of Refresh: I have found no documentation or answers about how often the temperature sensor is refreshed. However, it often seems like the readings are delayed and take a long time to change, even when there is a noticeable increase/decrease in air temperature as a result of thermostat changes.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Bookwyrm,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2020","Update: Echo can only hear you about 1/2 of the time. Although this 4th gen Echo has some really nice features that we like, her ability to hear you isn't one of them. We can be standing right in front of her, and our Flex in a hallway on the other side of the house hears us and responds way more than she does. Not kidding. How can it, facing in the other direction walls away hear us and she can't? Our first generation Echo hears us 100% of the time, the 4th gen... maybe 1/3. We put her in the room where we are closest to her when speaking, but it doesn't really help much. In taking away the 360 mics and making her so focused in one direction, they lost something vital. SO majorly annoying. She sounds great, though. Just needs a hearing aid.

Original review:
The 4th gen Echo has better sound, a built-in smart hub and lots more bells and whistles than my 1st gen Echo, which is five years old and still going strong. I mainly use my Echo to check the weather, time various cooking projects or dog recesses, set zillions of reminders, answer questions, read Audible books, and play a lot of Spotify. What I REALLY, REALLY wanted Echo to do was to be able to call 911.

Emergency calling: Within a few minutes of getting the Echo out of its box, it was set up for everything but AT&T and 911 calling. That took a bit of walking through instructions, squirreling off to my iPad (ADD for the win), and then back again to finish setting it up. I was able to connect to my AT&T account on the Alexa app very easily, and specify which devices are at what addresses. Most of our devices are at our home, but one of my daughters has her tablet at her other mom’s house. I loved that I could specify that her tablet was there. Now when I call emergency services (well, I hope never to call), they’ll know where we are if we use one of our Amazon devices. Way too cool!

Overall, the sound is better, it has more features, and I really love that I was able to link in calling out on my Amazon devices via my AT&T account. I absolutely love that feature.

Better sound is great, too, because I listen to music a lot. The sound is just richer and more detailed. No, this isn’t a Bang and Olufsen, but it sure sounds nice.

One caveat. The light ring is on the bottom, so if you have this on a crowded surface as I do, it’s harder to see the light ring. If you have yours in a clear area, just ignore that. But for me, I preordered a wall mount. That will get the Echo raised to where we can see the light ring, and it will also clear the bit of space where I had it.

Very pleased with this newest generation of Echo.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Domino72,"Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2021","I bought an Echo 4th gen and an Echo Dot (4th Gen) in a package. I've been using them for 9 months now. These devices do play music from Amazon Prime Music account but the Alexa software is pretty buggy. Example: For months I couldn't get the two paired Echo devices to play Amazon music (or anything else) on Everywhere group. Then recently I was able to get that to work, BUT Alexa would only play one song from Amazon music then shut all devices down. I made sure network connectivity was not the problem. Both Echo devices are paired and connected to the same wi-fi network. My Everywhere Group includes both devices. I could play music all day long on a single device at a time. Today (9/29/2021) I found that if you start initially playing Amazon music on Everywhere, it will shut off all devices after one song, BUT, if you initially start playing NPR/Kuow (from iHeart Radio) on Everywhere, you can then switch to Amazon music and songs will continue to play. This is what I mean by ""buggy"".

Now for the rest. The other Alexa features like Lists, Routines, Chore Chart (blueprint), Task Tracker (blueprint) are so far pretty useless. What I wanted to do was use Alexa to help us (two adults) manage our time, like keep track of chores, with daily reminders, and keep track of tasks lists for each of us. Alexa doesn't seem to be able to use more than a single ""list"" or tracker and it better be for a single person. I created two lists (using Lists & Notes, not Blueprints), one a shopping list, one a to-do list. Alexa had trouble keeping these lists separated, and adding/removing items at least from voice commands. I also tried creating a couple of Skills using Chore Chart blueprint and Task List blueprint. These also did not work for multiple people, and you cannot edit the items without logging into the Blueprints web so it's not very useful for a daily Task List that needs to be dynamic.

Bottom line, it has taken 9 months to get this far. I was willing to put some learning time in, but not have to take a class or hire a technician just to get things working. I find the Echo hardware are adequate speakers for me, but Alexa software is not. Amazon's online documentation is woefully inadequate, difficult to find and very general. I did not try the Help & Feedback from the iOS Alexa app since I find reading documentation on a phone screen difficult. The forums are sometimes helpful if you use suggestions cautiously. I have spent a lot of time trying to get Alexa features working, and my lack of success does not make me happy. I admit my expectations may have been too high.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Sara Dupree,"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2023","I went all in on these things. I have them in every room. I upgraded network to handle them. It reminds me of having more kids around the house. I constantly have to repeat myself to get them to do what I want. Echo turn on the lights. Echo turn on the lights. ECHO TURN ON THE LIGHTS!

I ask it to play music through the house. And sometimes it works great. Other times. One will play. Then I dig into it and paired speakers will switch networks. One will be on one network whole the other will be on guest network. Go through a long drawn out process forcing to go through a reset of device to swith back to network and then it will not pair with the rest. Some will pair others will say not on network.

I feel like I spend hours every week trying to fix these issues only to have them happen again the next week.

I have two echo studios with a fire cube. All of a sudden one will quit playing sound or both will. It is because one of the three decides to swith networks and I have to figure out which one and then I have to go through a whole set up again. Nothing like trying to sit down with my wife to watch a movie and by the time I get it up and running an hour later, she has fallen asleep. My wife hates these things.

I figured. At this point the bugs would have been worked out but that is not the case. I got them knowing there would be issues. I started buying them 4 years ago thinking the issues will be ironed out but it has not been the case.

The sound is so far and ahead of the smaller E-dots, it's not even worth comparing. HOWEVER, when you try to get this one to turn on or turn off some lights, it doesn't listen very well. Either it does absolutely nothing and you'll have to repeat yourself, or it'll do something wrong (turn on the wrong lights) or it sometimes will ask you if you wanted something you didn't even say.

Shane Marker,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2024","I have used an echo dot and Bluetooth soundbar for years as a “home theater”. My thoughts were “the full-size echo can’t sound that much better to justify replacing what I have.” After hearing one at a local store, I decided to buy one and try it. So much better for a few reasons: 1) The sound quality is incredible. Better than any of the mid level soundbars I tried. 2) using the soundbar caused a delay when playing music in my everywhere group. The echo immediately solved this problem. 3) The home hub really helped by freeing up my WiFi from the 10+ smart bulbs/sockets/appliances.
I’m disappointed that I waited so long to buy one. I’ll definitely be buying more in the near future. The dots/pops are nice for small areas, but if you have the space. Go for the echo.

Update… I still love the sound, but Alexa, or the support software, it whatever it is, is getting progressively worse. My groups disappear, Bluetooth won’t stay connected, it randomly stops recognizing lights. It’s getting out of hand. This has been going on for more than a month. I’ll be switching away from the echo soon if the problems persist.

Ludwig,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2022","This was a Christmas gift for my 98 year old Grandmother. My wife and i have an earlier echo generation and love it. In my grandmother's case she loves the music, and help with reminders. The problem arose during setup. To create an account for my grandmother's echo it was required she had an email address. She is 98 and does not use the internet nor has an email account. So i elected to include it with my account. All was good until we found out only one device could stream Amazon Music at a time. My grandmother's Echo came with a promotional 6 month Amazon Music Premium feature while my wife and i only use the free Amazon Music with our Prime Account. Suddenly, it became almost a competition where our echo would play one song then request if wanted to move the streaming service to our device. We would have it and then lose it as my Grandmother at her location did the same thing. I called Amazon about the problem and spoke with someone with a heavy Indian accent who claimed they could resolve the problem and after 20 minutes dropped the call. I tried again and got a second Indian representative who was brash, rude, continually talking over me and saying ""just let your 98 year old Grandmother listen to her music!"". Giving up i tried to politely end the call, where the representative asked if there was anything else he could help with..... I was hoping i would get a survey about the call, but instead i got an form email from the rep saying it was a pleasure talking with me and he was glad he could help.... No survey. On the same day this conversation occurred my wife got a charge on her credit card from Amazon for a Prime Membership. When checking the credit card purchase online i clicked on the merchant who charged her and i was taken to my Amazon Prime Account..... I did not purchase a second Prime account and most assuredly not on my wife's credit card.

John Miller,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2024","I got two and created a stereo pair which sound great. The Alexa app that ""controls"" them seemingly could not be worse if they tried. So many things you ""can't"" do. For a smart speaker it might as well be connected to an old school amp for how inconveniently it plays radio stations, pandora, etc. I'm almost sure I'm not taking advantage of some features but then again it's almost impossible to find out what they may be and how I would ""control"" them. Also got an Echo Studio to try which complements the stereo pair of echos but it is also very difficult to control. The volume on the studio also pops to 10 at random moments and there's no way to turn it back down without using the buttons. So, not smart. Again, sound is great and better, if only by a small margin, than my discontinued Bose sound touch speakers. It also, doesn't drop out as often as they now do (the main reason to get something new), so I'm stuck. The Studio is going back due to the volume control issue, unfortunately.

InterTube Consumer,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2021","I bought two of these to set up a wireless stereo setup. The bass is insane, to the point where you have to turn it down to hear much of anything else. The midrange is recessed to a nearly objectionable amount, but for the price it's tolerable, I guess.

Amazon must do something with spatial audio because the stereo image on these is also insane. Very nice.

As for the Alexa thing, I already have four other Alexa eavesdroppers. This is more a review of Echo as an audio device and stereo deal. Short version: don't do it.

Linking my two echoes together was easy enough, but one got put in one ""room"" and one unassigned, and after days I can't for the life of me figure out how to get that other Echo into the same ""room"", but it's just a labeling thing. Connecting them in stereo was simple. Then came the issues.

First... these only work in stereo if you stream from an official Amazon(tm) service. That means Amazon music (and probably Prime video). So if you wanted to use these in stereo for TV or YouTube... nope. Doesn't work.

And even using this with Amazon Music... is problematic. I have to connect to the pair twice before they start playing, but I can deal with that. But then the Amazon Music app might reset and then I have zero control of what's playing. The speakers keep going on the playlist, somehow, but the app completely loses any sense of what's going on. So seeing what's playing or skipping songs isn't do-able.

And as a Zigbee hub... well one works great, but Alexa has no sense of common controls like changing light colors in a group (only individually). It's a great piece of hardware stymied by limited software. There's no reason Alexa couldn't crib notes from every other zigbee app out there, and use my wifi network to stream audio data from one Echo to the others when I bluetooth connect to it. These would make a great little theater setup if they got that to work and kept the sale pricing.

Of course, I don't use the thing for Alexa at all, which should probably say something about the strange product planning involved as well. Kudos to the hardware guys, but what is the software group up to?",3.0 out of 5 stars

Having the illuminated ring at the bottom where you cannot see it is just dumb, unless you have it on a glass shelf above head height. Concerning Echo/Alexa in general, I cannot believe they have not made it any smarter in all these years. Instead, they are putting all their energy into marketing gimmicks. If I say the exact name of a song I want to hear, sometimes it will choose one with a similar name rather than the exact title I requested. Stop doing what you think I want and start doing exactly what I say. You should only play an alternative if I stated a title that does not exist or was not stated correctly. I get ""Hmmm, I dont know the answer to that"" to some pretty simple questions as well. They have it evolved to the knowledgeability of a nine year old and have not evolved it since. I may begin to look at alternatives, as I cannot support this stupidity much longer. In large companies, Marketing typically always has the power over Engineering. I know this, as I am a retired Engineer from a large fortune 50 company. It is apparent that Amazon is the same way. I can hear the debate now... ""It won't work as well that way.

I purchased this Echo due to its ability to connect with Philips Hue bulbs without a hub. The product is new enough that Amazon tech support does not understand that the Echo 4th generation does not work with Philips Hue bulb model LWB004. I have 2 of them and spent way too long on the phone trying to sort it out. I ended returning my new Echo and getting again with a bundle of 2 new Hue bulbs (Model 453100). Those Hue bulbs worked immediately and easily.

The sound quality is is a step back from the the previous Echo models. Definitely distortion on the maximum volume that is not there in older models.

The size and shape are not as problematic as I thought it would be. It does feel like it will be prone to getting damaged by kids more than the older coffee can version of the Echo design.

In the end though, it is still cheaper than an Echo Dot plus a Philips Hue Hub. And the Echo 4th gen certainly sounds better than an Echo Dot. Additionally, I am one of the people who got burned by Philips shutting off access to the first generation Hub, so I am happy to not be forced into buying another Hub from them.

I love asking Alexa strange questions or just throwing out song requests or a reminder or timer throughout my day, I utilize the crap out of her! Alexa answers are hit and miss, I do receive a lot of ""Sorry, I don't know that"" but all in all the idea behind Alexa is sound. I have owned at least 1 Echo and an echo dot (if available) since its inception, and continue to be impressed with the utility of it. This generation of Echo has been a real disappointment to me. While Alexa is becoming more fluid in this iteration, in some ways it feels like a rather large step back from its predecessors. Let's talk about this generations audio, shall we? I dislike that when using verbal commands to Alexa for volume up or volume down, it's very basic and uses a 1-10 system. This can be modified using the plus or minus sign on the device itself, or using the Alexa app on phones (which, to its credit, allows for a 1% to 100% sliding scale to get the desired volume). However, if you are like me and want to be able to say ""Alexa, set volume to 22%"" Alexa will set the volume to the nearest 1-10 volume, in this case, it would set the Echo to volume 2. As an audiophile this feels clunky and lacks ease of use I've come to expect from Echo devices. The sound quality is alright, but I miss the 360 degree sound that previous generations gave me. Fourth generation Echo's also lack music clarity, and the bass is not impressive in the least.Next up, the shape, sigh. This 4th generation Echo looks like a crystal ball and takes up more space while also being a lot more noticeable. Perhaps this is intentional, but I prefer the more discreet shape of the 3rd generation. I am not impressed with them doing collaborations with designers like Diane Von Furstenberg when so many more necessary features like better audio quality and the Echo's voice sensitivity are sorely lacking.

Fire,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2020","I have owned every echo since their inception . And one fact is true ... amazon has done a very good job with making small improvements while keeping the costs down . This latest design is once again a minor improvement on the previous generations I own . The sound has improved a bit . Slightly more bass and treble . Still not a Sonos or a Bose ... but the cost isn’t either . So it’s a compromise . Glad they finally just included the “hub” instead of 2 separate models . The design being a sphere is up for debate . One thing that isn’t ... it’s no longer a omnidirectional speaker . It sends sound where you point it . So unfortunately you can’t bounce the sound off a wall to increase the bass like previous generations . The look ? Meh ... kinda weird . But not a deal breaker . One complaint I have as well as others : the led indicator that lets you know it’s listening is now on the bottom . Terrible placement . You just can’t ever see it ! If it was higher or if it was much brighter perhaps . 2 things that I’m not happy about at all : 1) like others have said ... the microphones are no longer as sensitive as other generations . My older echos almost never miss when I ask a question , even clear across the house . This one ? I very often end up screaming at it , especially when the music is playing . Even when I’m just a few feet away. It seems as though there are either less microphones or the ones on this model are not as discerning. Perhaps a software update in the future will improve this . ( note : I am not alone in my evaluation - others are having the same issue) 2) My biggest dislike ? I purchased 2 black / charcoal echos ... and they give you white power cords with white power blocks ! White ? Seriously ? No doubt this is a cost saving measure so that they include the white ones across the board no matter what you order . But ... they are ugly as Hell ! They do not blend in at all . Hopefully they listen to all of us complaining and change this - as well as swap out our white ones for black ones . Amazon pulled a Henry Ford with the model T .

mike in mass,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2022","What I liked –
Better bass that my original echos
No commercials in my flash briefing
It has a hub just like my studios
Better bluetooth headphone range than my first gen echos,

What I don’t like –
There isn’t any switch in settings for local voice control
It can’t hear as well as my original echos
The sound is in one direction
It changes my bluetooth mesh lightbulbs when I turn them on

Overall it isn’t a bad upgrade for four generations later than my original echos. But it has some flaws.
First it doesn’t seem to have any switch for local voice control. So will the hub work when the internet is
down with my zigbee lights? My studios still control zigbee lights, but not sure if this one can. The new
echo has trouble hearing me, but I think this is due to low power mode, as it has to recover before it can
listen. So I have to often repeat commands. The bass is nice and the sound is in one direction more like
a normal speaker, but I got used to the 360 degree sound, so this seems a little backward to me. The
sound isn’t bad just different. One thing I hate is the interaction with my bluetooth mesh alexa only
bulbs. If I tell it to turn on light 2, it always turns it on at 100% and white. This is different from my
studios which just turn on the light at the current settings. I keep the downstairs light blue and 5%, if I
go downstairs and say to my studio turn on light 2, it is blue and 5%, if I say turn on light 2 to the gen 4
it turns on the light white at 100%.

Overall it isn’t bad, I will keep it, but I have the original echo in the closet just in case..",3.0 out of 5 stars

S. Tracy,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2022","Decided to give these a try. They were on sale for $59.99. Figured it was worth a shot to see just how much better these were versus my Echo 3rd gens.

I have them connected to a Firetv cube with an Echo sub as well (same configuration as was with my 3rd gen Echos).

So the sound quality is slightly better. Not really that superior to the 3rd gens. The system as a whole may have a little more bass but, I don’t feel it’s enough difference to warrant the extra $$$.

Thare they really fall short is volume level. They seem to be quiet. With any background the sound of these just gets swallowed up.

I would expect some real leaps and bounds from a “4th” gen speaker. These aren’t it.

The home hub is okay if you have specific hardware that requires a “hub” but as of this post with over 50 “smart” devices in my home to include a thermostat, I’ve yet to need a “hub”. I feel it’s just more “fluff” and gee wiz gadgetry that’s unneeded.

Also, I feel it’s time (especially with the Firetv cube) to incorporate a true home theater so one can set this up with 4 speakers. The cube could be the center speaker in a 5.1 or 5.2 setup. Give the speakers a little more volume and then we’d have something to write about.

All in all, not that impressive. A speaker that’s nothing more than a portable rechargeable speaker….with a hub.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2023","I bought this unit to replace an older Smart Things hub but was disappointed to find that the Zigbee home automation implementation is VERY limited. There are device types that are either not supported or not fully supported. While the Echo Hub is fine for simple on / off voice light control, it is currently impossible (9/2023) to access the lux meters built into my motion sensors. The humidity sensors in my temperature sensors won't display. I also couldn't get the power monitoring functions of my smart plugs to display. I had to delete the units from the Echo Hub and add them back into my Smart Things hub.

For example, without access to the light levels in the room, you can't really use the motion sensor to control the lamps. You have to limit them to certain times of day so they don't turn on when it is daytime. But then when it storms and the room is dark, the lamps won't light.

I'm not a fan of the lights being underneath reflecting off the surface. It's more difficult to see them and I miss the large rotating volume knob which is much more intuitive to use. It was impossible to add the new speaker to my existing speaker group - seems to be a bug of some sort with the Alexa app (iOS).

ORIGINAL REVIEW 10/23/2020
I was hoping the audio quality of the 4th gen was going to be better than my first gen echo. I listened to them side by side and the don't sound THAT different - not worth the cost of replacement. The new version is louder, has slightly more pronounced bass and fills the room about the same when against the wall. The sound of the new one seems unbalanced. The highs are tinny and overbearing. Mids are understated and the bass is so-so. Overall the sound is top heavy and flat.

Its width takes up a lot more space, about double over the first gen. The buttons on top are kind of difficult to press - they're hard to feel without looking, shaped into small symbols instead of chunky round buttons and not that responsive. The original echo's buttons were easier to navigate without looking.

I don't mind the white cable because it blends in better with the white walls.

If you don't mind having 2 devices, I would suggest going with an echo dot and buying a good quality bluetooth speaker. The flexibility of taking the speaker elsewhere with you and the sound quality will be much better.",3.0 out of 5 stars

UPDATE: Ok, with the help of my buddy Adam we figured it out:

To start, make sure your Echo is disconnected from Bluetooth.
A) Launch Alexa App
B) Find Echo Device
C) Device > Status > Device Settings > General > Aux Audio

So, find and select your Echo device using the Amazon Alexa App.
Scroll to the bottom and select Status.
Selecting Status takes you to Device Settings.
Scroll down to General > Aux Audio > Line In or Line Out

Hope this helps anyone else that wants to enjoy of the great sound of the Echo using the Aux In option.

My phone, TV, and I think it must be my rug or something, already knows even what I'm thinking about.

Anyway, I was hoping it could change my TV channels at least, but that involved buying another gizmo. OH --""PREMIUM SOUND"". Not sure what that means but it isn't hifi Bose quality. More like enhance AM radio.

That voice ... annoying, so I changed it. It says you can change the voice, but its only male of female. And they say you can change the wake up name. There are only a couple that you can choose from a list as well. All with multiple syllables, and I want a one syllable name..like JOE... Hey Joe. So it stays Alexa with a male voice.

I love the shape and look, and with the added light at the base, it looks pretty cool. It would be even better if the entire globe radiated soft pastel colors and then jumped bright red when someone is detected at the front video doorbell You could keep the yellow for when a package is delivered by Amazon.

THe jokes are pretty corny. The weather report is great, and it can tell you what temperature is residing at its location. Overall use for TV is great if you have a Fire TV. It wants to go to Fire TV over ROKU or even cable. Changing cable using the Fire TV Blaster is a bit hit or miss. It doesn't respond the same to even the same command to change the channel. Overall using Alexa to control the TV is hit or miss anyway. Much easier to just use the remote.

My overall assessment is that it's a cool gimmick, not really practical. That might be me though, as I'm old. A longtime tech-head, but an old one. Sometimes cool factor of a product isn't worth the bother.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Another Shopper,"Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2022","I own both the full size Echo 4th, and the Echo Dot 4th with LED Clock. I purchased two of the full size Echo 4th devices to allow for connectivity for Ring Bridge devices, notably a Ring Mailbox Sensor and a Ring Lighting Motion Sensor, both of which require either a Ring Bridge, or a Sidewalk Bridge device. This Echo device is specifically named as a recommendation. I gave it a shot, and both the mailbox sensor and the motion sensor went offline repeatedly, even when placed just a few inches from the Echo 4th Gen unit. Sometimes they came back online on their own. Sometimes they ran their batteries dead trying. I returned one of the sensors thinking I had a bad one and got the same results. When I bought a dedicated Ring Bridge, all the problems went away. Sidewalk Bridge simply isn't working and isn't reliable.

As for the other features, the audio quality when listening to music or just hearing Alexa's voice is very boomy by default. I haven't tried playing with the equalizer, but really, I should be able to get decent quality from default settings.

Voice recognition is hit-or-miss if you're not using Alexa as your wake word. It doesn't seem to matter much if you're facing the unit directly when you speak to it or if you're just somewhere in the room. Recognition is about the same either way, for better or worse.

The unit itself is HUGE, and the audio is comparable to the Echo Dot 4th Gen, so if you're faced with a choice between the two and don't need Sidewalk, I'd recommend the Echo Dot.

Lastly, the surface is covered with cloth, meaning that cleaning it isn't much of an option.

The mics on the Echo plus were a little sluggish so I thought why not upgrade and move my echo plus to another part of the house that is less used. Well the new Echo showed up a little early and I even went through the payment plan. I thought that the new generation should have all kinds of woops and whistles than what I originally had.

Well the first thing that I enjoyed was the integration of dual languages. With me learning Spanish this I thought would be a fun feature. Well it seams that this version has still a lot of issues. My commands are not recognized very often. When I try to play something from xm it just errors. I have to use my echo show to play on the network I choose. Now it plays fine on the new Echo but it just does not seem to take commands very well. The spanish commands are hit and miss but right on with the echo show.

Overall I am very disappointed with the replacement. If it wasn't for my smart home features I may even consider sending it back till they can get it right. The first and second gen plus is still very cheap and I could just replace it with that from ebay or something.

(update) So tech support reached out to me and was concerned as well. It seems that my Echo Show is less sensitive to commands than the echo plus. The echo plus being more sensitive, would not know how to respond if there was an extra word in the command. As for the Language issue well it worked fine the first time the tech was listening but the second time it would not respond saying it had a limited vocab. They will work on it.

mrklean02,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2020","Okay, so I have had an Echo 1st Gen with hub for about three years now. I also have purchased several Echo Dots in that time. I like how each sounds but I have to admit the Echo 1st Gen with hub sounds great, much better than the Dots. I didn't and don't have a problem with it, it still sounds great and responds great. It sounds so great I had been planning on getting a second one to go in another room for some time. So since I kept seeing the new 4th Gen Echo advertised for around $70 I couldn't pass it up. I read the reviews about having to repeat ""Alexa"" being an issue but I didn't realize how bad it would be until I ran into the problem myself. I have it in my bedroom on my nightstand and you would think that no matter what position you are in it would hear you when you are lying on the bed with the speaker about a foot away. But that's not the case, if you are facing away from the speaker you almost have to yell ""Alexa"", so that your sound bounces off one of the walls, to get a response. And this is the case no matter where you are in the room. You have to face the speaker to get a constant response. I don't have that problem with the 1st Gen speaker. If it only had only happened a couple of times I wouldn't care, but it's constant.

But not all is bad about the speaker. I know that some of the reviews mentioned about it's tone being a little too low. I actually like the sound it puts out. This is far better than my 1st Gen and the Dots. After all the ranting about having to repeat my demands, the sound, at least for me, does make up for it and I do plan on buying another one to get a more stereo effect.

I still don't think that it warrants four or five stars because it is a smart speaker, and if previous generations function better at performing that function, there is definitely room for improvement for this gen.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Steve Bradfield,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2020","Update: I rated this 4 stars, but I'm changing it to 3 for now. I have become increasingly frustrated with it's inability to hear me. Sometimes I have to yell so loud that the bedroom Echo responds instead of the one in the family room. I'm seriously considering returning this one and using my old gen 1 Echo. Either Amazon needs to improve the sensitivity or give us the ability to adjust it ourselves.

I bought this to replace a gen 1 tower. I have several echo devices around the house and liked the old cylinder. I won’t comment on the aesthetics since that is a personal preference, but will say the new design requires a larger footprint on the table. The base is small, but the diameter of the sphere means you can’t put anything close to the bottom of the base. Functionally, the sound quality is much better than the gen 1 device. I appreciate that the new design probably was necessary for that. The new echo is much more directional. This is good if you have it against a wall, but not if it is in the middle of the room. The light ring at the base makes it difficult to see on a low table or if there is something on the table next to it (like a book). I have a lot of trouble seeing if Alexa heard me. Speaking of that...it seems Alexa is aging and has a lot more trouble hearing me than the old one did. I find I have to talk loudly to be heard and with the light ring at the bottom, I have to be in the right position to see if she’s responding. The built in hub was a bonus. I have a hub from years ago, so have not made use of it yet, but will eventually try to retire the hub I have. I like the new device, but will not be replacing any of my gen 3 dots with the new dots.

I assume it's Alexa trying to avoid having to deal with us :) The speaker quality is decent, but not really outstanding. It can get loud, but the bass is dull IMHO and muffles clarity at times.

Anyway, if you like shouting commands at someone repeatedly (maybe you're a drill sergeant or unhappily married), then this might be a diverting toy for you. More seriously, though, if you have restricted mobility or you live alone, then this device could be a real time/effort saver if you have it hooked up to other devices in your home (e.g., lights, tv, wall thermometer). You should be aware that there is a trade off between your privacy and the detail of your personal experience. For example, Alexa will want access to your contacts if you use it for calling folks via your wifi (your internet connection). And, it wasn't so long ago that people were able to hear others' conversations and command history. BTW: This is information you can look up via your Amazon account. So, travel with caution and ask yourself whether voice commands are superior to the discretion of silently typing your searches (which are archived is a cloud unless you disable the feature).

Back in the day I heard about how the echo plus and then the 3rd gen still didn’t sound nearly as level or bassy as the first generation echo so I had been abstaining from upgrading for a while. But then the quality of the sound from the 4th gen had been one of the main features I had been hearing about so I finally decided it was time. And honestly on that front as well as the built in zigbee hub it delivers in spades. The 4th gen Echo is more than capable of shaking the entire bookshelf she’s on with just the default audio settings.

However, there is one extremely frustrating aspect to the 4th gen echo, coming from a 1st gen: microphone quality and her ability to recognize when she is being spoken to.

My 1st gen echo was almost too sensitive. She would wake up for anything that even vaguely sounded like “Alexa” at any volume with close to any amount of room noise. I have an oscillating fan in my living room and she could hear me over that and the TV. The new 4th gen will basically refuse to hear me unless I turn the fan off and mute the TV. And when she does recognize that I’m yelling ALEXA at her from 10 feet away, half the time she won’t pick up on the command I speak next.

Because if you forget to turn the device down then it’s blaring at you. If you have a device (iPad pro) connected and want to control the volume from the device you either a) have to go into the Alexa app to turn it up or b) turn it up in the app so you can control it with the device. If the device goes to sleep and you don’t have any audio coming out it disconnects from Bluetooth and then reconnects when you wake the device back up and then lets you know. We don’t need that or at least give us the option to turn that off. Until then I don’t recommend unless you don’t mind that problem.,3.0 out of 5 stars
MK_NC,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2022","I bought a 2nd generation echo when they first came out years ago. I keep it in our kitchen and use it daily for music, news and general inquiries. I have also setup some smart switches so I can control lights using voice through Alexa. When I upgraded to smart thermostats I purchased one that has Alexa built in. I noticed recently that the Echo was not interpreting my requests very well and frequently would not play a song after a request. I assumed it was just getting old so decided to upgrade to this latest device that was on sale during Prime days. I assumed there would be a significant improvement in sound quality but it is marginally better. not enough to justify replacement. I find I need to yell at this echo for it to recognize my voice, the old one worked much better. Lastly, I moved my old 2nd gen echo into the upstairs bedroom thinking I could play music up there but Alexa does not support that. Appears you need to have an individual Amazon account for each device if you want to have it play Spotify. I have a Spotify family account and have no interest in paying for Amazon music premium as well. I am disappointed with this and now I have two echoes that are unreliable when it comes to playing any requested music. I am seriously going to look at Google now.",3.0 out of 5 stars
D. Krajewski,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2021","I bought three of these around the release and have regretted the purchase. We have a total of 12 Echos, Echo Shows, & Echo Dots placed throughout our home and these are the worst when it comes to communication. 2 of them replaced Echo 3rd Gens, and another was an add on to an existing TV (with 4k firestick) for better sound and since adding them to our system, we have had nothing but problems with the wrong device answering us. None of the locations changed, these were just swapped in. We noticed that these ALL LAG, and must not have the same speaker configuration as the Echo 3rd Gens because Echos two rooms away will now answer before these devices will.
They do sound GREAT when they work properly, but because we already had a functioning system throughout our house, and knew the capabilities, these were/are a HUGE let down.
I have tried updating them to see if that helps, but it has not.
As a stand alone device these might be great, but to a family that has been using Alexas since the beginning and keeps adding for functionality around the home, we find them more of a nuisance than a help. We end up yelling at poor Alexa more than it's worth.
I will note also, one is being used and is hard wired into my work from home computer, and that one lags even more... I notice when I unplug the AUX cable it seems to pick up speed, but when it is plugged in via the AUX cable to my PC it lags and is very slow to respond which in turn has the wrong device answering most times.
It has all become more frustrating than helpful. Hoping that an update can help solve this matter in the future.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Placeholder,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2022","Purchased this because I could not find a Bluetooth speaker to work with my tv that wasn't overly expensive. I like the sphere shape and it is a slightly heavy solid device (drop it on your foot and it'll hurt) which speaks of quality construction. Just set it up which would have been easy if I didn't have to track down the device settings that had all voice control stuff turned off. Amazing how cryptic some device ID'S are. You have to best guess a lot of times. Still, once that was straightened out it was easy. Having an Amazon account really did make things go smoother. Now, I can get enough volume with enough clarity to understand what the talking heads are saying. Setting the controls for Bass, Treble and Mids was easy. I appreciate the Bass control as it is physically painful if set too high. Since this is my first experience with this type of device I gave it only 3 stars until I have more experience with it. So far, it is performing well. Sound quality isn't quite as good as I'd hoped, but is quite good and all I need so no complaints there.

Jeremy Get.Fit.For.Travel!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2022","Okay, so I have 2 of these paired with a Fire 4K TV stick.

If I'm only playing music through Amazon's music service... incredible sound and the volume is more than enough for any sane person to thoroughly enjoy. For reference, we listen at about Volume 4.

BUT...

When it comes to watching a television show through the Fire 4K stick... it's so frustrating it makes me want to return them. 100% of the time, we set ""Volume 10"", which is maximum volume. And even *that* doesn't always allow us to hear the dialogue coming through the show.

I've tried SO many settings to fix it. I've paired and unpaired countless times.

AND there's more.

For some reason, we have to reboot our 4K Firestick every single day before we watch a show. Otherwise, at some point during the day, it disconnects from the speakers for TV. And only for TV. Because if we ask for music, it works just time, every time.

Moral of the story: happy with them for music. Terrible as a speaker system for television.

I was just about to purchase a new one when they called. I couldn't handle the bad sound it was giving on my favorite songs. I like that they did that, but still make sure you pay attention to the sound and get more warranty or something. Bought the last one in Sept. of 2021 and it broke by June of 2022. I had these less than a year. I never raise the volume past 6 most days... over time the sub just stop producing good sound and at some point I'm screaming at it to hear me. I have the bass on 0 and it still have that blown out sound. Like what happened? I'm sure they plan for them to break after a few months so you have to consider buying a new one. My whole house have one in every room or section and I'm thinking about tossing them all out and getting google just because you can whisper to those and they hear you.

This was never an issue with the dot we had previously. We listen to the same music and asked questions then too.

James M.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","So I love Alexa and most of the Alexa products. I have the new-gen 4 to replace Gen 3 so it would have the hub. The hub part works great. However, when I am in the kitchen and the device is so close to me (same position as older model) I have to yell at Alexa and wait (note; no music or anything playing) then speak the command. In previous-gen versions, I have been able to talk at a normal volume and pace and Alexa picks up what I am saying right away.
Now 1 of 2 things happen 1. I have to pause for 3 -4 seconds after saying Alex or it simply does not respond OR 2. the echo dot device in another room picks up the request and plays the response in that room.

Also while it looks super nice compared to other models, the light indicator being at the bottom is almost useless. If I have a notification I can't see the light , where when the light was at the top of the device you could see the light from a distance. Now it's just hidden and pretty useless if you are not right on top of the unit.
Also playing music on this is not nearly as loud or pronounced as previous gen models. This sounds muted (so does the dot 4th gen) , sadly I feel like this 4th gen went down hill and not much able to be done about it if you're a alexa ecosystem. household",3.0 out of 5 stars
Phantom Unmasker,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2022","Naturally I like being able to just say, ""Alexa, turn on the lights,"" or ""Alexa, set the heat (temperature) to ## degrees"" in order to accomplish these tasks. On these winter days, I especially like being able to turn up the heat from the comfort of my bed by invoking Alexa. But all this just increases my disappointment when Alexa just doesn't seem to get what I am requesting, even when I am taking great care to be very clear. Even worse is when Alexa appears to go on strike and just not respond to my requests at all. I dread hearing her frequent plaint, ""I'm sorry. I'm not understanding right now. Try again later."" In addition to these complaints, I have to add that Amazon is still far from the top of its game when it comes to the sound quality of its Echo devices--at least this one. If Amazon is going to tout ""premium sound,"" it should certainly do better. When Alexa speaks, she sounds as if her face is buried in a pillow, and music is by no means crisp, clear, or well balanced. What bass response there is does not make up for imbalances over the rest of the frequency range, which Alexa's equalizer function seems unable to adequately adjust.

GT Fan,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2021","Update: Rating changed from 4 to 3 stars. The new devices (have 2 now and am kind of regretting it) are a step up with sound quality for sure. But the microphones and voice recognition are really poor. Have to repeat commands (even simple ones like ""end timer"") many times. Heck, the devices have a hard time picking up ""Alexa"" wake word most of the time. Haven't looked at the internals, but guessing that the physical positioning of microphones in the new ball shaped package was ""good in theory"" but just poor design. Either that or the software upgrades are anything but.

And Amazon is not doing anything about the ugly white cords and adapters. Shame. The round package could be cool - if it wasn't for the ugly white only cords and adapters (and performance issues of course). It is fine with the white one we have. It might even work for the blue. But it is gosh-awful with the charcoal unit. If a person wants a dark colored smart device, it is probably in part because the location needs a dark color. Tell me again how white cords/adapters make sense?

Overall the device is a step up from 2nd gen device. Sound quality much improved and reasonable for price. Voice recognition not as consistent as with 3rd gen Dots for some reason.

Christopher,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2022","I can’t believe Amazon ditched the sleek, elegant design of their original hit concept for this hideous and inefficient miniature bowling ball. I have NO idea what they were thinking. Yes, the bowling ball sounds marginally better than my Echo Plus 1st Gen, but that’s a mighty slim margin. The EP1G, in the tonally reflective metallic silver most especially, is a modern masterpiece of design that blends in and contributes interesting conversation to any décor. By contrast, their 4th Gen is a plasticky child’s toy you have to hide away or make excuses for. The EP1G’s tower gave us superb sound, Zigbee, and a clearly visible mechanical light ring we can turn to control the volume. 4th Gen you have to fumble around to feel the raised symbols.

Perhaps the worse crime of all is Amazon taking away our choice. Okay, if you want to go experimenting with bowling balls, fine. I don’t get why they had to force all of us into that form factor.

Max Power,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2022","I bought two of these during a sale and traded in my 1st and 2nd generation devices. They are solid units, but fall short in the following ways:

1) Voice recognition not as good as previous generations. There are times when I attempt to wake the device up and have to shout. I was able to wake the other devices up with more of a conversational tone. There are also times when it doesn't appear to be able to process what I said, so it will just disregard everything and not say anything.

2) The speaker is good, but I can see why others have complained about it not being 360. One of my devices is placed facing the dining area. When I am in the kitchen, the music does not sound as good since it is facing away from me. This was not an issue with the 2nd generation is previously replaced.

3) Not a big deal, but it would be nice if they sent out a darker cord with the dark colored units. They did this previously.

A.Lien,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2021","* AUDIO: the audio coming out of this Echo is very heavy on the bass and sounds are muddled. Not crisp, clean, clear.
* BUILT-IN ZIGBEE HUB: after unplugging the Echo (or after a power outage) Zigbee devices get disconnected and do not automatically reconnect. It is a huge pain to have to reset and reconnect each device and redo any routines that used those devices. I also worry about the safety and security of a smart home when devices like heaters, humidifiers, alarms, etc no longer talk to the hub or follow automated commands after after a power outage. Hopefully this is something that Amazon can fix with a Echo software update.
* TEMP SENSOR: I like that there is a temperature sensor, but unlike a standalone Zigbee temperature sensor, the temperature reading from the Echo doesn't show up when I add the Echo to the Favorites section of the Devices page in the Alexa app. It should. Seems fixable with an Alexa app update.

Another example, I asked Alexa ""What time is it?"" which I ask regularly and it responded with ""It is"" and stopped. I then asked it again, the device lit up when I asked, but then went dark like it didn't hear me. I tried yet again and the same happened. I have a routine created that when I say good morning the volume lowers, and then it tells me the time and date. I did that and it actually worked.

We have used the 4th Gen Alexa for 1/2 months; the only problem we have noticed is that, and I should first say; the 4th Gen is geared more toward digital devices, with that said; the problem it has is that it does not voice recognize our request to play music by ""U2."" Its response is to direct us to enable ""youtube"" by using the Alexa app. At the Alexa app, there isn't a method to solve this problem.

This Echo however missed the mark for me on two very important aspects sound & voice recognition. Music through this Echo is simply muffled and without substance. Yes, I've played with placement and EQ settings. It just isn't what it should be. The volume output is strong and the bass as well. There however is pitiful mid/treble range on this thing. I'd even go as far as saying my 2nd gen echo dot puts out a fuller sound than this Echo does.

Additionally, the voice recognition on this system just isn't as good. I'm not sure why that is but again my earlier generation echo dots I have are more alert to my voice commands.

However, when it fails, it does so fantastically. My biggest complaint is that I get it, Echo, Amazon product, Echo is really just a way to drive and direct traffic, particularly consumer traffic to Amazon, but for God's sake it gets a little... unwelcomingly forceful about it sometimes.
Build quality of the unit is good.
The sound quality is okay. Stereo speakers could be configured a tiny bit better to try to get a little more spread out of them but really nothing can really be done when you cram a left and right channel so close together. Bass, is... bassy. The midrange is okay and the treble is fairly clear without getting too tinny. Voice recognition is okay, when you call her, 95% of the time she hears you.

However....

This is the real issue. Alexia isn't so good at understanding what you are asking her/of her. Sometimes the results are humorous, but over time that novelty wears off and it just gets irritating.
Also... The search engine is BING??? BING??? Really??? Why?!?!?!? Who actually uses BING?!?!?!

Juan Carlos Santamaria,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2021","I was looking forward for the new 4th generation Alexa: promised better sound, better home integration, nice looking! I bought the device to replace my 2nd generation Alexa device that we use in the kitchen/breakfast area.
The device does have better sound playback overall. We use it primary for music. But the device has several issues that make it worse than our ""old"" Alexa: (1) there seems to be a problem with the microphone. It does not capture the voice commands as good as the old device. Sometimes we have to raise our voice so loud that the ""old"" alexa responds (and she is at the loft at the second floor!). Most of the times, the commands do not come as intended. I can hear from the playback of the commands in the history page that they are not as crisp as the ones recorded in the old device. (2) the smarthome integration embedded in the new alexa fights with our current smarthings hub all the time. When scanning the sensors we see duplicates for most of them: one from the smarthing hub and another one from the alexa device. Deleting the ones from alexa builtin smarthome hub fixes the issue. The new alexa does have a better sound, but we resorted on swaping it for our ""old"" alexa instead and move the new alexa to the second floor, where it is rarely used.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Jamstewonline,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2020","Seems that Alexa's hearing problem is how she recognizes her name. If your voice does not sound very close to how you said her name when you trained her to hear you she does not respond. Re training your voice may help just keep in mind that when you do the training try to pronounce her name at different pitches and volumes so she recognizes you more. It helped me out some but not perfectly. I think the microphones are under her felt covering making it a little harder for her to hear the correct pronunciation of her own name. That's my best guess.

Ok I love Alexa devices. I have 6 various devices in my home. But this newer echo does not impress me.
First of all the voice recognition for me is terrible. I don't know where they hid the microphones but it rarely hears me and it sits about 3ft from me. The earlier version does a better job so much so that i put the last edition near me and the new one out in living room. The new one seems to hear better when farther away from you.
As for the sound i like the 360 sound much better that the new directional front facing sound in the new echo. The new echo does have better mid range but the 360 just sounds better it the place i put it.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Cassandra,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2023","When it works, the speaker is great. I use it as the main speaker for the tv in my room, and sound quality is a solid 7.5/10.

This is nothing new, these issues have plagued this generation for a few years now, the crackling in particular is supposed to be fixed with a software update that they're working on, but the fact that some units do it and some don't leads me to believe they have terrible Quality control on these.

I can be sitting in the living room, where I have the echo, and when I say, hey Alexa, it doesn’t light up. Often, I can try to play a song in the living room and the echo dot in my bathroom will start playing. Even the fire tv cube in my bedroom responds better than the echo. I even changed the wake words for the devices in case that was the issue, however it may have helped the echo only slightly. The dot still responds from two rooms away, yet the echo doesn’t always respond from ten feet away. Otherwise it is a good device. The sound is much better than the dot. There is distortion if I turn it too loud but even turning it down a little clears it up, and is still plenty loud to jam out while cleaning. 😊",3.0 out of 5 stars

Wodz,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2022","This product does not seem any better than the Echo Plus 2nd generation and looks much uglier. Whoever thought coupling a white power cord with a black-colored product needs to be fired. The first and second BLACK Echo products came with....wait for it.. BLACK power cords. Because if you are buying something in black, it is probably to pair with room decor. So having a very obvious WHITE cable paired with BLACK setting defeats the purpose. Obviously, the product in white coming with a white power cord is a great match; very stupid design choice. It looks like a duckpin bowling ball or a magic eight ball. Very odd. Bought 3 and will keep them since they were half-price. The white looks nice enough but the black only works if you can properly hide the entire cable. I did some voice recognition testing and the Echo Plus 2nd generation won that battle. HOWEVER at 50% off......that is ok. The white cable is clearly ridiculous. Booo",3.0 out of 5 stars

Brad Nagel,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2021","Upgraded from a Echo Dot 3rd gen and I was hoping for better sound. I got way better sound over the Dot. It sounds so much better. I got a free ring light that uses this model as a hub and so far it has worked great together. Works fast when charging light settings.

I also hit a few issues that seem like issues with this model. One issue that I have over the my Echo Dot is with Bluetooth. When connected it works great and never disconnects but the fight to get this echo to see my phone is a struggle. Saying ""Connect to my phone"" works rarely. On my Echo Dot its works more around 95% of the time. Once connected though there are no issues with sound or dropping. Second issue is that it seems harder to get it to respond to ""Alexa"". I end up saying it over and over getting louder each time till I feel like I'm yelling at it. Since its 2 feet away on my desk this seems a bit strange. Again the Echo Dot didn't have this issue.

Mike,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2022","I'm fairly new to the Alexa universe, and the 4th generation Echo is my first such device. My first impressions are that the sound quality (for the price and size of the device) is excellent. There is copious quantities of base. The highs are also quite good provided you place the speaker out in the open and are facing the front side of the device. The voice recognition is almost flawless if the room is quiet. However I found that Alex has some issues hearing me correctly whenever I was playing music, listening to the TV, or when my Roomba was banging around the house. I think it's reasonable that situations like this can cause Alexa to either not hear you, or misinterpret what you said.... and I can accept that.
My Echo's are connected to my 5GHz wifi network and are located all within 30 ft of my router. I've never had any issues with the wifi connection. A couple of times in the past 3 months the Alexa service has gone down, which can be a real issue. Luckily, ""most"" of my smart devices (Kasa and Feit) could all be controlled through their native apps. Fortunately for me, Alexa was only down for a couple of hours, and then all was good. The bad part was that my mother-in-law, who is in a wheelchair, uses Alexa to control the lights, ceiling fan, and TV in her apartment. The lesson here is that if you have a technically challenged person who relies of Alex, just realize that there will be times when Alex lets you down... and you'll need to have a backup plan to get buy until the service comes back online.
Regarding integration with other manufacturer's devices is hit and miss, depending on how main stream (widely used) their products are. I had no issues getting 5 Kasa smart plugs (for air cleaners and dehumidifier), 4 Kasa smart dimmers (for lights), 3 Kasa smart switches (for ceiling fans), and about 20 Feit smart bulbs, all connected and integrated into Alexa. Personally, before choosing a brand of smart product, go onto the Android/Apple app store (as appropriate for you), and check out the ""Start"" rating for that manufacturer's app. If it has a poor rating, it might be a good idea to choose a different manufacturer. The 4th generation Echo has a built in temperature sensor, which lets you create ""routines"" that can be triggered by the room temperature. The Echo can also listen for sounds like ""glass breaking"", and ""smoke/CO alarms"". If the Echo hears these sounds, you can get a notification on the phone app. Awesome feature, and it's free. There are more advanced security/safety features, but those have a monthly fee.
It's hard to review just the Echo, when in fact it's impossible to separate it from the Alex service. As a piece of ""hardware"", what you get in such a small package is impressive (5 stars). The other half of the rating is how well Alex integrates with your smart devices, and how well you use the capabilities within the Alex app to configure your Echo device. One of the most important functions is the ability to create ""routines"". A routine is a set of commands that get performed, when the trigger phrase is spoken.
I'll say that the capabilities available with routines is mind blowing. Many people might be intimidated trying to set them up. If you are not tech savvy, you might need to find someone who is to help you out. I've got a computer engineering degree, and it was fairly intuitive for me, but I'm an extreme example...",4.0 out of 5 stars
C,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2020","The new Echo 4th Gen is a big change in aesthetics and design for the Echo line. The new spherical shape is wider and shorter than previous Echo versions, and now focus sound in one primary direction instead of 360 degrees. It adds an extra tweeter, and seems to produce more sound than previous versions. Here are my early thoughts so far, after using it for about 24 hours:

THE GOOD:

Setup was incredibly simple. I just powered the device on, and the Echo announced that it was ready for setup. I opened the Alexa app on my phone, and the new Echo was automatically detected and set up instantly. I didn't have to enter any information at all. It can't get any easier than this.
BETTER SOUND. This new Echo has an extra tweeter, for a total of two 0.8 inch tweeters, and the same 3.0 inch Sub from the Gen 3 Echo. This new Echo is designed with the tweeters pointed forward, and the speaker placement seems to generate more bass also somehow, even with the same Sub as the Gen 3. All in all I think it sounds much better than Gen 3, with a little more bass and louder max volume. This could also be do to the sound-mapping feature that allows Echo to maximize the sound by detecting the acoustics and shape of the room. You can also pair two of these in stereo; and you are supposed to be able to use it as a speaker for your FireTV device, though I haven't tested that out yet.
Temperature sensor included. Yes, you can ask Alexa what the temperature is, and it seems very accurate so far. This is a nice touch, and I look forward to doing more testing, to see if I can set up routines based on temperature.
AZ1 Processor. This new Amazon processor promises better voice recognition and faster Alexa responses. In my testing so far, I have barely noticed a slight speed improvement (for example turning on certain room lights) but there are supposed to be upcoming updates that will make an even bigger difference in speed.
Zigbee + Sidewalk Bridge. This comes with a Zigbee hub, just like previous versions of the Echo Plus. It also contains the new Sidewalk Bridge, which allows the Echo to use bluetooth and radio connections to connect to some smart devices at long range, and push data to the internet.

THE BAD:

No 360 degree speakers. While I personally prefer the sound of this new version, some people might miss the 360 degree speaker setup of previous Echo generations. It certainly might lead to a situation where the ideal placement of the Echo in your room could be different.
White power cord. This is minor, but a strange choice. No matter what color Echo you get, the power cord is white. Some people might find that annoying.
Voice detection is not great while loud music is playing. This surprised me, as previous generations haven;t really struggled with this in my experience. I'm not sure if it is because this speaker is much louder, but Alexa hasn't heard me a few times when I talked while the music was playing at max volume. This could be annoying if you often listen to very loud music.

NEUTRAL:

-Aesthetics. I think I preferred the look of the cylinder design, instead of this new sphere shape. This is totally personal preference of course. I also wish the entire sphere was fabric, instead of being plastic on the back side. Some people might prefer the ball shape though, so that is up to you.

All in all, I'm keeping this new Echo because of the better sound and faster responsiveness, but it is not really a massive upgrade. Pretty decent so far, I'll update this review and try to answer any questions in the future!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Goofy Jessie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024","So my eight year old echo in my bedroom stopped working. And I did without Alexa in my bedroom for a couple of years. Finally, I gave in and ordered a 4th gen echo. I’ve always thought the best thing about the echo was Alexa. Especially with Halloween fast approaching.

The sad reality it's that Alexa is not as advanced as its competitors. I compared Alexa’s response when I inquire about the weather. Alexa provides the answer, but it’s not exactly accurate. Its competitors provide the actual temperature, but they go a step further and provide “how it actually feels” by accounting for humidity, which in some parts of the country can be a difference of over ten degrees. I also ask her to turn on or off a smart light bulb that worked just fine with my eight year old echo. The same bulb its competitors easily turn on or off. Alexa on this brand new Echo fails. Can’t do it. I was going to pack it up. Return it.

But then, out of sentimentality, I ask Alexa to play some jazz music. State of Jazz, Part 80. Wow. Deep bass. Clean treble. Impressive highs. Sound even better than my stand alone Bose speaker. Kid. You. Not.

Instead of returning it, I’ll keep it. I’ll order some Kasa light bulbs. Kasa never fails. Never. And hope I don’t regret keeping this Echo.

And I’m really hoping the rumors about an upgraded Alexa in October are true. Because I love Alexa, but she’s getting a little long in the tooth. Not as sharp. But still my sweetheart. Hey, if anyone from Amazon/Alexa happens to read this review, you might consider sending me some complimentary Kasa light bulbs. Or maybe a discount code. Here’s hoping Alexa is soon rejuvenated.

That's where the problem comes in - the Alexa app. Writing a routine is incredibly painful. Sure, it is relatively easy to write a simple routine, but anything more is tedious and slow. It would be nice, for example, if the app could incorporate existing smart home device setting automatically into a new routine. It is so tedious to select ""Smart Home,"" then ""Lights,"" and then scroll down a list of devices to find the desired light, then pick whether it's on or off, the light intensity level and then the light color. And then, do it all over again for every single light or device to be in lured in the routine. Setting up groups, which makes setting up multiple lights easier is an Ok solution, but is just another hoop to jump through. The app menu setup is totally unintuitive.

Don B,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2023","I bought 2 of these as refurbished, to add to the other 3 that I have in the downstairs of my home. One would not connect after repeated attempts. Not the end of the world, just inconvenient and a hassle. Especially after working all day, this should be about a 15 minute procedure for BOTH units. So, after 45 minutes on ONE, I stopped attempting the connection, and switched to the other unit. The other unit connects within minutes (as it should) and I went back to the other one. This is the 5th time now to attempt a connection, and it won't take. So, I click on the Alexa app for an Amazon rep with technical support to call me. So, a guy calls, and wants me to walk through the connection process with him on the phone. I get it, they need to verify the issue, so I oblige him and go through it with him on the line.
Well, attempt number 6 fails with him on the phone, and let him know that was as far as I could get prior to asking for tech support. He wants me to unplug it, and start it back up again. I said OK, but this will be the 6th time of doing that exact thing. So I unplug it, and it reboots itself (as before), and we walk through the setup process again, and guess what? Will NOT connect. I asked since this was refurbished, if it was possible, by any chance, that it is still connected to the previous owner? He said he already checked on that, and it was not. So, now he wants me to unplug it once again, and close the Alexa app. I did both already, and informed him of such, but he insists that we need to do so. OK, we'll try it again. So unplug, close the app completely, plug back back in, power up, and reopen app. Go through set up process, will not connect again. Frustration is starting to creep up on me, and he says hang on, I am going to reset your system remotely. Ok, maybe that helps (perhaps he should have suggested that early on?), I don't know. Either way, phone is silent for a minute or so, then the hold music starts to play for another minute or 2 (maybe 3, not even sure now) and then I am disconnected! Wow, really? Ok, I am sure that was an error on his part, not intentional, but still....
So, I call back, get bounced to the right department, tell the story to another tech support guy, he agrees that it is faulty and says he can just refund my purchase. Well, I let him know that I don't want a refund, I want a replacement item. That is why I bought 2 more to begin with. No luck, refund only, so I agree to it.

D.Z,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2022","I have had homepod mini, the original homepod, and most of the Echo first party devices, including echo studio. The echo 4th gen is definitely the best of all of these. I have even owned the bose portable, some really expensive Sony speakers. For the size and sound quality and reliable and fast voice recognition, these can't be beat.

Issues with the homepods:

The homepod had great sound quality, but it was big and you still dont get the stereo separation effect you can get with two speakers one on each side of the room, and after a firmware update the speaker developed a weird and terrible sounding issue and I had to throw it away. Apple discontinued it so I couldn't buy a replacement. The homepod minis used to be good, in fact better sound quality than probably the echo dot 5th gen (I didn't test it personally, just heard the sound in a review). However they started becoming unreliable as well, one would cut out midsong or there would be a weird echoing effect and the voice recognition was always slower than an echo device. And sometimes siri wouldn't recognize at all, or she would say 'something went wrong, this is taking longer than I expected'.... a lot.

So switching over to two Echo 4th gens, in a stereo pair, was really great because the voice recognition is faster and she usually understands what I say and play it. I could say the same request to both and Siri wouldn't get it while Alexa would.

However there was a major issue, at first they wouldn't pair in a sound pair. I had to web search and find out that what you have to do is plug in one speaker only, say 'alexa check for updates' and then wait until that speaker updates, then unplug it, do that for the second speaker, unplug it when done, then update the alexa app on your phone, then plug everything back in and try to pair them again in the app. That worked for me. Amazon really dropped the ball on this, and I had to remove a star, you shouldn't get a product that has a basic feature like the speakers working in a stereo pair that requires a bunch of googling to solve. I can imagine the frustration if you buy two and then they don't work in a stereo pair and your googling skills aren't good enough. Another knock on Alexa compared to Siri in general, is that lately Alexa has been spamming me asking me if I want stuff. Siri never does that. Alexa will say things like 'by the way (advertisement, would you like to try it/buy it?) However as far as I know there is no reliable Apple smart speaker that exists so this is your best option. Note that I didnt try the google products because I gave up on google made products, they all seem to break (chromebook, pixel 6, google wifi, etc. and then google always makes some excuse why they wont fix it- so not only do their products break but they also won't fix them- I gave up on them)",4.0 out of 5 stars

PlantNerd,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2024","I bought this after staying at my brothers’ for a week and getting used to using his Sonos speakers. When I learned how overpriced the Sonos were (and that they didn’t even have bluetooth connectivity) I opted for the echo and a couple dots instead. The sound quality is perfectly adequate for me and my apartment living, and I like that I can adjust the equalizer settings with the Alexa app. Definitely not as full of sound as the Sonos, and I don’t think it can get as loud, but it’s fine for me. The only irritating thing is how glitchy Alexa is, that you can’t control the volume of her spoken responses (way too loud ALWAYS), and the many glitches between the Alexa system and various other services/skills, but that’s really an Alexa problem vs. the speaker. Oh, also the voice recognition can be spotty. I swear Alexa never understands me when I speak commands in an angry tone 🤣 Very weird.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Coolguru,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2023","Overall a great device.
Audio is great - compared to smaller echo dot devices. Plus having built-in smart home hub allows it to connect to bulbs and plugs directly - which makes it great. With this, you can actually get rid of all the individual hubs (Hue, Sengled and others).
The device also has built-in temperature sensor (Not figured out how to use it yet ! except creating routines as Alexa thermostat was not there yet).

Amazon needs to do few things:
1. Publish a roadmap - on what features will be added to device (considering that the device is 3 year old and still going on).
2. Explore if Wifi can be added to device (as mesh node).

other feedback:

Amazon could do more with Alexa. e.g. I should be able to pair new smart devices with my amazon echo just using voice. Using phone should be optional. That would make this device a must have.

Occationally my audio shuts off. I understand that this is potentially due to internet stream issue (but I am supposed to be using streaming services of amazon itself). In such scenario I expect my device to detect the issue (my roku does), and gracefully recover from it (my roku does) or provide a feedback to me that it has encountered a stream issue (my roku does).",4.0 out of 5 stars

Its mostly nice in terms of features. Its nice having a temperature sensor and the sound is better than previous generations. Its also nice to see a smarthome hub included, but its definitely reflected in the price.

I got this to finally replace a gen 1 echo in a small room, and the biggest change has been that with the light ring at the bottom of the device we cannot see it with it positioned where we had the previous model. It may be a minor gripe but its definitely something to consider if you're replacing an older model and expect to keep the device in the old location. We had to move ours to another spot since it was often strange not being able to see if Alexa heard us (we find it to be a bit of a pain to use the acknowledgement mode).",4.0 out of 5 stars

I have an Echo Studio in the kitchen, which has wonderful sound. When this version became available, I ordered one in late 2022 for the bedroom. For the price, the sound is remarkably good, with full bass and a smooth spectrum of sound for music. However, it occasionally exhibits weird behavior. A couple of months ago, I was awakened by flashing blue lights. There had not been a power outage, but the Echo was rebooting itself. It did that several times over the course of the night. Over the last two weeks, it has twice gotten stuck. It won't respond to voice commands and keeps playing the playlist it was last on. Unplugging it and rebooting it gets it working properly again, but I have never had to do that with the Echo Studio. If it were as reliable as the Studio, I'd give it five stars, but I have to knock off a star for the inconvenience of occasionally having to reboot it.",4.0 out of 5 stars

We got the 4th generation Echo and have been pleased with improved sound. Installation was much easier than the earlier versions. I expect to make use of the internal Zigbee hub in the future; replacing the stand-alone hub we have now.
The only troubling feature is the temperature sensor. The only use I had for this was to tell me the temperature when I'm on the other side of the house. That's fortunate because it isn't accurate enough for most of the suggested smart home applications. Mine is always wrong by 2°F to 4°F high. Some on the internet have it much worse. Recalibrating the temperature sensor by unplugging the Echo for several minutes and restarting has had no effect.

Sue C.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2021","I was an early adopter of the Echo technology. This is my third basic Echo (in addition to an Echo Studio, several Echo Dots, and the version for your car).

Positives:

This one picks up commands easily even from the next room over without me having to raise my voice.

It controls my smart lights, smart outlets, motorized blinds, and other convenient features, and many items interface very smoothly so that installation of new devices is typically easy. Not always, but often.

Negatives:

The spherical design doesn't ""blend into the woodwork"" and takes up more shelf space than the previous cylindrical versions.

The system isn't very good at presenting information outside the fairly narrow range of skills. Ask it to play a song from the Amazon library or to ""Tell me about my commute"" (after specifying the location when you set up that skill), and it's helpful. Ask it the sort of general information question that you might input into Google, and it will probably tell you it doesn't know that. (I assume that the Google system would do better in this respect.)

It's programmed to offer you ""help"" that you didn't ask for which is irritating--mostly the opportunity to buy stuff. ""BTW, did you know that you can ask me to automatically order blah blah blah?"" as an addition to whatever you did ask it to do. Yes, I do know that, and I don't appreciate having to tell it to stop playing what amounts to an ad for other Amazon products or services.

The fact that there are only a few ""wake words"" is a problem in a household with multiple devices. It would be better if the user could input their own choice of a wake word that they would be unlikely to use in general conversation.

I'm not impressed with the sound fidelity of this system. It's better than the Dot's, but not by a whole lot. The Studio version is much, much better (but also much more expensive). To my ear, it doesn't sound as good as the second cylindrical version we own. That was disappointing, and is probably a direct result of having fewer speakers than previous versions. If listening to music is going to be a primary use, you're going to need to fuss with Bluetooth speakers or spring for the Studio version.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Wil W.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2020","I'm pretty impressed with this echo overall. It's smaller than I expected and It makes the new Dot seem large! But the sound is very good for such a small and inexpensive package. I think it's great that it's not 360 degree audio anymore as I have almost never seen one not installed near a wall. Additionally, the 1/4"" mounting hole (1/4-20 threaded like a tripod) is absolutely fantastic. I have mine mounted using a cheap security camera mount but you can use almost any tripod, arm or mount due to the ubiquity of this mounting size.

I was especially interested in the Aux-In / Line-in capabilities. The Echo only has one audio port and you can switch it between output and input. (If you're planning on using it for output only, though, a dot might be a better choice for you if you don't need zigbee) I'm using the port as an input and it's not quite as full-featured as I'd like.

Here are some facts from my limited testing and use you may find helpful.

- The line-in needs a strong/loud signal. The headphone port from my Mac mini comes out too softly even when the Echo, Mini and all software volumes are at max. I mean, it's loud enough at that, but then Alexa is SO LOUD it's unusable. I also tested from my iPad Pro with a USB C hub that had audio out and found similar low levels. I don't have a proper line-level output device handy. Unfortunately this level problem makes it unusable for my original purpose unless I add an amp. (Otherwise, great computer speaker!)
- The line-in needs to be activated in the Alexa app. By default the port is line-OUT. Look under settings for your device.
- The line-in is mixed with Alexa audio but is NOT MIXED with other audio sources, for instance streaming music services. Example: Play music from Spotify, ask Alexa something, you'll hear Alexa speaking over Spotify. Play audio from an external source via the line-in and the Spotify audio will stop and the external audio plays. Ask Alexa something and you'll hear the response over the line-in audio. Start Spotify again and the external audio will mute and Spotify will play. You cannot seem to mix external audio and a streaming source simultaneously. So far the auto switching between seems to be inconsistent.
- The port is a little tight to the edges of the recess in the housing. A cable with a large connector may not make a good connection.

I'll be putting this to work elsewhere and hope that I can use it as a computer speaker if the level issue is ever addressed. (I know, bluetooth to it, but the latency is poor)",4.0 out of 5 stars

Eric Johnson,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2021",I originally got a Sonos One to control Alexa with because sound quality is a must for me. The sound quality was great but I would have liked more bass especially for the cost. But for some reason the Alexa voice control didn't work that great I often had to ask several times for it to get it right so I took it back. I originally wanted the Echo Studio but it's not been available for months now so I decided to get this Echo Premium sound. When I first hooked it up in the living room on an end table I honestly was not impressed and was going to take that one back as well. But! I wanted to listen to music in the bathroom so I hooked it up in there and wow- it sounded like a different speaker all together it was sitting higher than it was on the living room end table and was also in a corner those two details transformed the sound. It's sound quality is on par but just slightly under the Sonos One @ $220 but when you think of the big price difference it makes the Sonos not worth the price. If you had $200 to spend on speaker I would buy two of the Echo 4 Premium sound speakers that makes a stereo pair and for sure would sound better than one Sonos One. I always thought the Echo Studio would be closer paired to the Sonos but I think it's actually closer to the Echo 4 Premium. Another reason that I like it better is you can play music through out your house on any Echo devices. With the Sonos it has to be another Sonos product to play throughout house. In my bedroom I have an Echo dot that is connected to my very favorite Logitech Z625 400 watt 2.1 THX certified speakers so I can still get the bass from the subwoofer in the bathroom that makes the Echo sound that much better. I'm glad I gave it a chance before returning. Another tip is make sure you set the equalizer to your liking adjusting that makes a huge difference.,4.0 out of 5 stars
S.F. Caldwell,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2022","What this device can do is absolutely amazing, the music really has a great sound with nice bass. I have a Fire TV, Sirius XM, Apple Music, Audible Books, etc. and I can just say say 'play this or play that' and Bam, the TV turns to what I say or the Dot plays in one, specific, or all rooms. Truly an amazing technological design with so many amazing features.

There is so many great things about this device, but the engineers made 2 major flaws; the first flaw could be fixed through a software update, the second could be just a cheaply bought microphone or it could possibly fixed through some complex software coding and then updated on all of these devices. If this could be done, this would without a doubt be a 5 Star purchase with zero complaints. Let's see if they do something to fix this or if they are now going to make you buy the next Generation and this purchase was a pretty much a waste of money. Here are the 2 flaws that I have found so far.

1) When Alexa talks, there is way too much bass to the voice and it makes it very hard to understand. Music is perfect, it is just when Alexa is answering questions making an announcement, telling you your reminder, etc.

2) Also, as I've read in many reviews, when you say the 'Wake Words (Alexa, Echo, etc.), sometimes it will answer you from 20 feet away and sometimes I'm literally standing over it and I can't get it to do anything (it especially stinks when you ask it to do something and it misheard what you said and starts talking about a subject and I say Alexa over and over, louder and louder, and it won't stop going on and on about a topic I didn't ask for, yet I can't get it to stop. I have to pretty much yell to get the thing to shut up).",4.0 out of 5 stars
Mike,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2022","I was looking for a soundbar system for my livingroom. While I was doing some research, I saw a huge sale on the Echo for $59. For the price of a budget soundbar system, I was able to buy two echos and an Echo Sub.

The software is wonky and frustrating to use sometimes. It took a half hour for the it to recognize the Echos as a stereo pair. Once they did, I was able to set them up in seconds. After that, I set it up with the Fire Stick as a home theater. The Echo sub hadn't even arrived yet. The sound is actually pretty amazing. The speakers sound crystal clear and provide competent bass. Music listening is where these speakers REALLY shine. There is a huge difference when you listen to music in true stereo.

Going back to the software, That's why it's 4 stars instead of 5. I woke up the next morning, and the home theater no longer had sound. I deleted the group and set it up again, no luck. I noodled with the software for 2 hours, and it just refused to work. This seems to be a known issue. After getting the boxes together to return the devices, 6 hours later, the software magically fixes itself. Just to be certain, I spent some time trying to break it again to see where the instability is, but it's rock solid now. I'm thinking they pushed it into production without properly testing the software. Once it broke, they must have pushed a big update to fix it. It just took time for the updates to happen on all the devices. You hear that Amazon? You need to do a better job of testing your software!

That being the case, it's the smartest home cinema you can buy. Most soundbar systems will make you use a separate remote to switch channels to Bluetooth, if you want Alexa to work...unless you want to pay for Alexa integration. The dual Echo configuration is completely seamless, because...well, it's an Echo. Music is what it does best. If you want music, Alexa plays music in full stereo. If you want to watch a movie, it automatically plays the sound in Dolby Digital using the Fire Stick.

Raleigh Rhino,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2021","Original review below. I did finally get them working (a few days later they sit magically realized they’re on the same network). They sounds great. Bumped it from 2 to 4 stars. Would give 5 if it weren’t for the below time wasting activity.

I bought these to replace a 2nd gen Echo set. I had lots of issues with the 2nd gen in stereo + sub mode. Mostly related to the setup (next paragraph). Usually if you can get them setup, they work mostly ok. Every few hours one of them will start to just play static...which is more than moderately annoying. Most of the time this can be fixed by saying Alexa, Stop and then Alexa play... About 1/6 times it requires physically unplugging all three devices and then plugging them back in. About 1/30 times they have to be unpaired and re-paired and that leads to the below nerdspeak.

Setup: So we have a home network with multiple SSIDs overlaid on 3 Unifi-Pro-AC Access Points (highly recommend those btw). However, every time I try to create a stereo + sub pair, once I click on the L or R speaker it tells me the R or L speaker is on a different wifi network (it isn't, all our IoT spyware devices are on one SSID/VLAN). So I thought maybe I'll just disable all but the closest AP and turn on only 2.4GHz. Note: this meant I had to drop like 50 other wireless clients, but I still did it, still got the same faux error. Why I know this is an Amazon issue (and suspect it's the Alexa app specifically) is because the sub will pair just fine with either echo. But yet the echos won't pair with each other. Then days later, I looked again, and viola it let me pair them again.

I googled for help, but all I found was a bunch of other users with the same issue but no resolution. So I contacted Amazon, which was a waste of time.

These may be fine speakers on their own, but if you plan to pair them in a stereo or stereo + sub set you're as likely as I was to be disappointed.",4.0 out of 5 stars

James L. Greenlee,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2020","We had two sets of Monster bluetooth speakers and all four connected to each other via 5.8hz technology. We'd run them through one Echo Dot, and that's how we did whole-house sound. But the Monster speakers are dying after a long life, and we needed to do something else. In my experience, using bluetooth speakers in tandem with Echo speakers throws the sound out of synch. So, I went for an all-Amazon solution.

We already had three 3rd-gen Dots, a Spot, a Fire Cube 4K, FireTV and a Show 5. So, I bought this new 4th-gen Echo to be the ""hub"" of things, plugged it in, and bada-bing, it set itself up. I added all of the speakers (except the Fire Cube) to the ""everything"" music group, and it works pretty darn well. You can tell it to play anything on ""everywhere."" You can tell it to turn the sound level to maximum ""everywhere."" It's mostly fixed my problem with replacing my old speakers. Now, some things I learned:

- Echo Show 5 has only two mics, and they're terrible. Put that in a room that is away from the rest, where there isn't any overlap.
- Echo Spot gets very confused when connected to the old bluetooth speakers, and would oddly slow down Alexa's speech, and song speeds. Don't ask me how, but it did. But the old speakers are out of the equation now.
- Fire Cube 4K will not join the ""everything"" sound group, but also isn't a terribly good speaker, so it's not a loss.
- To have more robust sound, we kept an EchoDot in the same room with the new 4th-gen Echo, but changed its wake-word to ""Echo,"" to avoid confusion between them.
- Fire Cube 4K's wake word was changed to ""computer"" for the same reason.
- Echo 4th-gen is great in most respects, but may have slightly less responsive mics. I've had her wake, but then ignore my requests. It's a minor issue, and nowhere near as bad as the EchoShow 5.

All-in-all, I'm pretty happy with the purchase, with my primary mission--whole house sound--solved. I figure I'll replace a Dot or two with these or other Echo speakers with more robust sounds as the months and years go by. I'll keep watching for sales.

Due to sending back another dot I was able to get a second on prime day for $42 net after trade in.
I paired it to the other one so now have a stereo pair. It is indeed sending different signals to the left and right channels based on the music.

I think it is pretty good for a home office. I did hear the Studio in the big box store last week and still might add one of those.

Update: I would give 4.5 vs.perhaps a 3.8 earlier. It seems to adapt over time by perhaps learning your voice and acoustics as I moved it in the room.

I had some credits with Amazon and decided to get this as it was on sale for $80- 25% trade in minus $5 dot trade in. So ~ $55 net. I was considering just getting a Echo Studio but the purpose of this is to sit on my floor and sometimes listen to music during the work day. My main Amazon/Alexa music listening to these days is through my Yamaha YAS109 and sometimes my Sonos One.

The setup was easy, much better than years ago - just opened the app and it connected. No more, password, pressing two buttons at once. I would agree that there have been a few ocassions I needed to repeat myself though as others have mentioned.

I was surprised by how much bass there was- I am in the process of adjusting the EQ on the app. I have tried it out with some classic rock and disco. I don't think the unit is earth shattering but for a casual listening experience while playing softly while WFH I think this has a lot of potential.

I will see if repositioning it changes my opinion higher. I have a Echo Studio 5- i think this does have clearer vocals .UPDATE: It is sounding better maybe it does recognize the room/small area with my voice.

Richard L Keitz,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2021","Sound quality as stereo Echo pair is great on my WiFi 6 Orbi network. They don’t interfere with my Bower & Wilkins Formation sound system.

My only complaint is Bluetooth airplay (Apple Music, Tidal) allows my iPhone to connect to only one Echo at a time so it’s not possible to grab them and go as a portable stereo sound system. They need WiFi and the Alexa App to pair them.

Amazon Music App works well and if you have the Formation, Apple Music and Tidal skills installed in the Amazon Alexa App you can figure out how to tell Alexa to play music from any skill source to any Alexa sound room or Formation sound stage.

I will test them with WiFi off to see it it’s possible to set them up and pair them using only Bluetooth and the iPhone Apps to see if I can get AirPlay to stream Bluetooth from Apple and Tidal music Apps to both Echo’s as a pair. I swear my initial setup outside on the deck had my Airplaying to both speakers in stereo. The next day, my iPhone rejected the saved Bluetooth device and when I detected and reattached I was able to connect to each speaker one at a time with no way to hear stereo mode without Amazon Music or telling Alexa via WiFi.

How they seemed to work via Airplay outside Amazon Music/Alexa on Bluetooth then wouldn’t the next day is a mystery.

Then how my Amazon Music App seemed to be broken with no way of changing speakers and other quirky things suddenly got better after I agreed to purchase Music HD is another mystery. Suddenly an AirPlay came alive in Amazon Music that now allows me to AirPlay to any Amazon sound room and also my Formation sound stages.

Jimtowner,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2022","I wanted decent sounding but budget friendly stereo speakers for the bedroom so I ordered two 4th Gen with Premium sound Echos and set them up as a stereo pair in the Alexa app. I mostly use Spotify for music and it is nicely integrated with Alexa making it easy to switch sound from my iPhone to the speakers. So far so good. The sound quality is good to my ears and I like the funky shape of the speakers.

However, it was disappointing that I could not drive sound to both speakers from other than the Spotify app. So listening to sources like Audible and Apple Music wasn’t possible. The best I could do was connect to one of the speakers via Bluetooth. But that defeated the stereo separation and fuller sound I wanted.

I finally settled on this workable an inexpensive solution:

1. I purchased a Bluetooth to Stereo adapter. I got this one https://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B078J3GTRK?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title

2. I also purchased two RCA to 3.5 mm adapters. Together with #1 the cost was about $30. https://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B092RTHZPW?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title

3. I plugged the left channel output from the Bluetooth adapter (using cables I had) to the Echo on the left and the right channel output to the right Echo.

4. Now when I want to listed to any iPhone app I connect the iPhone to the Bluetooth adapter and cast to the speakers.

Once it’s set up it’s simple to switch to the speakers via Bluetooth giving me the full sound I want. I just have to power on the adapter and it automatically makes the Bluetooth connection.

I did take off a rating star because I think Amazon should design their system so that stereo from any source is built in. But I know they want to keep people in their Alexa eco system so I don’t expect a built in solution any time soon.",4.0 out of 5 stars
robv14000,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2020","I am amazed at how good the Echo (not Echo Dot) 4th Gen sounds for music. I purchased the Echo for music while showering. I'm impressed enough to write this review. Now, if AMAZON considered reasonable trade-in values for older Echo Dots, I'd consider upgrading all the Dots I have around the house. This Echo makes me wonder what the Echo Studio sounds like, but I can't bring myself to purchase an Echo Studio due to its cost; I also don't need one because my ""main music room"" has all the gear I need there.

UPDATE:
I had more than four (4) 2nd-generation DOTs, and tried the ECHO 4th-gen to replace my bathroom DOT for showers. It works great in there, so I was moved to give the ECHO 4th-gen a positive review and went on to replace four (4) of my 2nd-gen DOTs with the 4th-gen ECHO. First of all, these ECHO 4th-gens are very sensitive to position in terms of the sound. I tolerated it. (They sound much better than the DOTs.) The MAIN PROBLEM with the ECHO 4th-gen is it DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO LISTEN. Sometimes the one in the living room didn't even acknowledge I was talking to it! (You can tell by the light not coming on.) And oftentimes it wouldn't hear me, and another ECHO or DOT would answer! So sometimes it wouldn't listen; other times it got the meaning of the words wrong; and yet other times it couldn't negotiate with the other ECHOs and DOTs ""within earshot"" as to which device should respond! If this ECHO was defective, then all of them are defective: they all do the same goofed-up-listening thing. I have since replaced the living-room ECHO 4th-gen with the old 2nd-gen DOT. Now I have sane listening in my living room again. I ""complained"" to AMAZON (oh how I complained) via ""I have feedback"" of course to no avail: AMAZON would have to acknowledge their design goof, which they continue to sell ""as is."" There is something wrong with the voice pickup in these 4th-gen ECHOs. It was aggravating enough for me to ""downgrade"" the 4th-gen ECHO to a 2nd-gen DOT.",4.0 out of 5 stars

It has a lot more base than my old echo Dot second generation. :-)

H J S,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2022","I have three of these balls with Premium sound. I’m replacing all the Dots in the house when I can get these on sale. So far, got one at $33, one at $44 and one at $52.

The sound quality is good, but directional, compared to the Plus 2nd Gen, which I can’t seem to get more of anywhere.

The mic’s on the new ball don’t seem too good. A little better than the Show5, but not as good as a Dot 3rd Gen or the Plus 2nd Gen. When I ask Alexa for something, I am sitting closest to this ball, but the Plus across the house hears me better and responds.

I like that they have temperature sensors in them, and am Trying to find out if I can get a widget on my phone to list all the temps from my 5 devices that have sensors. Haven’t found a way to do that yet, but I do have a routing set up that announces the garage temp at 3:00 pm from my dining room Plus.

I don’t need the ultrasonic sensor that I know of, and don’t use Zigbee for anything, so it would be better to make the device hear us better and leave those things out.

I got a great deal on those Echo Plus 2nd generation devices. I bought 2, but had I known how superior those are, I’d have gotten 6! Limit was 3 per account!

The light ring on the bottom of the ball is much less noticeable, and Less annoying as well. I hate those yellow rings for notifications. I need to turn that stuff off again, but they do go away after several hours.

Overall, it is the best sounding budget Echo device you can currently buy new. If you need it to actually hear you, you might want to get a used Echo Plus 2nd Gen.",4.0 out of 5 stars

2 Wheel Therapy,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2022","The style of the new Echo 4th Gen is aesthetically pleasing. I plugged it into the wall, the echo was detected by previously installed Alexa devices and it was all set up with a confirmation. Device is updated with a new processor which is supposed to improve the speed of response and commands.

Pros:
The addition of another tweeter to the new 4th Gen now fills the room with even more sound and provides more volume than previous generations.
Sound mapping improves the sound quality based on room size and shape features.
Temperature sensor now allows for more routine customization.
Home theater setup: I currently have two of these paired with an echo sub to create a home theater 2.1 system through my Fire TV Cube.
Internal Zigbee hub allows for a more integrated smart home experience, helps to lessen the bandwidth requirements of a smart home and improves the range for connected compatible devices through a Zigbee mesh network. (This is a largely desired improvement)

Cons:
Home theater setup: Despite having two Echo’s paired, the volume does not seem to be twice as loud as one would expect. It seems as though the audio levels are capped when the devices are connected in a home theater setup. While the volume is still good for the 2.1 system and it fills the room, it doesn’t seem to be far different than running one Echo at upper level volume. Also not capable of providing Dolby Atmos surround sound with Echo Gen. 4 as the paired speakers (Echo Studio required for this).

While there is only one con on my list it is a fairly large con as I purchased two of these devices in order to build a quality home theater system. I will update this if I find a way to improve this or an update does it for me.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Secondly, I use this primarily as a speaker in my bedroom and the sound is really very good. I tend to play it at low to medium volume so I can’t speak to what it sounds like at a high volume. But, I have one significant complaint. It has to be plugged in at all times to listen to music. Unless you pay $40+ for the battery base, which is ugly and takes away from the beautiful design of this model. Ideally I could take my Alexa outside for pool parties and BBQs but I’d have to schlep the whole set up out there and use one of only two outdoor outlets to plug it in.

Carol,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2022","Purchased this to upgrade a echo dot. Mainly purchased it for better sound since I like to listen to music. Also exchanged my echo show this purchase. First the echo dot sound is really poor but it’s a first generation. Not worth listening to music on really. The echo show I find to be pretty useless. I bought it to use it in the kitchen to see recipes on all recipes and it worked at first and then all of a sudden it stopped working with all recipes. The screen is quite annoying on it. It got unplugged pretty early on and sat in my closet. This gen 4 device I purchased for the sound since that’s what’s most important to me and operating lights and such. I discovered that it also has a motion detector in it working by ultrasound. Well I set that up it worked once when I walked into the room and never again. now it says it cannot connect to it.. This is pretty disappointing since I was hoping this would be a nice feature for the kitchen area, since my wall switch is kind of out of the way and this way I wouldn’t have to say to turn the lights on every time. I know sounds a bit lazy but isn’t that The whole idea of having a smart home and things automated? If there ever sizing something as it works it should work.

Spencer,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2022","We wanted to get away from all of the wired speakers that we had all over the room and opted for the Echos and the sub. Getting each one setup on their own was simple and quick. Making sure to change the activation name to not grab both of them at the same time for simple commands and questions.

I had a heck of a time getting them to go into the home theater group only to find out that they needed updates and then everything went smoothly. This is a must. Once on and running ask them if they have any updates and then they will finish.

Occasionally when switching apps back and forth the sound forgets where it was and a simple volume down and back up seems to fix that. Though I wish the remote would allow for solid hold vs. clicking every notch up or down.

Something that I took for granted was the fact that if your internet decides to have issues your speakers also will. Our previous setup was an old pioneer wired unit and didn't care about internet. These do. Not a deal breaker but worth noting.

Sound is pretty decent. Is it a 5k dollar sound system absolutely not. Does it fill a room to the point of neighbors knowing what you are watching I would say yes. Sound is clear through all volume level, but the equalizer I think could use some updates for real adjustments.

For a true surround sound setting, being able to pair more than 2 echos and a sub would be a great option.

I would buy these again.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Roland W.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2021","I found a voice recognition less accurate than the previous echo. I found this to be a bit disappointing as I got used to the quality of the voice recognition and the previous version. the voice recognition quality appeared to degrade after an update. I do hope they fix this. The sound quality however is excellent. I've been using it with basic Amazon music service and that's been more than enough for me. I have multiple devices so when I tell it to play music everywhere I hear music throughout my home playing simultaneously. It also connects to various podcasts and online radio stations.

One feature that I do like is the built-in thermostat. I'm able to use that to trigger other devices such as a portable heater, which are plugged into smart plugs, to turn off and on in a room when the temperature is above or below a certain range.

The ability to call people through the device is that nice bonus.i
It is not using your cell phone which I found to be a bit creepy but it will put your cell phone number as a number that is being dialed so it is effectively spoofing your phone. Basically you could put any phone number there in the account online to be dialing from and it will use it.

The user interface for Alexa integration is quite frankly confusing. I write computer systems for a living it took me quite a while to figure out the integration. I think the average user will give up on many of the integration features because of this difficulty. I should be able to talk to the device directly to create a routine and not be clicking through an application with confusing menus.

Overall it's still a great piece of technology and I highly recommend it.",4.0 out of 5 stars

geth1138,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2021","I have this along with a few echo Echo dots. The big echo is about ten feet away from my regular seat on the couch, and the echo dot is about thirty feet away, give or take, in the dining area on our open floor plan downstairs. The dot always hears me better than the big echo does. Always. I seldom have to raise my voice to the dot but I do for the echo. It does understand me okay when it hears me, though. Most of the time I wind up talking to the dot in the kitchen, though, because it hears me better, and only speak to the Echo when I want it to play music.

That said, the sound quality is noticeably better with the bigger echo, especially when it comes to bass. The dot is good, especially for a casual listener like me, but if you want better bass the echo is a good option. In our little condo it's loud to me at volume 6/10 and we generally keep the volume at 3 or 4.

It has a temperature sensor inside which is kinda fun but we don't have a smart thermostat so it's not a big selling point for me. I'm new to smart home stuff, so I haven't bothered figuring out the ZigBee thing yet.

I bought it on Prime Day, and for what I paid then I'm content. If you already have a dot and you're just looking for better sound, though, it might be worth it to you to spend the extra on the Echo Studio. We don't have it but a relative does, and the sound out of that is really nice.",4.0 out of 5 stars
JS in AZ,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2021","Finally a true high fidelity Echo! Of course it lacks true stereo separation, but that is hardly noticed with the 2 separate tweeters at 45 degree angle to each other.
This is a great way to stream music in HD and UHD as Echo 4 plays in this cd-quality format, better than mp3 quality for sure.
UPDATE: Voice recognition while loud music is playing is not as good as the 2nd generation, which is very sensitive during loud music or TV. With the TV at normal listening level, I have to almost yell to get the new Echo to hear what I am saying.
My opinion is that this one is great for pop music, which doesn't require as great sound as, say, symphonic music. I listened to a Mahler symphony with this Echo and the sound quality was quite good, suitable for background listening to classical. My high fidelity Onkyo system and speakers of course sound better, and a high quality sound system is required for serious classical listening. Still, this is a good unit and replaces my 1st gen living room Echo. The comparison here is phenomenal.
The new HD 2009 remastered Beatles albums sound great with Echo 4!
Also, it works with non-Amazon music streamers though it requires a paid subscription to Amazon Music HD to access them!
I like the globe-shape design. I was surprised at the white power cord, but it didn't bum me out like some reviewers here.

Van Buren,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2023","I was very impressed when I received my 4th gen Echo in November 2020.

Of course, this doesn't compare with my high-end stereo system but it beats the pants off of other small speakers. Yes, it's better than the Google speakers and it's hugely better than your phone.

I put mine on a table in the kitchen because my main home stereo is in another room and the sound doesn't reach the kitchen without blowing the ears out of family members in the living room. It was never subjected to extreme heat or high humidity but it was played daily while cooking.

Last week it was playing during lunch when there was a pop and the music stopped. All of the other Echo functions continued to work except the main feature that I purchased it for... music.

R Howard,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2021","Since wink has pretty much gone belly up and started charging to use it I decided it was time to put it to bed. Since I already have numerous dots, spots, and shows I decided the best idea was to go with the echo hub. I have a Phillips hue hub and numerous bulbs which connected very easily. I also have several switches that were mostly Z-wave so those all had to be replaced with Kasa zigbee switches which also installed very easily. My back door lock is a Schlage Connect but it was also Z-wave so I had to replace that with a Schlage Connect zigbee and that installed much easier than the Z-wave. I have to agree with everyone that it’s ridiculous they ship a white power cable with a charcoal unit. Luckily my cable is mostly hidden. I thought I could possibly use a power cable from one of the old dots but they all work on different amp outputs. I also have to agree that this thing needs an improvement on it’s microphone. I have this installed in my kitchen and normally have to call it my name several times to get it to respond whereas one of my shows is in the living room and I can easily get it to respond from the kitchen. Overall it was much easier to install and maintain than the wink hub. A word of advice. If you have a wink hub and you want to change to this hub make sure that you delete all of your devices from your wink app, unlink everything in the wink settings, remove the app from your phone and disable the wink skill. Otherwise Alexa Will reinstall them automatically and you will have to delete them all every time it does. Speaking from experience.",4.0 out of 5 stars

First, don't worry about the directional speaker if you put these against a wall already. It still fills the room with sound.

I'm a composer and sound guy and while the low might be a bit better here over gen 3 but the rest of the sound just isn't as full as as the previous version. Gen3 is just a richer sound. Finally, and something I didn't see coming, the new shape. People can debate if they like it or not, but having it out for just a few days, and because the whole top is speaker mesh, you get finger prints from the buttons and dust and other air-gunk gets stuck on it and it can't be wiped away because, well, it's speaker mesh.

I don’t use the Echo to its fullest capacity and likely never will. That being said, this one looks pretty and the function buttons are readily identifiable. The voice recognition is good (I still need to repeat the wake word more than once on occasion), the volume stays where selected, and it has a better sound quality.

The light bar goes around the bottom. I am not a fan of this change as I find that notifications are not readily obvious. This may be related to my use of the original for so long where the ring was around the top which I found was easily visible. This is not a real ‘problem’ more a dissatisfaction with location.

So we decided to make the switch, when these work they work amazing, their sound and bass are not as good as our HomePod was but with 2 it made a richer experience. We have ran into some issues, a few resets and wifi troubleshooting later we are still having problems. Wifi is not an issue at my house, we have fiber and the speeds are amazing. For a while the echos would randomly just stop playing sound, whether that be music, from Netflix, YouTube, you name it. After many resets we have almost eliminated that issue, but one still remains, after streaming for a while the echos start making a weird staticky electronic noise (almost futuristic glitchy). We have to then turn off our fire stick and then when it turns back on it freezes for a few minutes, we go back to what we were watching and then 80% of the time the sound goes back to normal.

This is NOT supposed to be a blast the neighborhood out speaker, but it did fill a larger room with quality sounding music that is noticeably improved to past generations. Voice commands and responses are practically instant and tigger happy quickly improved... Me likes so much that I replaced 2 of my 8 for in the areas where I am most using them. I even returned my first gen to amazon to get 25$ off then new one. Understand, my old ones are in pristine condition with all the original packaging and boxes, but how great to be able to do this!

My whole house is voice controlled, lighting, fireplaces (ceramic logs with LED ‘fake fire lights’), thermostat and as an early adopter of the Echo Voice Assistant, I’ve never looked back. Being able to ask any question, to ask about a stores hours before even driving there to make sure it’s open and then being given the option to phone DIRECTLY from the device, is sweet. And how about NEVER having to touch your alarm clock to hit snooze or turn it off again? Yes please. Get quick and accurate local weather reports instantly, air quality too! Need to be reminded, multiple timers or announcements and intercom functions. Just say the word. I have every news channel I want set in my flash briefing and LOVE these, hearing them most days. Here’s my line up: Daily scripture, this day in history, Fox news, BBC news, Management tip of the day and a few more. You can easily add what YOU want to hear and it’s a treat. I LOVE podcasts and there’s a series called “Hardcore History” with hundred of episodes. Some of which are 6 hours long! What’s cool is I can start one of these while I’m cooking in the kitchen, tell the device to stop when I’m finished and when I later (day, month, weeks or whatever) tell it to “Play Hardcore History” it will name the episode I left off on and pick it up for exactly the same spot! How sweet that??

And guys, knock yourselves out because there are thousands of podcasts on virtually any subjects to enjoy and learn from. I love having this ability!!! LOVE, Love, love the ability to always be learning new things from this device while still doing what I do do in the background. There’s so much more and I could literally go on for hours with what a great enhancement this has been in so many ways, learning, security, information, entertainment, news, communications, etc. Being able to have my arms full, walk though my house and just TEll a light to turn on along the way without having to touch or find a switch is sublime! Yep, you need the right lights, but boy, talk about convenience and living in the future now. NEVER going back! Even my landscaping lights and sprinkler control system, my security cameras works with it. And if I want to make an announcement to the whole house, I just say, “Echo, repeat EVERYWHERE” and then tell it what I want to say. And all 8, in every room will go off: “Dinner is in 5 minutes!” So sweet!

I also have 2 of the Echo Clocks that work with the device and they are awesome. The LED ring and countdown before the alarm going off is sweet.

But guys, I even LOVE just telling the Echo to play rain/storm sound effects and it’s calming, deep and healing. What a wonderful, effortless device with so many capabilities. Even during one of my personal bible studies, I can ask Echo for some background on virtually anyone I reading about and background is forthcoming.

Yes, I was an early adopter and man, these are a purchase I’ve never regretted making. I use them EVERY day and they have enhanced my life in ways that are special, rich and convenient. Like something out of a Dick Tracy comic from the 1930’s, this system is here, ripe, mature and developed. I’m such a fan!

The only suggestion I have for Amazon would be to give me the option in a metal package. Who wants to dust fabric? Lastly, IF you built in even great Biblical knowledge capability, you’d sell even millions more. Give me a teaching assistant that has a data base to field just about anything biblical I could ask of it.

LOVING this product and the direction it’s going. The future IS now and ECHO is the best, most supported, device with thousands and thousands of functions. Thank you Amazon and keep enhancing this baby because I’m upgrading all along the way. I returned on for a discount and the other 1st gen is going to a charity raffle. And heck, it’s in perfect condition with all the original packaging and boxes.

Hot Dog!

S. Fox,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2023","This was my first smart speaker purchase. Initially, I only wanted a portable Bluetooth speaker to move between my office and garage. I didn’t find anything with decent sound for under $100, so I started looking at smart speakers compatible with Amazon and Google. Per the many reviews I read, both the Amazon Echo and the Google Nest have good sound, but the Echo has better sound than the Nest. The Echo also has a 3.5mm jack while the Nest does not, so I chose the Echo. I wanted that jack as a way to connect my Walkman and listen to my playlists instead of using Bluetooth and draining Walkman battery.

My Echo arrived a few days ago and here is my review. Other smart speaker brands like Sonos, Bose, and Sony were way too expensive for my application and many were not fully compatible with all of the Alexa and Google features. That was a surprise. Plus, they were still mono speakers like the Echo and Nest.

Amazon immediately sent a link so I could start the setup process before receiving the Echo. That also gave me time to download and take a good look at the Alexa app on my Android phone. This initial setup process only took a few minutes. When the Echo arrived, I read the documentation, then plugged it in and finished the setup process using the app. There are a lot of possible settings, but many didn’t apply to me because I am not using any smart devices. This process also was easy.

I plugged my Walkman into the 3.5 mm jack and didn’t hear any audio. Later, I figured out that the jack can be configured as an output to another speaker or as an input from devices like my Walkman and the default is as an output. Problem solved.

The buttons on top of the Echo are clearly marked and are raised, so they are easy to identify and operate. The Echo has some weight to it that makes it stable when placed on my desk or workbench. It is light enough to make it portable. The Echo is not considered as a portable device because it must be plugged in, so I added a power supply ($15 on Amazon) in my garage and now I do consider it portable. The ring at the bottom turns blue when Alexa is connected. There is a button to turn the microphone off if desired. The sound is pretty decent; not Hi-Fi but certainly good enough for my purposes and better than the portable Bluetooth speakers I initially looked at. The Bluetooth connection between the Echo and my Walkman took less than a minute to create. That’s great because my Walkman has had issues trying to connect to external speakers in the past. The Echo also recognized a Bluetooth signal from other devices in my house, but I didn’t need to connect any of them.

I had not planned to use the Echo as a smart device, but found it so easy and convenient that I am using it fairly often for weather forecasts, to find out what channel a game is on, for current news, and other things. It’s fun and Alexa answers almost immediately. Some reviewers complained that they have to repeat requests or speak loudly to get a response from their Echo. I have not had any issues at all, even with Amazon Music playing and the volume up.

The best thing is that Amazon was selling the Echo for half price when I purchased it. I neglected to choose a color so my order defaulted to blue. It’s a soft blue and I like it. The only thing I don’t like, and other reviews have commented on this, is that regardless of the Echo color the power supply and cable are white. They should be same color as the Echo.

So far, I am thrilled with my purchase. Easy to setup, easy to use, responsive, sounds good, portable, and looks good. I can operate the Echo either directly through the speaker and buttons or through the Alexa app on my phone. Both work well. I started with my phone during setup, but now only use the speaker.

Update: Amazon replaced my Echo with a new one. The hum problem is now resolved. It is just as responsive and sounds just as good as the original echo that I returned had has no issues. Now that I have spent some time with the Echo I am glad I chose it over the Google Nest.",5.0 out of 5 stars
SubieNewbie,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2021","This is an honest review and comparison of the new 4th Generation Echo (not Dot) vs. the 2nd Generation Echo Plus (the last Echo Plus that was launched with the 3td Generation Echo).

I actually purchased two 4th Gen Echoes to create a Home Theater Group with the FireTV Stick 4k latest variant. I'll include notes about that as well.

Sound Quality Pros: I really enjoy music from different genres and I like to tinker with equalizer settings so that I get the fullest sound out of even a cheap speaker. I also like when a speaker(s) can pull double duty as a surround sound system for my television as well. That's what attracted me to the new Echoes.

Regarding music streaming from Amazon Music HD, I must say the sound is really smooth and crisp. I adjusted the equalizer settings for the individual devices in the Alexa app to boost the mid most, followed closely by the treble and a moderate bass setting (if they are paired in a stereo pair or Home Theater, adjusting one device automatically adjusts the other). I have my Echoes placed about 12 feet away in front of my primary seating spot on the sofa and the are spaced about 8 feet apart flanking the television. They are situated about 4 feet off the ground on book shelves. This positioning has been perfect for the accoustics in my 15x18 living room with tall ceilings. The speakers really fill up the space. And I am most impressed with how the sound bounces off of the walls and truly feel as if it surrounds me and immerses my eardrums into it.

This holds even more true for when I watch a movie with the Dolby Atmos setting on. I can hear the channels fairly well and it really seems like I own my own private movie theater in my living room. There's been times that there's a sound affect so specific to one channel and reproduced so clearly that I've actually muted the show thinking that I was hearing some noise from outside or in the hallway of my apartment building.

These two devices together get pretty loud without any noticeable distortion. Now I haven't played much bass heavy music but I do love action and sci-fi movies that are sound effect laden and peppered with bass booming explosions etc. The new 4th Gen Echoes keep up very nicely.

In contrast, though I thought I really loved the Echo Plus 2nd Gen, I now find that I really can't enjoy music or movies as much on it. I think that this is because the main speaker fires downward and the rest of the sound is omni directional. This sounds good on paper but in practice, at least for my uses, that type of speaker just seems muffled and really a waste of sound waves. Let me explain. How often to you place the Echo device in the center of a room to benefit from an omni-directional speaker? Most people don't have floor outlets under their coffee tables so it sits on an end table or bookshelf. It's usual home in a bedroom is on the end table. Even in a kitchen, unless placed on the island, the Echo rests with it's back to a wall. So, why then, would you want (let's say) 40% of the sound waves to be directed to a big slab with no ears to appreciate it?

The directional sound setup of the new Echo 4th Gen is ideal, really, for it's positioning in most homes. Sound is really diminished if you are behind it or immediately to it's side but comes barrelling at your ear drums when you are any angle in front of it. It's louder, more clear, and much more advanced when it comes to being able to utilize Dolby Atmos playback. I definitely choose the 4th gen over the 2nd Gen Plus any day. I almost feel bad for unloading the Plus onto my parents when I bought the 4th Gen. I'll upgrade them this Christmas. Lol.

The omni-directional speaker would be a benefit if it were placed in the center of a patio for a gathering or party, but again, where's your outlets? Not in the middle of the concrete or deck floor. So chances are, even on the patio, it will be placed backing up to an exterior wall. So the myth of the omni-directional speaker advantage is busted in my book.

Voice Recognition:
At first, I felt there was a noticeable difference with the Plus having the upper hand when I comes to summoning Alexa. However, I believe there have been some fairly large software updates recently that included fine tuning adjustments to the mics on the 4th Gen devices. They now clearly pick up my questions or commands from across the room and quickly cancel out the other Echo Dot I have on the far side open floor plan nearest the kitchen. Before, with the Plus, it was a toss up as to which one would respond because I firmly believe the best mics are still on the Echo Dot 3rd Gen with clock variant. Hands down. If only the echo show 5 in my bedroom would be even half as good, I'd be happy ( that unit is by far the worst with just 2 lack luster mics vs the 4 on the Dot and Plus).

Alexa is also quicker to respond on the 4th Gen too. Now that's a combination of the 450-ish gbps internet speed I am fortunate enough to have but I understand it's also due to a better processor and improved software.

And let me just say one thing... I don't know anyone who buys their smart home devices with Zigbee compatibility being the #1 consideration. Who cares? I have bought the best reviewed for the price smart bulbs, TV, and plugs etc not giving a thought to Zigbee because the latest generation smart devices don't require a hub.

All of my smart home devices work just fine by enabling the skill on the Alexa app with that of the manufacturer's chosen app and linking the accounts. The biggest issue I have is trying to remember what I named each lamp and group to turn on and off the lights. First world problems, I know.

For what it's worth, the big 3 smart home apps which seems to be used by these el cheapo devices are Kasa, Govee, and Smart Life. I have devices on all three and the Alexa integration is seemless. Except the darn ceiling fan speed control. Still haven't completely figured that one out entirely.

Setting up the devices and Grouping:
Both the Echo Plus and 4th Gens are very easy to set up initially. The Alexa app, though not entirely user friendly regarding the UI, does all the work and guides you through the process fairly quickly. The oddball thing that's a bit more challenging is knowing what the difference is between a stereo pair, a home theater and a speaker group.

First, a stereo pair must be two identical models (I believe an Echo Sub woofer can be added as the one off) and the pairing is only for music streaming. Only one Echo will respond at a time when you are conversationally interacting with Alexa.

In a Home Theater grouping, one or more Echo devices of the same model can be joined with a FireTV device such as the Stick 4k. A sub can also be added. The crummy part at first, is that you can't include your existing sound bar into this Home Theater Group. Amazon devices only, folks. So you must choose which you want to listen to.

Now, I'm not horribly disappointed because the sound quality of the two 4th Gens on each side of the TV is really great so the sound bar isn't needed but I hate the thought of the wasted money sitting 32 inches wide in front of me producing no sound at all.

IF, you have a smart TV like a Vizio, there is a way to activate the sound bar and have the Amazon Home Theater working at the same time. And here it is: the sound bar must be hooked up to an optical cable and the audio setting on the TV must be set to PCM not automatic. Auto defaults to whatever device you are streaming on ie a FireTV Stick. Then, while playing your FireTV Stick, choose the Home Theater as your audio source on the Fire TV menu. So in essence, the TV thinks it must send sound to the sound bar only while the Stick thinks it should be using the Home Theater. Through whatever glitch, I now have all three speakers working in tandem. BUT ONLY while using the FireTV device. It does not work if I am using the smart TV streaming apps from the Vizio home screen. Which I don't do anymore except for a couple things that are not found on the Amazon App store.

FYI, I don't believe that the Fire Edition Insignia and Toshiba televisions sold here and at Best Buy have the capability to set up the Home Theater function with the Alexa app.

Finally, a speaker group is the best way to get unlike models to sync with each other to play music. However, there's a catch... You must ask for that group's every time at the end of your request to play music etc.

Meaning, with the stereo pair and home theater, music and movies are automatically played through those selected speakers by means of the Alexa app. You would simply make the standard request for Alexa to play a song or album with no extra added specification. But remember, you're limited to only pairing the same models together for this to work like that.

Now, with a speaker group, you can include your Echoes, Dots, Shows, Spots, Inputs, FireTVs, Tablets etc etc into that group and have them all going at the same time through out your home, so long as you name this all-Echo inclusive group something like ""Every where"" or ""all speakers"" or ""whole house"". Be creative :) ""Echo Symphonic Orchestra"", ""Live from the Love Shack"", or ""on all decks of the Enterprise"" (you can even call your individual room groupings for lights and sounds things like "" the Bridge"" -Living Room, ""Ship's Galley"" -Kitchen, ""Ten Forward"" - dining or rec room, ""Shuttle Bay Two""-garage, "" Engineering""-utility room/basement, and ""Captain's Quarters""-master bedroom, ""Risa"" -backyard patio). Lol. Alexa groups can be named whatever you want! I digress though....

The point is you have to tell Alexa to play music AND include the name of the speaker group everytime or else music will just play from the device you speak into. Ex: ""Alexa play the song Starships on all decks of the Enterprise"" or (boring) ""Alexa, play Mr. Robot-o, everywhere"" or ""Play a lullaby in the dirty diaper factory (nursry)"". Get it?! I can sense your mind is starting to ignite like a solid rocket booster, now.

I really hope this helps someone. I know it's been a learning curve for me. And not always a lot of fun. Just wait til you first start exploring how to build your own custom routines or then decide to relocate devices into different rooms as you upgrade with new ones. It can be a labor of love...or regret.

Bottom line, if you are looking to upgrade but aren't entirely sure, try out the new Echo 4th Gen (especially in a pair for a Home Theater) and decide within 30 days if you really like them. Definitely explore the Alexa app and routines. And commit to replacing at least one bulb in each room with a color changing LED smart bulb to experience the fun you can have with this device. Also, I think you will be pleasantly surprised at what many people say is a drawback about being a directional speaker is really a benefit for most user's needs, including yours.

Some people will find fault in anything and some will find that they can't have everything to their exact liking. There's not a perfect smart speaker out there, so figure out what you must have features are, your nice to haves, and your deal breakers are and make the choice.
Regardless, enjoy these little glimpses of the future. Heck, they're even spherical shaped just like what the future devices and ships looked like in 2001: A Space Odyssey and Space Balls or a Borg scout ship, even. You gotta think that's at least a nice nod for sci-fi fans everywhere. Or if you are a devotee of mod design or simply a believer in form following function, then this ball of joy is sure to please. So, enjoy your new Echo; It's outta this world!

Rustam Alikhodjaev,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024","This is my third Echo device and second kind of. First two, Echo Pops, were purchased for my daughter. Actually, after I got one for her, she loved it so much that I decided to get another one for stereo and better sound overall. So she is happy! But the thing is after playing with Alexa while setting up my daughters Pops, I kind of fell in love with this device myself lol. So I bought a 4th generation Echo (thank you for Amazon Prime day and better price lol) and I’m very happy now. So as you can see on one of my pics the Echo is definitely larger than Echo pop, therefore takes a bit of more room which might be Cons for someone, it’s more than twice expensive and still has a white power cord lol. Those were Cons. And other ten thousand reasons to buy it will be Pros. Well the first main advantage over the Pop for me is a noticeable sound quality improvement (which is understandable since the Echo is a way larger therefore a speaker itself is definitely larger). No, I’m not trying to say Pop isn’t good. It’s a great speaker for its size and price, I’m just talking about my preferences now. So for its size and price Echo is an amazing speaker, sound quality is more than just decent, has pretty nice bass, especially on lower volumes, excellent quality built, has a tripod thread (or wall mount or any standard mount screw hole I believe) and has different color choices. Alexa does its job exactly the same way as on Pops (no surprise lol). I’ve got the one you see on my pics (something like blue I believe) just in case, because I’m still dreaming about its larger brother/sister (whatever lol) - Echo Studio. So “just in case” means our kitchen cabinets color surprisingly matches my new Echo so I’m thinking to move this useful companion to our kitchen in the future. I still feel I’m a beginner in Alexa universe so she can’t stop surprising me with my smart devices. With my new Echo I also ordered a smart bulb to see how it works together and of course I’m pleasantly surprised - I don’t have to lift my lazy bottom out of bed anymore, my bedroom nightstand light is voice operated now. Alexa turns it on or off, Alexa dims it to my desired preferences, Alexa turns it on in the mornings thanks to my routine group setting. Love the feature how easy to listen to my favorite music around our apartment now - I just asked Alexa to play music everywhere and my playlist started to sound on all 3 Echo devices we have (had to create an “everywhere” group before by the way). Just Amazing! I’m not talking about thousands of other features Alexa offers like weather, news, history, songs etc… etc… etc… After my little experience with both Pop and Echo and all the features Alexa offers my point of view about Echo devices changes, and not to Alexa or AI side, they are not perfect yet, but definitely improving, and Alexa works equally on both devices, so here is a matter of future software updates. It changes towards the Echo devices now. I can clearly hear the sound difference, both, in my opinion, perfect for its size as I mentioned above, and especially its price range. Sorry for comparison, but my $200+ Bose speaker sound exactly the same as my new Echo (and Bose doesn’t have Alexa living inside lol (or who knows maybe there is something I’m not aware of yet, but Bose still can’t beat the price). So after my first Echo Pop purchase, I’m impressed again, now with even better sound quality. Even now, during my finger gymnastics writing this review I’m thinking again to buy a next Echo for our bedroom and then Echo Studio for our living room. Oh, then garage, laundry………etc. So pleasant to have that amazing feeling of satisfaction of spending money the right way lol. Hope someone will find my review helpful.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kevin,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","I have one of each - a black one, a blue one, and a white one. I've been using them for about 3 years, and I absolutely love them.

Pros:
- Sound quality is amazing, I use mine to play music when I'm in the kitchen, in the office, or in the bedroom. Lots of bass, superb quality for such a small speaker.
- As stated, small speaker. They take up so little space, yet do so much. I have the bedroom one positioned behind my TV, my office one is on my book shelf, and my kitchen one is just sitting on the counter. They fill the entire room with music, and do an absolutely amazing job of it.
- Integrations with everything. My Alexa handles my lights, my thermostat, the TVs, the lights, it tells me when people are at the door, it reminds me of packages, it plays my music via Spotify just by asking, I get my morning news fix from it, sets my timers, wakes me up. It basically does everything for me that I would otherwise have to do on my own. Excellent little device.

Cons:
- They are sometimes terrible listeners. I'll ask Alexa to turn the lights off, and it'll take anywhere from one ask to 5 asks to get the lights to turn off. That could be an integration issue, but sometimes she'll say ""playing lighthouse by -"" and I'll have to scramble to tell her to stop (especially in the middle of the night).
- Sometimes annoying to setup. If you ask her to do something on a schedule, you have to go into the app and dig around for the settings in order to make her stop, you can't just request that she stop doing it. Currently my office Alexa will tell me the weather every day at 6:31pm, on the dot. I've asked her to stop, she doesn't know how. I've looked in the app, can't find it.

Other than that, truly one of the best additions to my house. They get a fairly large amount of use around here.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Arthur,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2023","Well, I have to say I love that its a speaker that has Alexa on it. If I had to complain though it would be easy truthfully. The music function. I had the advertised Unlimited plus music feature, after it was advertised as the only way for my grandmother to play certain old songs she was looking for with ease instead of her asking and then getting a different song with an advertisement worked in. However, it worked out for 2 seconds because I thought, why not pay more and get an Amazon Echo dot too for her room ao she could listen through the house. So that apparently added almost 20 bucks a month to a free service we had before. Mind you, I already pay for Prime and I added the Music Unlimited. But because she wanted to play her music softly in her room for ambience and then play it differently in the livingroom, Amazon said she had to upgrade to another more expensive music package called Unlimited Family. Thats the only way to she can listen to music she wants on her devices throughout her home. Again, the service costs more than most video services and is more than spotify, xm radio, or well just about any radio service that allows the option to pick a song via voice recognition these days. They really like to nickel and dime you for the most basic things and it isnt riggt in my opinion. If you pay to have music options through Amazons library, why should you pay more and more for ease of getting to that music? I mean, Amazon music uses to have all the music I could ever look for free with my Amazon Prime membership. And I think they added the voice search feature before this fee on top of a fee thing happened. It is crazy to me that every time you want to actually use the products that come out to the desirable extent they are advertised, you get either microtransactions blown at you, or even worse now you get a hefty monthly additional bill. Again, after being a member with the company paying a monthly fee for over a decade. Why would they think this would keep customer loyalty? All it does is make customers hope for and await another option that has something similar or even a little less nice for a better price. Can you imagine if a competitor like Ebay or Facebook got together and created a decent music library access via buying something like soundcloud or spotify. It has to be easy for the CEOs to themeselves want another option on a platform built similar to the Echo. And people themselves in the public that for the middle class have to like me be eager to seek out that second option. Yes the supply chain and easy shipping options makes it the onlyntrue source to buy things quickly and easily and Prime is still a great deal for that reason. But the echo, the dot, etc... are all just waiting to be taken off the shelves at this rate. And it is awful, because the advertised version and or even the versions where you can use the full functionality after burning a million dollars on unlocking them each month proves the Echo and its component products can do and be great products that make amazon something worth keeping a membership with for years to come. However, selling a product to active prime members and then putting limiters all over the software with the intent to create more monthly revenue on a loyal cusyomer base that you could of just succeeded in making that much more reliant on keeping a membership. Thats jist greedy and dumb at the same time. The echo or other products of this line have zero need to have these extra upcharges is the point. Get rid of them before your customers get rid of the products tge moment a better option becomes viable. Yes we will keep prime for the shipping. But heck, prime video is just rediculous right now with advertisements, fees for decent shows and movies and then just nothing of real value for prime members. It used to be a great service with limited options. But we loved and used it all the same because it was free for Prime members. Same with Amazon music. I loved it and used it all the time. No its advertisements for every song or monthly fees. So tired of the fee onslaught that comes with buying anything that looks like its useful these days. Thats the summary here. Amazon, you dont need to do what your doing. Your products have the ability to be in every household and used regularly everywhere. You will make a killing just selling the next updated color of the echo. Imstead of closing up video and music access. Eat the costs on rights and give it to your prime customers. You already raised rates for that too. But your cutting services on top of raising rates. What are you thinking. Your monopoly isnt unbeatable. Its difficult to see past the day people choose something better knowing what your chains look like right now. But Im telling you, this way of pushing customers for everything you want just because you can at the moment will end up making you the myspace of well....you know.

Hardy,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2024","So, I have a audiophile grade two speaker stereo main system, but I have Echos throughout the house to provide seamless sound from room to room. It all makes me happy. But wait, I just read that Amazon is going to start charging a monthly fee of $5 to $10 for Alexa AI and the current speakers won't work. This makes me ungruntled, and mumbling about Amazon's continuous bait and switch. From one day shipping shifting to multiday shipping, to creating faux TV channels that you have to buy or rent movies on rather than including them in their Prime package, to the creation of Woot to see their unsellable stuff (good luck getting a warranty on Woot junk). 3/4 of the stuff sold on Amazon is actually from China sold by China, not US sellers.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Brian Thomas,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2024","This is my second Echo. I wanted one for my workbench. Two is, in fact, better than one. In addition to using this in a second location I have also on occasion paired it in the same space with my first Echo. The stereo of having two Echo's in one room was awesome. Perfect for chilling to some good music. You can set these to play the same music in different parts of the house. If you upgrade your Amazon Music account you can play different music in different parts of the house at the same time. I use the basic Amazon Music because I only listen in one part of the house at a time. They can also connect through Bluetooth to the TV for an even better theater experience. I use this mode for watching football. Echo's can also have macros. If I say, ""Alexa, good night"" Alexa tells me, ""Good night"" turns down to the lowest volume and plays the Ambient music station for 30 minutes. This was very easy to set up. I can't say enough about why having an Echo will improve your life.",5.0 out of 5 stars
AkarueKa,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2022","A friend of mine recently gave me an echo. 2nd Gen. And I didn't think I was going to wind up using it very much but being visually impaired I wound up using it a lot more than I expected.

I came to find out that I could listen to my audible books and also my kindle books read to me which is great for my visual impairment it makes it a lot more enjoyable during the day when I become bored with trying to figure out what is actually on the television with my provision some things are just not watchable like they used to be.

But the echo. 2nd Gen. Speakers are well they leave a lot to be desired and I had to add additional speakers so when I saw this item I was like I'm gonna go see what the reviews are like and everyone said they were awesome they're awesome and so much better than the. 2nd Gen. So I decided to go ahead and get one for my birthday as a gift to myself and additionally I got the battery and the silicone carry case combination to go with it and I can take the thing all over my house in my yard and that is so cool.

Since I've gotten this particular one though I have found there are so many other things that I can do with it other than just listen to my audio books and kindle books I can listen to podcasts I can get the daily news I can check the temperature in the room that the echo is in it is in which is really cool because I don't have an interior thermostat in my house I run on a space here and a wood stove so I never know what the interior temperature of my house is but I do now.

There are also cool games you can play play I've been playing prices right and Trivia and a choose your own adventure kind of game andAre you smarter than a 5th grader by the way I'm smarter than a 5th grader.

I opted in for Amazon music and not only am I finding all the songs that I've forgotten from my past but I found some really cool new ones things things that I would have never found without this echo.

I've created playlists that when I'm in the mood for one thing or another I just tell she who cannot be named what playlist I want to hear and all of a sudden there I am.

She can also actuate my televisionI have a roku TV but I have also added a fireStick as well and she can actuate both of them and also my easy buzz camera that I have to keep an eye on my front porch and yard and be able to speak to people out there when I have guests without going to the door.

Being visually impaired this thing is a real helping hand the only thing would be better is if she could clean my house maybe Amazon will get there eventually.

But for now I'm very fond of this device

Other cool additional thingsI like how much bass the speaker has I like to listen to binaural beats music and meditation music and some dance music for exercise and I can feel the music it's pretty cool.

The speaker is pretty darn decent.

I chose the white version because because white is a color that I can see better with my vision the only concern I have is that the speaker cover might eventually get dirty but they get dirty I try to dust it on a daily basis just to make sure.

We also are using it for well-to-do list for one, alarms, oh and I've set a household network up where the smaller echo. that I was gifted is now in my kitchen and I can play them as a group oop or someone in my kitchen can drop in on me and ask me if I want dinner or if I'm busy and vice versa I can drop in on them as well well additionally I've set it up so I can tell it to make phone calls directly from my cell phone and works as a great speaker phone I've tested it out a few times and everybody says that they can hear me just fine and clear.

By the way for a little fun ask her to Beam me up Scottie.

Jeff S,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2022","I have my apartment which is not a small apartment and it has a loft as well for my 12-year-old son so he has his own area he’s getting to that age so anyway I had I think 5 echo dots and one echo show that had the visual screen for pictures and things like that but without a subwoofer or anything I was fine with the multi room music and I used it for that and basically also used it so I could just tell any of my echo dots or just basically when I open the door I would say Alexa Turn on my apartment!! Immediately all of my lights would come on and some of them are dimmed to a certain level which you can do in the settings on your Alexa app that most people have on their phones. I even have a couple lightbulbs that are multicolored so I have them set to green and red currently for Christmas!! So the lights all come on when I tell Alexa to do that including my living room TV as well. You can add numerous other items that are compatible with Alexa and/or SmartThings app and you name it. If you don’t have something that is compatible or doesn’t have Bluetooth or wifi etc… as long as you use a plugin for that item you can at MINIMUM turn it off and on with your voice or touch screen on your phone or Alexa show and I bought 2 of these Echoes because my friends have one or more and it is a sphere. So even though it’s twice as big as the echo dot, in the newer generations at least, they started out looking like a hockey puck which is still good and people have them still but I started using Alexa products just a couple years ago so, mine are all round balls that you can talk to and play music and control lights and cameras for security while home or check on your home while you’re not there!!

I bought 2 regular Echoes to replace 2 of the echo dots because they have 3 or 4 different speakers in each one!!! Crazy how much sound you get from the dot but the bigger one the regular echo, sounds like a huge floor speaker but it’s just a ball and you can get black or white or blue and more so I got 2 of them to pair together for stereo sound and to my Samsung TV that has an Alexa app built into it. So I can rock out or get surround sound when paired with my TV and Soundbar Sub woofer which I don’t use the soundbar anymore the echoes sounded better but I got them last month. They were 49.99 a piece!!! That’s like half price and why I hadn’t bought them before so for 100 bucks I have a completely wonderful set of speakers that you barely notice and they sound wonderful and you can buy them with a Studio speaker by Amazon or an Amazon Subwoofer bundled for even more awesome sound but I live in an apartment so I don’t want to get kicked out!!! They act as a hub for all of your Amazon devices also so you don’t need anything else but one echo honestly to run all of your lights just get the type of bulbs they suggest and they have bundles for those also and it’s truly amazing what quality of sound and other things that they can do but I have already typed far toooooo much. Start with 1 even for listening to music over the holidays and add devices as you go. That’s what I did and 2 years later I have it set up so we’ll that I can talk to my son when he’s at his Moms house on his echo and my echo here and there’s no need for buying him a cellphone!! Yet!!
There’s just so much I could say about what these things do for 50 bucks to get one of them is a steal because you’re just keep adding things and finding different things like grocery list reminders and alarms. It helps you with many things you wouldn’t even imagine.
So now, when I open my door to my apartment, I have it set to where the lights automatically come on with my TV. I don’t even have to talk. It’ll do that too so kudos to the designers of these things because they are very affordable and do so much.!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Quick answer: Deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation” when activating your 2.4 Wi-Fi broadcast on your router.

Back story: Last week I was at my wits end in utter frustration over three major roadblocks. The reason I switched to Alexa from Apple for smart home controls was over not being able to connect most Apple HomeKit devices into HomeKit, and the blasted issue of only being able to select more than one, ..1, ..ONE! echo speaker at a time to play music. I was continually blocked from setting up Multi-Room or even pair echo speakers. Hundreds of tries. I deleted, rebooted, spent 4 hours with Comcast getting my internet working again today because I rebooted my modem and router so much, they got molasses slow and stopped trying.
In interest I also am trying a few Google speakers. They wouldn’t stay connected to the internet for more than a split second before “Something went wrong” message. Probably over 70 tries.
Thursday, I broke down and bought my first homepod mini (wow, sound is really nice, but too high of price), and it gave me a hint how to solve all these other internet blocks.
It kept telling me that I don’t have “peer-to-peer connection” allowed on my network.

Now, I’m a little techy, but it took three days to finally take a chance on a for granted setting I always enable on my netgear router. It’s the blasted first Wireless page when enabling a wifi broadcast. I had to deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation.” That was it. It solved every issue I have come across with smart home tech for the last 4 months.

Tonight, I finally am able to play music at the same time on all my Echo speakers. I definitely will be putting these all over. Love.

For the months that I could not solve these problems, Amazons Multi-Player Music issue made me dig deeper. I did not find anyone suggesting this setting, so I thought I’d share. It may be out there, but it’s buried in the plethora of inquiries of people pleading for solutions.

I’m not sure what this will do for my/your internet security. But I’m going with it for now. And I’ll try to putt all devices back onto guest Wi-Fi.",5.0 out of 5 stars

First off the bad. If you're used to room enveloping sound with no sense of stereo this one will disappoint. Dual tweeters firing forward give it a true sense of direction so sticking it in a corner and have it fill the room will not be as satisfying. You'll notice where it's located more, especially if there's anything blocking your direct line of sight ( hearing ) . Where I keep mine only needed a slight shift to make it not be partially blocked by my sofa . Volume was still plenty loud in its old spot but it just didn't sound right. Easily solved but might not be that easy for others and some might actually prefer the directional sound more.
The bass can be a bit boomy though while listening to YYZ live in Rio the bass drum didn't sound bad at all and overall everything was satisfactory though slightly lacking in the mid highs. The eq settings in the Alexa app are set to flat on all 3 choices .
It's wider at the base than the previous generations by a lot. This could be a problem for some .
Star Trek Self Destruct Skill doesn't work on this one or my 4th gen Dot but does fine on my previous generation ones for some reason . Instead of blowing up my den it searches for ""zero zero zero"" movies on my Fire Stick. I'm sure that won't last long though .
Enough about the bad.
The bass is no longer wannabe but real. No longer does it struggle with everything below mid level voices but as I wrote above , bass drums actually sound like bass drums and Ends of the Earth by Lord Huron excels at all of the music ranges considering its size. Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams also sounded very nice across the sound spectrum . Music For Tables extreme from the high notes in the keyboard to the lows didn't miss a thing whereas the cow bell was very slightly muddy but the wood blocks sounded right . Am I saying it's as awesome as my studio headphones ? Not by any means but they took a huge step forward over the 3rd generation , which I was quite content with .
Response time seems noticeably faster and more accurate than the gen 3 I use . Only once did Alexa not understand my query and that was while setting up a traffic check routine. All I had to do was rephrase a little and now Alexa tells me the commute traffic and fastest way to get to work 5 minutes before I have to leave . 95 is terrible for accidents and Maps tells Alexa the best alternative if there's any.
I think my favorite thing though is the new shape and I REALLY like the lights being on the bottom, especially once the lights go off .
If you're still smitten with your gen 3 Echo or don't like the mini Death Star look of the new model skip this one as the performance improvements are readily apparent they're not earth shattering. Amazon will have to do something mind blowing next year to get me to part with my dough ray me for a gen 5. The more I listen to Fourplay on Echo the more I'm liking it for the music , nevermind all the super cool stuff I can do on it or my Dots or my Flex .",5.0 out of 5 stars

Veronica,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2024","We had the very first Echo, with the wood trim. It kept disconnecting even when we added an extra wifi adapter closer. I ended up getting this one to test which my husband wasn't too pleased with since he was thinking that it wouldn't sound good. He was complaining about how the price doesn't match the quality. Let me tell you, I played our old echo first in front of him to hear, then did this one, and it blew him away. You could hear a HUGE difference. Great bass/sound, not a bad price and doesn't disconnect. Works for me! It does take a lot of space but I bought a wall hanger for it so we'll see how that works out.",5.0 out of 5 stars
