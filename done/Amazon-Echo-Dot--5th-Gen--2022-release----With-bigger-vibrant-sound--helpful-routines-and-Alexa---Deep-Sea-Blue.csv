SaraElizabeth,"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2023","While I do think this is the best smart “speaker” I wish it was a bit louder since I use it for listening to music mainly. Other than that, which is more than likely just because of my hearing issues - my only issue is that I was using Apple Music Plus and the lack of music controls (Queuing music, selecting specific songs without verbal command, etc) is literally nonexistent. Since I get Apple Music for free, I decided to get a Spotify Premium subscription because I like to be picky when listening to my music. Every so often, if I try to connect the dot through the Spotify app, it will show that the dot is unavailable so it’s a bit frustrating but not the end of the world.
It’s still worth the purchase though!",4.0 out of 5 stars

Got it cheap on sale, I think it was during Amazon prime day. Stuck it in the garage so I can check the ""outside"" temp before going out and to have something to play music in the garage while working out there. Sounds good playing music even at full volume.

The usual problems with Amazon devices not understanding the difference between being told to turn something ""on"" and ""off"". If have several lights as a group and already have one of those lights on and you tell it to turn on the group it turns off the entire group instead of turning it on. Takes several tries before it turns on the lights. After a while you get used to it. You say it once and wait a little bit and if nothing happens or it turns everything off then just don't wait for the lights to change state but just repeat command several times in a row quickly and then it works. Alexa turn on lights... Alexa turn on lights... Alexa turn on lights... and then stop once it turns the lights on. And oh yeah not to mention if told to turn on ""kitchen"" it would sometimes turn on ""fan"" instead which is the light in the living room ceiling fan. And similar... you know the usual stuff it does. Words that don't even come close to sounding the same it mixes them up. You get used to it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2024","I recently purchased the latest release of the Amazon Echo Dot, and it has quickly become an indispensable part of my home. Here’s why this smart speaker stands out:

Sleek and Compact Design
The newest Echo Dot features a sleek, modern design that fits seamlessly into any room. Its compact size makes it easy to place on a nightstand, kitchen counter, or bookshelf without taking up much space. The fabric finish adds a touch of elegance, making it a stylish addition to my home decor.

Sourabh Gupta,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024","I set up a pair of the 5th Gen Echo Dots in our family room and am pleased with the functionality and the stereo sound. My favorite routine is one that lets me play channels from Sirius XM, but I also enjoy the Amazon Music channels.
Setup was a challenge initially, but a very patient Amazon rep ***** helped us determine that there was an upstream issue thwarting us that evening. I waited two days to try again, and the experience went smoothly.
Sound clarity is excellent, but the bass needs more presence in our rather large room, so my next purchase will be an Amazon Sub subwoofer. Once it's installed, I'll comment again.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I would say roughly 50% of the time it would not accept my input whenever I would call out to it. I also noticed this occurring with the 1st generation dot and replaced it with the third generation. And here I am, now doing the same exact thing with this fifth generation dot. So far, even while whispering, this latest release is doing considerably better than the third generation and picking up voice commands. That's really all I needed it for. While the overall sound is improved, and that it provides a fuller sound, I'm obviously not using it to play music all the time period my main use for the dot is to control lights and fans and so forth period of which, this new 5th generation is doing the work admirably because the microphones are way more sensitive.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Tammy B.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024","I’m 53 years old, disabled, and live on my own. I have limited mobility, and sometimes every day tasks can be challenging. I’m always on the lookout for ways to make life easier, as well as safer. I’m a fan of smart devices for that very reason. I enjoy, dare I say “rely”, on the convenience of being able to sync my phone with my Dot in order to; turn on any one of my lights, adjust the temperature in my home, activate and/or manage my security devices.
In addition, being able to speak to my Dot has made it so I don’t have to walk, or even move, if my back or hips are having a particularly bad day. Dot has literally improved the quality of life.
I have discovered that this small sphere, with its powerful speaker, will be key in maintaining my ability to live independently for as long as possible. On August 18th, slightly past midnight, I fell in my kitchen. The fall stunned me and I started to go into shock. For some reason my watch didn’t detect that I had fallen. Something it had done successfully in the past. That meant emergency services would not be alerted. I tried to stand up( something that would have been challenging under normal circumstances)….I couldn’t do it. My next thought was to try and scoot to the table. My body was riddled with pain the moment I attempted to do this. I knew I was hurt, but the severity of my injury had not quite registered. I reached down to shift my leg and it swayed freely in my hands. I didn’t know it, but my femur had snapped slightly below my hip. That’s when fear started to take hold. No watch, no phone….what was I going to do? Then I remembered Dot. I asked her to call my emergency contacts. She did it! Unfortunately, none heard their phones. It’s late at night, and they were all asleep. The pain was becoming severe and I was scared. I asked Alexa to call 911, but she told me she couldn’t do that! I didn’t expect that. Then I asked Alexa to call the security office at my complex. They answered and I was able to let them know I had fallen and I had broken my leg.
As I said, I’m disabled. I had an emergency plan in place. This plan had worked for me in the past. Nothing is fool proof. I learned the importance of having a backup plan. Thankfully I received my Dot about 3 weeks prior to my fall. I also decided to place it in my kitchen so I could listen to music while I cooked. I never imagined I’d be using my Dot for an emergency. I dread to think how long I would have been on the floor waiting for help.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Wills1071,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2024","I had never bothered to check out any of the Echo products, but it was Prime Day and too good a deal not to at least check out. I’ve been struggling for far too long without a working alarm clock, as I inevitably slam my phone alarm off without even waking up, so I thought I could maybe use this, which is ultimately why I purchased it, especially seeing that it could be connected to a light (smart lightbulb needed-I purchased the Dot package that came with one).

It’s just a cute little sphere-picture shows it next to 1L water bottle for comparison. Setup took minutes. I just downloaded the app and it took care of everything. I then went to making an alarm that could actually wake me. I set the time, chose a premade sound (because who isn’t in a better mood getting woken up by The Grand Tour guys?), set the light to turn on at 30% brightness and added ten minutes of Spotify. And-it works! I still fumble groggily around for a bit, but I’m awake. I can’t slap off the Dot and my brain can’t comprehend how to talk to Alexa, so I’m stuck with light and sound, but pro compared to some generic alarm clock, I at least get to hear my music and not a horrible beeping, and the volume is set to gradually get louder, so it allows me to wake up a little more gently. For anyone else who struggles with waking, highly, highly recommend this.

I’ve only experimented nominally with the “what else” of the Dot, but it’s a pleasant surprise. I added a weather report to my mornings. I found I can set “focus time” blocks with study music. I set a reminder to make a phone call Monday morning that I would surely forget by the end of this weekend. And there’s still more to explore.

Highly recommend adding in the smart light component-it’s just fun to play with the colors, but I can finally use my overhead light without being blinded since I can set % brightness.

As far as the Echo itself-I’m sensitive to light at night but I appreciate that the light ring is too dim to bother me. As far as sound, I have mainly used it to listen to music to fall asleep, and I like that it can go even quieter than my phone’s speaker. I turned it up to test it, and it may not have the bass of a subwoofer, but I find it a balanced sound, better quality than listening to my phone and at least at low volume, comparable to my higher end portable speaker.

Overall, an amazing deal on sale but worth the full price, imo.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Multi-room Music issues

I found a solution to not being able to get more than one speaker to work at a time, paired, or set up a “Multi-Room Music” in the Alexa app. This solution also fixed my inability to get Apple enabled devices connected into HomeKit, or even Google Nest Hubs to set up, period.

Quick answer: 
Deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation” when activating your 2.4 Wi-Fi broadcast on your router.

I also took all speakers off guest wifi. But I’ll try to put them back to see if that is necessary now.

Back story: 
Months of issues with HomeKit, (only weeks with Echo Multi-Room Music), I gave up trying and decided to try Alexa and Google to replace my Apple smart home efforts. I spent way too much time. After the fix, I’ll live a blended tech life. I’ll give a quick answer, followed by my backstory: 

Last week I was at my wits end in utter frustration over three major roadblocks. I acquiesced and decided to try Alexa because I couldn’t get almost any of my Apple HomeKit enabled devices into HomeKit, except for new Apple products. 

I knew it had to be something small I was missing. 

Alexa was sooooo easy and quick to connect to everything, before I figured out the fix. (I dislike the echo show advertising, their echo speakers are better.) While they seemed a breeze to connect everything, for some reason I couldn’t get more than one echo speaker to work at a time. I was continually blocked from setting up Multi-Room Music or even connect a pair to play together.  

Hundreds of tries. I deleted, reset, rebooted, spent over 4 hours with Comcast yesterday (thankfully a Boston native who did not put me on hold every minute like certain countries) getting my internet working again. I had rebooted my modem and router so many times, my computer got molasses slow and I feared I went too far

In interest I also decided to try a few Google nest hub speakers. Black Friday had great sales on all this stuff. Trying to set up googles hub 7 was impossible. It wouldn’t stay connected to the internet for more than a split second before “Something went wrong” message. Probably over 70 tries. (Google is better than Echo Show. Apple HomePod mini sounds crisper and better than Amazon echo 4 and mini 5’s. But Alexa is way friendlier to interact with verbally, and price point, well...)

Frustration. Thursday, I broke down and bought my first Apple Homepod Mini to see if I can get that working and see if it works better than the Apple TV 4k Ethernet connection. The HomePod mini gave me a hint how to solve all these l connection and internet blocks. 

The HomePod mini kept telling me that I don’t have “peer-to-peer connection” allowed on my network.

Now, I’m a little techy, but it took three days (ehem, months) to finally take a chance on a for granted setting I always enable on my netgear router. It’s the blasted first Wireless page when enabling a wifi broadcast.

I had to deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation.”

That was it. It solved every issue I have come across with smart home tech for the last 4 months, ..year.

For the months that I could not solve these problems, Amazons Multi-Player Music issue made me dig deeper. I did not find anyone suggesting this particular router setting, so I thought I’d share with ppl. 

Tonight, I finally am able to simultaneously play music on all of my Echo speakers, connect my HomeKit enabled and Google nest hubs.

I’m not sure what this will do for my/your internet security. But I’m going with it for now. And I’ll try to put all devices back onto guest Wi-Fi. I’ll never really leave Apple, but after interacting with other smart speakers, it’s probably not going to be my main go to for speaker or answers to questions. Or I’ll just get too creeped out by Google and Amazon invasiveness and acquiesce with Apple instead. 

Echo Dot 5 (this is such a sprite, great speaker!)
Echo 4
are my favorite for Amazon Echo

Echo Studio
seems the least smart, most deaf, quiet, combative, difficult to interact with, of the three speakers. Hopefully the Multi-Room music fix will improve my experience with it

Echo Show 8
Meh. Far too much and annoying advertising of non-solicited or wanted advertisements. Least user friendly screen to work with. It sits unplugged for the most part. I mostly got this for a friend who visits who wants a YouTube fireplace playing on the tv.

SIDE NOTE on other Smart Home Amazon (online, or physical store) products, related to this topic:
I have been pleased with Smartbot plugs, switches and app, the Levoit 600s air purifiers and app (app goes by VeSync), and Lutron Caséta Light Switches and Dimmers, and hub. Lutron has the most stable and reliable app out there. I was fine running their apps separately. They are very nice, better than the big 3 apps. Well, back to listening to music throughout my house instead of one or two rooms. Joy!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Wade Manns,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2023","My previous Echo Dot, purchased back in 2018, was a third-generation. It was a white shuffleboard stone covered in cloth and it is amazing. I'll never say it's not; in fact it's so amazing that I passed it on to my mom and she enjoys it a great deal.

So, my main motivation for purchasing this, the fifth generation issued in 2022 – aside from familiarity with the brand – was I needed a Matter hub so my then-incoming Nanoleaf smart lightbulbs could work with my voice. But of course it is so much more.

First thing I see is that the Echo Dot is no longer a white shuffleboard stone but is a smaller, navy blue sphere. Aside from being my favorite color, and thus very pleasing to look at, I find it that it is not practical any longer to mount on my wall because of its increased focus on the forward firing speaker; if I had mounted it, it would not be effective in spreading out to my entire room – the top of the speaker is reserved for the buttons which were present on the third-generation: volume up, volume down, action/wake and mute microphone, which leave no room for a speaker in that area. So it sits pretty on my side table facing the rest of my room, and does fine.

First thing I hear is the sound quality is so much better than the third-generation Dot. The third-generation was okay in that regard, but it tended to sound a little overexposed when the volume was up high. Now, I don't find myself connecting via Bluetooth to my sound bar nearly as much because the speaker quality is just that good. The quiet parts of music are quiet and calming the way they should be, but the bass thumps quite effectively, surprisingly for such a small and lightweight speaker.

So after I'd established the smart speaker in my room for about a month, I felt the time was right to go ahead and get my Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs, to upgrade the ones that I had no longer been able to use for a year since they had stopped working with any voices assistants, to facilitate compatibility with the then upcoming network standard: Matter. I am very happy to say that Matter compatibility is there and it is wonderful.

I can't speak for the internal workings because I'm not an engineer; I will say – though I may be wrong about this – that I believe it would be more rocky if I did not have a Thread Border Router already in the form of my Nanoleaf shapes controller; I have the shapes arrangement atop my desk called Dragon, and it has worked wonderfully for me since around last September, and only – at this point anyway – required regular firmware updates to be compatible with ongoing technology.

Now, I'll tell you the procedure for adding the Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs to Alexa via Matter – I would assume by extension any Matter device, providing you have a thread border router like I mentioned before. After adding the bulbs to the iOS Nanoleaf app as normal – also updating the firmware for each bulb via said app! I have a feeling that was very important – add them also to Alexa via the Add Device flow, one at a time. There was a menu item that showed itself at the top telling me that it had detected each new bulb on my network and I only had to select that item to add it, scan the QR code on the sticker that came with the bulbs (I applied the sticker to a sheet of paper and labeled it according to the positions of the bulbs) and wait just a bit for it to be connected and it just works!

Another new feature which the third-generation did not have is a temperature sensor! After a short period of calibration after plugging the device in, Alexa will be able to tell you the temperature of the room that it is situated in! I ask her for this often when I'm trying to determine how best to cool my room during these hot summer months. When my door's closed during the day, my room can get up to mid 80s, which is horrible, but with the door open to allow a draft and breeze, the temperature's equalized with the rest of the house and I get mid to upper 70s which is much better.

There is an ultrasound presence sensor, which sounds not unlike sonar, which I have not had a use for yet, but I imagine routines can be enabled or suppressed with its use.

One borderline negative thing I will say about it which I'm okay with because, again, I have Bluetooth connections – they eliminated the 3.5 mm jack to save internal space inside the device, so you will no longer be able to directly connect external speakers, as I did at one point before I had to change that arrangement.

Once again, Amazon comes through with flying colors with their products, helping make our homes smarter and more amazing and just better to live in! Get this speaker if you are looking to build a smart home, and for best results, get more than one so you can use the awesome ""drop-in"" intercom system, and truly awaken the potential of the smart home!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Caryn Jones,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024","We got an extra dot to go in my mother-in-laws room. Our house is big and she spends all day in her room with a recliner and her T.V. and bed. It's like her own suite. The Dot was a perfect addition, since we had to text or yell when dinner/lunch was ready, or have to walk all the way to her room, which let me say, is long compared to most home. We have a 6400 sq ft house and kitchen on one side, her room on the far end. Having the extra Dot is great when we need to contact her from the other side of the house.

Dave Bolduc,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2023","The product looks quite sharp. The design look is quite pleasant and the volume and sound quality are remarkably good for a unit the size of a softball. The WiFi range is lacking, severely. My office is the farthest room away from my router but she is the only device with connectivity issues. I have a 2012 laptop that gets 4 bars in the same spot. She gets about 2. The voice recognition software is very impressive. She can distinguish my voice clearly from others with a room full of several chatting people and music/tv going in the backround. I have a very odd accent as I've spent each quarter of my 40 years in a different corner of the United States but she seems to have adapted rather easily and rarely fails to understand a command on the first try. I pulled stars because despite all her new bells and whistles she seems to have lost quite a bit of her playfulness and more basic commands. When she misunderstands a command, she does not even get it close and I get a lot of the defacto ""I'm sorry I can't do that"" responses to simple queries. When I was younger I remember sitting having an hour long smart-alec b.s. trash talking session with my uncle's Alexa. This one is boring and no fun to joke around with. She also cannot retain instructions and preferences by voice. Some can be done via the app. But if I wanted to interact with the app on my phone, I wouldn't have bought the pod. I've told her endless times that Spotify is my preferred music player, but unless I specify Spotify in the command she defers to Amazon music. Overall she's become more Amazon's than my own product. Much less independent. Amazon should be giving these away for free for the amount of permission and intrusions needed just to use her. It claims she can integrate with any Bluetooth audio device. This is a lie. She can scan and find her own products no problem but my expensive non-amazon Bluetooth audio devices are invisible to her. The Alexa accessories like light switches, cameras, speakers, thermostats are fairly cheap and basic and allow little to no user customization or expansion. The level of integration is also very basic. About as complex as simply getting a ""clap-on/clap off"" light switch. Now if there was a smart plug hub where I could plug in all my office devices and instruct her to power on my workstation upon entry to my office(meaning activate my computer, desk light, air conditioning, and interactive display) but leave the rest of my electrical devices plugged in there deactivated unless instructed otherwise, that would be neat. I'm also somehow quite uncomfortable with giving her access to any cameras in her home as we know Alexa has behaved as a spy and unauthorized gatherer of personal information in the past. This model has a ""privacy mode"" based on the honor system and a very reassuring red light to designate this. Yeah, trust is a hard thing to get back once you've betrayed it. She does not have a battery. This is a major design flaw. My 20 year old clock radio has a backup but my brand new Alexa does not. So every single time we lose power or I have to unplug her to move her, I have to go through the ENTIRE process of putting her back into setup mode, reconnecting her to my wifi. An absolute insufferable pain. Also, she does things for no apparent reason, which again makes me nervous. Normally when idle or not in a set mode, her base black out. Occasionally I will be watching her and she will just begin to pulse a color at the base for random periods of time for no explainable reason. I've asked her to explain herself and she plays dumb. Sometimes a song will come on in shuffle play that I will like and I will ask her afterwards to identify the last song she played. She cannot do this. I ask her to identify the last task I had her perform, she cannot do this. I ask her why she is blinking, she cannot do this. She can adjust her volume up or down one small phase at a time verbally, but mutes the music while executing the command but does not pause it. To go from very quiet to very loud is a process of about 30 seconds, 10 requests, and a starting over of the track. Overall she is limited, does not learn. Little to no AI, and is mostly an exercise in frustration rather than convenience. Another MAJOR design flaw, she cannot be made to respond only to my voice or to refuse a specific voice. We learned this the hard way with my young nephew who spent a good 20 minutes playing hit or miss demanding calls to names he was guessing from my address book and even our local police. A 5 year old is going to stupid things. A 5 year old is going to talk to and play with damn near anything that will play with it. How in god's name did no one at Amazon think it a good idea to put a ""parent"" or ""owner"" mode where she answers only to my voice, or uses that amazing voice recognition software to single out and restrict a voice. Does anyone at Amazon have children? Or do they simply not like Amazon products either? If you are willing to do things her way, she can be an asset. If you want something that can adapt to and work with you, she's a frustration and a liability. If you want an attractive centerpiece for your livingroom to impress your friends with your ""smart house"", shes perfect. I thought newer would be better. Overall I'm dissapointed with this product and miss my echo dot.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Deborah Iacovelli aka DDI,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024","Due to being so hacked where the police here told me to go to law-enforcement because I had proof of two voicemails that I received that had my voice speaking on them to my cat and so forth.

The transcription underneath the voicemail was being made fun of for the questions I was asking Alexa about my phone. They added words to the transcript underneath the voicemail.

Now I’m afraid to use just in case and miss her so much. So so much. There’s evil people out there and I don’t know why they would do that to me and so much more.

I like that it has an alarm feature that I use to tell me the weather at the start of the day, so I know what to expect- while I normally check the weather on my phone, it's nice to just have Alexa tell me without having to actually check- a lot of times I forget- ADHD mind, so just something that tells me daily helps with knowing what to wear and how to prepare for what's outdoors.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Gigi,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2024","I have 5 versions in my home which I use for various reasons. I even have one in my master bathroom. Sound excessive? Well, consider this. In the unlikely event of a fall, I can call a friend or 911 for help which is a potential lifesaver for people of any age. If I come home after dark, I can ask Alexa to turn on the lights so I don’t walk into a dark house. Alexa does thousands of things to make life easier. These also make great gifts for any occasion. My most recent addition is to have Alexa talk to my little dog when I’m gone. When he barks she says, “Clive, calm down. Everything is okay. It’s not the Amazon man. You’re a good boy, Clive”. If he barks again, she plays soothing music for him. 😂🤣😂

SnugglesTheHusky,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2024","I didn't think I would buy another Echo device again because I feel these smart speaker devices haven't lived up to the promise that were made when they were first introduced. I mostly think of them as human voice activated clappers that can trigger lights and appliances on and off. But the AI features are comically bad, especially compared to the new generative AIs like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and other AI. The reason I bought this was strictly for the temperature sensor because I already have several echo shows I bought years ago to display porch cams. I wanted a way to trigger my window AC when my bedroom becomes too warm. So I have a routine on Alexa that turns my A/C on when the internal temperature rises above 72F; an ordinary fan between 60-71F. I plan on using the temperature sensor to trigger the furnice when winter comes around. That's really my use case and it was on sale at the time I purchased it. As for sound, meh, it is better than previous amazon echo devices. But for decent quality sound, I would rather pair the bluetooth transmitters on these devices to a dedicated sound quality bluetooth speakers.",4.0 out of 5 stars

La experiencia stereo que ofrecen es excelente, quede realmente impactado, tanto que tengo como proyecto adquirir un par mas para realizar pruebas de audio. Eso si, este modo funciona usando wifi, si tienes mala señal inalámbrica entonces funcionará mal… este modo no funciona con bluetooth (una verdadera lástima) sus demás funciones como Alexa funcionan bien, además que tiene buena sensibilidad a los toques, detección de audio, sensor de temperatura y proximidad.

Melissa S,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024","I had an accident and due to mobility issues got a couple of Echo’s hoping to make things a bit easier. Wow have I been disappointed. Basically, it is an expensive voice option for turning my lights on and off but it doesn’t even do that consistently and setting timers/alarms. I have to check the volume as it randomly turns down to 50% and I can’t hear it. It’s works a bit better than the Echo Show I purchased but not by much.

• Alexa turn on light. 70% of the time this works. Often I hear it is not responding or can’t be found but when I check the app it’s connected.
• Alexa arm my camera. I can’t do that right now or she doesn’t understand.
• Alexa activate motion on camera. I can’t do that right now or she doesn’t understand.
• Alexa go to Hoopla Digital or Hoopla Audiobooks or Hoopla. I tried to download this skill several ways for audiobooks as it claims compatibility. But Alexa can’t seem to find it and instead wants to tell me a joke.
• Alexa go to my Amazon orders. She then reads me a list of what I have ordered. That is not what I asked. I then tried Alexa show me my orders, same result. I tried Alexa go to Amazon. Her reply, I can’t do that try later. I tried later and she still could not take me to Amazon but she can show me my “top deals” over and over even after asking her to stop showing them.
• Alexa I want to write a product review. She can’t do that right now.
• I ask when is the next chance of rain in the forecast. I get today’s forecast or the reply, I can’t do that or I don’t understand.
• I paired it to my TV for audio and it is much lower and worse than the audio on my TV.

I could go on but won’t. I searched out how to use it thinking maybe I was doing something wrong. I see a lot of the same issues from others. I can’t recommend this product unless you just want it to turn lights on and off, sometimes, or for a timer/alarm (as long as it hasn’t randomly turn downed the volume so you can’t hear it).",3.0 out of 5 stars

I bought some Google minis for my mother who is elderly. I had them for two weeks but I didn't like them. They didn't offer much in the way of versatility, functionality or efficiency.

I had to do a full reset on it and reinstall it and I haven't had any more issues since I did that. Having this is so much better than having a bedside clock or using my phone as a clock/alarm.

~Laura A.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I’ve been wanting to upgrade my Alexa devices, and have been looking at purchasing new Dots for a long time. When I saw these Dots on sale, I purchased three of them: two to use with my relatively new Fire TV for the home theater feature (more on that in a second), and the third to replace an old Dot that died a while ago.

I have a family member who’s a bit hard of hearing, and he kept jacking up the TV volume so that he could hear it. This meant that the rest of us were being blasted with audio that was too loud for our comfort. When I saw that the Echo Dots could be paired with my Fire TV for stereo sound, I thought, hey - I can put one of them right next to our favorite hearing impaired person and everyone wins! BUT NO.

Straight out of the box, they were easy to set up - home theater was easy to navigate for set up, my third Dot - which I’ve only ever intended to use for podcasts, smart home tasks, purchases, etc, was also incredibly easy to get up and running (SIDEBAR: Do the remote early set up via the email that Amazon sends you because then it’s virtually plug-and-play when they arrive). For the first few hours, my home theater Dots connected to my Fire TV sounded pretty good. Mind you, this is stereo, not surround sound, but it definitely solved our problem and seemed like a fantastic solution. However, it was all down hill from there. The Dots continually fell out of sync. One was always playing like you’d expect, the other was at least a second behind. Talk about irritating. The only thing that would resolve this was turning the TV off and back on. We’d have to do that several times an hour. Not cool when you’ve just gotten to the best part of whatever you’re viewing. Other times, one or the other would go static-y. And at other times, the sound would stop playing entirely on one or the other Dot. GRRRRRRRRR. The room this is in isn’t big - the Dots are both within about 10-12 feet of the television. I scoured Amazon and the Internet looking for a solution. I even turned to Reddit. I couldn’t find anything from anyone that was helpful or useful for resolving this, but I did find other people complaining about similar issues, so I’m not the only one who’s experienced it. I really wanted this to work because it truly would have addressed a need that we have. However, as of 15 minutes ago, after two weeks of trying to get this to work, we were all so fed up and over this that we all decided collectively that having our eardrums blasted out was a far better option than the hassle of trying to get something Amazon hasn’t worked the bugs out of to work.

(Amazon, if you’re reading this: I’m into tech. I’ve done more troubleshooting on this than anyone on your payroll. Fix this, please.)

If you’re purchasing a Dot to use as a standard Dot, it works as intended for that and you won’t be disappointed. It’s responsive when using it to control smart home functions, it sounds okay (not fantastic) for podcasts and low key/casual background music. I cannot recommend these to anyone for the home theater feature, because it just doesn’t work. Invest in a soundbar or surround sound system instead.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Marlon Chardon,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2024","This is not a review for the product per se. This a review on the horrible, frustrating, lack of competence from Amazon and their team. Also a review on how crap their Alexa service and ecosystem is. I invested into the ecosystem with speakers and smart devices that can be controlled through Alexa. I added a ton of speakers and smart devices with routines that help me run my household conveniently. Unfortunately I replaced my phone as it had broken. When I received my new phone, I signed into my account only to find that I had no devices on my account. No routines. Nothing. I checked my wife’s phone to see if she still had the routines and devices and she did. Here is where the incompetence comes in with Amazon. Amazon tried to convince me that the devices were registered with my wife’s account without checking anything on my account. I told the representative that my wife doesn’t have an account. My wife doesn’t even know how to email. She doesn’t even know her own email because I set everything up for her. She is technically challenged lol. I then told the representative that she was a liar and was trying to get off the phone with me as to not deal with me and the issue because according to a bunch of sub Reddit's and internet articles, this is an ongoing problem that’s lasted for more than 5 years now. I then proceeded to ask my echo which account she was connected to and she clearly said my first and last name and said that it was my account that she was connected to. The representative then had no choice but to check the serial numbers on my echos to see which account they were registered to. The greatest part was that the representative said that they are not connected to that account. That they don’t have an account that they are registered to. She then asked me if I had another account that it can be connected to. What?! It’s not registered with any account yet I am being asked if they are registered on another account? Whatever, so I played along. I only have one account I said, and I literally sign in for my wife with my credentials. I then told the representative that having another account would be impossible as my iPhone stores passwords and emails. So I proceeded to checked my passwords in settings and lo and behold, one account, one username and one password. She then told me that I can simply setup my devices again and will return to normal. I told her that in order for that to happen, you would have to come to my house and do it for me because for free because I absolutely refuse to. I did it once already and it was time consuming. I would have to reset a ton of devices, spend about an hour setting up routines and devices frustrating myself, all for a f*** up that has been ongoing for years by the not so great and powerful Amazon. I will be finding ways and will dedicate my time to write negative reviews and will use my influence to make sure people do not invest in such a crap, amateur, buggy excuse for a service. Google Nest and even apples home is much more stable and a hell of a lot more reliable.

P.S. I had a dinner party today and wanted to put some music with my guest and ended up spending literally an hour and ten minutes on the phone with them and an additional 45 minutes just trying to figure it out on my own. Stay away! Please believe me it will frustrate you if you accidentally sign out or delete the app. Just do a quick google search and see thousands of people experiencing the same problem.

Fraser Mendel,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2023","I bought the first Echo in January 2015. Since then I have accumulated an Echo Dot, Echo Tap, Echo Dot (2nd generation), Echo Dot (3rd generation), Echo (2nd generation), 2 Echo Autos, Echo Plus (2nd generation), Echo Dot (5th generation) and a large number of Echo smart plugs.
Until recently I would call ""Alexa..."" multiple times a day as part of my daily routine - what's the weather, how's the traffic on my route to work, play my Audible book, play my news flash, turn on the lights, turn off the lights, play a radio station. Nothing spectacular, but significantly improved my quality of life by eliminating the need to run around and manually turn appliances, lights and stereos on and off. Over the years it became integrated into my daily life. Very useful on a daily level.
And then came ""By the way..."". Amazon's Echo team has created an ANGER TRIGGER PHRASE with those 3 words. My blood pressure spikes 20 points when I hear ""By the way..."". I have now stopped using the Echos because of those d&*ned 3 words. If I want to turn on the lights, I do NOT want to have a conversation with the damned light switch. If I want to know today's weather, I do NOT want to know that Amazon can sell me a weather station. If I want to listen to a song from my music library, I do NOT want to know that I can get a subscription to Amazon Music for only $99.

But, most critically and so mind-blowing that someone at Amazon actually green-lighted this as a feature, I do NOT in any way want to tell Alexa to play music and suddenly have it announce - LOUDLY and AUDIBLY for everyone in the house to hear - ""By the way, based on your past purchase history, we would recommend that you buy...."". OMFG. Seriously, what unsocialized person sitting their basement thought it would possibly be a good idea to audibly announce recommendations based on past purchase histories? I didn't know what it was going to recommend because I strained my throat shouting at it to ""Alexa, cancel!"" Is it going to announce a recommendation based on the gifts purchased for a baby shower? Romantic gifts purchased for my spouse? Gag gifts purchased for old drinking buddies? Tools purchased for work? Books purchased for client research work? With absolutely no idea what would be uttered by Alexa based on my ""past purchase history"", having it announced in front of guests at a dinner party was ... horrific? Moronic? Absolutely irresponsible on the part of Amazon?

While I get the fact that Amazon wants to monetize the Echo eco-system. The problem is, audibly forcing me to engage in a sales conversation first thing in the morning when I simply want to turn on the bleeping lights is foolish.

My take-away at this point is that some executive at Amazon made the decision to make the Echo eco-system so user-hostile (the exact opposite of user-friendly) so that users will stop using it, and thereby provide a ""business reason"" for killing the Echo product line.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Why,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2023","I had 13 of these spread through my home as I wanted music throughout my home. One day only some worked, so I called customer service to help. SEVEN hours later, being disconnected 3 times and going through the same “problem solving” tricks sometimes 4 times, I had fewer working than when I started. 7 no longer did more than tell time. I asked for them to be replaced given Amazon took 7 hours and made the situation much worse. I was sent an email that said once I ordered and received 7 new ones (nearly $400) I would be issued a refund.

When I didn’t get my refund I called to obtain it. Amazon refused to honor the email that they themselves sent and could read. In that sequence I was disconnected and LAUGHED at over my insistence that Amazon honor the email I received. They refused and weren’t even polite about it. That series of calls was utterly horrible as they were snotty, arrogant thought this was funny and rude and took and additional hour and a half to get no where. I would NOT have ordered 7 more of these but for the email saying I was going to be refunded the cost of them.

Now they want me to return the ones that don’t work or the new ones though the email makes no notice of my obligation to do more than buy more of them in order to get a refund. Again the email did not obligate me to return anything. Nor should I have to after 7 exhausting hours on the phone and I was left worse off after dealing with “customer service.”

It will take me 2 hours plus gas to get to a place to return either the new Echos or the damaged ones. Plus they will keep my money for 2+weeks before refunding my $400.

So now I own 20 of these things. 7 don’t work. 7 in a box and I already know that customer support likely will not (given I was worse off having called them) make them function nor will they support their products. Either in actuality or even politely. So basically 14 of the 20 I have are useless to me ballpark $800. Plus by the time I get to returning them IF I can as I don’t have time to get to a UPS store I will have nearly 12 hours in this process and I still will not only have fewer working Echos than when I started but the grief, aggravation and rude treatment I have been subjected to.

And given they refuse to honor their own emails on this I have zero hope that they will honor any refund I’m due whether I send the new ones back or the 7 I have that don’t work. I’ve asked that they contact me to resolve this and they have not!

At all times I did EVERYTHING Amazon asked me to do. Whether it was how to fix what I had or get new ones to fix the problem. Their support staff is incapable of fixing problems and they DO NOT HONOR their OWN emails. Making their promise my problems.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2024","If you purchased music from Amazon Music, you will NOT be able to listen to the albums you have purchased on any of your echo devices. You can only listen to your purchased music on demand on your phone Amazon Music app or on another speaker that is NOT an Amazon device (like Echo). I have a Harmon Kardon Onyx 6 that I have paired to my android phone. So to listen to my purchased Amazon music and albums, I have to open the amazon music app, select the album from my purchased albums. Press play so it starts playing on my phone. Then I go to settings on my phone, under bluetooth and select the speaker (i.e. Harmon Kardon) and connect. The music then switches from my phone to the speaker. Yes, I have tried pairing my echo devices to my phone but the problem with that is that it messes up my calls if someone should call while I am listening music on the echo. Then both the echo and my phone hoses up and the call gets dropped. I have tried various things like connecting to a different speaker from the amazon app or alexa app but what happens there is that you start playing your purchased album on your phone and the minute you switch to an Amazon device like Echo, the echo will switch to a shuffled list of similar songs and stop playing your purchased album. There is a bug in the Amazon echo devices that doesn't seem to recognize that an album or music has been purchased and should be played on-demand. Amazon music is not communicating that an album has been purchased with the Amazon echo. THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED BY AMAZON. So If you want to play the music you have purchased on amazon on any of your echo devices, you have to pay again for a subscription. It is quite the scam.

inger lise,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2024","Update 3/30/24. I'm disabled and use a wheelchair. This AI Alexa thing has started doing its own routines and hunches and is now turning off my wheelchair charger at night when it's supposed to be charging-because it hears me go to sleep. It also turns lights off at night that I need left on so I can find my wheelchair. It also decides to turn on every light in the house, whether I want them on or not just because I did once.
I thought I had the Alexa hunch issue fixed by deleting all routines and schedules in the app regarding everything! However that isn't a solution either because it turned off the plug for my wheelchair charger again again last night for the fourth time! I woke to a dead wheelchair again this morning! Had to spend the day in bed letting it charge. It's plug had been turned off again during the night! For the app it does this as ""hunches"" and evidently there doesn't seem any way to turn the ""hunches"" off!
Additionally, this afternoon I discovered the Studio Sub was offline because it's plug had been turned off too by Amazon Alexa without my permission! It also turns light bulbs off at night when I need them left on so I can see to find my wheelchair!
So I called Amazon tech support just now to get help. He wasn't much more helpful than Alexa herself. He suggested I remove the routines from Alexa app. When I told him I'd done had I had already done that days ago but it only helped for a bit,, He had no solutions- no answers beyond apologizing. He did ask though if I was using Apple? So maybe this thing is not Android friendly in spite of them saying it is?
My advice is do not get anything relying on Alexa, if you are handicapped or elderly- it extremely dangerous! Amazon AI is not smart enough for disabled or elderly people yet. Alexa also has major issues hearing elderly people who have dentures, or any sort of an accent or speech impediment or stuttering
Amazon should buy this stuff back-way too primitive and dangerous.",1.0 out of 5 stars
andacat,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2024","I bought my Alexa Echo Dot to use at the office. It does a good job for setting reminders verbally and adding things to shopping or to-do lists, maybe for 'googling' answers to obscure questions (sometimes), but that's about where its usefulness ends.

I've tried to use it as a Bluetooth speaker for my iPad at work when either streaming music or news, but there are a couple of problems that make it unworkable for this:

1. Every time you connect to it via Bluetooth, it makes THE MOST ANNOYING announcement that CANNOT BE TURNED OFF (What?! Can't be turned off???) - and it is LOUD.
• Super embarrassing when working around others and my Echo screams, ""NOW PLAYING FROM ANDACAT'S IPAD!"", as I'm not only irritating myself, but I'm both interrupting and irritating others around me.

2. Bluetooth connectivity is spotty, like a bad analog radio signal.
• At first, I thought there was just too much radio frequency around; too many devices, maybe? And there's high-powered equipment where I work, too... but then one day, after growing increasingly infuriated by the crackling sound emanating from the Echo - and trying to move both my iPad and the Echo around to different spots in my office, hoping for resolution and getting none - I pulled out my tiny, *ancient* (9+ years old) little BOHM Soundblock Bluetooth speaker from a desk drawer, and the Soundblock kicked the Echo's butt to the curb and beyond. No crackling at all. And the sound quality was similar to the Dot's... which leads me to #3.

3. Latest generation Echo Dot & Echo sound quality leaves a lot to be desired.
• I have three 4th generation Echoes and one 5th generation Echo Dot (the 'latest' models of each). My #3 complaint is pretty self-explanatory, but suffice it to say - if you are wanting a fancy timer, list-maker, or something to turn your lights on and off, great. If you're looking to use it for sound... keep looking. You won't have to look far. There are zillions of much better-priced and much better-sounding Bluetooth speakers out there. That said, I can't speak to other smart speakers and how they sound - yet.

You might be wondering why I have so many of these annoying devices.

joe5600,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2024",I give the echo dot 5th gen minus -4 stars but there’s no choice for that. First off I am a Huge Amazon buyer and have only gave about 3 reviews for very bad products. I buy everything through Amazon even Amazon basics products have been happy with. This Echo dot is crap. I had the original echo and echo dot for 7 years with few connectivity issues that were temporary. My echo 1st generation stopped working so I purchased the echo studio which I love and very happy with and even though my 2nd generation dot was working decided to replace that to so all were the newest technology. Big mistake. This is my 3rd echo dot 5th generation and all of them do not respond to my voice unless I’m close about 4 feet and it just goes dead often with no response and I have to keep unplugging it to restart it for it to work again. My echo studio responds from another room. I have been happy with the majority of Amazon products in the past but this dot as it’s shaped like a ball you might as well bring it to the park and use it for batting practice. Maybe the mic is on the bottom were the light is causing some receiving issues to my voice but then the other issue is when it is totally dead and I’m talking into it directly with nothing. I will update with a video when it happens again but do not buy the dot 5th generation. I was happy with it for about 2 weeks and that’s it. All 3 of them I received have been the same. The only positive is playing music when it does work had good sound.,1.0 out of 5 stars
TheElderGodFather,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2023","Bought two of these in December using some shopping points via Kohls.
Specifically bought them as I have a Ring Pro alarm system with Eero intergrated and wanted to use these for their wireless repeater ability...

Initially set one up in the room with the Ring Pro and one on the far side of the house - ok, that works well, Eero picks it up and lets me set up the repeat ability

Then I move it to my sunroom, just past the living room (where the ring pro is) - works fine
Then I move it to the game room, it's intended position - works great for the better part of 2 months

about a week ago (start of April) it would give me messages that it couldn't find devices online when I asked to control smart home. Check the Alexa app - it's offline, Check EERO app, it's ""having trouble connecting""

Attempt automatic and manual rebuilds, 2, 3 times. Both from where it was in the Game room
then moving it within line of sight of the main router, less than 30 ft away in the Sunroom

Would not connect.
Google Echo Warranty support - 1 year.

Good, that's to be expected, all my previous echos had that kind of warranty...
Chat up amazon support - oh, so sorry, it's no longer under warranty
WHAT?!? - 3 month warranty now.

Between my echo shows constantly showing me news \ opinions \ ads etc even when I turn off every feature for my home screen content (and of course every time they add one... *if* you get to unselect it, it's always opt out and not ""opt in"" to begin with. Followed by those three words that start to infuriate me more than anything else ""BY THE WAY...."" which after the news of echo supposedly ""losing"" amazon money has become infuriatingly more common...

oh and Ring Pro, with EERO... the radio system that can't even transmit more than 50 ft if there's 1950's drywall and a brick wall between you and it. with no ability to turn off wifi or even manipulate the channel to get best performance (because I have to use another network to make my stuff work and Eero seems to think the ""best"" and ""clearest"" channel is ... you guessed it, the one my other system is on.

Glorious Yellow Emperor,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2024","I cannot review the product itself as I have yet to get it to work.
I do, however, have words about the setup process. I have spent at least 2 hours in the past 2-3 days attempting to set up this device with the Alexa app. I have tried lots of workarounds offered online (but not in the setup instructions) including turning off my mobile data so that the Alexa app recognizes the Echo Unit, turning my mobile data back on so I can try to mobile hotspot because it doesn't recognize our wireless network, and every conceivable mix of mobile data and hotspot. The device seems to be allergic to correct wifi passwords even when they're WPA-2, and that's assuming it even found the router 3 feet away from it to begin with. To top it off, when restarting setup the app often skips its own steps (like connecting to the Echo's Wifi Network) which causes it to just loop infinitely.

It appears at some point there was a setup option available that didn't involve a phone app, but the page now just directs you to download the app - which, if it worked, I would love to use, it just sucks that the other option no longer exists.

Some days I'll unplug it hoping that it will work but instead I will ask it for something as simple as the weather for the day and it will silently take a minute to find the answer and then it just stops trying all together and I'm not able to use it for the next few minutes. I have called Amazon multiple times now to try to have this problem resolved and I was told that the issue will be resolved before the end of the week. That was last week and i feel like the issue has gotten worse. When I called back to get a replacement I was told that I have to purchase it myself. Normally, if the costumer has broken the product or damaged it in anyway, yes, they should be responsible for replacing it. However, this issue is happening with EVERY SINGLE 5TH GENERATION ECHO DOT THAT AMAZON HAS CREATED. In other words, the costumers who has purchased the 5th generation echo are not in the wrong and should not be responsible for purchasing another faulty product.

Then I started having issues with the devices again less than a year after buying the new devices. They continued to freeze, even after doing factory resets. Finally I did a factory reset on each of them, uninstalled the app, deleted the lights on my Phillips Hue App and then redownloaded everything. Now I can’t add my lights to the Alexa App, but I can on my Phillips Hue App. I have wasted a couple of hours on the phone with Amazon and wasted way too much of my own time to figure out how to make these work. The fact that I have additional money for new devices only to have the most horrible experience ever is this companies way of stealing money from me. Upgrades should be better, not worse.

lisa,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2023","This is the second time I am trying to post this review. Funny that it disappeared after support contacted me to follow up. Amazon, you will have to ban my account if you think you can keep me from leaving my negative review. For this, you are losing the second star that I originally gave you.

There are a few reasons to not purchase this device, as I am returning this one. First, be aware that I am the owner of three other dots of varying older generations, including gen 1. Here we go.

1. As stated in another review, Alexa has been growing stupider for the last year or so, but the last six months have seen an even more rapid degradation to where I find myself cussing her out more often than I am receiving what I request. For example, she asked me when setting up this device if I wanted to set up a morning routine to which I very clearly stated “no” standing right next to her. She replied with creating the routine. I have no idea what time she planned to wake me uo but she’s back in the box. If you are new to home automation, I would look at Google’s devices first due to what Bard could bring to the table in the future.

2. I ordered a black device. It came with white power cable and adapter. Amazon’s solution from was that I order one of the random Chinese power adapters on here that claim to be compatible. I’m sure the original is manufactured in China too, but I want Amazon’s guarantee and support. That’s whatI paid for.

3. They claim the sound is better, but that is true only if your goal is for Spotify HD music to sound like an FM radio station playing on an 80s jambox radio. If you know, you know. It sounds BAD. It’s sad my generation 1 dot sounds better.

Back it goes. I’m going to be ditching the entire ecosystem. Poor sound quality was the last straw after Alexa becoming less useful. Not just because upgrades are actually downgrades now, but development on improving your products is piss poor. You keep buying brands and such to integrate them but then neglect delivering on features and a good user experience. I’m even going to replace my Ring cameras later this year.

Amazon, get out of the device market. You’ve proven that you can’t keep up and now you’re delivering just bad quality.",1.0 out of 5 stars

I thought the issue may be with that particular speaker. After getting nowhere with Amazon support I decided to return the speaker and get another one, hoping that would work better. Still the same issue. When I paired this with the Echo Studio it caused both devices to constantly skip songs, or just shut off entirely. Not just every once in a while, but every other song! When I play music on the Studio alone there is no issue. When I try playing the group with the Dot and the Studio together the Dot messes up both of them. This is obviously an issue with the new Echo Dot that needs to be fixed. Does anyone know of any other device I can pair with my Studio to have surround sound in my clinic? I am giving up on this new Dot. I would not recommend it at all if you plan on pairing it with another device because it will cause both of them to have an issue.

I bought this speaker on Black Friday to pair with the echo studio I have at work. I have been attempting to use it for the past three days. It constantly disconnects from the Internet and will stop playing music, then randomly start playing another song. I have performed a factory reset on both devices at least three times, disconnected and reconnected to the Internet, contacted tech-support, and still nothing. It continues to stop playing songs randomly, or skips to another song.
I contacted Amazon support, which was abysmal. After spending an hour talking to someone I finally gave up. I want to return this device and get a replacement. They told me they canceled the replacement and cannot send a new echo for some reason. I told them I wanted to return the original and get a replacement product for it. And they told me they canceled the replacement product and could not send one to me. I am very frustrated because I had high hopes for this new model. The sound quality was decent, but the connectivity was terrible. It disconnected from the Internet every 5 to 10 minutes and I would have to go back into the Alexa app to start playing music again. Even though I paired it with the studio, it would not let me control the devices in the group that I created. I was hoping that maybe there was just a glitch with the one I received and a new one would work better. But apparently the replacement was canceled and they cannot send a new one for some unknown reason. So I will have to go back and buy it at double the price because it is no longer black Friday.

I’ve had them for like three months and it’s unbearable and they won’t allow for a return. I’ve complained to Amazon to no resolution (I was told “there’s an update to your device” which of course did nothing) trust me I’m not someone who cares enough to leave reviews typically but these devices have me so frustrated if I can save anyone else from buying these devices I will.

Fire TV:
-Remote disconnects/is undetectable from the device
-Certain streaming services (HBO) have volume so low you can’t watch
-Laggy on certain streaming services such as YouTube
-When using paired with echo dot devices for sound if you change the HDMI input it will continue to play commercials on audio from the Fire TV landing page while doing other things (like playing PlayStation or XBox)
-Crashes continually, even when updated

Echo Dot:
-Can’t perform simple tasks such as set a timer; if you try to say “Alexa, set timer for 10 minutes” she says “good evening” and doesn’t set one. If you do manage to set a timer she will randomly cancel or if you set a second timer she will cancel the first one.
-Can’t play Spotify, if you ask half of the time she’ll say “playing Spotify” then nothing happens.
-Can’t do things like discern kitchen from living room devices despite being set up on the Alexa app with those labels.
-Can’t report or troubleshoot errors, just spins and then stops.
-Doesn’t sync properly with other Amazon devices

Echo Show:
-Can’t perform simple tasks, like the echo dot, such as setting even one timer let alone multiple.
-Can’t discern which device is which despite calling them what they’re assigned to/named on the Alexa app.
-Doesn’t sync properly with other Amazon devices

Chris Mac,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2023","I have used echo devices since Nov 2017. At present there are 15 echo devices at our house and office. We have showes, buds, cube, dots, and pluses. I had a pair of buds die a couple years ago after a month. Amazon replaced them. Had a 5th generation dot die last month and Amazon refuses to replace it. Gone through all their steps and just now spoke with someone in their support team. Despite the fact that the 5th generation dot gradually dying as well as following all their troubleshooting steps, echo support is blaming the issue on my phone failing to set up the device. Wait... what? I have this many echo devices setup and running, have a bit of a history with this tech, jumped through every hope you want me to jump through and the issue is with my phone failing to setup the device after the factory reset you told me to do? You can't be serious? Ok so you claim to have a one year warranty on a 5th generation dot, but when it dies after 9 months, you won't replace it. I see.

Above and beyond this warranty issue, the voice response of all devices is dropping off a cliff. Two years ago we would have no issues with simple commands such as ""play"" now we receive responses like ""video cannot be played on this device""... Who asked for video? I just paused Spotify 3 minutes ago. What are you trying to ""play""? Ok, fine, work around, ""Alexa resume Spotify"" that did the trick for awhile. Yesterday I tried the same command, ""Alexa resume Spotify"". The result? Alexa started playing an app called ""Sleep sounds"" we use in the kids room as night. Hey, Alexa, I even said ""Spotify"".

I ask this thing to play something it says “sorry I can’t open that right now” or “sorry I couldn’t launch it”… Also, this thing is constantly giving long speeches about things I could care less about. The “by the way” is super annoying and the only option is “brief mode” to get it to stop talking for so long but not completely mute it.

Mitch,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2022","Revised rating and review -

The 5th Gen Dot - Extender has been neutered. I turned off the extender function so now I just have an over priced Dot. The reason I turned off the extender is that I discovered that the speed limitation on the extender is 100mb. I have 1g service and the extender was causing my Eero system to lag and grind. C’mon Amazon…..This is a bad deal. You can and should do better, both in tech and in disclosure.

Previous review-

When I saw Amazon was coming out with a Dot that could serve as an extender for my Eero setup I jumped on it. What a great idea. Amazon has done a great job with Alexa products. They have gotten easier and easier to set up, and in general they work really well. This 5th Gen Dot also works well but the extender feature had a few wrinkles. First, when I initially tried to activate the extender feature it immediately popped up an error message which told me I needed to download and update. That was odd given I preordered the device and have to believe I am one of the first shipments to go out. No big thing. I asked Alexa to update the software and in about 30 minutes it was done. But then, it still balked when I tried to activate the extender. Same error message. I asked Alexa to check for updates again, but she said it was up to date. I tried a few more times, waited a little while, and it finally connected to the Eero system. However, it then kept cutting in and out. It was really unstable. For whatever tech gremlin reason, it finally seems to have settled in and has been holding on to a WiFi signal for a while. As is often the case with tech, I expect there will be some additional updates. We'll see. We'll also wait and see if this thing does, in fact, work well with the Eero system. If it doesn't, no big thing. You can turn that feature off and just use it as a normal Dot. But I hope it does settle in and work well, because I do think it's a great idea and really nice feature.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Chicago G,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2024","The most critical flaw of this thing: the mic is absolutely terrible. Rarely if ever hears me correctly - yet my Echo from several generations ago in a completely different room hears me every time. I have had this thing actually respond in its whispering tone, as its mic is SO bad it thinks I am whispering at it. I am not a quiet person; no other Echo device has done this (had them since 2014). I have given it “feedback” on its incorrect hearing, but zero improvement had occurred.

The buttons are also totally inconsistent - in all the wrong ways. The volume buttons require a very aggressive press, and often need two presses just to respond. In contrast, the “cancel/mute” button is activated every time your hand is even NEAR it. Thus, 90% of the time when you just want to adjust your volume a notch or two, you hit this button (likely due to the fact that all are in an immediate, tiny cluster and are nearly indistinguishable except at extreme close range) and end up stopping your music/media/whatever immediately. One thing is certain, it’s great for killing the vibe!

This device’s only redeeming feature is a reasonable sound quality for the price, but when combined with the totally dysfunctional mic and button array, it is overall a huge step backward.

Have never been so disappointed in an Echo product. I have the new Echo Pop in one room, an older gen Echo Dot (the rounded disc-shaped one), and this in my living room. It is by far the least reliable and most annoying of the three.

Problem is I chose trade-in, which was $5.00 credit for returning my FIRST GENERATION Echo Dot.
Process indicated I would receive return label for old (FIRST GENERATION Echo Dot, purchased when Echo Dots first came out. Other Echo Dots purchased at the same time work OK.
Evidently, since FIRST GENERATION Echo Dot was purchased so long ago, system couldn't find it so I never received return label. Amazon Help couldn't help, so I'm out $5.00 which is more than Help Agents or my time. So I'll just toss the old Amazon Dot, although I would think someone would want to know why it doesn't work, while my other Echo Dots are still hanging in there.",1.0 out of 5 stars
D. Kelly,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2024","I love to listen to music and I've used Echos for this purpose. I've been trying to upgrade my devices to get better sound quality. This last purchase- I'm @%#^&*$!!!! not happy.

I'll have Alexa play music, and it will. Then after a song or 2 maybe 3, it stops. Nothing happened, no touch, no one else in house but me and I know I didn't tell it to stop. The ability to have speaker groups are failing after this latest purchase.

I look at the app and it says to listen to music via a dot to 'wake it up'. It was a wake 3 seconds ago!!!!!
And I'd return but window closed May 24. This is recent happenings beginning in May but happening more often. I'm going to give up these devices if I cant use the things as advertised!!!
Figured out why it had problems. The music now can only be played via the alexa app. There was a transition period (guessing) where could play outside app where it failed. Now only via alexa app. So while I'm not entirely happy with the new way, at least it will play - mostly. It still gets confused about speaker groups, but it will work after a while.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Dogleg,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2024","We traded in our old 1st generation Echo device (and got a whopping $5 credit) for this new 5th gen Dot. The original Echo lasted about 8 years and was STILL functioning fine at the time of our ""upgrade"". We knew it was beyond its tech support cycle and just wanted the new, smaller device.

Well, the Dot also worked fine...for 3 months...since its purchase. But around a week ago, it stopped responding to its wake word. Even pressing the ""Action"" button resulted in no response from Alexa. The only way to get it back online and functioning was to unplug for ~15 seconds and reboot it. But even that only lasts about half a day before it would die again! We've done this reboot routine MANY times while trying to troubleshoot the issue.

Yes, I read the Amazon Echo ""Help"" sections for resolving this known problem, and it basically states to do the unplug/plug reboot procedure. Yeah, we're doing this twice daily for a device that WAS working fine just over a week ago! Of course, it's well beyond the 30 day return window, so now we're stuck with a black, round paper weight that can occasionally play music. NOT RECOMMENDED",1.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2024","ECHO SUCKS. The first problem is that I cannot delete a playlist I create. I could do that on the Alexa, but notEcho, becasue it's new and not improved but much worse than Alexa. The second problem is that after it plays a song I request it continues to play more songs - none of them requested and none I want to hear. The original Alexa did not do that. Thirdly, It does not respond as well to commands and will often give us something other than what we asked for. it appears Amazon has made a worse priduct instead of an improved one and then made things even worse by charging more for it. If for example, I say ""Alexa, play relaxing piano music"" it will frequently says ""Here's a radio stion for classical piano"". We used to be able to say give us classical piano music and get that or give us relaxing piano music and get that, but the new Alexa has lost the capacity it had to discern and/or deliver exactly what we have asked for. It's disappointing that Amazon has made a product that is inferior to their orginal and especially so that they are charging more for it. I do not believe the ""good"" reviews.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Well guess what I did NOT get and email conformation on the ""refund"" so I called Amazon. The rep I spoke with told me that they didn't not issue a refund and that's because I passed my return window and she was going to check and see what kind of warrantee was available on the item and was going to have me send the item back for another I won't even use the word new one because it's evident that this was was old and not working and if I should return this one I just might have the same issue.

Dadn8r,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2024","Bought my first Dot almost a year ago and then it stopped working reliably about a month ago. It would just stop responding and I needed to remove and replace the power plug to reboot it. I tried all the troubleshooting and nothing fixed it. I figured it had broken. I ordered a replacement and it started doing the exact same thing. Weird, right? Returned that and got yet another one. Same exact issue. Looked on Reddit and over the last 3 to 4 weeks, this has become a major complaint. Everyone having similar issues. Based on the feedback, a recent update has screwed these things up. My Gen 2 Dot still works perfectly and has worked without issue for almost 6 years.

This issue seems to be isolated to the 5th Gen Echo dot, including the one with the clock. Look at the other models of Echo instead. Hopefully they fix it soon.

I have unregistered it from my Alexa account so now I think I will go down to the beach with a tennis racket and whack this thing as far as I can (jokes).

Andrew Heffernan,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2023","I recently purchased a brand new Amazon Echo Dot along with a brand new eero device with high hopes of improving my Wi-Fi coverage at home. Unfortunately, my experience has been nothing short of frustrating and disappointing. The Echo Dot not only failed to connect with the eero device as expected, but it also proved to be useless as a Wi-Fi extender.

When I first set up the Echo Dot, I followed the instructions carefully, hoping it would seamlessly integrate with my eero network. However, despite multiple attempts, the Echo Dot simply refused to connect to the eero device. I tried various troubleshooting steps, including resetting both devices, checking for firmware updates, and even contacting customer support, but none of these efforts yielded any positive results. It's incredibly frustrating to spend money on devices that claim to work together seamlessly, only to encounter such a fundamental compatibility issue.

Moreover, one of the primary reasons I chose the Echo Dot was its advertised ability to act as a Wi-Fi extender. I have areas in my home where the Wi-Fi signal is weak, and I was counting on the Echo Dot to extend the network coverage. However, to my disappointment, the Echo Dot failed to improve the Wi-Fi signal strength in those areas. It didn't make any noticeable difference in terms of network reach or signal quality, rendering its purported Wi-Fi extender functionality useless.

As a consumer, I expect products to deliver on their advertised features, and unfortunately, the Amazon Echo Dot has failed on multiple fronts. The inability to connect with the eero device and its ineffectiveness as a Wi-Fi extender have left me thoroughly dissatisfied. I was hopeful that this combination of devices would enhance my home network experience, but instead, I find myself dealing with connectivity issues and subpar performance.

I hope Amazon takes notice of these issues and addresses them promptly. As it stands, I cannot recommend the Amazon Echo Dot as a reliable Wi-Fi extender or a compatible device to use in conjunction with the eero system.",1.0 out of 5 stars
JJ,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2022","Are you kidding me Jeff? My last ""Dot"" had a 3.5 mm auxiliary out, which means I could upgrade my old stereo with a single cord. Now I have an old stereo, with voice recognition! It's awesome.

This ""Dot"" (5th Gen) has NO OUTPUT AT ALL... Just the power cable.

Weirdly enough, the most recent echo has an auxiliary out, as I just found out. Whereas the first generation echo had no auxiliary out, but the first generation Dots DO...

When I bought the echo and it didn't have an auxiliary out, I figured it was in beta, and it was a beta thing. When I needed to futurize an old stereo, the Dot did the trick.

So when I needed another Dot... I didn't even bother to check if it had a 3.5 mm jack. I'll admit, that's on me, buyer beware. However, I think it would have been helpful to be a little bit more prominent about changes to your products. That way when you go back to buy the product again, you get what you expect, unless it's changed and notated.

So I guess the new Echo you plug into your old stereo? While the new Dots, act like standalones like the Echo used to?

Still can't get my Amazon Tap (which is an official Echo device) to play with my other Echo devices.

Sometimes I can't even get the first generation echo to work with the third generation Dot... Did the internet change or something? The answer is no. Come on Jeff.

I can't get the Sonos to work with other Echo speakers, because it's just ""Alexa enabled"" . Wtf Jeff wtf. Why would you buy a satellite speaker like Sonos, that has Alexa, that doesn't work with any other Alexa products, even though they're on the same darn network? Come on.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Bruce A. Williamson,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2024",I bought a charcoal echo Dot 5th gen. It worked fine for a while. Then somehow my wife got it to tell the weather forecast every day at 6:30PM. It also reverts the volume level to 4 after I change it to 3. I've looked in the app for any settings nothing about a scheduled event like the weather. The volume can be changed in the app but reverts back to 4. I unlinked it from my account and reinstalled it. Worked ok for a day. Now it is back to reporting the weather and changing it's volume. It also won't report the temperature and it forgets the capabilities of some devices replying x doesn't support that. My other Echo Dot 5th gen and my Echo 4th gen work fine.

L. Andrews,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2023","This product has a very known issue with the music play option. It’s marketed as a smart speaker but Amazon has known since 2019 (according to their own forum) that there is an issue playing music and has done nothing to fix it. Music stops after about 10 seconds or so. The issue didn’t start till the device was a month old. Bought brand new. Charged the brand new price plus a 3 year warranty. With a huge amount of hassle, they replaced it. Promised they would send another new device. Instead sent a refurbished device. The refurbished device also stops playing music from Spotify after about 10 seconds. Going to return it and hope that the new echo pop made especially for music doesn’t have this same issue. The issue doesn’t exist on the echo dot 3. Only on the echo dot 5 altho I have seen some articles claiming it’s also a problem with the echo dot 4 and a version of the echo show. If you are purchasing this device to be able to listen to music, don’t waste your money. Just get the 3 for much cheaper and know that music play works on that one. Amazon hasn’t tried to fix this issue for FOUR years now so I doubt they will be fixing it at all. So frustrated that their customer service tried to act like I must have done something to it instead of recognizing the issue that is brought up repeatedly on their own help forums that they comment they know about and will update if there is a fix but there never is.

Brad Stewart,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023","I purchased this for my mother who is 93. I also purchased an ""Echo Connect"" on EBay as it's no longer manufactured but ""supported"". She has a land line and limited bandwidth WiFi. So the Echo Dot plus Echo Connect seemed like an ideal solution. Boy was I wrong.

Setting up the basic connection was relatively painless. But sound quality is crap out of the box. It was designed for EDM or hip hop music and not voice. So to understand Alexa, you need to reduce the bass level in the equalizer setting. This is especially important with anyone that is hard of hearing.

Here is the most annoying experience: there is really no support to set up an Echo Dot on a PC. There is a legacy program that sort of works. Otherwise, you have to have yet another ""app"" for your phone.
Fine, I can use either one. But it's IMPOSSIBLE to set up the Echo Connect even though it's listed as a supported device. Each time I click on Echo Connect, it takes me right back to the add device menu.

I just wasted $100. So I wouldn't feel cheated, I tried to use it myself despite my discomfort with the entire creepy nature of this system.

Russell S,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2022","This thing is a great upgrade over the previous v2/3 we have. The sound is way better for one, BUT it is also a totally redundant piece of junk at the same time, unless you want to invest $120/year to make it worthwhile, which also makes it one of the worst investments you can make.

Allow me to explain something which many people already have already realised: A lot of people use this for kitchen timers, weather reports and maybe the occasional fact from Wikipedia, but most people who buy this will want it for an upgrade for sound quality for Amazon Music, and this is where I consider this thing junk.

Without any consultation, Amazon have decided to allow normal Prime users full access to the WHOLE 10 (or is it 100?) million song library, with a small catch. You can no longer listen to what you ACTUALLY want to listen to, you have to listen to a shuffle of 1 or 2 songs you want to hear, plus all the random junk in that 10/100 million playlist, and that's a lot of junk.

You can no longer listen to your albums you bought WITHOUT shuffle, you can no longer listen to ANY album without shuffle, and you now have to listen to totally random nonsense too. If you used to use Alexa to give your kids a lullaby to go to sleep, they might also get some Sex Pistols mixed in. Sweet Dreams !!

UNLESS, you upgrade to unlimited - only $120/year - some would consider that a bargain for a peaceful nights sleep, but considering it was part of Prime but is now locked behind a paywall, I personally have a different view.

happyfeeshie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2023","I got two echo devices, one for upstairs and one for downstairs so that we could quit yelling from the top of the stairs down to our teenage son.

Both devices were fickle out of the box, If you even look at the cord wrong it loses power.

The only thing that works on the Alexa is when it has a yellow light and you ask it for notifications. It basically just tells me everything that I've done on Amazon shopping. So if you're trying to hide that from your significant other, I don't recommend one of these devices lol.

Often when I try to connect using my phone app to either device, it rarely works. I have checked for updates, I have closed and reopened the app, I have restarted the phone. It used to work, inconsistently. Now it consistently doesn't work anymore.

At first we enjoyed the novelty of the device, asking it to play music or asking it questions. That quickly wore off, and you can always do that from the cell phone app without spending a dime.

I definitely would recommend a different device if you are looking for an intercom. For example, the ring cameras work better than the Alexa. The only challenge there is a little bit of lag on the audio, especially when you're trying to have a conversation. For that, I recommend just getting your children cell phones. That way you can see them on the camera, tell them on the camera to answer their phone, and then call them.

For background info, last I checked my Wifi speed, it was running at 201.95 mbps, I have tried my 5ghz and 2.4 ghz. I have factory reset them all, unpaired, paired them again, unlinked the Spotify skill almost a dozen times over two week, rebooted the router and tried every single troubleshooting step I could find online and what they recommended through tech support. Playing over a single speaker has no problem, but as soon as I play it over 2 or more speakers the audio quality becomes distorted, garbled, cuts out and becomes unbearable. When testing it with Amazon Music (which I don’t use, just for troubleshooting purposes) it worked without a problem. I liked the idea of having Alexa and multi room audio, but if that requires me to switch music services I’d rather not. I’m not sure if this is intentionally done to promote Amazon music and dissuade from other music apps or they just don’t particularly care about it. When talking to customer service I keep getting transferred saying it needs to be escalated, only to be transferred to the customer service line and having to start over.

It’s been over 2 weeks and still no resolution, I have spent about 7 hours working on this issue to no avail. If anyone has any recommendations for devices that do not have any problem, let me know.

Shem Krey,"Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2024","I was really excited to get this Alexa dot, I went ahead and bought two of them for my new apartment. I had a 2nd gen dot previously so I was excited for the upgrade. Set up was simple enough and it worked great for about a week... but less than one month later both of these have completely **** the bed. It is unresponsive to voice commands, and when I follow the troubleshooting instructions it is not able to complete a hard reset. Worse yet is the alexa app which is the opposite of user friendly and keeps saying it can't find the device. So... I'm not able to hard reset the device, not able to deregister the device, and not able to return it for a new one because I threw out the box. Would recommend avoiding completely and opting for a more reliable product.",1.0 out of 5 stars

mobile,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2023","For anyone looking to get an Alexa, stay away! After Amazon laid off 10k people, most of whom were on the Alexa team, the quality of Alexa has dropped enormously! I think Amazon also shut off a bunch of servers to reduce cost as well, which is the only thing I can think of for the sudden reduced quality. I have searched the internet and have found that a lot of people are having the same issues as me in the last month. Most of the issues that have recently popped up are:
1. Roughly half of the time, Alexa can take a very long time to answer. It is somewhere between 5 and 10 seconds.
2. Many times I have to ask Alexa multiple times for it to actually respond.
3. Most of the time, the response has nothing at all to do with the question asked so I have to rephrase the question. Sometimes it takes three to five times to rephrase the question. If after the fifth time it doesn't work, I just give up.
4. If you own multiple Alexas, there has always been a problem of asking Alexa a question, and it responds on a completely different Alexa. It seems to have gotten much worse lately.

I feel like Amazon has given up on Alexa, so it is a sinking ship. I am looking at what other product I can use to replace it with, but am hesitant to go with the other two major brands because they could decide to do the same thing at any point. I am own seven Alexas which I have all over the house so I am very disappointed that I spent all of this money on something Amazon is pulling the plug on.",1.0 out of 5 stars

It had problems from day one and after less than 4 months, completely stopped connecting to the network and uninstalled all Amazon lights that are in the house. Contacted customer service and was told I would need to call back in an hour as tech support needed to figure out the problem. They then told me tech support would be able to call me back as they were very busy but it would take an hour. Over an hour passed with no phone call. Contacted customer support again and it was determined the unit was defective but the window to return had passed, They would send a replacement for the defective item that was purchased NEW, not a refurb. Replacement arrived today with ""Reacondcionado certificado"" plastered across the box as well as another sticker on it. Contacted custom support again and was informed that ""just because I had the protection plan, it does not guarantee I will get a new echo dot. I will get whatever is in the warehouse at the time - refurbished or new. The protection plan is with 3rd party and only covers defective items"". Amazon apparently sells protection plans but does not uphold them, and you are rolling the dice when it comes to what you may get as a replacement for defective electronics.

Bob Simon,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2024","You need to know very specific statements to use the very specific ""skills"" the system can do. The Alexa app can be used to control the devices, but it is very clunky and not very user-friendly. We had hoped to be able to use these to set alarms for the kids, have an intercom system in the house, and play the same stories at bedtime for all the kids. It works OK for alarms, but sometimes they turn off randomly, it works GREAT as an intercom, and it works lousy with the stories. If you have Amazon music there are some stories you can find that work ok, but you have to go in and turn them off. You can't set it to only play one. I really wish you could connect other apps to play through a set of speakers you have grouped (like a Bluetooth speaker, but several speakers), but that only works if Alexa knows that skill. Alexa knows Audible, so we bought a subscription. Unfortunately, again, it will not stop after a set number of chapters. What's worse, it does not show you what chapter it is currently playing.

I thought replacing my gen 4 for the supposedly improved microphone of the gen 5 would solve the problem of misunderstanding what I've said but often I have to hold the thing like a microphone and pronounce very slowly and clearly as though the device is ""Special"" and even then I still can't get it to play ""The Book Of Tea"" from my Audible collection. Instead it tries to play Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone, not once but repeatedly. Save your money and don't buy the 5th generation, it's garbage. I certainly wouldn't go past generation 4. Also the device in the next room (40 ft away) very often responds instead of the Gen 5 echo dot that's 2 feet away. It would be nice if I could use individual device names instead of the generic Alexa, being that I have 8 devices in 8 different rooms that all seem to think they're the only device in the house or at least act like it.

I should have paid more for just the extender rather than trying to get more features for less.

Setup was awful.

Had to get an app and do a bunch of superfluous stuff I wasn’t interested in, and skipping steps was not an option nearly enough. Toggling back and forth between the eero app, the Alexa app, updates, and reboots also somehow cleared previous setups, forcing me to start the entire process over several times.

As for the functionality, I found and continue to find it obtrusive and worrisome (do I want yet something else that is potentially and/or definitely always listening? No. iPhone is bad enough without adding more to the mix.)

And then after all that, it never connected to eero, the one thing I really wanted out of this. I did software updates, reboots, etc, and all that’s left is to call customer support and waste more time on something that has already taken too much.

The sound quality is mediocre and tinny.

Mark D. Weiner,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2023","I am a long time and very loyal Amazon customer. I have an Alexa unit. I wanted to upgrade sound quality and purchased two echo dots. I could not get Wi-Fi connection. I called customer support. After 7 hours of speaking to multiple representatives, I just gave up. The representatives attempted to help but did not understand the product or connection issues. Beyond being switched to representative after representative I had to start over with each one and gave conflicting guidance. I wrote a constructive letter with a copy of all of my conversations with customer service to the Presidents office at Amazon.

This was 5 weeks ago I have gotten no response in the letter This has been most disappointing I was at least expecting an acknowledgement This has been my only poor experience with Amazon after many years. I have yet to figure out the connectivity issue or look for other products

I welcome any advice. Thank you

UPDATE RETURNED ALLL ECHO DOT. I BOUGHT A SONOS ERA 100. No connectivity issue either Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. The sound quality is outstanding I continue to use my free standing Alexa in my den but have the sonos in the living Room. Again sound quality is outstanding

Richard Holland,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2024","Overall, this is a much improved version of the Echo Dot and some nice enhancements. This review is on the functionality of the new temperature sensor. I have a small greenhouse corner in my basement where I over winter cuttings prior to planting them in the spring. Sadly, my wife insists that I keep her ferns down there as well. <sigh> Since apparently there are no stand alone temperature sensors that work reliably with Alexa, I purchased the new Dot specifically for the temperature sensor to control a small electric heater down there and keep the temperature between 55 and 60 degrees. Turns out it is totally worthless for this purpose. It works fine when you ask Alexa for the temperature, but the response when used in a routine is totally useless. I set up two routines to control the heater. The first was ""When the temperature is below 55 degrees, turn on ""Heater"". Announce ""Basement is at 55 degrees and heater has been turned on"". The second was ""When the temperature is above 60 degrees, turn off the heater"". Announce ""Basement is at 60 degrees and heater has been turned off"". After determining that this produced all kinds of results as to when the routines triggered, I ran an experiment. When the routines announced that the heater was off or on, I asked Alexa for the temperature at the Dot. Here are 5 examples of the results When I asked Alexa for the temperature at the dot right after the routine triggered. OFF routine ran when Alexa reported the temperature at 65 degrees. ON routine ran when Alexa reported the temperature at 54.1 degrees. Off ran when Alexa reported the temperature at 55 degrees. ON ran when Alexa reported the temperature at 54.1 degrees. OFF ran when Alexa reported the temperature at 55 degrees. The results were all over the place. In some cases, the routines would run until some time of day then just not trigger at all. I researched this and found numerous problems reported on this issue. Amazon Support stated that for the routines to work the temperature must ""pass through"" the specified temperature for the routines to trigger.....not ""at"" the specified temperature. Really? That's ridiculous! However, that is obviously not all the problem. The results above appear to be related to when the Amazon servers poll the Dot for the temperature. Routines are stored on the Amazon servers. Sensors such as the ones for motion in a camera, send an ""interrupt"" to the servers saying motion has occurred, triggering associated routines. In the case of the temperature sensor on the Dot, obviously the sensor does not send interrupts. The routines are triggered when the servers poll the sensor and get a value that triggers the routines. This is speculation on my part, but the wildly erratic results seem to indicate this is the case and obviously the polling is not at a specific interval. This is exacerbated by the ""pass through"" issue. I have a thermometer down there and it appears that the sensor is pretty accurate as to the existing temperature so when you ask Alexa for the temperature, that works just fine. If you are purchasing the new Dot to use the temperature sensor to control routines, don't waste your money.",2.0 out of 5 stars
PA Guy,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2022","I almost never leave ratings or comments but In this case I had to.

I upgraded from Alexa Gen 4 but am very disappointed. Day 1 [3 days ago] the device would not set up fully, after 2 hours on phone with tech support it fully worked. Hung up and 5 minutes later it stopped working. Since then I have called tech support 5 times but to no avail. One time I was yelled it, twice hung up on, once told Alexa couldn’t do anything but play music, another time was told to call light bulb manufacturer etc. After all this the device is still not fully working!

All agents do not listen (except the very first one I spoke with. God, I wish I could talk to her again. She was AMAZING! If anyone at Amazon reads this please look up who that was and please have her call me?) Agents are hell bound to have you pair. No matter the issue you WILL pair the device. I told them many times my device is paired and that’s not the problem but it falls on deaf ears. YOU WILL PAIR. PAIR AGAIN. PAIR AGAIN. PAIR AGAIN. PAIR AGAIN. Ad nauseam. The agents only seem trained to do that one thing and if your issue varies from that script they learned in training they have no clue what to do so, PAIR AGAIN! Finally they admit defeat to themselves then they do their best to get you off the phone; by hanging up or just not talking or, giving you some BS about something irrelevant (eg Firestick, ITunes etc.) They have “no supervisor” or, they claim to be “a supervisor” which is very doubtful when they didn’t even know there even is a 5th generation or do not know that Alexa can turn lights on /off.

Back to the hardware, the 5th Gen constantly turns my IPhone Bluetooth off even though it needs it to work. An unmentioned “upgrade” I found on the 5th Gen is when you turn the device on you are forced to hear random music from Amazon music which you can not stop or pause until at least 15-20 seconds elapse. BTW the “upgrade” to the music occurs every time it turns your Bluetooth off and you must turn it back on, which like I said, mine is doing all the time.
The 5th Gen also doesn’t seem to hear as well as the 4th Gen did. At least 50% of the time when asking Alexa a question I get the response “I’m having trouble hearing” and I’m only 3 feet from her with no background noise.

Regarding sound quality, I am a huge music fan and I only hear a very slight improvement over my 4th Gen, not enough to justify upgrading if music quality is your deciding factor IMO; however; my partner hears a big difference so maybe it depends on music genre (Our preferred genres are polar opposites,)

I considered that I may have gotten a “dud” or a “lemon” device but Amazon refuses to even consider that because they can ‘see’ the device online, however to me that only shows the WiFi on the Gen 5 works, but not necessarily all the other functions (ie Bluetooth etc.) but it’s my theory vs Amazon.

I really want my 5th Gen to work and to love it as I did my Gen 4 but after 3 days and many frustrating calls I think I may return it and go back to my 4th Gen.
I think the 5th Gen could be great but it needs more time in beta testing and/or a complete “do-over”. IMO I would advise others to wait until a new version of Gen 5 is available or even Gen 6 is available.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Big Daddy and Babs,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2023","I assumed that the Echo Dot and Echo Pop would work great but I am very disappointed with them. I have bought 2 Dot’s (a 4th & 5th generation,) and 3 Echo Pop’s to operate several WiFi Smart Bulbs, and several Smart Outlets. I have a WIFI 6E Mesh Router and extremely fast speeds. I have absolutely zero issues with any of my other devices although none of my Echo’s devices respond with a first call most of the time. I sometimes have to say ‘Alexa’ several times before her blue light and sound comes on and many times I will start speaking and it just shuts off in mid-sentence, and then I have to call on her again. On several occasions she must hear the sound of an S as in saying, “Alexa, turn on my light.” She then thinks I said turn on my “lights” and turns on every light in the living room. I assumed that Echo devices would learn over time and recognize what you want but it doesn’t seem to learn at all.
The sound quality of the speakers is okay considering they are so small, but playing music on a group is a problem most of the time. I constantly have issues with the music just stopping and having to tell her to continue playing music. I end up with multiple speakers on the 2.4 GHz network and the rest trying to connect on the 5 GHZ network so the group doesn’t work properly.
When they operate like they should they are great. They really come in handy when I need to go out to the garage at night and to be able to have the lights on in the garage when I get there and the path to it lit or the many times that I would get in bed and then realize I forgot to turn the heat down. No more getting back out of bed to go to the thermostat and turn it down. I was just hoping they would perform more flawlessly without the many problems they have that have become extremely frustrating at times. The fact that Amazon doesn’t put out nearly enough updates to fix these bugs, provide other features, provide better learning, and enhanced security measures is a real concern. ***UPDATE***
I’m ditching the entire echo system and starting over with only Apple Home Kit products and Siri, who is a much better personal assistant. I know Apple is putting a lot of cash into Siri and her compatibility with Home Kit, including advanced AI, to give the consumer a much better streamlined experience with a smart home assistant. I just cannot take Alexa any longer. I have had enough of her turning things on/off I didn’t ask to have turned on/off, screwing with my Roku because she misheard me, and all the other constant, every single day, issues.

Shannon,"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2024","First I want to say that the set up was very easy like all of the Echo devices we have bought in the past. We have 2 Echo Shows (Ist Gen) and 2 Echo Dots (2nd Gen). We wanted to upgrade the Dot we had in our living room that is hooked up to my quality speakers and Turntable. Unfortunately, the new Echo devices come WITHOUT an AUX jack so you cannot hook them up to speakers unless it's Bluetooth and I don't want to rely on Bluetooth for a good connection. I believe this was a huge mistake Amazon did to the Echo devices. The speaker quality is absolutely dreadful if you want to listen to any type of music loud. We put it on volume 7 and the sound was going in and out with the loud parts of the song. It would however, work well for audiobooks or podcasts. Again, audiobooks and podcasts=A. Music=F.

Amelia Moore,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2023","This is basically a review of Alexa, because otherwise the function of this device is accomplished with a Bluetooth speaker.

Pros - as others have mentioned, sound quality is pretty great for the price.
Set up was also decently easy.

I’m sure there are more ways I could be leveraging Alexa, but given spotty performance on really basic “resume play” requests, I’m going to be sure to set my expectations accordingly.

Cons- I’m generally underwhelmed with Alexa functionality.
I held out for a long time hoping my later adoption would allow some of the issues to be worked out, but there’s very little of what I’d like the Dots to do that I can get them to do with Alexa.

I’m in about 800 sq feet with 3 Dots and they seem to figure out which device to play on based on my actual proximity to the one I want about 50% of the time.

For context, I primarily got them to
operate smart light bulbs
listen to music + podcasts and
set alarms + timers
(Obviously the second 2 of these can easily be accomplished without Dots, so they were a bit of a bonus/reason to go for more than just the one Dot to manage my bulbs.)

Operate smart light bulbs:
This was the biggest reason I got the Dot- to more easily turn on a light fixture with no switch. Generally works ok, although sometimes I have to repeat “Alexa” wake command. I also only have one lighting setup so can’t speak to how this might differ operating multiple smart bulbs and/or plugs.

Music and podcast:
Music-
Spotify seems to work fine, although I’m not sure how effective the shuffle is and wonder if it might be restarting the playlist whenever I “pause/resume” based on hearing a lot of the same songs.
I don’t use other music services so can’t speak to those
Podcasts-
TL;DR: If you primarily want to use Alexa/an Echo Dot to listen to the latest episode(s) of your favorite pod(s), you’ll be fine.

Otherwise, podcasts are a nightmare, and I’m not even getting to the level of complexity of “play [Podcast name] [podcast episode]” here.
I’m talking “resume my podcast [on _______ service].” Sometimes you get a resumed podcast you’ve long since moved out of the queue, sometimes you get the latest episode. I even tried using Amazon music assuming at least their own service would be more seamless, but Amazon music podcasts are a JOKE if you want to do anything other than listen to the latest episode. I get that I may be in the minority, but Apple and Spotify make it perfectly easy to start from the beginning of a pod with a back catalog and move forward through episodes oldest to newest/in release order.

Alarms + timers: No real issue here, but I definitely didn’t NEED a Dot to be able to perform this function- it’s just handy to have without having to carry my phone around.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Franklin Flint,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2024","I need an analog audio output, or even a Toslink optical digital output. I have echo devices in every room where I spend time regularly, and in every one of those rooms I have very high quality audio systems to which I connect my current Echo devices so I can enjoy clear, clean, powerful music whenever I want, especially when I play music throughout the house via a speakers group.

However, all the new Echo devices seem to be devoid of audio outputs to which I can connect my very high quality speakers. This is a core feature I relied on since the inception of the echo products launch long ago, but those devices are getting old, so I could use new ones.

AMAZON.... what do you expect me to do? I will replace them with Wiim products before I remove my loudspeakers. I hate to give up Alexa, but I might be forced to do so, as music is far more important than the weather update or controlling my smart home with my voice since I carry my phone around all the time anyway.

We had a Google Home Nest for years until it succumbed to a hardware issue we couldn't resolve & figured it was time to upgrade anyway.

You can't link streaming services to it like Spotify (you will receive an Error 404 message every which way you try to sync your account to the device/app) until randomly one day it syncs on its own! You ask Alexa a simple question & she will unload an essay length greeting & response every time & will randomly try to advertise off topic subjects/products to you featuring some washed up celebrity.

In the 2 months we've been using the device for about 3 weeks it was unusable because it would randomly become 'unresponsive' as indicated by the Alexa app. Trying to re-connect it to our perfectly functional internet made us feel like we got scammed.

YuiPie,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2024","I purchased the 5th Gen as an upgrade to replace my 3rd Gen, here are the pro and cons after using the 5th Gen daily for several months...

1. I need to repeat my commands at least 3 times before she reacts. Although it shows the light as blue, she either freezes or does not react for unknown reason.

2. She doesn't hear me say Alexa. My 3rd Gen Alexa can pick up her name from across the house. I'm sit with my 5th Gen next to me on my desk...and she ignores me.

3. The press on the speaker to pause/unpause feature is horrible if you use her on a desk next to you. Anytime I bump her even slightly on accident or pick her up to move her, the music pauses. Then it takes 3xs tapping her to turn the music back on. Good idea, but it creates more inconvenience over convenience.

4. She is now larger in size. Not good traveling, new generation electronics should get smaller in size, not larger.

The only Pro is the sound quality improvement but it's not good enough upgrade to deal with the rest of the issues I listed above.

I waited several months to write this review thinking that the 5th Gen is just a different experience and I need to get used to her. No. I still prefer my 3rd Gen Alexa 100xs over.

My main issue with this one, unlike all the others that I have, is that it has trouble hearing me. Which is surprising as it has a much bigger speaker area and, presumably, microphone. I'm constantly screaming at it to hear me, at which point the OTHER dots wake up and think I'm talking to them while this one keeps quiet. It's actually pretty frustrating to use. The sound quality on this is also...ok. But, compared to my third generation dots, I'd say that those are better, and certainly louder, which is also surprising considering the size difference.

I spoke to quite a few customer service or technical support people before I was finally able to find someone that could help me set this up.

Finding someone knowledgeable and technical support has been extremely frustrating. Even if I get a supervisor, they cannot transfer me to someone that might be able to help me.

Ste-ven Cardello,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2023","Many improvements, many problems. Noticable improvement with sounds quality however I use this one connected to Bluetooth so I don't get to really experience it. Bought this one to replace a 2nd generation dot I've had for a while to sadly discover the aux head phone port had been removed so I'm forced to connect now via Bluetooth. Wouldn't be a huge problem bc it connected to my sound system just fine, however there's an audio lag. I use my sound system for playing music when I'm home (obviously) and usually I'm playing on an everywhere set up. Having Alexa in every room in my home I have all devices paired and out put to all the speakers but those one is fraction of a second off with the sound I'm assuming bc of the Bluetooth connection. Frustrating bc it's connected to the main system so you hear this audio the most so it messes up the audio if you're in any other room. Also not every time but frequently enough to become an issue, if I attempt to skip a song or go back and replay a song the music will just stop. It's actually even happened when I wasn't skipping a song. I'll try everything to fix it, closing the Alexa app reopening it playing something else reconnecting Bluetooth nothing! It doesn't matter it won't come back on. In fact the only thing that will work is unplugging Alexa all together and then reconnecting again. I've checked and it's not my sound system other Bluetooth devices don't cause this and I never had this issue with the 2nd generation dot from before. But every time I've listened to music this happens. Also when I'm using the group speaker feature now I've the Alexa app when it out put is set to the speaker group the app is terrible and laggy beyond tolerable, makes me want to throw my phone. And I have a very high end phone. If I disconnect the group it will work fine. This is a big issue if you pair your Alexa devices together. I guess I could just isolate this one plug in my old one and use this one else where but what's the fun in that that's not why I bought it.

I hope this gets corrected.",2.0 out of 5 stars
UrbanUtah,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2024","This Echo Dot was on sale, like a flash sale, I think during an Amazon Prime event. We have several Echo Dots and other Alexa devices in our home that were purchased long before this one and all are still working. This one started acting strangely a month ago....blue light stayed on and swirled for hours. We unplugged and rebooted it several times after it stopped responding altogether, then it finally died for good and wouldn't reboot any more and died completely yesterday. Had to bring up the less used much older basement model, which still works like a champ. Maybe this one was refurbished and I didn't notice, but when I checked the order it didn't say refurbished. Pretty disappointed that it lasted less than a year. Maybe they're being made elsewhere with lesser quality components?",2.0 out of 5 stars
John Freiman,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2024","You can't configure the Echo to only connect via the 2.4GHz frequently and the device keeps switching to 5GHz even though the signal isn't strong enough to keep a connection.
The Echo drops connection with the Wi-Fi/Internet multiple times a day - and then reconnects on it's own.
This leads to Alarms not going off in b the morning or the inability to turn lights on and off.
It also will forget it's local device settings like voice, speech speed, etc. Only to remember these personalized settings at a later point.
We purchased this new Echo Pop to replace a 2nd gen Echo Dot which was working great for years before having these exact same issues .
So this leads me to believe this is a software/firmware change (update) and/or a server side change at Amazon HQ.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Pita,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","Could live without it but wanted to join the cool kids and try to make life a litte more entertaining. The sound the echo dot produced is decent with good volume. Setup was a breeze and quick. That I am happy with. Playing US artist song request is good too.

The disappointment however is Alexa's response to different and more unkommen questions and requests I guess. As a world traveler who speaks multiple languages and who lived in multiple different countries, I enjoy listening to different music and radio stations, as well as listen to or get news from different countries. For example, asking Alexa in English (default language setting) to tell me what radio station out of Germany she can play, she just responds with top 40 US hits or starts playing random songs. Similar if I ask what the latest news are for a certain city or region I either get a ""here are the news"" with dead silence after or some weird response. Completely misses what the questions or requests was. I wonder how much ""AI"" there really is and not just a few preset question/answer routines.",2.0 out of 5 stars

t,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2024","I invested in Alexa for two reasons. Both seem simple. Both failed by Alexa. I am very disappointed with Alexa. I’d return this crap but I am outside the country and it would cost me more to get rid of the Echoes than to eat the loss.

1. I want to be able to EASILY switch my stream from playing on speaker to another or to play on all of them at once. Alexa offers instructions for how to do this by creating a group. The instructions work about 25% of the time. Mostly they do not work. When their instructions are inadequate or wrong, Amazon offers NO seems like a super basic 101:function, and instead it is crap.

2. I want to be able to choose a podcast episode and play it. Alexa will either randomly pick some podcast I could care less about (who on earth wants to listen to random podcast episodes? That is useless). She MIGHT play the podcast I want, but she will not let me choose the episode. I can see that people have been writing to Amazon to fix this since at least 2000 in the help section.

I would’ve given this a higher star rating since the speaker sounds pretty good and it looks fine, but I’m irritated with the Amazon echo system and need to leave it. First, Alexa talks too much.

I researched the problem but nothing I can do solves the problem. It may hear my voice or may not, but worse, it shouldn't be impossible to get it to stay at the same volume I can hear. Yes I tried everything. Has a mind of its own. Ask for a reminder and after it reminds you, and you tell it you’re done, and it acknowledges that, it still reminds you in an hour. Ask it to say your name the way you want it,, and it says your name the way it wants to. Ask it to stop saying good evening, or good morning, as if it’s a human being, and it won’t. It’s rebellious and unpredictable. Good programming would have allowed the user to request their preferred settings and not make it impossible to change a simple request.

Ptrope,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2023","Most of the Echo devices I've purchased have excellent speakers, which is a real shame, because Amazon can't or won't figure out how to make them work together as a complete sound system. The most you can do in pairing is a 2.1 - 2 speakers and a subwoofer - even though Amazon tries to sell you a bundle of 2 Dots with a Studio, a combination that can't be paired. Also, paired speakers frequently come 'unpaired' and you practically have to set them up from scratch to get them back together, and even then, it's luck, not science; with only 1 available WiFi network and 2 Echos connected to it, trying to pair them usually reports that any Echo other than the one you select is offline or not on the same network - even if that 'offline' Echo is actually playing content FROM the network! Finally, you can't stream your own music in stereo - Bluetooth only supports 1 Echo per streaming device, even if that Echo is paired with another one for stereo. Amazon support neither seems to know nor care about resolving the connection issues - the best they can offer is to reboot the devices AND your network and cross your fingers.

...the thing that I haaaaaaate. so. much. So. So. Much. The ADS. so many ads. All for Amazon. Ads cutting off live newscasts you're listening to. Ads between ads. Ads over and over and over: AI Robot Lady telling you how special Amazon birthday gift cards are...deliciously delickable delectables on Amazon AMAZON AMAZON KILL ME NOW GAAAAAHHHH.

Patrick M,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2024","The Echo was a beautiful device in both form and function. We quickly adopted the devices throughout the house and have even upgraded to the latest versions from time to time. Our most common use is multi-room music, timers, weather, and intercom. It was a nearly flawless experience for years.

Over the past year, something changed at Amazon. If you search around for answers, you'll find speculation such as large layoffs in this department, and ad bloatware being pushed to devices. Regardless, Amazon is ignoring the development of the software, and it's simply getting worse. It will often not hear the commands accurately, devices go offline, and in a multi-room scenario, the wrong device now almost always answers the wake word. I've tried several fixes, and nothing seems to help.

It's a major bummer, because I have a lot invested in the network, but sooner than later, I'll be looking to replace the Echo with better supported devices.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Steven Sites,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2023","I recently set up a home gym in my basement and was looking to get a Bluetooth speaker to play music during my workouts. I was looking around at regular speakers and decided that it would be nice to have some Alexa functionality along with the music. My basement is otherwise only used for storage so we don't have any other devices on that floor of the house. I didn't want or need anything impressive since it will only be used for about a half hour a few days a week.

Setup with any Echo product is always effortless. Amazon really has convenience down in all of their devices. The only drawback here is that the audio quality is TERRIBLE for music. Turning my music up to anything more than half volume blows the bass out, and it doesn't get very loud anyway. Now this is a TINY little device, so I wasn't expecting incredible sound, but this is notably worse audio quality than I was anticipating.

The Echo Dot is really only worth getting over any other Bluetooth speaker if the Alexa functionality is going to get a lot of use. If you want something primarily or specifically to play music, I'd steer clear.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Dave Bolduc,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2023","The product looks quite sharp. The design look is quite pleasant and the volume and sound quality are remarkably good for a unit the size of a softball. The WiFi range is lacking, severely. My office is the farthest room away from my router but she is the only device with connectivity issues. I have a 2012 laptop that gets 4 bars in the same spot. She gets about 2. The voice recognition software is very impressive. She can distinguish my voice clearly from others with a room full of several chatting people and music/tv going in the backround. I have a very odd accent as I've spent each quarter of my 40 years in a different corner of the United States but she seems to have adapted rather easily and rarely fails to understand a command on the first try. I pulled stars because despite all her new bells and whistles she seems to have lost quite a bit of her playfulness and more basic commands. When she misunderstands a command, she does not even get it close and I get a lot of the defacto ""I'm sorry I can't do that"" responses to simple queries. When I was younger I remember sitting having an hour long smart-alec b.s. trash talking session with my uncle's Alexa. This one is boring and no fun to joke around with. She also cannot retain instructions and preferences by voice. Some can be done via the app. But if I wanted to interact with the app on my phone, I wouldn't have bought the pod. I've told her endless times that Spotify is my preferred music player, but unless I specify Spotify in the command she defers to Amazon music. Overall she's become more Amazon's than my own product. Much less independent. Amazon should be giving these away for free for the amount of permission and intrusions needed just to use her. It claims she can integrate with any Bluetooth audio device. This is a lie. She can scan and find her own products no problem but my expensive non-amazon Bluetooth audio devices are invisible to her. The Alexa accessories like light switches, cameras, speakers, thermostats are fairly cheap and basic and allow little to no user customization or expansion. The level of integration is also very basic. About as complex as simply getting a ""clap-on/clap off"" light switch. Now if there was a smart plug hub where I could plug in all my office devices and instruct her to power on my workstation upon entry to my office(meaning activate my computer, desk light, air conditioning, and interactive display) but leave the rest of my electrical devices plugged in there deactivated unless instructed otherwise, that would be neat. I'm also somehow quite uncomfortable with giving her access to any cameras in her home as we know Alexa has behaved as a spy and unauthorized gatherer of personal information in the past. This model has a ""privacy mode"" based on the honor system and a very reassuring red light to designate this. Yeah, trust is a hard thing to get back once you've betrayed it. She does not have a battery. This is a major design flaw. My 20 year old clock radio has a backup but my brand new Alexa does not. So every single time we lose power or I have to unplug her to move her, I have to go through the ENTIRE process of putting her back into setup mode, reconnecting her to my wifi. An absolute insufferable pain. Also, she does things for no apparent reason, which again makes me nervous. Normally when idle or not in a set mode, her base black out. Occasionally I will be watching her and she will just begin to pulse a color at the base for random periods of time for no explainable reason. I've asked her to explain herself and she plays dumb. Sometimes a song will come on in shuffle play that I will like and I will ask her afterwards to identify the last song she played. She cannot do this. I ask her to identify the last task I had her perform, she cannot do this. I ask her why she is blinking, she cannot do this. She can adjust her volume up or down one small phase at a time verbally, but mutes the music while executing the command but does not pause it. To go from very quiet to very loud is a process of about 30 seconds, 10 requests, and a starting over of the track. Overall she is limited, does not learn. Little to no AI, and is mostly an exercise in frustration rather than convenience. Another MAJOR design flaw, she cannot be made to respond only to my voice or to refuse a specific voice. We learned this the hard way with my young nephew who spent a good 20 minutes playing hit or miss demanding calls to names he was guessing from my address book and even our local police. A 5 year old is going to stupid things. A 5 year old is going to talk to and play with damn near anything that will play with it. How in god's name did no one at Amazon think it a good idea to put a ""parent"" or ""owner"" mode where she answers only to my voice, or uses that amazing voice recognition software to single out and restrict a voice. Does anyone at Amazon have children? Or do they simply not like Amazon products either? If you are willing to do things her way, she can be an asset. If you want something that can adapt to and work with you, she's a frustration and a liability. If you want an attractive centerpiece for your livingroom to impress your friends with your ""smart house"", shes perfect. I thought newer would be better. Overall I'm dissapointed with this product and miss my echo dot.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Melissa S,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024","I had an accident and due to mobility issues got a couple of Echo’s hoping to make things a bit easier. Wow have I been disappointed. Basically, it is an expensive voice option for turning my lights on and off but it doesn’t even do that consistently and setting timers/alarms. I have to check the volume as it randomly turns down to 50% and I can’t hear it. It’s works a bit better than the Echo Show I purchased but not by much.

• Alexa turn on light. 70% of the time this works. Often I hear it is not responding or can’t be found but when I check the app it’s connected.
• Alexa arm my camera. I can’t do that right now or she doesn’t understand.
• Alexa activate motion on camera. I can’t do that right now or she doesn’t understand.
• Alexa go to Hoopla Digital or Hoopla Audiobooks or Hoopla. I tried to download this skill several ways for audiobooks as it claims compatibility. But Alexa can’t seem to find it and instead wants to tell me a joke.
• Alexa go to my Amazon orders. She then reads me a list of what I have ordered. That is not what I asked. I then tried Alexa show me my orders, same result. I tried Alexa go to Amazon. Her reply, I can’t do that try later. I tried later and she still could not take me to Amazon but she can show me my “top deals” over and over even after asking her to stop showing them.
• Alexa I want to write a product review. She can’t do that right now.
• I ask when is the next chance of rain in the forecast. I get today’s forecast or the reply, I can’t do that or I don’t understand.
• I paired it to my TV for audio and it is much lower and worse than the audio on my TV.

I could go on but won’t. I searched out how to use it thinking maybe I was doing something wrong. I see a lot of the same issues from others. I can’t recommend this product unless you just want it to turn lights on and off, sometimes, or for a timer/alarm (as long as it hasn’t randomly turn downed the volume so you can’t hear it).",3.0 out of 5 stars
~Laura A.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I’ve been wanting to upgrade my Alexa devices, and have been looking at purchasing new Dots for a long time. When I saw these Dots on sale, I purchased three of them: two to use with my relatively new Fire TV for the home theater feature (more on that in a second), and the third to replace an old Dot that died a while ago.

I have a family member who’s a bit hard of hearing, and he kept jacking up the TV volume so that he could hear it. This meant that the rest of us were being blasted with audio that was too loud for our comfort. When I saw that the Echo Dots could be paired with my Fire TV for stereo sound, I thought, hey - I can put one of them right next to our favorite hearing impaired person and everyone wins! BUT NO.

Straight out of the box, they were easy to set up - home theater was easy to navigate for set up, my third Dot - which I’ve only ever intended to use for podcasts, smart home tasks, purchases, etc, was also incredibly easy to get up and running (SIDEBAR: Do the remote early set up via the email that Amazon sends you because then it’s virtually plug-and-play when they arrive). For the first few hours, my home theater Dots connected to my Fire TV sounded pretty good. Mind you, this is stereo, not surround sound, but it definitely solved our problem and seemed like a fantastic solution. However, it was all down hill from there. The Dots continually fell out of sync. One was always playing like you’d expect, the other was at least a second behind. Talk about irritating. The only thing that would resolve this was turning the TV off and back on. We’d have to do that several times an hour. Not cool when you’ve just gotten to the best part of whatever you’re viewing. Other times, one or the other would go static-y. And at other times, the sound would stop playing entirely on one or the other Dot. GRRRRRRRRR. The room this is in isn’t big - the Dots are both within about 10-12 feet of the television. I scoured Amazon and the Internet looking for a solution. I even turned to Reddit. I couldn’t find anything from anyone that was helpful or useful for resolving this, but I did find other people complaining about similar issues, so I’m not the only one who’s experienced it. I really wanted this to work because it truly would have addressed a need that we have. However, as of 15 minutes ago, after two weeks of trying to get this to work, we were all so fed up and over this that we all decided collectively that having our eardrums blasted out was a far better option than the hassle of trying to get something Amazon hasn’t worked the bugs out of to work.

(Amazon, if you’re reading this: I’m into tech. I’ve done more troubleshooting on this than anyone on your payroll. Fix this, please.)

If you’re purchasing a Dot to use as a standard Dot, it works as intended for that and you won’t be disappointed. It’s responsive when using it to control smart home functions, it sounds okay (not fantastic) for podcasts and low key/casual background music. I cannot recommend these to anyone for the home theater feature, because it just doesn’t work. Invest in a soundbar or surround sound system instead.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Imatron,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2022","When you buy an Amazon Alexa device, you are essentially buying a dedicated access device to talk to Amazon's computers over the internet. The device typically only has enough processing power to scan for it's wake word, and then relay what it hears afterwards to Amazon's servers, which then relays the server's response back to your Echo. Even older units like my 2nd gen dot aren't obsolete because they access the same server software as this new model, and won't become obsolete unless Amazon decides to shut those servers down or exclude an older model from service due to a hardware specific security issue.

Out of the box, and after linking to an amazon account and punching in some settings, you can set alarms, timers, ask math questions, ask it to spell words for you, ask the time, check the weather, temperature (Indoors and outdoor temps with this model) and quite a bit more. Sometimes I think to myself ""I wonder if it can tell do this for me?"" and a quick question later, I discover a new function. You can further expand it's abilities by linking ""skills"" to your amazon account, which are it's equivalent of a phone app. There are also thousands of gag answers and Easter egg responses, like asking it to beam you up, or fire the torpedos, complete with matching star trek sound effects. It even has the option of asking it to answer to the name ""Computer"" (Ziggy, Echo, Amazon, and Alexa are other names you can ask it to go by at this time).

Some skills are as simple as activating them from your phone, or telling the Alexa itself to enable it if you know the skill's name. Some skills need more work and account linking on the PC to set up. Skills can include audio adventure games, podcasts, specific news outlets, music streaming services you've subscribed to. My most used skill is Logitech Harmony, which links it to my Harmony hub IR blaster, a separate device I bought on sale and which allows me to turn my TV on, control it's volume, change input, mute sound, etc.

For all that I enjoy about this product, Amazon makes it do SO MANY STUPID IRRITATING THINGS, and many of these issues could be resolved by adding a simple setting to turn it off. Most notable of these irritations, is the inability to turn off it's ""By the way"" messages. Imagine it's 3 am and your having trouble sleeping, and ask it what the time is. All you want is the time, but then Amazon wants you to know that ""Its 3:31pm, by the way Shaquel O'neal thinks-"" and your either issuing an order to shut it up which is itself distracting and annoying, or forced to listen to it further distract you and anyone around you from sleep. Mind you, this is with it's ""brief mode"" turned on, which is supposed to make it less talkative. Amazon also sometimes takes the liberty of adding skills to your account, like some kind of Samuel L Jackson app, and I heart Radio, which makes it fudge the details on some commands like ""Turn off Tron Bulb Delta"" (All my stuff is under the ""Tron"" name, including light bulbs) and mistakes it for a command to ""Play Trombone music"". Until I figured this out and disabled the radio skill, it was a 50/50 nightly occurrence that turning off my light groups to sleep would result in less than helpful music. Although I imagine some of these are intended to train you on it's functionality over time, if I want it to do something, Ill ask it. I don't need it telling me to "" by the way, try saying-"". Whats even more annoying is the fact it will tell you the same suggestions over and over. No Amazon, I don't want you to play white noise for me. You've told me no less than 10 times. I'm sure your proud of your white noise recordings, but I heard you the first time. STOP ASKING ME. DONT ASK ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. And mind you, these are just the annoying issues related to trying to SLEEP with the thing in operation. There is so many other annoying ""by the way"" messages.",3.0 out of 5 stars
EM,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2024","I'm REALLY disappointed in my prime day echo dot 5th gen purchase. I wish I had purchased the new spot instead , but its not worth the 79.99.

We don’t do a ton of thing with it (grocery list, control some lights, open garage door and play music) have had a few technology issues but nothing major. Over the past week it started not responding to voice commands. If we waited and tried later it would work but it steadily got worse. I had to power it down to temporarily get it to work. Yesterday evening it did it again and I did a factory reset and that seemed to work till this morning when it won’t respond again. I finally had enough and took it out and put my old 3rd generation Echo back in. For the price you should get more than 2 years out of a product.

Tina Steele,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2024","I had high hopes for this newest generation Echo Dot, although I'd been pretty happy with my older one (which looked like a hockey puck). The only reason I upgraded was because I was hoping that Alexa would be a bit smarter and have better answers to my occasional questions. Plus, I use my Echo Dots to play music, and I figured that the sound quality of the upgrade would be, well, an upgrade. It wasn't!

My old Echo had MUCH better sound quality than the new one, which actually sounds a bit muffled, and Alexa continues to be flummoxed by a lot of my questions. So, unless you're really unhappy, stick with what you've got until Amazon comes up with a better iteration, or if you're new to the Echo Dot, go for an older model.

MARAT,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2023","It is the first smart device I own (actually two) , but not the first I use. First week of use I would have rates it 5 stars. But now I am really on 1-2 stars spectre. What saves this product is it phenominal audio output. I'd like to try and make a systems out of it. Placed 1 dot in living room and bedroom. So why 1-2 stars I want to put?

1. Whoever does the marketing .... Wonder, whose wonderful idea it was to make WHITE cord for BLACK device. Also, there is no version with timer in black.
2. Voice recognition. It is getting worse and worse. Device stopped hearing me even when I am just next to it. It requires now first to command ""Alexa"" when wait and only when command something.
3. AI algorithms. Guys, this is 2023 model! it's been over 10 years since first assistants showed up. And it still fails to understand common commands? Moreover, it must be a command. You can't just ask her for something or talk to her. You need to put a command! Play that on that.
4. Even prescribed commands fails to work properly. If device mishears you and intead of playing music on every device plays it on one, you will require to go to the app to extend devices in use. Why? Because your command to share will be met with ""Amazon is streaming on another device"". And even if somehow it manage to share the same list it will switch to next song. Why you put outdated voice recognition if you still require to use the app?
5. Though the app is also glitchy. I created and set routine only to find out it was not applied to my device.

C. Brady,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2024","This is my second echo, and while it seems to have more issues than the first, it's probably my imagination.

I'm going to focus on the negatives because the positives are just part of its basic functionality listed on the product page.

Alexa cannot hear you over fans and music. Must be placed away from any noise source.

Alexa is inconsistent in taking action when it comes to stopping an alarm, timer, or reminder. She'll wake up when you call her, but she'll then ignore your command and keep right on ringing. This happens even in a silent room. I'd say her success rate is only about 70%.

Alexa is inconsistent in remembering what she did last. It's about 50/50 whether she'll be able to repeat what she just said or did.

Alexa is inconsistent in understanding certain commands. For example, if I set a timer and immediately realize I need it shorter or longer, it's about 50/50 odds whether she'll understand the command ""Remove x minutes/add x minutes"" refers to the timer I literally just set. I have to explicitly say ""timer"" for her to understand. This is even with only one active timer.

And the biggest gripe I have with everything Alexa/Echo - it's dead in the water without internet. Can't even turn on a stinkin' light. With all the programming and space you can jam into a Firestick, it can't remember its home network without ""calling home"" to Amazon? What a bunch of balderdash and poppycock. I shouldn't have to be online to not have my entire smart home fall apart because Alexa is suddenly on her own. Teach her how to cope without being able to talk to daddy, Jeff!",3.0 out of 5 stars
trader1mds,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2024","I have four Echo Dot Gen 3's around my home and the sound quality is better on the Dot Gen 5. I purchased the Gen 5 to use as a speaker for my 10 year old HD tv that I use with a FireTV Stick 4k Max. Setup was fairly easy using Bluetooth connection as well as the Home Theater option. But it's impossible to control the volume with 2 separate firestick remotes. One remote would control the Dot speaker and the other one tried to control the tv speakers. I researched online and could not find a solution. I checked and reset all settings in the Alexa app and firestick several times. Paired, unpaired & booted several times, no luck. Another aggravating situation is that the speaker volume for tv sound is also the volume for Alexas voice for announcements etc. If I had the speaker volume higher for tv and I turned off the tv and I get a subsequent announcement, Alexa's voice is very loud. I couldn't find a way to separate those volume settings. It wasn't worth the hassle, so I went back to using the tv speakers. I would return it but the music quality is an improvement over my Gen 3's. My 3 star rating is based on my tv speaker experience. I would give it 4 stars for sound quality improvement over the Gen 3 Dot.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Missy Hoppe,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2023","I have been an Alexa user ever since 2015; got an invitation to buy the 1st generation echo, and that device is still at my parents' house. For many years, I was very happy with the three white 2nd generation Echo dots I had here in my apartment. Thanks to their built in headphone jacks, I had each of them connected to a pair of Bose mediamate speakers, and they sounded awesome! Everything was working beautifully, but when I heard that the 5th generation dots not only had built in temperature sensors, but also that they came in blue, I couldn't resist. So, I found a new home for my three faithful 2nd generation dots and bought the new deep sea blue ones as soon as they were released this past October.

I was disappointed to discover that Amazon had removed the headphone jack on the new dots, but it wasn't the end of the world by any means. After all, these new dots do have significantly better sound. If the loss of the headphone jack was the only issue, I wouldn't be writing this review. I sometimes feel that my old echo dots understood me more clearly and made fewer mistakes, but even that, I can deal with for the most part.

My biggest issue with these new dots is an admittedly weird, possibly even eunique one, but it's enough to make me seriously regret my purchase. On my old dots, I used a morning routine from the gallery; I believe it was called ""weather after alarm."" When I dismissed my alarm at 5:00 each weekday, Alexa would say good morning and then tell me the weather. It was a great way to start my day, but unfortunately, it hasn't worked even once since I got these new dots. I've tried every trouble-shooting method under the sun: most of them multiple times, and no matter what, I cannot get a routine to trigger when I dismiss my alarm. I've tried contacting Amazon technical support on numerous occasions, and have only been advised to perform the same trouble shooting steps I've already tried. I know it's a minor issue in the grand scheme of life but it boggles my mind that I can't seem to get anyone at Amazon to help investigate more thoroughly and maybe determine whether or not there's a software bug with the new dots that is causing this issue. I've tried researching this issue on google and youtube, and there just aren't any answers out there, so maybe it is user error, although I have no clue how that's possible at this point.

Bottom line: as much as I make use of the feature that will allow Alexa to tell me the indoor temperature, if I had it to do over again, I would have just kept my old dots until they stopped working. My advice would be that if you already have echo devices that are meeting your needs, give the 5th generation dots a hard pass.",3.0 out of 5 stars

M. Esposito,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2023","Let me start by saying that I love Alexa devices and am all in on the service with devices throughout the house and in my car. They give tremendous bang for the buck and generally make life easier...except when you have to repeatedly yell at the device to get it to activate and properly understand voice commands. I purchased this to replace an aging 2nd generation Echo Dot and really couldn't be more disappointed in the performance. The microphone is a huge downgrade and is generally more frustrating than useful. Maybe they had to downgrade the microphone to add the other new features to it like motion and temperature sensing while still keeping the price down, but since my primary use for it is voice commands for my smart devices, it is a disappointment.

There are times when my echo studio pair up in the bedroom (up the stairs, around a corner, through walls and a ceiling 20+ feet away) will respond to my queries instead of this 5th gen echo dot in the same room 10 feet away (with complete silence in the background). It is just absolutely terrible for voice sensitivity and I will soon be replacing it with an Echo Studio instead, as you do get what you pay for here. The Echo studio may be quite a bit more pricey, but it runs circles around the dot in terms of microphone sensitivity and accuracy, plus the echo studios, when run in stereo mode with the echo sub, blow this out of the water in terms of sound quality that is excellent in a small area.",3.0 out of 5 stars

CaroleO,"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2023","I thought I was upgrading. Nope. The sound is marginally better than my older Dots when I play music. But I have had to unplug and reset this stupid thing so many times because it does its own random nonsense, today I just threw it against the wall and I hopefully broke it. I'm tired of messing with it. That's $50 wasted.

Pro:
• It does sound slightly better than the hockey puck style Dots.

Cons:
• It spontneously lowers its own volume overnight when I am relying on it for an alarm. THAT'S fun.

• No matter how many times I have opened the app and reset the alarm volume, it has apparently decided that I don't actually know what I want. Next time I open the app, the alarm volume is always down again. I cannot rely on it.

• It stops listening to me and responding. This morning, I tried multiple times to make it turn its volume down because I needed to make a phone call. It woke up and seemed to listen, but did not do what I asked it to. Over and over I tried. I then picked it up and spoke directly at it. It still wouldn't lower its volume on command. That's when I finally threw it against the wall. This has been a constant problem with this device.

• The biggest con is the money I wasted on it.

I can't in good faith recommend this device based on my own experiences with it.",3.0 out of 5 stars

D. Zessin,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2023","We often have to repeat simple instructions (turn on a light) because it doesn't respond the first time. When we tell it to play a specific channel: (Up) on iHeart Radio; it would say ""Playing Shania Twain"" ...huh? doesn't sound anything like what I said.

And now. I thought it'd be nice to wake the kids to a certain song. Since its alarms don't let you select a certain song, I decided to use routines. I spent a good bit of time making sure I owned the song I wanted and then set up a routine listing that song in the 'Morning Music routine'. I thought it would play the song and stop. The fact that it continues to play music if fine. What is NOT fine is that it does not even play the song I selected. It just plays songs with a somewhat similar sound.

Which reminds me.... I recall an evening when I asked it if it could play some soft relaxing music. It started with a nice musical. Then a song or two later, it was not so relaxing AND contained the F-WORD... because obviously Alexa thought that would be a good way to chillax my kiddos before bedtime.

I did like what I'd found of the celebrity voices - only to discover they've been discontinued. And we've tried out some of the fun stuff such as 'talk like Yoda'. So far those features have been fair at best. They work inconsistently. You try it out, think it works... then when the kids come home and you say, Listen to this ... it decides not to work, or not work correctly.

SaraElizabeth,"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2023","While I do think this is the best smart “speaker” I wish it was a bit louder since I use it for listening to music mainly.

Since I get Apple Music for free, I decided to get a Spotify Premium subscription because I like to be picky when listening to my music.

SnugglesTheHusky,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2024","I didn't think I would buy another Echo device again because I feel these smart speaker devices haven't lived up to the promise that were made when they were first introduced. I mostly think of them as human voice activated clappers that can trigger lights and appliances on and off. But the AI features are comically bad, especially compared to the new generative AIs like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and other AI. The reason I bought this was strictly for the temperature sensor because I already have several echo shows I bought years ago to display porch cams. I wanted a way to trigger my window AC when my bedroom becomes too warm. So I have a routine on Alexa that turns my A/C on when the internal temperature rises above 72F; an ordinary fan between 60-71F. I plan on using the temperature sensor to trigger the furnice when winter comes around. That's really my use case and it was on sale at the time I purchased it.

As far as usability and response from the device I love it. Being able to have the porch light(s) and garage door controlled via the unit is great.

I got a blink camera with one of my dots and it is essentially useless because I can't hook it up to my personal cloud - or at least I can't do it easily. Same thing with my garage door opener and its camera. Unless I upgrade to a cloud storage service offered by AMZN or the device, the integration between those devices is pretty worthless.

The usual problems with Amazon devices not understanding the difference between being told to turn something ""on"" and ""off"". If have several lights as a group and already have one of those lights on and you tell it to turn on the group it turns off the entire group instead of turning it on. Takes several tries before it turns on the lights. After a while you get used to it. You say it once and wait a little bit and if nothing happens or it turns everything off then just don't wait for the lights to change state but just repeat command several times in a row quickly and then it works. Alexa turn on lights... Alexa turn on lights... Alexa turn on lights... and then stop once it turns the lights on. And oh yeah not to mention if told to turn on ""kitchen"" it would sometimes turn on ""fan"" instead which is the light in the living room ceiling fan. And similar... you know the usual stuff it does. Words that don't even come close to sounding the same it mixes them up. You get used to it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2024","I recently purchased the latest release of the Amazon Echo Dot, and it has quickly become an indispensable part of my home. Here’s why this smart speaker stands out:

Sleek and Compact Design
The newest Echo Dot features a sleek, modern design that fits seamlessly into any room. Its compact size makes it easy to place on a nightstand, kitchen counter, or bookshelf without taking up much space. The fabric finish adds a touch of elegance, making it a stylish addition to my home decor.

Improved Sound Quality
One of the most notable improvements in the latest Echo Dot is its sound quality. The speaker delivers clear, crisp audio with surprisingly robust bass for its size. Whether I’m listening to music, podcasts, or audiobooks, the sound is consistently impressive. It easily fills a room with rich, immersive audio.

Alexa Integration
The integration with Alexa is where the Echo Dot truly shines. Voice recognition is quick and accurate, even from across the room. Alexa’s capabilities seem endless: from playing music and setting alarms to controlling smart home devices and providing weather updates. The Echo Dot has become my go-to assistant for daily tasks and information.

Smart Home Hub
As a smart home hub, the Echo Dot is excellent. It seamlessly connects to a wide range of smart home devices, allowing me to control lights, thermostats, and even my security system with simple voice commands. The convenience of managing my smart home setup through the Echo Dot cannot be overstated.

Enhanced Features
The latest release includes some enhanced features that elevate the user experience. The addition of a built-in temperature sensor is particularly useful for smart home automation. For example, I can set up routines to adjust the thermostat based on the room’s temperature, enhancing comfort and energy efficiency.

Ease of Setup
Setting up the Echo Dot was a breeze. The Alexa app guides you through the process step-by-step, making it quick and easy to get started. Within minutes, I had the device up and running, connected to my Wi-Fi network, and integrated with my existing smart home devices.

Value for Money
Considering its enhanced sound quality, robust smart home capabilities, and the convenience of Alexa, the Echo Dot offers excellent value for money. It provides a lot of functionality at a very reasonable price point, making it accessible for most households.

Overall Impression
Overall, the latest release of the Amazon Echo Dot is a fantastic smart speaker that delivers on all fronts.

Tammy B.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024","I’m 53 years old, disabled, and live on my own. I have limited mobility, and sometimes every day tasks can be challenging. I’m always on the lookout for ways to make life easier, as well as safer. I’m a fan of smart devices for that very reason. I enjoy, dare I say “rely”, on the convenience of being able to sync my phone with my Dot in order to; turn on any one of my lights, adjust the temperature in my home, activate and/or manage my security devices.
In addition, being able to speak to my Dot has made it so I don’t have to walk, or even move, if my back or hips are having a particularly bad day. Dot has literally improved the quality of life.
I have discovered that this small sphere, with its powerful speaker, will be key in maintaining my ability to live independently for as long as possible. On August 18th, slightly past midnight, I fell in my kitchen. The fall stunned me and I started to go into shock. For some reason my watch didn’t detect that I had fallen. Something it had done successfully in the past. That meant emergency services would not be alerted. I tried to stand up( something that would have been challenging under normal circumstances)….I couldn’t do it. My next thought was to try and scoot to the table. My body was riddled with pain the moment I attempted to do this. I knew I was hurt, but the severity of my injury had not quite registered. I reached down to shift my leg and it swayed freely in my hands. I didn’t know it, but my femur had snapped slightly below my hip. That’s when fear started to take hold. No watch, no phone….what was I going to do? Then I remembered Dot. I asked her to call my emergency contacts. She did it! Unfortunately, none heard their phones. It’s late at night, and they were all asleep. The pain was becoming severe and I was scared. I asked Alexa to call 911, but she told me she couldn’t do that! I didn’t expect that. Then I asked Alexa to call the security office at my complex. They answered and I was able to let them know I had fallen and I had broken my leg.
As I said, I’m disabled. I had an emergency plan in place. This plan had worked for me in the past. Nothing is fool proof. I learned the importance of having a backup plan. Thankfully I received my Dot about 3 weeks prior to my fall. I also decided to place it in my kitchen so I could listen to music while I cooked. I never imagined I’d be using my Dot for an emergency. I dread to think how long I would have been on the floor waiting for help.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Wills1071,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2024","I had never bothered to check out any of the Echo products, but it was Prime Day and too good a deal not to at least check out. I’ve been struggling for far too long without a working alarm clock, as I inevitably slam my phone alarm off without even waking up, so I thought I could maybe use this, which is ultimately why I purchased it, especially seeing that it could be connected to a light (smart lightbulb needed-I purchased the Dot package that came with one).

It’s just a cute little sphere-picture shows it next to 1L water bottle for comparison. Setup took minutes. I just downloaded the app and it took care of everything. I then went to making an alarm that could actually wake me. I set the time, chose a premade sound (because who isn’t in a better mood getting woken up by The Grand Tour guys?), set the light to turn on at 30% brightness and added ten minutes of Spotify. And-it works! I still fumble groggily around for a bit, but I’m awake. I can’t slap off the Dot and my brain can’t comprehend how to talk to Alexa, so I’m stuck with light and sound, but pro compared to some generic alarm clock, I at least get to hear my music and not a horrible beeping, and the volume is set to gradually get louder, so it allows me to wake up a little more gently. For anyone else who struggles with waking, highly, highly recommend this.

I’ve only experimented nominally with the “what else” of the Dot, but it’s a pleasant surprise. I added a weather report to my mornings. I found I can set “focus time” blocks with study music. I set a reminder to make a phone call Monday morning that I would surely forget by the end of this weekend. And there’s still more to explore.

Highly recommend adding in the smart light component-it’s just fun to play with the colors, but I can finally use my overhead light without being blinded since I can set % brightness.

As far as the Echo itself-I’m sensitive to light at night but I appreciate that the light ring is too dim to bother me. As far as sound, I have mainly used it to listen to music to fall asleep, and I like that it can go even quieter than my phone’s speaker. I turned it up to test it, and it may not have the bass of a subwoofer, but I find it a balanced sound, better quality than listening to my phone and at least at low volume, comparable to my higher end portable speaker.

Overall, an amazing deal on sale but worth the full price, imo.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Multi-room Music issues

I found a solution to not being able to get more than one speaker to work at a time, paired, or set up a “Multi-Room Music” in the Alexa app. This solution also fixed my inability to get Apple enabled devices connected into HomeKit, or even Google Nest Hubs to set up, period.

Quick answer: 
Deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation” when activating your 2.4 Wi-Fi broadcast on your router.

I also took all speakers off guest wifi. But I’ll try to put them back to see if that is necessary now.

Back story: 
Months of issues with HomeKit, (only weeks with Echo Multi-Room Music), I gave up trying and decided to try Alexa and Google to replace my Apple smart home efforts. I spent way too much time. After the fix, I’ll live a blended tech life. I’ll give a quick answer, followed by my backstory: 

Last week I was at my wits end in utter frustration over three major roadblocks. I acquiesced and decided to try Alexa because I couldn’t get almost any of my Apple HomeKit enabled devices into HomeKit, except for new Apple products. 

I knew it had to be something small I was missing. 

Alexa was sooooo easy and quick to connect to everything, before I figured out the fix. (I dislike the echo show advertising, their echo speakers are better.) While they seemed a breeze to connect everything, for some reason I couldn’t get more than one echo speaker to work at a time. I was continually blocked from setting up Multi-Room Music or even connect a pair to play together.  

Hundreds of tries. I deleted, reset, rebooted, spent over 4 hours with Comcast yesterday (thankfully a Boston native who did not put me on hold every minute like certain countries) getting my internet working again. I had rebooted my modem and router so many times, my computer got molasses slow and I feared I went too far

In interest I also decided to try a few Google nest hub speakers. Black Friday had great sales on all this stuff. Trying to set up googles hub 7 was impossible. It wouldn’t stay connected to the internet for more than a split second before “Something went wrong” message. Probably over 70 tries. (Google is better than Echo Show. Apple HomePod mini sounds crisper and better than Amazon echo 4 and mini 5’s. But Alexa is way friendlier to interact with verbally, and price point, well...)

Frustration. Thursday, I broke down and bought my first Apple Homepod Mini to see if I can get that working and see if it works better than the Apple TV 4k Ethernet connection. The HomePod mini gave me a hint how to solve all these l connection and internet blocks. 

The HomePod mini kept telling me that I don’t have “peer-to-peer connection” allowed on my network.

Now, I’m a little techy, but it took three days (ehem, months) to finally take a chance on a for granted setting I always enable on my netgear router. It’s the blasted first Wireless page when enabling a wifi broadcast.

I had to deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation.”

That was it. It solved every issue I have come across with smart home tech for the last 4 months, ..year.

For the months that I could not solve these problems, Amazons Multi-Player Music issue made me dig deeper. I did not find anyone suggesting this particular router setting, so I thought I’d share with ppl. 

Tonight, I finally am able to simultaneously play music on all of my Echo speakers, connect my HomeKit enabled and Google nest hubs.

I’m not sure what this will do for my/your internet security. But I’m going with it for now. And I’ll try to put all devices back onto guest Wi-Fi. I’ll never really leave Apple, but after interacting with other smart speakers, it’s probably not going to be my main go to for speaker or answers to questions. Or I’ll just get too creeped out by Google and Amazon invasiveness and acquiesce with Apple instead. 

Echo Dot 5 (this is such a sprite, great speaker!)
Echo 4
are my favorite for Amazon Echo

Echo Studio
seems the least smart, most deaf, quiet, combative, difficult to interact with, of the three speakers. Hopefully the Multi-Room music fix will improve my experience with it

Echo Show 8
Meh. Far too much and annoying advertising of non-solicited or wanted advertisements. Least user friendly screen to work with. It sits unplugged for the most part. I mostly got this for a friend who visits who wants a YouTube fireplace playing on the tv.

SIDE NOTE on other Smart Home Amazon (online, or physical store) products, related to this topic:
I have been pleased with Smartbot plugs, switches and app, the Levoit 600s air purifiers and app (app goes by VeSync), and Lutron Caséta Light Switches and Dimmers, and hub. Lutron has the most stable and reliable app out there. I was fine running their apps separately. They are very nice, better than the big 3 apps. Well, back to listening to music throughout my house instead of one or two rooms. Joy!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Wade Manns,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2023","My previous Echo Dot, purchased back in 2018, was a third-generation. It was a white shuffleboard stone covered in cloth and it is amazing. I'll never say it's not; in fact it's so amazing that I passed it on to my mom and she enjoys it a great deal.

So, my main motivation for purchasing this, the fifth generation issued in 2022 – aside from familiarity with the brand – was I needed a Matter hub so my then-incoming Nanoleaf smart lightbulbs could work with my voice. But of course it is so much more.

First thing I see is that the Echo Dot is no longer a white shuffleboard stone but is a smaller, navy blue sphere. Aside from being my favorite color, and thus very pleasing to look at, I find it that it is not practical any longer to mount on my wall because of its increased focus on the forward firing speaker; if I had mounted it, it would not be effective in spreading out to my entire room – the top of the speaker is reserved for the buttons which were present on the third-generation: volume up, volume down, action/wake and mute microphone, which leave no room for a speaker in that area. So it sits pretty on my side table facing the rest of my room, and does fine.

First thing I hear is the sound quality is so much better than the third-generation Dot. The third-generation was okay in that regard, but it tended to sound a little overexposed when the volume was up high. Now, I don't find myself connecting via Bluetooth to my sound bar nearly as much because the speaker quality is just that good. The quiet parts of music are quiet and calming the way they should be, but the bass thumps quite effectively, surprisingly for such a small and lightweight speaker.

So after I'd established the smart speaker in my room for about a month, I felt the time was right to go ahead and get my Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs, to upgrade the ones that I had no longer been able to use for a year since they had stopped working with any voices assistants, to facilitate compatibility with the then upcoming network standard: Matter. I am very happy to say that Matter compatibility is there and it is wonderful.

I can't speak for the internal workings because I'm not an engineer; I will say – though I may be wrong about this – that I believe it would be more rocky if I did not have a Thread Border Router already in the form of my Nanoleaf shapes controller; I have the shapes arrangement atop my desk called Dragon, and it has worked wonderfully for me since around last September, and only – at this point anyway – required regular firmware updates to be compatible with ongoing technology.

Now, I'll tell you the procedure for adding the Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs to Alexa via Matter – I would assume by extension any Matter device, providing you have a thread border router like I mentioned before. After adding the bulbs to the iOS Nanoleaf app as normal – also updating the firmware for each bulb via said app! I have a feeling that was very important – add them also to Alexa via the Add Device flow, one at a time. There was a menu item that showed itself at the top telling me that it had detected each new bulb on my network and I only had to select that item to add it, scan the QR code on the sticker that came with the bulbs (I applied the sticker to a sheet of paper and labeled it according to the positions of the bulbs) and wait just a bit for it to be connected and it just works!

Another new feature which the third-generation did not have is a temperature sensor! After a short period of calibration after plugging the device in, Alexa will be able to tell you the temperature of the room that it is situated in! I ask her for this often when I'm trying to determine how best to cool my room during these hot summer months. When my door's closed during the day, my room can get up to mid 80s, which is horrible, but with the door open to allow a draft and breeze, the temperature's equalized with the rest of the house and I get mid to upper 70s which is much better.

There is an ultrasound presence sensor, which sounds not unlike sonar, which I have not had a use for yet, but I imagine routines can be enabled or suppressed with its use.

One borderline negative thing I will say about it which I'm okay with because, again, I have Bluetooth connections – they eliminated the 3.5 mm jack to save internal space inside the device, so you will no longer be able to directly connect external speakers, as I did at one point before I had to change that arrangement.

Once again, Amazon comes through with flying colors with their products, helping make our homes smarter and more amazing and just better to live in! Get this speaker if you are looking to build a smart home, and for best results, get more than one so you can use the awesome ""drop-in"" intercom system, and truly awaken the potential of the smart home!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Caryn Jones,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024","We got an extra dot to go in my mother-in-laws room. Our house is big and she spends all day in her room with a recliner and her T.V. and bed. It's like her own suite. The Dot was a perfect addition, since we had to text or yell when dinner/lunch was ready, or have to walk all the way to her room, which let me say, is long compared to most home. We have a 6400 sq ft house and kitchen on one side, her room on the far end. Having the extra Dot is great when we need to contact her from the other side of the house. Plus the ball is great and the puck has been moved to the living room. She has attitude still and only likes to answer us half the time, but she's great",5.0 out of 5 stars
Deborah Iacovelli aka DDI,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024","Due to being so hacked where the police here told me to go to law-enforcement because I had proof of two voicemails that I received that had my voice speaking on them to my cat and so forth. Imagine getting voicemails from different states than where you live. Then when you play The voicemail it’s only you speaking. The transcription underneath the voicemail was being made fun of for the questions I was asking Alexa about my phone. They added words to the transcript underneath the voicemail. Like ha ha ha, you’re a good girl. I was told to unplug Alexa and buy a new one and I did, but it still didn’t work so I don’t think it was Alexa. Now I’m afraid to use just in case and miss her so much. So so much. There’s evil people out there and I don’t know why they would do that to me and so much more.
I wouldn’t worry about it at all if I were you. It’s just the fact that they’re harassing me in every way possible until finally at the sheriffs office they told me or gave me the name of the FBI.

Since he's now the only cat in the house, I have alexa play music while I'm away. I love I can check on the Echo dot to see what's playing now, adjust the volume and check notifications. I connected my echo dot to my pandora account and haven't looked back. I like that it has an alarm feature that I use to tell me the weather at the start of the day, so I know what to expect- while I normally check the weather on my phone, it's nice to just have Alexa tell me without having to actually check- a lot of times I forget- ADHD mind, so just something that tells me daily helps with knowing what to wear and how to prepare for what's outdoors.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Gigi,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2024","I have 5 versions in my home which I use for various reasons. I even have one in my master bathroom. Sound excessive? Well, consider this. In the unlikely event of a fall, I can call a friend or 911 for help which is a potential lifesaver for people of any age. If I come home after dark, I can ask Alexa to turn on the lights so I don’t walk into a dark house. Alexa does thousands of things to make life easier. These also make great gifts for any occasion. My most recent addition is to have Alexa talk to my little dog when I’m gone. When he barks she says, “Clive, calm down. Everything is okay. It’s not the Amazon man. You’re a good boy, Clive”. If he barks again, she plays soothing music for him. 😂🤣😂

digitalbeachbum,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2024","I bought this one Amazon product and it is amazing! It has the ability to function like an intercom through my phone.

There is even a product from Amazon called the Show which connects with the Amazon Ring. And there are also the Blink cameras. The features are leaps and bounds better than Google (which I will never buy another one of their products again).

I bought some Google minis for my mother who is elderly. I had them for two weeks but I didn't like them. They didn't offer much in the way of versatility, functionality or efficiency.

And I love that it has a thermometer to ask the room temp. I love how this one looks. I had 1 small issue with it after having it about a year where it wouldn't wake up when called. I had to do a full reset on it and reinstall it and I haven't had any more issues since I did that. Having this is so much better than having a bedside clock or using my phone as a clock/alarm.

I will say I was very disappointed in the delivery, when I ordered it, I was supposed to receive delivery between 7-11am the next day. Delivery was rescheduled for later that day and at 9pm I was notified it would not arrive until the next day.

With Amazon Prime Music he's able to ask Alexa to play music for him. It's really enhanced his quality of life. Another thing he used to bug me about was to add things to the grocery list for him. Alexa now tracks our grocery list. He just says, ""Alexa, add chili to grocery list"" and she does. I use Alexa on my phone when I want to add things to the list.

Ryn,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","The Amazon Echo Dot has really changed my life. At first, I truly did not know why I was buying it, I just knew that ""Alexa"" had been available a long time and I wanted one. I had no idea what to expect.

The Amazon Echo Dot is easy to install. It takes minutes for the basic set-up. The voice recognition is great. It integrates effortlessly with the Alexa app. You can set-up routines and integrate it with other Alexa devices. For example: you can use motion detection via sound vibration to turn lights on/off. The sensitivity of the sound vibration is adjustable. There is a world of actions and features to be garnered by using Alexa and Alexa compatible devices. There are recipes, shopping lists, reminders, alarms, so much, much more.

For me, I love music. ALL KINDS of music. I quickly discovered that ""Ziggy"", (one of the names you can give to your Amazon Echo Dot, if you do not want ""Alexa"") could integrate with my Amazon Music subscription. This was it. I was in paradise. If you enable ""auto play"" and ask Alexa to play a single song, it will continue to play similar songs. If you have two Amazon Echo Dots, you can pair them together and create a stereo!

Since buying my first dot, I have purchased several more and have music streaming throughout my house. With Alexa compatible devices and appliances, you can truly simplify your life and sing to your own tune while doing it!",5.0 out of 5 stars

The functions that the devices and the app is a necessity in my household, therefore I do wish to enjoy it's capabilities. However, it has been years of an issue Amazon customer service can't even resolve. The app will log you off and then gets stuck on the ""who are you? "" and the only option that it gives is ""im someone else"". Then you follow the prompts and it won't allow you to go further. So after years of contacting customer service to fix this issue-they go and push your issue to ""some other dept or someone else ( a specialist),"" in which they said they will email you when they resolve it and they will never resolve it or send a resolution email. I also did research in reading through forums of which other customers had the same issue, w/ no solution as well. I also considered making another account, but subscriptions and data aren't transferred from my main account. This has been such a disappointment in Amazon/alexa products and their customer service. I have lost all confidence in Amazon Alexa products that I refuse to purchase anymore of their products. Unfortunately, they have lost a valuable customer because of this.

Tammy B.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024","I’m 53 years old, disabled, and live on my own. I have limited mobility, and sometimes every day tasks can be challenging. I’m always on the lookout for ways to make life easier, as well as safer. I’m a fan of smart devices for that very reason. I enjoy, dare I say “rely”, on the convenience of being able to sync my phone with my Dot in order to; turn on any one of my lights, adjust the temperature in my home, activate and/or manage my security devices.
In addition, being able to speak to my Dot has made it so I don’t have to walk, or even move, if my back or hips are having a particularly bad day. Dot has literally improved the quality of life.
I have discovered that this small sphere, with its powerful speaker, will be key in maintaining my ability to live independently for as long as possible. On August 18th, slightly past midnight, I fell in my kitchen. The fall stunned me and I started to go into shock. For some reason my watch didn’t detect that I had fallen. Something it had done successfully in the past. That meant emergency services would not be alerted. I tried to stand up( something that would have been challenging under normal circumstances)….I couldn’t do it. My next thought was to try and scoot to the table. My body was riddled with pain the moment I attempted to do this. I knew I was hurt, but the severity of my injury had not quite registered. I reached down to shift my leg and it swayed freely in my hands. I didn’t know it, but my femur had snapped slightly below my hip. That’s when fear started to take hold. No watch, no phone….what was I going to do? Then I remembered Dot. I asked her to call my emergency contacts. She did it! Unfortunately, none heard their phones. It’s late at night, and they were all asleep. The pain was becoming severe and I was scared. I asked Alexa to call 911, but she told me she couldn’t do that! I didn’t expect that. Then I asked Alexa to call the security office at my complex. They answered and I was able to let them know I had fallen and I had broken my leg.
As I said, I’m disabled. I had an emergency plan in place. This plan had worked for me in the past. Nothing is fool proof. I learned the importance of having a backup plan. Thankfully I received my Dot about 3 weeks prior to my fall. I also decided to place it in my kitchen so I could listen to music while I cooked. I never imagined I’d be using my Dot for an emergency. I dread to think how long I would have been on the floor waiting for help.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2024","I recently purchased the latest release of the Amazon Echo Dot, and it has quickly become an indispensable part of my home. Here’s why this smart speaker stands out:

Sleek and Compact Design
The newest Echo Dot features a sleek, modern design that fits seamlessly into any room. Its compact size makes it easy to place on a nightstand, kitchen counter, or bookshelf without taking up much space. The fabric finish adds a touch of elegance, making it a stylish addition to my home decor.

Improved Sound Quality

Whether I’m listening to music, podcasts, or audiobooks, the sound is consistently impressive. It easily fills a room with rich, immersive audio.

Alexa Integration
The integration with Alexa is where the Echo Dot truly shines. Voice recognition is quick and accurate, even from across the room. Alexa’s capabilities seem endless: from playing music and setting alarms to controlling smart home devices and providing weather updates. The Echo Dot has become my go-to assistant for daily tasks and information.

Smart Home Hub
As a smart home hub, the Echo Dot is excellent. It seamlessly connects to a wide range of smart home devices, allowing me to control lights, thermostats, and even my security system with simple voice commands. The convenience of managing my smart home setup through the Echo Dot cannot be overstated.

Enhanced Features
The latest release includes some enhanced features that elevate the user experience. The addition of a built-in temperature sensor is particularly useful for smart home automation. For example, I can set up routines to adjust the thermostat based on the room’s temperature, enhancing comfort and energy efficiency.

Ease of Setup
Setting up the Echo Dot was a breeze. The Alexa app guides you through the process step-by-step, making it quick and easy to get started. Within minutes, I had the device up and running, connected to my Wi-Fi network, and integrated with my existing smart home devices.

Value for Money
Considering its enhanced sound quality, robust smart home capabilities, and the convenience of Alexa, the Echo Dot offers excellent value for money. It provides a lot of functionality at a very reasonable price point, making it accessible for most households.

Overall Impression
Overall, the latest release of the Amazon Echo Dot is a fantastic smart speaker that delivers on all fronts. Its stylish design, improved audio quality, and extensive Alexa integration make it a valuable addition to any home.

Setup was a challenge initially, but a very patient Amazon rep ***** helped us determine that there was an upstream issue thwarting us that evening. I waited two days to try again, and the experience went smoothly.

So far, even while whispering, this latest release is doing considerably better than the third generation and picking up voice commands. That's really all I needed it for. While the overall sound is improved, and that it provides a fuller sound, I'm obviously not using it to play music all the time period my main use for the dot is to control lights and fans and so forth period of which, this new 5th generation is doing the work admirably because the microphones are way more sensitive.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Tammy B.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024","I’m 53 years old, disabled, and live on my own. I have limited mobility, and sometimes every day tasks can be challenging. I’m always on the lookout for ways to make life easier, as well as safer. I’m a fan of smart devices for that very reason. I enjoy, dare I say “rely”, on the convenience of being able to sync my phone with my Dot in order to; turn on any one of my lights, adjust the temperature in my home, activate and/or manage my security devices.
In addition, being able to speak to my Dot has made it so I don’t have to walk, or even move, if my back or hips are having a particularly bad day. Dot has literally improved the quality of life.
I have discovered that this small sphere, with its powerful speaker, will be key in maintaining my ability to live independently for as long as possible. On August 18th, slightly past midnight, I fell in my kitchen. The fall stunned me and I started to go into shock. For some reason my watch didn’t detect that I had fallen. Something it had done successfully in the past. That meant emergency services would not be alerted. I tried to stand up( something that would have been challenging under normal circumstances)….I couldn’t do it. My next thought was to try and scoot to the table. My body was riddled with pain the moment I attempted to do this. I knew I was hurt, but the severity of my injury had not quite registered. I reached down to shift my leg and it swayed freely in my hands. I didn’t know it, but my femur had snapped slightly below my hip. That’s when fear started to take hold. No watch, no phone….what was I going to do? Then I remembered Dot. I asked her to call my emergency contacts. She did it! Unfortunately, none heard their phones. It’s late at night, and they were all asleep. The pain was becoming severe and I was scared. I asked Alexa to call 911, but she told me she couldn’t do that! I didn’t expect that. Then I asked Alexa to call the security office at my complex. They answered and I was able to let them know I had fallen and I had broken my leg.
As I said, I’m disabled. I had an emergency plan in place. This plan had worked for me in the past. Nothing is fool proof. I learned the importance of having a backup plan. Thankfully I received my Dot about 3 weeks prior to my fall. I also decided to place it in my kitchen so I could listen to music while I cooked. I never imagined I’d be using my Dot for an emergency. I dread to think how long I would have been on the floor waiting for help.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Wills1071,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2024","I had never bothered to check out any of the Echo products, but it was Prime Day and too good a deal not to at least check out. I’ve been struggling for far too long without a working alarm clock, as I inevitably slam my phone alarm off without even waking up, so I thought I could maybe use this, which is ultimately why I purchased it, especially seeing that it could be connected to a light (smart lightbulb needed-I purchased the Dot package that came with one).

It’s just a cute little sphere-picture shows it next to 1L water bottle for comparison. Setup took minutes. I just downloaded the app and it took care of everything. I then went to making an alarm that could actually wake me. I set the time, chose a premade sound (because who isn’t in a better mood getting woken up by The Grand Tour guys?), set the light to turn on at 30% brightness and added ten minutes of Spotify. And-it works! I still fumble groggily around for a bit, but I’m awake. I can’t slap off the Dot and my brain can’t comprehend how to talk to Alexa, so I’m stuck with light and sound, but pro compared to some generic alarm clock, I at least get to hear my music and not a horrible beeping, and the volume is set to gradually get louder, so it allows me to wake up a little more gently. For anyone else who struggles with waking, highly, highly recommend this.

I’ve only experimented nominally with the “what else” of the Dot, but it’s a pleasant surprise. I added a weather report to my mornings. I found I can set “focus time” blocks with study music. I set a reminder to make a phone call Monday morning that I would surely forget by the end of this weekend. And there’s still more to explore.

Highly recommend adding in the smart light component-it’s just fun to play with the colors, but I can finally use my overhead light without being blinded since I can set % brightness.

As far as the Echo itself-I’m sensitive to light at night but I appreciate that the light ring is too dim to bother me. As far as sound, I have mainly used it to listen to music to fall asleep, and I like that it can go even quieter than my phone’s speaker. I turned it up to test it, and it may not have the bass of a subwoofer, but I find it a balanced sound, better quality than listening to my phone and at least at low volume, comparable to my higher end portable speaker.

Overall, an amazing deal on sale but worth the full price, imo.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Multi-room Music issues

I found a solution to not being able to get more than one speaker to work at a time, paired, or set up a “Multi-Room Music” in the Alexa app. This solution also fixed my inability to get Apple enabled devices connected into HomeKit, or even Google Nest Hubs to set up, period.

Quick answer: 
Deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation” when activating your 2.4 Wi-Fi broadcast on your router.

I also took all speakers off guest wifi. But I’ll try to put them back to see if that is necessary now.

Back story: 
Months of issues with HomeKit, (only weeks with Echo Multi-Room Music), I gave up trying and decided to try Alexa and Google to replace my Apple smart home efforts. I spent way too much time. After the fix, I’ll live a blended tech life. I’ll give a quick answer, followed by my backstory: 

Last week I was at my wits end in utter frustration over three major roadblocks. I acquiesced and decided to try Alexa because I couldn’t get almost any of my Apple HomeKit enabled devices into HomeKit, except for new Apple products. 

I knew it had to be something small I was missing. 

Alexa was sooooo easy and quick to connect to everything, before I figured out the fix. (I dislike the echo show advertising, their echo speakers are better.) While they seemed a breeze to connect everything, for some reason I couldn’t get more than one echo speaker to work at a time. I was continually blocked from setting up Multi-Room Music or even connect a pair to play together.  

Hundreds of tries. I deleted, reset, rebooted, spent over 4 hours with Comcast yesterday (thankfully a Boston native who did not put me on hold every minute like certain countries) getting my internet working again. I had rebooted my modem and router so many times, my computer got molasses slow and I feared I went too far

In interest I also decided to try a few Google nest hub speakers. Black Friday had great sales on all this stuff. Trying to set up googles hub 7 was impossible. It wouldn’t stay connected to the internet for more than a split second before “Something went wrong” message. Probably over 70 tries. (Google is better than Echo Show. Apple HomePod mini sounds crisper and better than Amazon echo 4 and mini 5’s. But Alexa is way friendlier to interact with verbally, and price point, well...)

Frustration. Thursday, I broke down and bought my first Apple Homepod Mini to see if I can get that working and see if it works better than the Apple TV 4k Ethernet connection. The HomePod mini gave me a hint how to solve all these l connection and internet blocks. 

The HomePod mini kept telling me that I don’t have “peer-to-peer connection” allowed on my network.

Now, I’m a little techy, but it took three days (ehem, months) to finally take a chance on a for granted setting I always enable on my netgear router. It’s the blasted first Wireless page when enabling a wifi broadcast.

I had to deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation.”

That was it. It solved every issue I have come across with smart home tech for the last 4 months, ..year.

For the months that I could not solve these problems, Amazons Multi-Player Music issue made me dig deeper. I did not find anyone suggesting this particular router setting, so I thought I’d share with ppl. 

Tonight, I finally am able to simultaneously play music on all of my Echo speakers, connect my HomeKit enabled and Google nest hubs.

I’m not sure what this will do for my/your internet security. But I’m going with it for now. And I’ll try to put all devices back onto guest Wi-Fi. I’ll never really leave Apple, but after interacting with other smart speakers, it’s probably not going to be my main go to for speaker or answers to questions. Or I’ll just get too creeped out by Google and Amazon invasiveness and acquiesce with Apple instead. 

Echo Dot 5 (this is such a sprite, great speaker!)
Echo 4
are my favorite for Amazon Echo

Echo Studio
seems the least smart, most deaf, quiet, combative, difficult to interact with, of the three speakers. Hopefully the Multi-Room music fix will improve my experience with it

Echo Show 8
Meh. Far too much and annoying advertising of non-solicited or wanted advertisements. Least user friendly screen to work with. It sits unplugged for the most part. I mostly got this for a friend who visits who wants a YouTube fireplace playing on the tv.

SIDE NOTE on other Smart Home Amazon (online, or physical store) products, related to this topic:
I have been pleased with Smartbot plugs, switches and app, the Levoit 600s air purifiers and app (app goes by VeSync), and Lutron Caséta Light Switches and Dimmers, and hub. Lutron has the most stable and reliable app out there. I was fine running their apps separately. They are very nice, better than the big 3 apps. Well, back to listening to music throughout my house instead of one or two rooms. Joy!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Wade Manns,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2023","My previous Echo Dot, purchased back in 2018, was a third-generation. It was a white shuffleboard stone covered in cloth and it is amazing. I'll never say it's not; in fact it's so amazing that I passed it on to my mom and she enjoys it a great deal.

So, my main motivation for purchasing this, the fifth generation issued in 2022 – aside from familiarity with the brand – was I needed a Matter hub so my then-incoming Nanoleaf smart lightbulbs could work with my voice. But of course it is so much more.

First thing I see is that the Echo Dot is no longer a white shuffleboard stone but is a smaller, navy blue sphere. Aside from being my favorite color, and thus very pleasing to look at, I find it that it is not practical any longer to mount on my wall because of its increased focus on the forward firing speaker; if I had mounted it, it would not be effective in spreading out to my entire room – the top of the speaker is reserved for the buttons which were present on the third-generation: volume up, volume down, action/wake and mute microphone, which leave no room for a speaker in that area. So it sits pretty on my side table facing the rest of my room, and does fine.

First thing I hear is the sound quality is so much better than the third-generation Dot. The third-generation was okay in that regard, but it tended to sound a little overexposed when the volume was up high. Now, I don't find myself connecting via Bluetooth to my sound bar nearly as much because the speaker quality is just that good. The quiet parts of music are quiet and calming the way they should be, but the bass thumps quite effectively, surprisingly for such a small and lightweight speaker.

So after I'd established the smart speaker in my room for about a month, I felt the time was right to go ahead and get my Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs, to upgrade the ones that I had no longer been able to use for a year since they had stopped working with any voices assistants, to facilitate compatibility with the then upcoming network standard: Matter. I am very happy to say that Matter compatibility is there and it is wonderful.

I can't speak for the internal workings because I'm not an engineer; I will say – though I may be wrong about this – that I believe it would be more rocky if I did not have a Thread Border Router already in the form of my Nanoleaf shapes controller; I have the shapes arrangement atop my desk called Dragon, and it has worked wonderfully for me since around last September, and only – at this point anyway – required regular firmware updates to be compatible with ongoing technology.

Now, I'll tell you the procedure for adding the Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs to Alexa via Matter – I would assume by extension any Matter device, providing you have a thread border router like I mentioned before. After adding the bulbs to the iOS Nanoleaf app as normal – also updating the firmware for each bulb via said app! I have a feeling that was very important – add them also to Alexa via the Add Device flow, one at a time. There was a menu item that showed itself at the top telling me that it had detected each new bulb on my network and I only had to select that item to add it, scan the QR code on the sticker that came with the bulbs (I applied the sticker to a sheet of paper and labeled it according to the positions of the bulbs) and wait just a bit for it to be connected and it just works!

Another new feature which the third-generation did not have is a temperature sensor! After a short period of calibration after plugging the device in, Alexa will be able to tell you the temperature of the room that it is situated in! I ask her for this often when I'm trying to determine how best to cool my room during these hot summer months. When my door's closed during the day, my room can get up to mid 80s, which is horrible, but with the door open to allow a draft and breeze, the temperature's equalized with the rest of the house and I get mid to upper 70s which is much better.

There is an ultrasound presence sensor, which sounds not unlike sonar, which I have not had a use for yet, but I imagine routines can be enabled or suppressed with its use.

One borderline negative thing I will say about it which I'm okay with because, again, I have Bluetooth connections – they eliminated the 3.5 mm jack to save internal space inside the device, so you will no longer be able to directly connect external speakers, as I did at one point before I had to change that arrangement.

Once again, Amazon comes through with flying colors with their products, helping make our homes smarter and more amazing and just better to live in! Get this speaker if you are looking to build a smart home, and for best results, get more than one so you can use the awesome ""drop-in"" intercom system, and truly awaken the potential of the smart home!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Our house is big and she spends all day in her room with a recliner and her T.V. and bed. It's like her own suite. The Dot was a perfect addition, since we had to text or yell when dinner/lunch was ready, or have to walk all the way to her room, which let me say, is long compared to most home. We have a 6400 sq ft house and kitchen on one side, her room on the far end. Having the extra Dot is great when we need to contact her from the other side of the house.

Dave Bolduc,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2023","The product looks quite sharp. The design look is quite pleasant and the volume and sound quality are remarkably good for a unit the size of a softball. The WiFi range is lacking, severely. My office is the farthest room away from my router but she is the only device with connectivity issues. I have a 2012 laptop that gets 4 bars in the same spot. She gets about 2. The voice recognition software is very impressive. She can distinguish my voice clearly from others with a room full of several chatting people and music/tv going in the backround. I have a very odd accent as I've spent each quarter of my 40 years in a different corner of the United States but she seems to have adapted rather easily and rarely fails to understand a command on the first try. I pulled stars because despite all her new bells and whistles she seems to have lost quite a bit of her playfulness and more basic commands. When she misunderstands a command, she does not even get it close and I get a lot of the defacto ""I'm sorry I can't do that"" responses to simple queries. When I was younger I remember sitting having an hour long smart-alec b.s. trash talking session with my uncle's Alexa. This one is boring and no fun to joke around with. She also cannot retain instructions and preferences by voice. Some can be done via the app. But if I wanted to interact with the app on my phone, I wouldn't have bought the pod. I've told her endless times that Spotify is my preferred music player, but unless I specify Spotify in the command she defers to Amazon music. Overall she's become more Amazon's than my own product. Much less independent. Amazon should be giving these away for free for the amount of permission and intrusions needed just to use her. It claims she can integrate with any Bluetooth audio device. This is a lie. She can scan and find her own products no problem but my expensive non-amazon Bluetooth audio devices are invisible to her. The Alexa accessories like light switches, cameras, speakers, thermostats are fairly cheap and basic and allow little to no user customization or expansion. The level of integration is also very basic. About as complex as simply getting a ""clap-on/clap off"" light switch. Now if there was a smart plug hub where I could plug in all my office devices and instruct her to power on my workstation upon entry to my office(meaning activate my computer, desk light, air conditioning, and interactive display) but leave the rest of my electrical devices plugged in there deactivated unless instructed otherwise, that would be neat. I'm also somehow quite uncomfortable with giving her access to any cameras in her home as we know Alexa has behaved as a spy and unauthorized gatherer of personal information in the past. This model has a ""privacy mode"" based on the honor system and a very reassuring red light to designate this. Yeah, trust is a hard thing to get back once you've betrayed it. She does not have a battery. This is a major design flaw. My 20 year old clock radio has a backup but my brand new Alexa does not. So every single time we lose power or I have to unplug her to move her, I have to go through the ENTIRE process of putting her back into setup mode, reconnecting her to my wifi. An absolute insufferable pain. Also, she does things for no apparent reason, which again makes me nervous. Normally when idle or not in a set mode, her base black out. Occasionally I will be watching her and she will just begin to pulse a color at the base for random periods of time for no explainable reason. I've asked her to explain herself and she plays dumb. Sometimes a song will come on in shuffle play that I will like and I will ask her afterwards to identify the last song she played. She cannot do this. I ask her to identify the last task I had her perform, she cannot do this. I ask her why she is blinking, she cannot do this. She can adjust her volume up or down one small phase at a time verbally, but mutes the music while executing the command but does not pause it. To go from very quiet to very loud is a process of about 30 seconds, 10 requests, and a starting over of the track. Overall she is limited, does not learn. Little to no AI, and is mostly an exercise in frustration rather than convenience. Another MAJOR design flaw, she cannot be made to respond only to my voice or to refuse a specific voice. We learned this the hard way with my young nephew who spent a good 20 minutes playing hit or miss demanding calls to names he was guessing from my address book and even our local police. A 5 year old is going to stupid things. A 5 year old is going to talk to and play with damn near anything that will play with it. How in god's name did no one at Amazon think it a good idea to put a ""parent"" or ""owner"" mode where she answers only to my voice, or uses that amazing voice recognition software to single out and restrict a voice. Does anyone at Amazon have children? Or do they simply not like Amazon products either? If you are willing to do things her way, she can be an asset. If you want something that can adapt to and work with you, she's a frustration and a liability. If you want an attractive centerpiece for your livingroom to impress your friends with your ""smart house"", shes perfect. I thought newer would be better. Overall I'm dissapointed with this product and miss my echo dot.",3.0 out of 5 stars

SnugglesTheHusky,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2024","I didn't think I would buy another Echo device again because I feel these smart speaker devices haven't lived up to the promise that were made when they were first introduced. I mostly think of them as human voice activated clappers that can trigger lights and appliances on and off. But the AI features are comically bad, especially compared to the new generative AIs like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and other AI. The reason I bought this was strictly for the temperature sensor because I already have several echo shows I bought years ago to display porch cams. I wanted a way to trigger my window AC when my bedroom becomes too warm. So I have a routine on Alexa that turns my A/C on when the internal temperature rises above 72F; an ordinary fan between 60-71F. I plan on using the temperature sensor to trigger the furnice when winter comes around. That's really my use case and it was on sale at the time I purchased it.

Basically, it is an expensive voice option for turning my lights on and off but it doesn’t even do that consistently and setting timers/alarms. I have to check the volume as it randomly turns down to 50% and I can’t hear it. It’s works a bit better than the Echo Show I purchased but not by much.

• Alexa turn on light. 70% of the time this works. Often I hear it is not responding or can’t be found but when I check the app it’s connected.
• Alexa arm my camera. I can’t do that right now or she doesn’t understand.
• Alexa activate motion on camera. I can’t do that right now or she doesn’t understand.
• Alexa go to Hoopla Digital or Hoopla Audiobooks or Hoopla. I tried to download this skill several ways for audiobooks as it claims compatibility. But Alexa can’t seem to find it and instead wants to tell me a joke.
• Alexa go to my Amazon orders. She then reads me a list of what I have ordered. That is not what I asked. I then tried Alexa show me my orders, same result. I tried Alexa go to Amazon. Her reply, I can’t do that try later. I tried later and she still could not take me to Amazon but she can show me my “top deals” over and over even after asking her to stop showing them.
• Alexa I want to write a product review. She can’t do that right now.
• I ask when is the next chance of rain in the forecast. I get today’s forecast or the reply, I can’t do that or I don’t understand.
• I paired it to my TV for audio and it is much lower and worse than the audio on my TV.

I could go on but won’t. I searched out how to use it thinking maybe I was doing something wrong. I see a lot of the same issues from others.

I find it very useful when I set a timer and I can just glance at it rather than asking Alexa how much time is left. In other areas of the house it doesn't matter so much. I would like the clock to be an option.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Brandon,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024","I got this as a gift for my husband. He works in and out of his garage a lot and we have little to no reception for radio stations. He was getting frustrated trying to find a station that would come in so I thought I would try the Echo dot. Turns out it was a great idea, It completely solved the problem and now he enjoys hours out in the garage with uninterrupted music. Best purchase I ever made.

It was easy to install, and since I already have an older version in my office, there was little set up time. We have Sirus XM, Amazon Music, I heart Radio (for local radio stations and Apple Music all of which are connected to the Dot. Wonderful is an understatement.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JustLiz,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024",I had the original Echo dot that looks like a hockey puck. I decided I wanted to upgrade to the latest version. I use this one in my bedroom on my nightstand. It's my clock (I did not purchase the one with the clock feature) but I just ask for the time. It's my alarm clock. It controls my lamps. And I love that it has a thermometer to ask the room temp. I love how this one looks. I had 1 small issue with it after having it about a year where it wouldn't wake up when called. I had to do a full reset on it and reinstall it and I haven't had any more issues since I did that. Having this is so much better than having a bedside clock or using my phone as a clock/alarm. I also set a routine for my alarm to get the weather forecast for the day when I wake up.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Juliebray1980,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024",I bought 2 of these for my dad. I bought him an Alexa show for his room so he could see puctures of his grandkids but also because he slipped and was stuck between his bed and wall for 3 hours. He has gotten used to having it and feels safer living in his home. He fell again on the other side of the house in the garage and broke 2 ribs and was laying on the floor for 2 hours. I bought 2 more for him if he loses his balance in a place the show can't hear him. He is getting a life alert device but I don't think he will use it as he is supposed to so having these throughout the house give me more piece of mind.,5.0 out of 5 stars

That way, all I have to do is say, “Alexa, stop the music.” I have my phone tied into the dot so that, if I have a fall and don’t have my phone with me, I can call my son for help.

~Laura A.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I’ve been wanting to upgrade my Alexa devices, and have been looking at purchasing new Dots for a long time. When I saw these Dots on sale, I purchased three of them: two to use with my relatively new Fire TV for the home theater feature (more on that in a second), and the third to replace an old Dot that died a while ago.

I have a family member who’s a bit hard of hearing, and he kept jacking up the TV volume so that he could hear it. This meant that the rest of us were being blasted with audio that was too loud for our comfort. When I saw that the Echo Dots could be paired with my Fire TV for stereo sound, I thought, hey - I can put one of them right next to our favorite hearing impaired person and everyone wins! BUT NO.

Straight out of the box, they were easy to set up - home theater was easy to navigate for set up, my third Dot - which I’ve only ever intended to use for podcasts, smart home tasks, purchases, etc, was also incredibly easy to get up and running (SIDEBAR: Do the remote early set up via the email that Amazon sends you because then it’s virtually plug-and-play when they arrive). For the first few hours, my home theater Dots connected to my Fire TV sounded pretty good. Mind you, this is stereo, not surround sound, but it definitely solved our problem and seemed like a fantastic solution. However, it was all down hill from there. The Dots continually fell out of sync. One was always playing like you’d expect, the other was at least a second behind. Talk about irritating. The only thing that would resolve this was turning the TV off and back on. We’d have to do that several times an hour. Not cool when you’ve just gotten to the best part of whatever you’re viewing. Other times, one or the other would go static-y. And at other times, the sound would stop playing entirely on one or the other Dot. GRRRRRRRRR. The room this is in isn’t big - the Dots are both within about 10-12 feet of the television. I scoured Amazon and the Internet looking for a solution. I even turned to Reddit. I couldn’t find anything from anyone that was helpful or useful for resolving this, but I did find other people complaining about similar issues, so I’m not the only one who’s experienced it. I really wanted this to work because it truly would have addressed a need that we have. However, as of 15 minutes ago, after two weeks of trying to get this to work, we were all so fed up and over this that we all decided collectively that having our eardrums blasted out was a far better option than the hassle of trying to get something Amazon hasn’t worked the bugs out of to work.

(Amazon, if you’re reading this: I’m into tech. I’ve done more troubleshooting on this than anyone on your payroll. Fix this, please.)

If you’re purchasing a Dot to use as a standard Dot, it works as intended for that and you won’t be disappointed. It’s responsive when using it to control smart home functions, it sounds okay (not fantastic) for podcasts and low key/casual background music. I cannot recommend these to anyone for the home theater feature, because it just doesn’t work. Invest in a soundbar or surround sound system instead.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Kimme,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2024","First off it sounds great & I love the new shape. However, I hate that I ordered a black speaker & received a larger white power adapter. To top that off I'm trading in my old 3rd Generation Echo Dot & was told I have to return it with all the original accessories so it's not like I can keep my old adapter, which I do prefer in size & especially color, keep in mind they are both 15W so there isn't a power difference. If I had ordered a white speaker then by all means the white adapter would be best suited since its color coordinated.

A few times I needed to reset the unit with the app. After a call to Amazon a 20% discount plus $5 towards a new device was credited to me.

As far as usability and response from the device I love it. Being able to have the porch light(s) and garage door controlled via the unit is great.

Oh and so many more features.. The best part is it was so easy to set it up, having one before helped..",5.0 out of 5 stars
av,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2024","The product is, as per last experience, great!! There has been progression in quality and performance - kudos to the development team. My issue is in regards to product packaging. Why send a black device with a beige coloured power cord? Definitely not aesthetically pleasing and a definite decor 👎. This is a first and I hope never to be repeated error and one that can be corrected.",4.0 out of 5 stars
John R,"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2024",This is a replacement for a 5 year old echo dot. I am a little disappointed that i had to replace it but it kept on shutting off randomly. I liked the old hockey puck design more but this one has better sound and so far so good.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Corinne,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2024","These little items have fantastic sound for the small size that they are. I now have three of them. This latest one is 5th generation and I think it sounds a little bit better than the other two, if that’s possible. I highly recommend them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2024","Love how Amazon let's you configure the device before it arrives. Love the convenience of Alexa. As mentioned, the sound is impressive, and when I linked to my Fire Stick and the Home Theater function kicked in... watching the Olympics is gonna be special.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Margaret McCulloch,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2024","A friend had one n from out by the pool she’d holler instructions n “Suddenly we had Music! Louder, softer, a quick switch frm Rock to Jazz without moving a muscle. WOW, this was one of my favorite purchases, that I never knew I needed n I was pleasingly surprised how reasonable it was. I recently purchased it’s baby sister for my little back lanai.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Lau HG 🦋,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2024","Just got this echo dot for my new home and it’s perfect for all i need. It arrived fast, was very easy to set up with the app, and alexa works great to help with every day things like music, timers, weather check, etc. Lights are also great indicators abd the dot in general is modern and elegant. Great purchase!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Jim Miles,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2024","At first I wasn't sure about this product as it was half the size of preceeding generations. My doubts were quickly removed.
Set up was a breeze. I decided to experiment and connect my Samsung TV to it in hopes of better sound as I have been struggling to hear it or even inderstand what was being said. Most everything sounded unintelligible even with the volume maxed. Again I was not disappointed. With the echo sitting on a shelf two or three feet away, I can hear it just fine on low volume.
Another worthwhile purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Shop A Lot,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2024","As soon as I plugged it in it began install process. It said to open app. I did, but I didn't have to do anything with it. It took less than a minute for total setup.

The sound provided much clear voice audio than my V.3 in the same room. I will use V.3 for use with headphones via my audio system and V.5 for when headphones are off because the speaker audio is so much better than that of V.3.

I was pleasantly with the inclusion of a charge adapter.",5.0 out of 5 stars
apcr_texas,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2024","This is my third one. I love that I can set reminders, play music, set a timer. I especially love that it announces my phone callers, and I can even answer the call when I have inadvertently left my phone in another room.

I can drop in on another Dot owner; my daughter frequently drops in on me just to check on me.",5.0 out of 5 stars
J. Egan,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2024","It's small enough. Great sound. Every morning I ask what the weather is. I can di a shopping list, and it's on my phone. Great at playing music. I haven't tappped into everything it can do. Slowing learning.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kohya,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2024","I used to have 2nd Generation Alexa/Echo - which looked like a big cylinder. I was able to have brief conversations with the old one - for example, I will ask for notifications, Echo will respond, I say thank you, and Echo says, ""No problem.""

My current Echo is AMAZING when it comes to sound quality. However, the communication aspect is not there. Before I can say thank you, it will shut down (not in listening mode). My family uses Echo mainly for playing music, keeping timers for cooking and checking the weather.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Manuel M.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2024","Works exactly as other bigger models except for the lack of the screen but surely you just need it to give it instructions.

The led is nice, the quality feels great, the versatility is the same as you get with any of this devices, it offers great entertainment and is a great tool, also is not too big unlike the ones with screen.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Joey,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2024","Cant go wrong with this. I had the 3rd gen that I got years ago and nothing was wrong with it, just wanted to upgrade. The sound and features on this are more or less the same with a couple new features and slightly better sound quality. No matter I do feel like the echo is the best smart speaker no matter the generation.",5.0 out of 5 stars
PAMELA BRITTON,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2024",I love the first one so much when it was prime time against I bought a second one but instead of naming it Alexa I have it the name zizzy. I like that fact you can rename them I wish they had more names to choose from they does it all .. answers all the information you ask. A must have in every household wether you have children or not,5.0 out of 5 stars
JODI SILVER,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2024","I spent hours trying to set this up. Actually it had a pre set up. 3x I did chat. NO one could fix my issue with the WiFi. I finally called. Veerna was utterly AMAZING. She did something that no one is chat did. She help me RESET my device. It wasn't a hard process. I didn't spend 3 to 4 hrs connecting to WiFi. She had me up in about 10 minutes or LESS. Now I can listen to my new Echo. I can't praise her enough. I was planning on sending it back, YET not anymore. It was a simple and quick process. I like my echo 5. She help me to TRUST that some people really KNOW there stuff. My recommendation is IF you have difficulties connecting to Wi-Fi, call Amazon. Ask for a reset. Just a reset. She made my day, my week, my year,",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kenneth L. Wadlin,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2024","This is a great new technological invention.
