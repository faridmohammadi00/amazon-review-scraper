Honest Abe,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2021","I have read the reviews and I see that some people hate these bulbs but I must say that these are the best bulbs that I have had. They are rock solid and they work exceptionally well with Alexa and our Amazon Home. The quality of the bulbs can't be beaten. Now, what are some of the downfalls of LIFX? Well as some have commented, getting the bulb to connect to wifi and subsequently Alexa is a little more involved than most light bulbs but to me, it wasn't crazy or insurmountable, and once connected, the connection is flawless and reliable. The thing is that you have to scan a QR code for each light and go through the setup process individually for each light which can seem like a hassle but it's really not (it's just not instant gratification right out of the box). To me, that's the biggest issue if you can even call it an issue. The lights are expensive but get what you pay for. They work great, the color range is incredible. I have tried other brands and nothing compares. I can tell Alexa to do virtually anything with those lights and it's done. There are no connectivity issues ...I mean none!!! If you can afford it....I would get these lights. I know you will be satisfied and I believe the value will be worth the cost. I'm not wealthy or have money to just through around on light bulbs but it is my belief that these will last me a long time with minimal upkeep and hassle.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Adam,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2022","Bulb is bright without being overly bright. Didn’t want something I had to shield my eyes if I looked at it.

Had some initial trouble pairing straight to homekit so I paired it with the Lifx app. Bulb would be discovered in homekit when I scanned the code, but then would just time out instead of adding to the home.
Lifx app worked great. Tons of features homekit doesn’t actually offer yet, but my inner nerd wanted it with all my other smart devices.
Reset the bulb via the Lifx app. Then paired straight to homekit and worked flawlessly. I don’t have very many WiFi smart devices (mostly ZWave and run nodered to pair to homekit which could be part of my initial struggles) so I’m just thinking it was a fluke.
Have enjoyed this bulb very much. My 4 year old gets a kick out of asking Siri to change the color.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Karli,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2024","Some smart bulb technology is not compatible with Apple Home, but these are!! It's so easy to use and the app is awesome. It offers the full spectrum of visible light, and a color wheel, as well as different shades of white to use throughout the day. I truly love these bulbs and am happy to see their prices becoming more reasonable over the years.",5.0 out of 5 stars
S. Gilmore,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2023","Pros and Cons: Each bulb is individually addressable over WiFi so no hub is needed, although this means that large deployments can easily overwhelm lower-end networks and it also limits their top-notch iOS app to only a single phone. Their Apple HomeKit integration is so-so as it gives access to only a small subset of the full power of the bulbs but it does enable multi-user access to the entire network of bulbs, including remote access. Despite those limitations, and although they're less popular in the market, I still believe LIFX is the category leader: their bulbs are bright and their colors are truer and deeper and they support and integrate with other smart platforms.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Brandon,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2021","I'm guessing some of the negative reviews are written by boomers or people who are tech-illiterate. I purchased a single light and received it yesterday. Plugged it into my standing lamp, turned it on, downloaded the LIFX app (android), and began the setup process.
The setup was ridiculously easy and straightforward. It auto-recognized the light, I had to put in my wifi password, and 'bam' it's done. It simply can not be any easier than that.
Easy to control through the app. The colors look great. Love all the color configurations and the ability to change the brightness. You can really set the mood in your room. My favorite feature by far is the ability to schedule your lights. With the winter months nearly here and the sunrise happening later, I can schedule the light to begin to fade in to maximum brightness over the course of 10 minutes to help me wake up before the sun rises.
I should not that I haven't updated the firmware since everything works perfectly out of the box. Typically on devices such as this you don't want to update the firmware unless you have to.
My only pain point (4 stars) was the value for money. They are a little expensive. Not sure if I'm paying more for the tech or the brand but I was happy enough that I ordered the 4-pack today so set some more up in my room.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Mea,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2023","I use a Linux desktop as my daily driver. This review and my rating of the LIFX light bulbs is mostly concerned with that... using them with Linux. I was pretty delighted to learn after installing them, I could ping them directly over wifi. You *can* use them with a cloud based home automation system, but my net connection is pretty flaky, so I *LOVE* that I can ping them directly.
I was able to find a node.js package that did most of the heavy lifting and provided a simple API to turn them on, turn them off and change their colour. I *think* it can also setup animations, but I'm not really into that. I saw a reference to a python package, but I don't do python anymore.
I was able to find the docs (they're not perfect, but they're good enough) so I'll probably add a Janet or Clojure package... cause... you know... lisp.
The don't seem to be the brightest bulbs I've seen, but they're good enough for my living room. You might be sad if you tried to light a 14' x 28' condo with just two bulbs. I would say go with 6 because blue and purple seemed to be dimmer than green and red. That might be a feature of human colour perception or maybe it's the LEDs in the bulb. But when I tried out my Commodore 64 colour scheme, the cyan was MUCH brighter than the blue.
I would love it if these things were a bit cheaper, but they're cheap enough that I bought a few. I rated ""value for money"" at four stars. I'm happy with the purchase and definitely don't feel like I was ripped off.
So... if you're a Linux person and you want to do coloured light bulbs like all your iProduct friends, these are great. If you grok node or bash, it's pretty straight forward to make them change color at a certain time of day, when your spouse emails you or the CI/CD pipeline stalls (again.)",5.0 out of 5 stars
Derek,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024","LIFX are the only people who make these right tbh - capable of saturated and unsaturated colors alike at every brightness, and power supplies that don't flicker like mad because you dared to have a gaming PC on the same circuit. If you want to actually use the colors of your smart bulbs, get these. The cheaper brands are fine for warm -> cool white or basic primary colors, but have insanely bad color reproduction as brightness lowers.",5.0 out of 5 stars
CSSD,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2021","ABSOLUTELY NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT & bulbs become obsolete (unusable) quickly
They have a whole bunch of articles on their website, but absolutely no way to contact anyone directly with a question.
Bought a bunch of the LIFX minis a couple of years ago. Less than a year in, one became unresponsive. Did all the troubleshooting, nothing worked. Customer service was there, but pretty much said there was nothing they could do. Waste of money, but the rest still worked.
Recently bought this set of 2 lights. App had a super hard time setting them up (had to reset them -- which thankfully I knew might be the issue, then eventually one set up in the app). As I was setting them up, I noticed my older bulbs needed a firmware update, so I did that... and ALL of them became unresponsive. Tried resetting multiple times, finally got the app to recognize one, but it can't be used unless it's added to HomeKit which requires a number... which is supposed to be printed on the product, but is not. So now I have 1 new bulb that works, but 4 old ones that won't do anything.
TOTAL waste of money. Software AND hardware is super buggy, and worst is that there's no more customer support! Once you buy the stuff, you're on your own, and apparently once the bulbs become a few years old, new firmware will render them useless. No way to revert them to how they were before.
Get another brand!",1.0 out of 5 stars

Alex Alasti,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2024","These are amazing. My first smart bulbs that I bought for mood lights in my room. It’s so fun to play with the colors until you get exactly what you like. The app is super compatible. It’s not that the setup process is hard, it’s just a bit lengthy. I have an IPhone and it probably took me 15-20 minutes before they were connected. They don’t buzz like some other smart lights apparently do. You can turn them on and off from your phone. I’m pretty sure you can turn them on and off while you’re away from home too although I haven’t tried yet. So so so many color options. You can dim them. I have an 11x11ft bedroom with two ikea lamps that these are installed into. 800 lumens is enough light for me. The room would definitely be able to be a bit brighter with higher lumens but it’s not necessary. I can’t see why and bulbs would be better! These do everything you need at a good price and look fantastic.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Louwho,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","Very happy with these bulbs. Previously with other brands smaet bulbs, I've experienced a lot of disconnection from the WiFi. So the bulbs would have to be reset and resynced. Sometimes they would just go offline and resync on their own. It was very irritating and had to be done monthly, sometimes multiple times.
Those days are gone with these bulbs! I've had them a month or so and I've had absolutely no issues with the bulbs disconnecting or going offline. I have them connected to my Google home network. The app synced with the Google home app seamlessly.
I also really love the app set up accompanied with a widget I keep on my home screen to quickly switch the lights when I need.
I don't really use them for other colors but I did play around with them and the colors are very vibrant. Overall I'm very impressed with the bulbs from this brand I've never even heard of. Will definitely recommend to others.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Gregory Norris,"Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2023","App can be a bit flaky sometimes and I found Google home integration confusing (that may be on their side) but so far the hardware's been great. I usually drive it at 75% during the day and 50% at night so I'm hoping it'll last a long time (LEDs are more efficient and last longer if you underdrive them unlike incandescents which are brighter and more efficient when you overdrive them but die quicker, that's the real reason incandescents are only rated to last 1000 hours while an LED could be rated for 20,000). As far as know LifX bulbs use better components so they shouldn't burn out prematurely like cheaper LEDs that use fewer and cheaper components then overdrive them.
Wish list for the software would be better initial connection process (it took several attempts and a long wait time) and better management of scenes and routines like the ability to copy routines.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jennifer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2024","I've been using Lifx for years, I have probably 40-50 bulbs. They're great when they work but their software/firmware is absolutely trash. Idk who designed it, but it simply does not work well at all. If it connects, it works great. But 25% of bulbs simply do not connect.
Furthermore, every so often every single light will decide to go completely missing on the network and you'll have to manually set up every light in your house again, reconnect, update, name, set location, set timers—everything. I've talked to their support, there is no solution for this.
The hardware is nice, great colors and brightness. But they clearly cut corners on the software and firmware and it shows, it makes Lifx products a 2/5 instead of a 5/5. They need to hire someone to rebuild their software and firmware from the ground up, whoever built it has no idea what they're doing and it makes this product very frustrating to use. As a consumer, I should not be tasked with troubleshooting your product every time I need to set up a new bulb. I will be buying their competitors' products from now on.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Kamar A Duval,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2021","I hate to write this review as a huge fan of Lifx I'm so disappointed in these. One spoiled apple can really ruin the bunch. Let me give you some background I'm an IT professional and I have an Enterprise Network in my house. The network is 100% overkill and completely unrealistic for 99% of people.
I have 2.5g fiber connection the network. I have a dedicated Network for my smart devices separate from my home and guest networks in the house.
Why am I explaining? I have seen people talk about connection issues. With all the lights that I have none of them have ever had a problem or failed. I have Entire floors of my house are Lifx.
I recently bought a four pack paying $60 a light bulb grows old very quickly. I saw these as a more affordable option. Many corners were cut. Missing color options, missing light spectrum wheel colors. Well 99% of people notice no. I'll tell you what they will notice they will notice not being able to connect the lights. They'll notice having the lights connect and then 5-10 minutes later the lights are no longer detected. What makes it worse is the light has an access point in the same room.
I'm looking at bad reviews with the new eye. I do believe a lot of negative reviews are people that are trying to connect the lights to a 5G Network or they have defective lights but they don't know that they're defective.
I couldn't even get a refund or new lights because I didn't test the lights immediately. So by the time all the lights were up and noticed problems no one cares. The 30 days barely came.
At the point you are resetting it so often it becomes a regular bulb. It connects fine for around 5 minutes then the bulb just kills itself it gets stuck in whatever position it was in so either it's stuck off and you can't turn it on without flipping the switch or is stuck on and you have to flip the switch to turn it off but you'd have to reset it to have it work correctly.
I have a lot of automation and routines in my house. Imagine telling Google to turn off all the lights in your house then one light never turns off. You don't know till the next day. Or imagine lighting the room to your office and it's dark. It's truely frustrating. My Google home and homekit setups keep looking for a light that connects that disappears. I suggest looking at other Lifx bulbs.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Lacucaracha,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2021","Just purchased two LIFX mini multi-color bulbs— my third LIFX purchase so far (I doubt it will be my last.) I bought the regular LIFX multi-color build (the larger 1100 lumens) from Amazon and a refurbished beam (directly from LIFX) when I found myself nesting shortly after lock down began last spring. I am really happy with both items. The beam in particular is awesome. I use both in my living room to great effect.
I bought the two minis for the bedroom. They work as expected setup and look fantastic. The colors are definitely more saturated than the 1100 lumen version. Not sure if it’s because they are using superior LEDs in the new batch, but they can be wonderfully vivid when I want them to be. Setup was not entirely frictionless, but I wouldn’t characterize it as particularly challenging either. I have had zero problems since. I can turn off the lamps manually if I chose and they reconnect immediately. One additional note: LIFX changed their package design. They now come in a regular box (not the fancy cylinder). Clearly a cost cutting measure. Initially, I was skeptical about the change in packaging which made me skeptical as to whether they were actual LIFX bulbs or a knock-off. Then I noticed that the square box packages were pictured right at the top of the LIFX website (a smart choice from a branding perspective.)
I do not use Alexa or Google, I set them up in Apple HomeKit. The HomeKit integration is not seamless, but I believe that is due to limitations of the HomeKit app. So I don’t really bother with the HomeKit app; the LIFX app works really well and is a much better user-interface for this purpose. Despite this issue, the lights do work well with Siri (to the extent that Siri works well for anything.)",4.0 out of 5 stars
Mike,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2024","I had some concerns when I received the product because 2 of the boxes seals have been cut and the bulbs were obviously taken out prior to me opening it due to the fact of the cardboard support to be broken and the instruction manual to be torn.
I ordered a total of 4 bulbs, one came in a brand new set of 2, and the other 2 bulbs came in individual boxes of one, but both were open box items.
How I know that this to be true, is the fact that the QR codes do not match with the serial number on the bulb itself. This created issues during the initial set up.
The manual setup is difficult due to the application UI being very basic and does not allow for easier navigation sadly. The QR code worked flawlessly when I set up the bulbs from the unopened, new box.
I am extremely disappointed that the seller decided to send me 2 opened (and possibly used) light bulbs when I absolutely assumed that I ordered 2 brand new, unopened light bulbs.
I’ve used LIFX bulbs previously, but purchased at Best Buy in person. If this is the type of business this seller conducts, I would advise purchasing products from another seller.
Note: 3 out of the 4 bulbs are working as design, the other bulb I am unable to complete the initial set up due to the mismatching QR code with the serial number on the bulb itself. Even when I attempt to input the serial number that is displayed below the QR code, the set up is unsuccessful.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Spencer,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2022","We have these and the lifx 1100lm ones strategically placed around the house and we occasionally enjoy the lifx effects and app. The only thing that phillips hue is better for us is the sync. We also have lifx strips integrated and housed in diffusers as kitchen backlighting and up lighting. Having it all work seamlessly once it's all set up is really nice. Set up can be a pain especially if someone in the family or a visitor accidentally resets the light, but have no fear the bulb will still work as a regular bulb until it has been set up again. That means I can choose whether to set up the light or use the switch and do it later.
These also work with Apple HomeKit, so giving anyone with an iPhone permission/access to the lights or revoking privileges is a breeze. Scheduled automation and scenes are better in the lifx app than in any 3rd party apps too imo. I have custom scenes set up in lifx and using the built in effects in the app, I can easily entertain myself and guests or set the mood for studying or a movie. While this product has room for development and occasionally I have recieved products with defects (especially their beautiful strips that are still worth it anyways) or they have trouble setting up, these are still my favorite high-end smart bulbs and I hope that they last us many years before we hopefully update to updated lifx bulbs.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2022","I ordered this LIFX product because they advertise ease of set up and great functionality. This couldn't be further from the truth. I was not able to get the light to connect to my WIFI so I went through all of the help topics on their site. None of the solutions resolved my connectivity issue so I reached out to the LIFX Customer Support Department, which you can only (conveniently for them) contact by email. I informed the service tech that I was unable to get the light to connect and had worked through the help topics on the site. This is where everything started to go bad.
The customer service from LIFX is atrocious. It takes anywhere from 3-5 days to get a response to every email and the service techs apparently don't read the emails sent to them. The service tech I was dealing with, Felipe C., started by sending me instructions on how to repeat the exact same steps from the help topics on the site. So it had to move through the same steps even though I repeatedly told him I had tried them, only this time I had to do it over a period of weeks because I was continually waiting for responses from them.
The light still failed to connect even after multiple attempts so I asked for a warranty replacement. Felipe asked that I provide various pieces of information regarding the light, including my receipt of purchase, and the light's serial and lot numbers, which he claimed would be printed on the light bulb. My bulb did not have a serial and lot number but it did have a model number that corresponded with the model I bought and I informed Felipe of that, which I didn't think was odd because Felipe also claimed that the light should have a HomeKit code printed on it and it didn't have that either. The website states that older lights without HomeKit codes are still being sold so I thought it reasonable that an older light would also not have serial and lot numbers printed on them. Felipe's response was that I had not purchased a LIFX product and that they would not be able to warranty the light. This response floored me because the product was shipped and sold by Amazon, I had a receipt, the light had a model number printed on it that corresponded with the model that I bought, and the product came in untampered with LIFX packaging. Felipe of course was not able to articulate to me how this could have happened and seemingly did not care that it seems so far fetched.
I was already past the 30-day Amazon return window because it had taken so long to work through the customer service process but Felipe and LIFX did not care and thrust the whole situation back on Amazon to resolve. Thankfully Amazon is a much better company than LIFX and Amazon stood behind its sale and provided me a refund even though I was outside the 30-day window.
Anyone considering LIFX products should be extremely wary because LIFX apparently does not stand behind its products and will not be there to make things right when their products malfunction or do not work properly.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Jagger H.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2021","Setting up has been a little difficult. HomeKit installation is not a problem, except for the fact that Apple doesn’t let you do automation with HomeKit unless you have an iPad or Apple TV to act as a hub. I bought this light specifically to automatically turn on in the morning and I don’t have either of those, so I tried directly installing on the app because it has that ability. I cannot get it to associate with the app regardless of the setup method. I’ve used several guides on their website to no avail. I’ll withhold final judgement until they’ve had a chance to respond to my help desk ticket, but overall a little frustrating for just setting up a WiFi lightbulb.
No complaints about the light itself. It’s bright and provides all the colors your heart could desire.

Ebullient,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2023","In total, I purchased well over $200 worth of LIFX bulbs. The comfort of my home is enhanced based on my ability to create ""warmth"" and ambiance through lighting. In theory, LIFX bulbs are awesome, however, setting up LIFX bulbs equates to a living nightmare.
Prior to purchase, I encourage you do a random internet search of 'problems connecting LIFX bulbs to WIFI'. You will see comments regarding the HOURS long process of setup. The hours-long process is due--in large part--to the purchaser being 'forced' to connect the bulbs via Apple's HomeKit (for those with iPhones) which the setup defaults to--in lieu of setup through the actual LIFX app. Opting out of using Apple’s HomeKit will cost you an extra 15 to 30 minutes of setup per bulb as the app shows a message saying you’ll have to wait 15 minutes for HomeKit to ‘reset’ the install approach since you opted to use the LIFX app instead of HomeKit for installation.
When I purchased my first set of bulbs +/-9 years ago, I only recall the LIFX app as my choice for setup and do not recall a ‘forced’ option to use HomeKit. A month or so ago I relocated and am in the process of setting the ambiance of my home with LIFX bulbs. The 'forced' use of HomeKit for non-first-time installation--and without the required original packaging that came with the bulb--is CRAZY. The user is prompted to scan the original bulb package OR to key in the HK (HomeKit) number stamped on the bulb--which means you either have to remove the bulb from your high ceilings to retrieve the HomeKit number off the bult, or have been forward-thinking enough +/-9 years ago (in my case) to write down the location of each bulb on the “stored” packages prior to installing the bulb so if ever you need to reinstall the bulb, you’ll know which package to scan.
By the way, retrieving and keying in the HomeKit number from off the bulb doesn’t work. I tried it three times much to even more dismay than I experienced hours into trying to set up these LIFX bulbs.
I feel that LIFX and Apple conspired to make life a living nightmare for those who opt out of being forced to use Apple HomeKit and choose to use the LIFX app for setup.",1.0 out of 5 stars

I can change the percentage of light that shines and lots more, all on the app on my phone. These bulbs replaced my dusk-to-dawn porch lights that would stay on all day on cloudy days. You can set the time they go on and off for each day individually, although I have mine set to turn on at sunset every day.

Robb,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2023","The LifeX app when I first bought these lights years ago was quick, responsive, and easy to create automated light changes.

Jefferson,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2021","Bought 2 of the LIFX 800 lumens bulbs. The packaging wasn't the round packaging you see in YouTube videos, but was in a box. The part numbers seemed to match up so maybe they updated the packaging. LIFX was branded everywhere, including the bulbs.
Both bulbs connected to the LIFX app but it took a few tries. I waited 10 minutes for the first bulb to connect to Wi-Fi. Nothing happened so I backed out of connecting screen and tried to connect again, retyped the wifi password, and it connected right away. The second bulb took 4-5 attempts but it did connect.
The bulbs are very bright and colors are accurate. Having a lot of fun trying different color combinations. I am able to turn my lights on or off anywhere.

I do feel this may be in part, user error. However, I have read through instructions and tried to contact the company support. They did not contact me back.
We had our internet switched and tried to reconnect this device. It asked for a ""key"" which is an 8 digit number that came with the product. I checked the bulb and the key is not located on the bulb itself. I obviously no longer have the original box for the key (and who would?) but there's no way around it and so I'm left with 2, $35 products that I cannot use.

David Roy,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2022","LIFX is easy to install even if not using Homelink instead you have to connect directly to the WiFi the bulb is transmitting from your phone.

Already had three of the Lifx floodlight bulbs and two Lifx beam units, got this so my bathroom wouldn't have any dumb lights installed. This bulb is 4th gen, meaning its soft whites go all the way down to 1500k. This adds ""candlelight"" and ""sunset"" to the color wheel, which my other bulbs aren't able to match, though lifx has said they're trying to add 1500k range to the gen 3 bulbs with a firmware update. Even if they can't, it's not a big deal. Lifx bulbs generate the best range of colors and the brightest light across the color spectrum of any multicolor smart bulb brand I've come across. They don't require a hub, although I'm probably going to select a hub soon so I can add some cameras, motion detection, and door/window sensors that I will want to integrate.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Anthstr,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2021","So the light itself was fine to setup - worked fine out of the box and paired easily the first try. The only issue I observed during the pairing process was that the MAC address is now one digit off from what is printed on the bulb. It made the static IP that I had set up on my network need to be adjusted.
The major issue I have is that I have a number of LIFX bulbs already in my place. When next to other LIFX bulbs (3rd generation A19/A19+ bulbs) there is a VERY noticeable difference in color hue. If I try to set the room to a single color, the color this bulb projects is very different than other bulbs for some colors. For example (in the pictures) when selecting a light green for the room, this bulb is more yellow than the other bulbs. Similarly, between orange and yellow this bulb is more orange. If you have existing bulbs in your setup, you might consider trying to keep those together if adding these into your mix.

Logan Magill,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2022","This lightbulb has been very easy to set up in the app. If it doesn't work, it probably needs to be reset which there is a specific process for resetting the bulb. Once it is set up, this bulb produces extremely saturated colors and it can be controlled offline using a program like Home Assistant. The biggest thing I really like about these bulbs is that it does not require a hub since they connect directly via Wi-Fi. Depending on how many bulbs you have, you may run out of allocated Wi-Fi devices. However, this only happens if you have over 100 bulbs for example.

I had a little figuring out the wifi connection, but just kept following the instructions and eventually my living room was able to be shades of all different colors.

I enjoyed the colors until there is power outage and these lights will enslave you to start connecting all over again. Worse, it argues that the wifi isnt 2.4g that it requires.. the same wifi it was connected to before the outage.

Jeb,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2021","The good news is it appears to be real; more on why I questioned that later.
As with other recent LIFX bulbs I’ve bought setup using iOS without HomeKit is a bit rough. Basically to set it up without HomeKit you have to turn it on and wait 5 minutes until you can connect to the wifi network from the bulb instead of the setup option in iOS. Then you also end up needing to disable cellular data... then most times you can open the app and go through setup as prompted.
This bulb arrived in a generic plastic bag. No box of any kind. Markings seem legit, paperwork was there... but no standard lifx packaging or anything to protect it in shipping. Product purchased was shipped and sold by Amazon.
I was able to set it up, cloud sync works fine, and it works as expected.

Each day is a new surprise, its like these bulbs have a mind of their own. It doesn't super bother me, but it's slightly annoying how inconsistent they are.
Also- the app is a trainwreck with its UI. I hate it so much.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Phil,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2021","LIFX has changed their app to work with apple home kit exclusively for first 15 min after power up in using an Apple device to set up.
You must power on the bulbs and wait 15 min until you can install it without apple home kit.
Lifx does not mention this in their instructions. I found the info on a Lifx developer web site. Apparently they had to cave into Apple (so their app can be on apple App Store) and change their hardware so the light looks for the Apple Home kit for the first 15 min after powering on.
I have purchased Lifx products before and never encountered this problem. This is an example of Apple coercing a vendor to favor its software.
Looks to me that there should be a class action lawsuit to prevent this anti trust violation.

Brian M.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2022","I've had several LIFX bulbs and they were great. This experience however was a total disaster. You need a PhD to figure out how to connect and set up the thing. There are ZERO instruction, ZERO codes, ZERO hints on how to get it to work. I followed the App set up instructions and it said to find a QR code or other code. The box has nothing inside of it. The bulb has nothing on it. But there is a QR code on the outside of the box and yet the camera will not read it, no matter how hard to I try. So after spending literally 2 hours trying set this thing up, I give up. I will NEVER EVER EVER EVER buy anything made by LIFX EVER again. I highly recommend you don't just walk, but run away from this junk. Please do not buy this and save yourself the frustration I and it appears many others have experienced trying to set this up.

Jamarquis Travers,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2022","One of the bulbs never turns off it just turns green! The simplest function of a smartbulb is being able to turn it off without getting up. Instead I now have a nice bright green reminder that doesn't let me forget to get up and flip the switch otherwise I can't sleep. You're probably better off investing in phillips bulbs, even aside from the green bulb these bulbs regularly fail to connect even with my enterprise wifi access point, this is also the case for the pair i bought my girlfriend too. I've tried to contact support multiple times over the course of a few months about the green bulb and haven't heard anything, and they make it extremely difficult to contact them it is honestly shameful.

I tried contacting Lifx to resolve the issue, but they don’t have a number to call just back & forth via Email (which is annoying as hell). Which none of the tips they gave resolved the issue.

It is impossible to connect the light bulb to your wifi. Once I was able to pair it with HomeKit or whatever it tells me it couldn’t find the wifi network - and then it is very unclear how to restart the process it just says “restart the light”. Okay… how? After that point when I want to add a new device it no longer detects any light at all and cannot try again. I bought three bulbs and have tried all three and cannot get one to pair or connect. It just works like a regular bright white LED light which is harsh and reminds me of the office lol… they need to improve the product to better connect to wifi and also provide much clearer instructions for setting up.,1.0 out of 5 stars

There are workarounds by disabling various router settings and other various trickery. A product that considers itself to be a premium offering should not take an IT professional to get it to connect to WiFi. It is ridiculous.

Morton,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2022",I purchased 28 lights in total 4 years ago when LIFX lights were top of the line. The LIFX Z strips are pure junk and I have 8 of them. Back in the day if you had any issues LIFX was on top of it and resolved your issue quickly. Now their support process is set up to constantly ask you for more and more information and log files over the course of a few months in order to make you give up and ditch the lights and buy new ones. Don’t! They have the best color lights on the market but the customer service and support is so terribly bad that it makes owning the lights not worth it. Much more of a headache to deal with LIFX than it’s worth unless you have a ton of extra time to work with them. Buyer beware… buy cheaper brand lights and when they go bad you can buy four or five of these lights for one LIFX light. It’s really yo bad as once upon a time LIFX was the best! Now they are below average and one of the most expensive lights on the market.,1.0 out of 5 stars

Car,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2021","They try to force you to link these to Apple HomeKit. I already have a preferred home app and it’s not HomeKit.
I followed all obvious prompts when setting up then and realized what had happened. I had to undo everything and redo, which involved a couple hours of internet sleuthing, as I’m new to this brand. And nothing I tried was working. The only thing that finally worked after MUCH trial and tribulation was to delete the app, delete my Lifx account, unplug each bulb 5 times, re-download the app, look off the beaten path for how to set up sans HK. This was stupidly time consuming.
It’s seems deliberately tricky, like maybe they get a kickback from Apple for all HK sign ups.
In the process of trying to work out how to undo, I posted two questions on the official Lifx support board. I went back the next day to see if anyone responded and my posts were GONE, as if they deleted them.
Anyway I was mostly set up, but my bulbs are two different colors. I want them synced. I tried everything under the sun to no avail. I even unplugged 5 times to reset them. Then the app wouldn’t recognize one of the bulbs. More troubleshooting.
So I started internet sleuthing again, but it was futile. These are a HARD, HARD pass for me. I got Govee and they are easy as pie on the first go.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Denise Pickering,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2021","Do not buy these bulbs. Nowhere on the company's website do they have reviews, most likely because they know their product is junk. Lights will not connect. Customer service is nonexistent, and they will give you the run around on why your product is not working. 2 years ago, their product worked phenomenally, unveiled a new app, and everything went in the tank. The app will give you a vicious cycle of connecting to wifi to home kit to can not connect to can not find your device while your lights will blink every 5 mins. We upgraded to a new mesh system, and everything works fantastic and can connect easily. LIFX recommended an Eero router, so that is what we purchased. Guess what bulbs still don't work.

William Lees,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2021","About 9 months after I bought this product the light burnt out. Good thing it still has another year on the warranty. But if you call Lifx they need a retail receipt. And it is past the Amazon return policy. So, you are out of luck if a product burns out. Even retail receipts fade after a year. This is bad business if you need a receipt to prove the product was purchased. This company should stand by their product and replace a broken light if they are in warranty. Very bad business and Lifx should be ashamed of itself. This is how bad reviews are generated and consumer confidence is decreased. Don't buy this product, one out of four burnt out and Lifx will not honor a warranty.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Christopher,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2023","I recently upgraded my home lighting system with the LIFX Color A19 800 lumens Wi-Fi Smart LED Light Bulb, and I must say it has completely transformed the way I experience lighting at home. This smart light bulb is an absolute game-changer, providing me with a breathtaking range of colors and unparalleled convenience.
The LIFX Color A19 bulb boasts a remarkable brightness of 800 lumens, ensuring that every corner of the room is perfectly illuminated. Whether I'm reading, working, or simply relaxing, the brightness level can be adjusted effortlessly via the intuitive LIFX app or through voice commands using my preferred virtual assistant.
One of the most outstanding features of this smart LED bulb is the vast palette of colors it offers. With billions of colors and whites at my disposal, I can create the perfect ambiance for any occasion. Whether I want a calming, warm glow for a cozy evening or a vibrant, dynamic burst of colors for a party, the LIFX Color A19 bulb delivers stunning results every time. The colors are rich, vibrant, and true to life, instantly transforming the atmosphere of any room.
Setting up the LIFX bulb was a breeze. It seamlessly connects to my Wi-Fi network, eliminating the need for any additional hubs or complicated installation processes. Once connected, I can control the bulb from anywhere using my smartphone or tablet, allowing me to turn the lights on or off, adjust brightness, or experiment with colors even when I'm away from home.
The LIFX app provides a user-friendly interface that is both intuitive and feature-rich. It allows me to create custom lighting scenes, set schedules for automatic activation, and even sync the lights with music or movies for an immersive entertainment experience. The app also integrates with popular smart home platforms like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit, enabling seamless voice control and integration with my existing smart home ecosystem.
Another aspect that impressed me is the energy efficiency of the LIFX Color A19 bulb. With its LED technology, it consumes significantly less energy compared to traditional incandescent bulbs, helping me reduce my carbon footprint while enjoying the benefits of smart lighting.
In terms of reliability, the LIFX bulb has been a rock-solid performer. It consistently responds promptly to commands, and I've never experienced any connectivity issues. The bulb also receives regular firmware updates, ensuring that it stays up to date with the latest features and enhancements.
Overall, I can't recommend the LIFX Color A19 800 lumens Wi-Fi Smart LED Light Bulb enough. It's an exceptional product that combines stunning color capabilities, effortless control, and energy efficiency. Whether you're looking to create the perfect ambiance or integrate smart lighting into your home automation system, this bulb is a fantastic choice. Upgrade your lighting experience today and immerse yourself in a world of vibrant colors and smart illumination with LIFX!",5.0 out of 5 stars
John W.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2023",It just works. I have two of the 1100 lumen lights over head and the 800 on my night stand. I don't have any re connection issues like others have mentioned. This is despite the router/app being downstairs. I wonder how many people reporting this turn the bulbs off with a light switch. If you do that you can expect like a 60 second lag before the bulb can be controlled via the app (once you turn the switch back on). I just hey Google kill the lights and it always works. Ymmv but I've never been disappointed with lifx bulbs.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Jon P Hildreth Jr,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2023","I'm a returning LIFX customer, and for a good reason. This is my 2nd purchase from LIFX, and probably won't be my last. I bought this pack of 2 for my nightstand lamps. They integrate well with my other LIFX fixture, and the range of colors/ animations are endless! What brought me to writing a review is the customer service I received after noticing 1 out of the 2 lights was faulty. After submitting a quick and painless questionnaire on the LIFX website, someone emailed me within the day. Once I provided more information and pictures, they submitted a warranty claim on my behalf and I was able to receive a new replacement light that works perfectly! If you're wanting a quality LED smart light that comes with quality service, I cannot recommend LIFX enough!",5.0 out of 5 stars
jj,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2022",Beware of these unless you are a techie type of person who knows how to set up and distinguish wifi signal and link the bulbs up for just 2.5 wifi. I’m not willing to do split my wifi and I want to opt for smart products that do this automatically. So now I have a bunch of useless dumb lifx bulbs that are way too bright and no way to dim them. I’m going to look into getting Bluetooth bulbs so I don’t have this headache and waste of money,1.0 out of 5 stars
