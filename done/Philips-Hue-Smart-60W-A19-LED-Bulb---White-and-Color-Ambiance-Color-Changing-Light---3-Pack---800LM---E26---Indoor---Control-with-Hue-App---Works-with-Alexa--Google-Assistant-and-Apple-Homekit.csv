Z,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2024","I recently upgraded to the Philips Hue Smart 60W A19 LED Bulbs, and they’ve been a fantastic addition to my home lighting setup. This 4-pack offers excellent value and a great way to bring smart lighting into your space.

First off, the installation is super simple. Just screw in the bulbs, and you’re ready to connect them to the Philips Hue Bridge via the app. The setup process is straightforward, and the app itself is user-friendly, allowing for a wide range of customization options.

The soft warm white light provided by these bulbs is perfect for creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. At 800 lumens, they offer ample brightness without being too harsh. The light quality is excellent—consistent and evenly distributed, which is great for both reading and relaxing.

One of the standout features is the ability to control the bulbs remotely via the Philips Hue app or with voice commands if you’re using a smart assistant like Alexa or Google Assistant. You can adjust the brightness, set schedules, and even create lighting scenes that match your mood or activity.

Another plus is the energy efficiency. These LED bulbs use significantly less power than traditional incandescent bulbs, which helps lower your energy bills and is better for the environment.

Overall, the Philips Hue Smart 60W A19 LED Bulbs are a great choice if you’re looking to enhance your home lighting with smart features. The soft warm light, ease of use, and energy efficiency make them a solid investment. Highly recommend for anyone wanting to add smart, customizable lighting to their home!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Brandon,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2024","The Philips Hue Smart 60W A19 LED Light Bulbs have completely transformed my home lighting experience. Setup was a breeze, and the bulbs connected seamlessly to my existing Hue Bridge. Setup was a breeze, and the bulbs connected seamlessly to my existing Hue Bridge. While Hue lights definitely run on the more expensive side, their seamless integration is undeniable. I have gone with other less reliable brands and still found myself coming back to the dependability of Phillips Hue. The ability to control the lights through the app or via voice commands with Alexa or Google adds an extra level of convenience. The range of color temperatures is impressive, allowing me to set the perfect mood for any occasion. Whether it's warm light for relaxing evenings or bright, cool light in the morning for focused tasks, these bulbs deliver. The energy efficiency is a bonus, making these bulbs a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to upgrade to smart lighting.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Double Deuce,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024",I have Hue bulbs throughout my house and I couldn’t be happier with them. These white ambience and color bulbs are great for using in my table lamps and sconces. They give off plenty of light and Philips has tons of light recipes to choose from in their app so you can set the mood according to how you feel. You can also create your own light setting. These light will work with Bluetooth or for a full slate of settings you can connect them with the Hue bridge. If you are going to use more than 10 lights then you must use the bridge. I love these lights and highly recommend them. They aren’t cheap but they are worth it especially if you are just starting out with smart lighting as no other company offers you the quality and variety of lights that Philips does. If you use Apple HomeKit these work great. They also connect to Alexa and Google Assistant for voice control. I personally prefer the security and the user interface of Apple but I have tried it with Alexa as well and was happy with the results. You can’t go wrong with these lights. They work great straight out of the box. Setup is a breeze and you can start using them within minutes. I like that I can program them to turn on when it senses me coming up the driveway so I never have to enter a dark house. You can also set them to turn on and off according to whatever schedule you want. They are truly amazing. Once you buy one you will want more and more of them.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Sean M.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2024","After something like 7 years one of my Hue bulbs wouldn’t show blue colors. Annoying given the price but it far exceeded the expected lifespan. So back to Amazon for a replacement. We’ve switched almost all of our lights over to the Hue system and are very happy with it. The light is nice. The system has gotten much more stable over time, and integrates well with home assistants. Lastly, in my experience they really do work well and last a long time, which makes the premium price go down a little easier. Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Michael F.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2023","I started my smart home a few years ago and Phillips Hue was my first purchase into verbal commands. It wasn't terrible to set up. It was pricey compared to other bands, but the customer and expert reviews were excellent. So I purchased a Hue hub and 4 bulbs. They started burning out after almost 3 years, so I went to order more and cheaper ones popped up. They worked for a week and wouldn't stay connected. I returned them and paid a bit more for Hue bulbs and I'll never go back to the bargain bulbs.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Barista143,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2022","I can’t say enough how much I can’t stand Alexa with smart lights. It is honestly the worst “smart” anything I have ever used. Alexa can control smart lights like an infant can control their bowel movements.

I have tried multiple companies, multiples lights, wyze, Phillips, Sengled and after 6 months of Alexa losing connectivity and constantly have to reset, re-pair, reboot wifi, reboot Alexa, reboot life, I finally found the issue.

It is ALEXA!!

Alexa is an awful, absolutely awful way to make your home “smart”.

I’ll give you an example. When I finally got my fill of “cheap” lights like Sengled, I decided to try the higher priced lights, Phillips in this case.

Highly rated, great lights. “Work with Alexa only, no hub needed!”.

Sounds to good to be true? Yes! Because it is!

I added all my Phillips lights, everything was perfect. All my routines for sunset and sunrise were working.

It was as great as the Sengled lights were, for about 1 week. THEN, just like with any smart light you will pair with Alexa, connectivity is lost. ALWAYS, LOST. ALWAYS!

No matter what you do. Lost.

Sent Amazon customer support a message. No help.
Sent Phillips a message, they said the issue was with Alexa. Same as Sengled said!!

I immediately returned the Phillips lights and then what happens. When you add ANY Phillips light to Alexa, it will stay with you until you die.

I tried to delete the lights from Phillips. They said the issue is with Alexa. I contacted Amazon. They said the issue is with Phillips!!!

So now, EVERY TIME I add ONE smart light, ALL EIGHT of the old Phillips lights try to re add AGAIN!

So instead of one device being added, it’s NINE LIGHTS. I have to delete any time I change anything on Alexa. ANY DANG TIME.

If I lose connective and fix it, 9 lights.
If I have to add them again, 9 lights.

So if you want to purchase a smart lighting system, stay AWAY from Sengled and stay AWAY from ALEXA.

Alexa is good at telling you the time. Not making your house “smart”. It will surely make your house “dumb” though.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Ca,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2024",I’ve own the same bulbs for over ten years and they still work perfectly. So I ordered more for new lamps we recently bought. Easy to set up and easy to control.,5.0 out of 5 stars
DVJ Luna,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2022","Ever since I went to a large electronics retail store near me to get something totally different than these bulbs and saw the Philips Hue demonstrated in concert with what I was looking for, I was hooked on them. I have them throughout my home and have them in my office at work. I have about 30 of them in my house and 10 of them in my office. To say the least, I am more than satisfied with the Philips Hue products.

Now the review…

Philips have been making bulbs for many years and then when they broke into the industry of smart wifi bulbs, they became quite the hit. Pair the hue bulbs with the Hue Bridge and the app, one’s creative side can really shine.

The Build Quality.

These bulbs have a little heft to them whereas there is a lot of technology that needs to be crammed into a space the size … well the size of a light bulb. The build quality in my opinion is pretty solid and done well. The illumination part diffuses the LEDs used in these bulbs are very smooth and do not see any hot spots whatsoever from the LEDS inside. The colors produced from the RGB LEDS are pretty rich and vibrant but as in every RGB style bulb, the light output will vary from color to color and different white temperatures. Case in point. If you choose the bulbs to light up in blue, the overall Lumens factor will be less than if you choose to use Yellow or other bright colors of the spectrum. But if you go with the white ambiance aspect, the whites will pretty much be equal in Lumens factor from the lower temperature like 2700K to the higher temperatures like 6500k.

Features.

These bulbs are full of them when you connect them with the Hue bridge. You can have them turn on and off with the use of Google Home, Assistant or Alexa. You can turn them on or off with the use of the user-friendly app and even turn them on or off when you are out and about as long as you have the app connected to the cloud server set up within your smart home. You can set up various different scenes as long as you have multiple Hue Bulbs. Scenes really don’t look great or seems simplistic if you have just one bulb. To get the best results, I recommend 5 or more of the Hue Bulbs in a room to get the different color scenes to show off well. (Refer to the bedroom pic I posted with this review.)
The latest versions of the Hue Bulbs can be operated via Bluetooth on the dedicated Bluetooth version of the Hue app. So, with bulbs having the Bluetooth technology, you do not need to have the Hue Bridge. The downside to that is you will not be able to set up multiple rooms and you can only control 10 Hue Bulbs via Bluetooth vs. up to 50 Hue Bulbs with using the Hue Bridge.
If there is anything that would be considered a downfall to these bulbs, is they are a bit on the pricy side. I have a few thousand dollars invested in my Hue Echo System and love everything about these bulbs. That would be the only flaw I can find with them.

The Recap.

These are some of the top of the line of smart bulbs. Can you find cheaper bulbs as far as costs is concerned? Yes, you can. But the saying goes, “You get what you pay for.” And that holds true with these bulbs. If you are willing to invest into the Hue System, you won’t be disappointed.",5.0 out of 5 stars
nikkolaus,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024","I'm happy with my new lights. Been running them for about a year, and the only negative that I have to say about them is that it's hard to balance between a high lumen output. You don't want too blue, and you don't want too yellow, and it's hard to find that in-between. I got these because I love to have the ability to change to a color of my choice to help with things like sleep, migraines, and motivation.

Several studies, including one conducted in 2016, found that green light significantly decreased light sensitivity and reduced the intensity of headaches in migraine sufferers. In contrast, blue light, which is prevalent in many modern light sources like LED screens, has been shown to exacerbate migraine pain due to its higher energy and shorter wavelength.

When I wake up in the morning I like to have the lights a nice soft-blue, at 25-40% brightness, until my eyes can adjust. With these lights and the app that PH has, it's easy. You can even set timers to make the lights fade-in, so it's not a sudden blast as soon as your alarm clock goes off. Other times I don't want to turn the lights completely off because I want to watch a movie and still be able to see around the room when I need to get up and use the bathroom or something without opening the app to turn the lights back on or up brighter. So, in that instance, i sent the light to a dim blue light at 8-10% brightness. The real problem with these LED lights lies in the app, which is a bit slow when it comes to connecting to the lights each time you open the app, but it gets there, just have to be patient. Every time you open the app it will do a remote connection to each light individually, and check their status, essentially. Sometimes it happens where the app will see 2 of the LED light bulbs, but the third one it just doesn't connect to for ~30 seconds. Sometimes you even have to fully close the app then try to ping that light again.

The physical size difference between a standard light bulb and the PH LED bulbs is noticeable but barely an issue; They fit just fine. They're just slightly taller or same size as other compact LEDs and traditional filament bulbs, but shorter than the A21.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Jake,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024","They’re ok. Really hard to get a decent indigo out of them and there’s no way these have as high a cri as are claimed in their advertising. I’m a warm light guy because I have a soul and stuff and don’t want to make everyone look like vampires. The warm light spectrum in these is a real color killer. It almost looks a bit fluorescent. It’s not horrible if the only white light in the room is coming from these, but if you pair them with a quality soft or warm bulb, it’s clear that they don’t hold up. (Better than lifx whites though. Big yikes there)

The colors are annoyingly muted too. When I’m creating a color scheme, I really like to get a rich indigo going for the room and something warm to light the subjects. For some reason, it seems like hue products engage the white diodes when you hit that blue to purple part of the spectrum. Lifx for colors all day every day no contest.

Love the hub system though. These are the most reliable smart lights in my setup.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Nefrai Laysh,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2021","I love these lights, I use 6 A19 bulbs and 4 BR30 bulbs for the kitchen. I have the 6 bulbs spread between 2 bedrooms and a bathroom.
I started getting these in 2018, and have bought a couple more each year. So far, I have had no issues. I see some low reviews for Google Assistant, I can't say anything on the Google stuff - I use the Hue Hub and Echo Show/Echo dots.

Using Hue Hub and Echo, I've so far never had a connection issue with these bulbs, like I have had with cheaper bulbs I tried in the past. I have bedroom lights set to turn on when my alarm goes off, and they have never failed so far. Echo and Hub both find the lights right away, and I can set routines with either app. I never bothered to look at the instructions the bulbs come with, if you have connected any smart devices to apps before, there isn't much to it. Turn on the bulb, and Echo/Hub will find it. Just note that if you have a power outage, the bulbs will typically turn themselves ON when power is back...that can be a little jarring at 3am! You can also set the bulb to remember it's last setting, so if you flick off/on the light switch (normally leave the switch ON all the time), it will turn on at the same color/brightness it was last.

I use the base wattage bulbs, and they have been perfect for me, but I generally keep my lights lower, such as 10% for bedroom lighting, and around 60% for my kitchen. At 100%, it's more than bright enough for me. Colors look great, and make my home office way more comfortable. Using a setting like ""energize"" in the office helps my eyes feel less sore, I'm big on setting just the right color for working.

I have given these lights a 5, because I have never had an issue with the 10 total I have (and may be getting 4 more today), I've never had an issue between these bulbs and my phone apps Echo/Hue Hub, lighting is great and color is what I wanted in a bulb. I love smart-lights, and after testing cheaper ones, these have been much easter to work with (in my experience), and unlike my old ones they have always stayed connected to my apps. 3 years so far with never having to reconnect is a win for me. Just bear in mind, I can only speak to using Echo and Hue Hub with them.",5.0 out of 5 stars

But the bulbs are good and working fine….would have gotten a 5 star review except for the spillage.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Dean,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2023","There are a ton of things to like about these bulbs. There are lots of different presets of color combinations to choose from, you can set alarms on the lights so the lights are on by the time you have to get out of bed, and you can turn off the lights FROM bed, which is sooo nice.

There are definitely some downsides that come from having essential life items be smart devices. You have to always have your bluetooth on to use these. That means if you disconnect it on accident, or need to put on battery saver mode: you're disconnected from the lights in your home and you'll need to reconnect them before you can use them. Kind of a downer.
Also, if your phone is older than Android 10 (I'm sure there is an equivalent for Apple) you straight up cannot get the app from the store. It's just not available for you. I learned this only after buying these lights, and thankfully my partner has a newer phone and is able to control them -- but if he isn't home then I simply don't get to turn on/off the lights or alter them at all. Obviously that's a bit of a let down.
We also could not get these to connect to our Google Home no matter what we tried. Not sure if that's just because we don't have a Hub, or because our Google Home hates us, but beware it might not work for you either.

But ultimately I am glad we got these. Being able to choose the vibe of the room with the colors at any time is nice",4.0 out of 5 stars

The ease of control is another standout feature. Using the Phillips Hue app, I can effortlessly adjust the brightness, switch colors, or set lighting schedules right from my smartphone. It’s not just convenient; it adds a layer of fun and interactivity to my daily routine.

They're so bright and cheerful, they make me feel like I'm waking up on a tropical island instead of in my dingy apartment. And if I ever need to set the mood for a romantic evening, I just dim those bad boys down low and boom! Instant ambience. My only complaint is that they're not great for taking selfies, but I guess you can't have everything.

Here’s what changed my life though. I haven’t touched my light switch SINCE buying these bad boys. Dear golly you hook these lights up on your phone and a Apple HomePod your house turns to heaven. “Hey siri turn on lights” BOOM, let there be light.. “hey siri turn off light” BOOM your back in the dark ages. “Hey siri turn the lights red at 20%” BOOM bring out the rose pedals and champagne. If you got the dough the make your whole house full of these you can separate the lights into rooms. So “siri turn on kitchen lights/ porch lights/ bedroom lights/ have a disco party in the bathroom.” Whatever you need. hate getting in/out of bed and messing with the lights? Have Siri do it. You ever walk outside your house or apartment to see you left the lights on? Scroll down on your phone and Tap the lights and BOOM theyre off. No need to go back inside or waste energy.

Thomas H.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2021","I have been wanting Philips Hue lights for about 10 years. Since they first came out. The day finally arrived when I had some extra money.

So I was very excited to try these. But from the time I turned these on, they have been a horrible experience.

I am an IT specialist that has been using a computer for 37 years. So if I have trouble setting these up, good luck...

Just finding the app was a nightmare because Google suggests unofficial apps instead, with the Philips app nowhere to be found. I actually had to type in a URL and it still went to the wrong address at first.

Their app doesn't even work with Android Marshmallow 6, so I had to use it with another smartphone,... because???

But I had already paired the light with that phone, so then I had to go through quite an adventure to get it working with my other phone. The lightbulb simply refused to work. It ""rejected"" being unpaired/paired. I would say that took about 2 hours.

After some struggle, finally, I had the other 2 lamps working with my phone, connected, now the real challenge had begun.

The lights are not unified in the scene, so if you pick a scene, the lights will be different colors. It never explains this. So I had two lamps on my desk which -- no matter what I did, they were different colors. It was so frustrating. I literally had to manually adjust one of them to match the other. Because by default, I guess people like their lamps to be different colors??? HAHAHA

You cannot even adjust the lights at the same time. For example if you wanted the 3 lights to change to a certain color and brightness, you have to adjust each one of them separately! Hahaha, what kind of smart app is this??

The app requires location to be turned on. HAHA, I'm using Bluetooth, I am literally right here where you are.. it would be impossible to control it over bluetooth if I wasn't standing before it. What kind of ""smart"" light is this.

Why do my light bulbs need my GPS location - are you serious? My location is not Philip's business.

Second, having location turned on to use your lamps means that all apps now have location turned on.

Third, this uses a lot more battery ... for what exactly, Philips?

Every time you open your phone, it will give you a location error. ""These require location to be turned on,"" this is despite the fact that location is turned on... Luckily, it's just a momentary issue each time (a few seconds)

The lights are dim, it's like living inside a cave lit by a candle. The lights barely light themselves up. If you use scene ""Bright"" you can almost find your way around the room.

I guess they are somewhat adequate in the white settings, but leave a lot to be desired.

If you want color mode, the lights barely light themselves up. You can stare directly at the lightbulb with brightness turned to the max. Christmas tree lights are brighter than these!

I have no idea in the world how these are like $50 each.

Now let's talk about the updates. Every single time you open the app, there is some update. Seemingly because it never finishes them.

You have to update each light bulb individually!!! It won't just download the update to your phone and then begin installing to all or each light. Haha, no that would make too much sense!

It will download the update, and it takes about 12-24 hours, and if you do anything else, it will cancel the update, apparently.

It never gives you any clues like maybe you're not close enough to the light bulb, or ... what.

Is this the slowest CPU/processor in the world? Combined with the slowest storage in the world? I'm serious, it probably is! Sure, they have to cut costs somewhere, but this is absurdly slow. And you can tell because when you turn the light switch on, it takes about 2 seconds for the lights to come on!

I had left my phone on the entire night, plugged in with the screen on, and when I woke up it was still updating one of the bulbs. 8 hours later, it says ""finalizing update"" and it was stuck there. Like maybe now I can never use the light again. I am literally in the dark here. Then I realized I had it it switched off!

2 days later, now it's time to update the 2nd bulb! YAY torture!

Black Friday deal or not, I will almost certainly return these and never buy a Hue product again.",2.0 out of 5 stars

James R.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2022","When I started incorporating smart devices into my home a few years ago, one of the earliest devices I added was a Philips Hue Bridge and two Hue color bulbs. As the years went by I added more devices from other brands, including other-brand WiFi color bulbs that were much less expensive than the Hue bulbs. However the cheaper WiFi bulbs started showing their cons, as I would experience random lost connections, every few months I had to reset one or two of them, and of all the other devices I had in my Smart Home, the WiFi bulbs were what gave me the most trouble.

Then I realized - this whole time that I've been using Smart home devices, I never - ever - had an issue with the Hue bulbs! With that in mind, I decided to pick up a pack of 4 Hue bulbs to finally get rid of the cheaper, unreliable WiFi bulbs that I couldn't stand anymore. Sure enough, with the Hue bulbs installed, I have had zero issues with the lights. If I had just stuck with Hue from the beginning I wouldn't have wasted about $80 on inferior WiFi bulbs. So if you want reliable, high-quality color bulbs for your Smart home, go with Philips Hue. They are indeed worth the premium price.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Shawn,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2023","The lights are bright and the color is very vibrant. They are also responsive.... when they work. So far, every time the internet resets or anything changes, it takes about 2 or 3 hours of playing around in the app to try and get them to work with Google home. It's advertised as ""seamless"" integration but it absolutely IS NOT. They also HEAVLY try to make you buy a $60 ""bridge"" to connect the bulbs to Google home which is outrageous, considering the older bulbs (that used Wiz) never needed a bridge and would ACTUALLY connect seamlessly. You can connect without one, but you'll be spending several hours factory resetting devices, and uninstalling and re-installing apps and sometimes, they just decide they don't wanna work right until you spend another 3 hours. Between the 3 or 4 times I've had to battle with these things to try and get Google home to be able to discover them, then actually be able to connect to them I've probably factory reset the bulbs and my Google home about 5 times before they'd show up.

Overall a nice bulb but setting up is a CHORE and the ""seamless"" integration is very misleading when they try their best to force you to buy a $60 accessory you don't actually need unless your whole house is set up with several of these things.",3.0 out of 5 stars
anon.mamut,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2019","So first let's start off with the light and not the technology. it's great wonderful colors that you can get on these bulbs and that's the best part about it. Going down to probably what is 2200 k That's a really warm orange color that allows you to really feel relaxed especially when dim down. And then you can scale that up to somewhere around 4,000 k or something a little more stimulating or if you really need some kind of bright bright color turn all the way up to 6500 k. I love that aspect about this bulbs and that's the best thing about them.

Now it's dive into why this only gets three stars. first I almost want to give this 1 and 1/2 stars for the false advertising. this does not work with the Google Assistant which is stated in this Amazon listing as well as printed on the box. It does not work with the Google Assistant. It only works with the Google home. Only way that this works with the Google Assistant is to get the Philips hub. Anyone that's buying the Bluetooth is buying it because I don't want the hub. so if I could give this two and a half stars I would because I don't like false advertising and I bought these because I wanted it to work with my Google Assistant and not have to get the hub.

Second multiple user setup is very complicated even for someone like me running my own tech company setting up advanced networks. there's conflicting information out there and I actually had to call Phillips to figure this out because even he had to ask an advanced tech because they had conflicted information in the office.

To summarize, this is a subpar beta product that should never have been released to the public. Don't advertise that it works with something when it doesn't. and for the price of these bulbs it better work with the Google Assistant and have much more seamless setup. That said, everything is in context and then the smart light world there isn't anything great yet so this is why I bumped it up to three stars and because I really do like the color and the lighting and that's where Phillip's really does come through",3.0 out of 5 stars

It’s great and simple that these two devices can be controlled simultaneously. Also, being able to create routines has helped me to wake up for those early morning workouts.

fifty50,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2019","I stayed up until 4:30 am trying to figure out how to work this new lightbulb with my new Echo Dot 3. First, you have to ignore the directions that came with the bulb. They were useless and misleading and one of the reasons I've been up half the night. No, you do not need a pricey Hue hub. You don't need the google playstore or the Apple store to download an app. You don't need to select ""Hue"" from the Alexa Skills menu and you don't need to sign up for a Hue account.

All you do is set up your Echo Dot if not already done. You should probably wait while it connects to your other devices. Then screw in the lightbulb and turn on the lamp/light fixture. At this point, Alexa should say new light found, but it didn't. I had to say ""Alexa discover devices"" Alexa named the device ""First Light"" Then I was able to say turn on first light, turn off first light, dim first light. There is a video on this page that tells you the exact same thing. This is the video to follow.

Tim,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2024","These are absolutely perfect light bulbs, especially for beginners. I would recommend these to anyone who wants a simple, easy-to-setup, basically out of the box, clean solution. If you’re starting out, with no budget constants - buy these bulbs. Otherwise, I’m not sure what the hype is all about. Yeah they’re great. But it’s a lightbulb. There’s quite a few cheaper options with pretty much the same capabilities. And yeah the App is fairly easy to navigate. But I’ve used many different apps and it’s really not my favorite. It sometimes feels like it’s made to be more complicated than it needs to be. Anyway.

I’ve checked through various bulb vendors: GE, Wink, Sylvania, Philips, Sengled, etc. They all had pros and cons, these included. If you’re more experienced, and depending on the types of bulbs you need, you can go with a cheaper brand with an easier app that is easily controlled via Alexa, Google Home or Apple Home.

As for the performance of the bulbs themselves, the color range is huge, brightness is fantastic, and you can use a darker color to dim them way down for night lights or hallway lights outside your kid's room, where you don't want the full brightness of even a 40W incandescent. The white Hue bulbs don't get quite as dim, and the new different hue colorscapes, etc. were great for our front porch on Halloween.

I'm not one to get too much into techy gadgets but my wife and i decided to give it a try. Now i'm addicted and have 6 of the philips hue color changing bulbs in the living room, 1 of the color changing rope lights around the back of the tv, and 2 of the philips hue white bulbs in the bedroom.

They are AWESOME.

Aside from being fun to change the colors manually, you can choose from a bunch of preset color ""themes"". You can also create your own color theme and save it as a preset. There's also something called the Philips Hue Labs and that has various features you can use too, some of which i'll probably never use but some are useful.

One feature we really like is the ability to set ""routines"" which is basically a timer for the lights. You can set routines to do the same on/off every day, every other day, any combination of days and times, and it has a ""random"" feature that mixes up the on/off time so it's not exactly the same every time. We were using the inexpensive plastic white mechanical timers plugged in to outlets and lamps, but those are a thing of the past now. I just set up a bunch of routines if we go out of town. So so so good.

David,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2023","It used to be, and in fact still is with my old hue lights, that if you turned off the switch and turned it back on it would reset to the default white light, which I liked. Now if you flick the standard switch on and off, it diverts back to the last state, no matter what state you select in the settings of that bulb on the app. I searched far and wide as to how to correct this issue, because sometimes instead of going to my app to turn a light on that i turned off using my app, I just want a fast way to turn the light on, which used to just be flick the standard light switch on and off. I turns out, you can still do this, but you need to count 20 seconds after you flick the switch off, and the light will turn on when you flick the switch on again.

To explain more, when all the lights are off and i flick the standard switch on and off fast, only my old lights turn on. The new lights remain off, unless I wait 20 seconds before flicking the switch on. I don't know who thought that would be better.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Steve from Boston,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2022","These bulbs were a little tricky to set up in the Hue app using Bluetooth, mostly due to an unstable Bluetooth connection. The app offers lots of control, once you figure out how it works. But for the life of me, I couldn't make it connect to my Google Home speaker. Google tech support knew a lot and spent lots of time on the phone with me, but we couldn't solve it. Phillips tech support was pretty close to useless. Finally, I figured out that there's a setting in the Hue app that makes the bulb discoverable. I'd tell you where it is, but I can't find it again. Anyway, once I made it discoverable, the Google Home app found it right away and connected it by Bluetooth to my speaker. It seemed pretty good for the first day.
.
Over time, I came to understand that my Bluetooth connections were extremely unstable, both between my phone and the bulbs and between the Google Home speaker and the bulbs. Every time a bulb lost a connection, it dimmed and then came back on. It gets old and annoying right away. After a day of this nonsense, my Google speaker lost its grip and never succeeded in doing anything with either of the bulbs. After a couple of days, I gave up and ordered a pair of GE ""Cync"" bulbs, which set up without a hitch and seem to be working great at a fraction of the cost.

She has as very happy to receive them; living on her own and occasionally traveling means the remote operation of lighting in her home can be easily arranged whether out of town or unexpectedly coming home after dark.
I had concerns about integration with her echo dot (3rd gen, I believe) but she reported that once the bulb was installed Alexa immediately recognized it and was ready to go!
The bulbs arrived quickly and we’ll packaged. They seem to be quality, neither appearing too light and chintzy nor bulky or too cumbersome for average light fixtures. Philips is a brand most know and trust; if the bulbs continue to function as promised I will consider this a gift well given and not hesitate to use or gift them again!",4.0 out of 5 stars

We can't get it to recognize the groups Bedroom Lights, only Bed 1 and Bed 2 along with Bathroom.

Aside from that the lights are great though, no hiccups over a month later (so far).

They are pricey, but they work perfectly with Alexa, no third party app which is a big deal if you've ever had to deal with a third party app for your lights. The fact I can not only turn on my lights with my voice, coming home at night its the best cause I don't have to leave on any lights and as soon as I open the door I say to Alexa, Alexa its dark in here and the one light I set up for that saying turns on right by the door. I use the color to attract the kids when they are in their rooms. Its better then yelling across the house. I can also use the Alexa echo's as intercoms but the light thing is the easiest to do and it doesn't stop my music on my echo. If you can budget for these instead of the cheapos that require that third party app, I would suggest it. If not, those cheapos, which I have one that's just whites, warm white to cool white, and it works just fine, but if given the choice, I would go with the Philips Hue brand.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I use them in my bedroom to automatically turn on when getting ready for bed and turn off after a preset time period. I like the fade feature after five minutes to gently turn off the lights.

Nolan,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2021","This is not a product for the tech newbie. Conflicting and misleading advertisements would have you believe setup & integration with your voice assistant will be easy - this is not the case. Here's what I learned for use without bridge & with the Google Assistant.

Compatibility.
You MUST have one of the following devices in order to use a voice assistant without the bridge:
Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation
Google Home
Google Home Mini
Google Home Max
Google Nest Hub

If you do not have one of these devices, you can still connect the lights to the Phillips Hue app, but not a voice assistant. The application has limited functionality.

I used a Google Home Mini for my setup. Here are the steps I took:
1. Install Hue App
2. Connect your lights to the hue app first
3. In Hue app, go to Settings > Voice Assistants > Google Home
4. Follow instructions as far as you can
5. Open up Google home app
6. Hit the ""+"" in the top left corner > Set Up Device > New Device > {Your Home} > Light Bulb
7. Hopefully you'll see your bulb, connect to it and follow Google's instructions

Why is this rated 1 star? Here's why:
1. The box arrived completely torn apart - this was clearly a used product I was shipped (despite buying new)
2. Only 1 of the lights in the box (out of 2) worked. Probably why it was returned the first time
3. Customer service for ""Hue"" is clueless - they have no idea what's going on. Don't waste your time with them.
4. Misleading advertisement and conflicting messages of functionality. The listing on Amazon is not correct, and does NOT specify the specific devices that are compatible, i.e. ""Works with all Echo smart speakers/displays and Google Nest devices""

Pretty sure the misleading advertisement is grounds for a lawsuit.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2023","I bought these for my whole house, I’ve always seen them as the gold standard in smart bulbs, and for the price, as well as the review scores, I assumed that was correct. I spent nearly $900 on my whole home full of these when it was on sale, now that number would have been closer to 1200 or so. During installation, I encountered around 8 of my 27 bulbs were not colored properly, and their soft white and blue greens were different to other bulbs from the same box and batch/model numbers. Had to exchange a bunch of them for that. Now I have a whole home of them that are the proper color but at least once a week I’ll have around 5-10 of them randomly disconnect themselves from my smart home system and won’t respond no matter what I try, it takes a full factory reset of the bulbs and re-pairing them to get them to function properly again.

David Elam,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2020","These are garbage... completely lied about being able to use with google assistant. That requires you to download yet another app, add a home, tell it you want to add a light, let it tell you it can't find one, return here and warn others... I'm so tired of products making false claims and misleading customers. I got these refunded about 20 minutes aftet unboxing them. All i wanted to do was use my google assistant with it but nothing ever works like it is supposed to. If you live in a rural area with no internet, then you don't have any need for home, which needs your wifi to work apparently, which means this product may be possible to use with the assistant but because i wasn't told that originally i just trusted the company and gave them money for what they claimed would work that does not. Don't waste your time with this company's bulbs. Yes they come on, and work with an app, and via Bluetooth... but these in particular have 0 further options... plus they are Yellow as can be and i preferred my white lights that don't require anything but me to operate. I'm throwing these in the garbage to keep anyone else from having to even look at the pathetic failures. 800 lumens is incredibly weak, the shade of light may as well be called ""Nicotine Stained' because that's the color it will make everything, and it's ugly. These don't have colors, they don't have shading options, and they basically don't do much else they say either... if you are without a wifi connection you get literally nothing from these that you think you get.

I recently purchased these bulbs to replace my other PH that I had in my home, 2 in desk lamps and 1 in overhead lighting. The 3 failed, 2 flashing without being able to connect and one just outright died. The old PH were purchased in 2018 and under the description of this generation AND the previous generation the claim is that these bulbs should last over 20yrs. I reached out to PH via twitter to inquire about the warranty.

2 out of the 3 bulbs are covered under warranty. The third is not...why? Because the bulbs are NOT designed to be in a totally enclosed light fixture! This is NOT articulated in the description. It IS stated on the box and ON the bulb itself both in the the tiniest of fonts. Be warned, if you plan on using these bulbs in an enclosed fixture and the the bulb prematurely fails, PH will not honor the warranty as your usage voids the warranty.

As for the bulbs performance for the last 2yrs...the last generation performed just fine and I found it very convenient to be able to control lighting in hallways that would otherwise be constantly lit, create mood lighting to get the little ones to sleep, and to create timers for my Parental Unit.

I long for revolution and an end to planned obsolescence, especially on such overly expensive light bulbs.

Suddenly stopped responding to the google home mini. I disconnected and reset everything (as the troubleshoot guides suggested) and now they can’t even be found again. Exactly the same as before except this time it took one extra week for them to stop working. Even if I can get the reconnect, I refuse to keeping going though this on a regular basis just to use.

Disconnected them to try and reset, now they won’t connect again. Probably going to send them back. Way more trouble than they’re worth.

That being said, the week they worked was pretty cool. Nice and bright at full blast but also dimmable; though the dimmest setting could be a a bit dimmer still in my opinion.

Mother of 2,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2021","I sort of bought these by mistake. I intended to get more of the GE smart bulbs but ordered these instead. Had I not already owned and used the GE version, these may have been fine, nothing to write home about but certainly workable. However, I do have the other bulbs and app and quite frankly, this app is garbage. The GE’s app and functioning is simply far superior. This app doesn’t make it as easy to control each individual bulb and has limited customizability in comparison. Also... this app is ugly. That shouldn’t be important but after seeing the beauty of the other app, it matters. I am upset that they call it “hue” with a colored ring when not all their bulbs change color. They also have two different hue apps which is annoying and confusing. And if you were planning on using this with your gaming, you have to have their additional hardware.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Braden Baumann,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2020","These bulbs simply don't work. Or rather, they are engineered NOT to work unless you fork over even more money on a completely unnecessary hue hub.

Tried to set these up using the Philip's hue bt app. Bulbs work fine through that app. I'm told by that app that they need an update to use with virtual assistant. Ok fine. Tried to make them discoverable to the google home app and was prompted to buy a hue hub. No thanks, I have a ""hub"" - my google home. I shouldn't need yet another superfluous piece of hardware.

I use the Philip's app to factory reset the bulbs. Sure enough they set up just fine through the google home after being wiped. But only for about a day. I'm assuming they updated while I was at work and now refuse to function even after resetting again.

Got them working un about 5 mins).

Every time power was switched off accidentally or if there was a power outage, these stupid Phillips bulb would not Sync back on and it'd be nightmare to link them again.

So please do yourself a favor and don't buy this useless stupid product. Go search for Smart Life bulbs instead, they are way better and cheaper.

Thomas H.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2021","I have been wanting Philips Hue lights for about 10 years. Since they first came out. The day finally arrived when I had some extra money.

So I was very excited to try these. But from the time I turned these on, they have been a horrible experience.

I am an IT specialist that has been using a computer for 37 years. So if I have trouble setting these up, good luck...

Just finding the app was a nightmare because Google suggests unofficial apps instead, with the Philips app nowhere to be found. I actually had to type in a URL and it still went to the wrong address at first.

Their app doesn't even work with Android Marshmallow 6, so I had to use it with another smartphone,... because???

But I had already paired the light with that phone, so then I had to go through quite an adventure to get it working with my other phone. The lightbulb simply refused to work. It ""rejected"" being unpaired/paired. I would say that took about 2 hours.

After some struggle, finally, I had the other 2 lamps working with my phone, connected, now the real challenge had begun.

The lights are not unified in the scene, so if you pick a scene, the lights will be different colors. It never explains this. So I had two lamps on my desk which -- no matter what I did, they were different colors. It was so frustrating. I literally had to manually adjust one of them to match the other. Because by default, I guess people like their lamps to be different colors??? HAHAHA

You cannot even adjust the lights at the same time. For example if you wanted the 3 lights to change to a certain color and brightness, you have to adjust each one of them separately! Hahaha, what kind of smart app is this??

The app requires location to be turned on. HAHA, I'm using Bluetooth, I am literally right here where you are.. it would be impossible to control it over bluetooth if I wasn't standing before it. What kind of ""smart"" light is this.

Why do my light bulbs need my GPS location - are you serious? My location is not Philip's business.

Second, having location turned on to use your lamps means that all apps now have location turned on.

Third, this uses a lot more battery ... for what exactly, Philips?

Every time you open your phone, it will give you a location error. ""These require location to be turned on,"" this is despite the fact that location is turned on... Luckily, it's just a momentary issue each time (a few seconds)

The lights are dim, it's like living inside a cave lit by a candle. The lights barely light themselves up. If you use scene ""Bright"" you can almost find your way around the room.

I guess they are somewhat adequate in the white settings, but leave a lot to be desired.

If you want color mode, the lights barely light themselves up. You can stare directly at the lightbulb with brightness turned to the max. Christmas tree lights are brighter than these!

I have no idea in the world how these are like $50 each.

Now let's talk about the updates. Every single time you open the app, there is some update. Seemingly because it never finishes them.

You have to update each light bulb individually!!! It won't just download the update to your phone and then begin installing to all or each light. Haha, no that would make too much sense!

It will download the update, and it takes about 12-24 hours, and if you do anything else, it will cancel the update, apparently.

It never gives you any clues like maybe you're not close enough to the light bulb, or ... what.

Is this the slowest CPU/processor in the world? Combined with the slowest storage in the world? I'm serious, it probably is! Sure, they have to cut costs somewhere, but this is absurdly slow. And you can tell because when you turn the light switch on, it takes about 2 seconds for the lights to come on!

I had left my phone on the entire night, plugged in with the screen on, and when I woke up it was still updating one of the bulbs. 8 hours later, it says ""finalizing update"" and it was stuck there. Like maybe now I can never use the light again. I am literally in the dark here. Then I realized I had it it switched off!

2 days later, now it's time to update the 2nd bulb! YAY torture!

Mark C.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2022","I bought this two pack when one of the other smart lights in my bedroom died, and I figured I might as well get what was labeled ""the best"" even if it was overpriced. According to everything I read and researched, they would work fine with my Google Home without buying Philips' special hub if I just followed instructions. Reasonable enough.

Got them started to install per all instructions. First, the Bluetooth App did not connect to Google Home the way it was promised. Every time I tried to link the app, it sent me to a Philips page saying ""It's time to link your Bridge"" and literally not allowing me to connect as every instruction I found online claimed. There was no way to tell it I wasn't using their super-special extra hub device.

When I decided to forego the app and simply see if Google Home would detect them, it actually worked. Success! Lights turn on and off and change color! Or so I thought...

Each light started randomly turning off for a second and turning back on. I did every measure of troubleshooting, searched all over online, checked reddit posts, forums, help pages, articles. I tried to reconnect them with the BT app and finally got them to just work with the app by saying I wasn't going to use an assistant program. After several times of having to delete and reinstall the app because it decided it couldn't connect to the bulbs if something went wrong on the first try. Then I updated the firmware on the lights, hoping this would solve the problem. But no. Turns out the flash off and on was the bulbs randomly disconnecting, even from the Bluetooth app. If it was just one, that might have been a defective item, but they both kept doing it no matter what. Checked to make sure my router wasn't overtaxed by devices, but no indication it was, and we had the same number of smart bulbs in previously.

That sucked 2 hours of my life away when setting up smart devices these days should be 15 minutes AT MOST. Usually more like 5.

So if you're really sold on paying for overpriced bulbs and their super-special awesome proprietary aren't-we-neat-for-being-Philips hub, go for it. I myself have a deep abiding hatred for companies and products that try to push us to buy extra products and devices outside of basic standards once standard APIs have been agreed on, and I'll be returning these for a refund and buying some more modestly priced bulbs that simply hook into wi-fi and work nicely with basic smart home setup in just a few minutes.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Brad Ohman,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2021","During setup in the Hue Bluetooth app, it says you need to update to the latest firmware to use a voice assistant (Amazon or Google only). When attempting to do so, it finds the update and downloads, but then fails to connect and goes into an endless loop. After this point the bulb stops responding altogether from the app. A factory reset is required in order to recover. This behavior was consistent across all four bulbs I’ve attempted setting up.

I’ve also tried this when connected to a friend’s Hue Bridge and it still refuses to update. Voice control does work when connected to her bridge. In my experience, the purported Bluetooth functionality is highly flawed, and won’t work with a voice assistant.

For support, Philips’ website says to call a number it provides, or write to an address it doesn’t provide, instead referencing the packaging.

The only reason I gave these 2 stars was because the hardware is good quality. I don't know who to blame for the lacking software, but it is not worth the trouble.

Regardless of how easy these are for anyone to set up, they are overpriced. There are hundreds of less-common brands out there that offer comparable products for half the price.

My issue, one bulb connected immediately, no issues. One wouldn't connect no matter what I tried... multiple Echo Dots, multiple phones, different light fixtures.

Katie,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2020",I husband spends a lot of time playing with home automation. Our townhouse however is just not ready for wire running and punching holes in the wall. He started with these bulbs. 4 of the multi colored ones in the bedroom. He recently purchased these along with the candle style bulbs for our living room. 1/2 of these bulbs died in the last month. These just don’t last. I enjoyed having the lights come on at sunset and going off around 9pm when everyone’s in bed. They really did not run that much and the lack of longevity makes them a poor choice in our home.,2.0 out of 5 stars
Mickey,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2021","No idea why these are rated so highly. I got these to ""upgrade"" some cheap Sylvania bulbs and to pair with the Lutron Aurora and MSI's ambient lightning.

Here are the issue I'm having and have been unable to resolve:
- All three bulbs flicker constantly.
- The bulbs are noticeably slow when reacting to commands.
- Ocassionally bulbs will ignore commands.

As for the light themselves, the colors and brightness aren't noticeably better than the Sylvania bulbs. For me, this was an expensive downgrade, and I'd return them if I still had the box.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Shawn,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2023","The lights are bright and the color is very vibrant. They are also responsive.... when they work. So far, every time the internet resets or anything changes, it takes about 2 or 3 hours of playing around in the app to try and get them to work with Google home. It's advertised as ""seamless"" integration but it absolutely IS NOT. They also HEAVLY try to make you buy a $60 ""bridge"" to connect the bulbs to Google home which is outrageous, considering the older bulbs (that used Wiz) never needed a bridge and would ACTUALLY connect seamlessly. You can connect without one, but you'll be spending several hours factory resetting devices, and uninstalling and re-installing apps and sometimes, they just decide they don't wanna work right until you spend another 3 hours. Between the 3 or 4 times I've had to battle with these things to try and get Google home to be able to discover them, then actually be able to connect to them I've probably factory reset the bulbs and my Google home about 5 times before they'd show up.

Overall a nice bulb but setting up is a CHORE and the ""seamless"" integration is very misleading when they try their best to force you to buy a $60 accessory you don't actually need unless your whole house is set up with several of these things.",3.0 out of 5 stars
anon.mamut,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2019","So first let's start off with the light and not the technology. it's great wonderful colors that you can get on these bulbs and that's the best part about it. Going down to probably what is 2200 k That's a really warm orange color that allows you to really feel relaxed especially when dim down. And then you can scale that up to somewhere around 4,000 k or something a little more stimulating or if you really need some kind of bright bright color turn all the way up to 6500 k. I love that aspect about this bulbs and that's the best thing about them.

Now it's dive into why this only gets three stars. first I almost want to give this 1 and 1/2 stars for the false advertising. this does not work with the Google Assistant which is stated in this Amazon listing as well as printed on the box. It does not work with the Google Assistant. It only works with the Google home. Only way that this works with the Google Assistant is to get the Philips hub. Anyone that's buying the Bluetooth is buying it because I don't want the hub. so if I could give this two and a half stars I would because I don't like false advertising and I bought these because I wanted it to work with my Google Assistant and not have to get the hub.

Second multiple user setup is very complicated even for someone like me running my own tech company setting up advanced networks. there's conflicting information out there and I actually had to call Phillips to figure this out because even he had to ask an advanced tech because they had conflicted information in the office.

To summarize, this is a subpar beta product that should never have been released to the public. Don't advertise that it works with something when it doesn't. and for the price of these bulbs it better work with the Google Assistant and have much more seamless setup. That said, everything is in context and then the smart light world there isn't anything great yet so this is why I bumped it up to three stars and because I really do like the color and the lighting and that's where Phillip's really does come through",3.0 out of 5 stars
fifty50,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2019","I stayed up until 4:30 am trying to figure out how to work this new lightbulb with my new Echo Dot 3. First, you have to ignore the directions that came with the bulb. They were useless and misleading and one of the reasons I've been up half the night. No, you do not need a pricey Hue hub. You don't need the google playstore or the Apple store to download an app. You don't need to select ""Hue"" from the Alexa Skills menu and you don't need to sign up for a Hue account.

All you do is set up your Echo Dot if not already done. You should probably wait while it connects to your other devices. Then screw in the lightbulb and turn on the lamp/light fixture. At this point, Alexa should say new light found, but it didn't. I had to say ""Alexa discover devices"" Alexa named the device ""First Light"" Then I was able to say turn on first light, turn off first light, dim first light. There is a video on this page that tells you the exact same thing. This is the video to follow.

Tim,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2024","These are absolutely perfect light bulbs, especially for beginners. I would recommend these to anyone who wants a simple, easy-to-setup, basically out of the box, clean solution. If you’re starting out, with no budget constants - buy these bulbs. Otherwise, I’m not sure what the hype is all about. Yeah they’re great. But it’s a lightbulb. There’s quite a few cheaper options with pretty much the same capabilities. And yeah the App is fairly easy to navigate. But I’ve used many different apps and it’s really not my favorite. It sometimes feels like it’s made to be more complicated than it needs to be. Anyway.

I’ve checked through various bulb vendors: GE, Wink, Sylvania, Philips, Sengled, etc. They all had pros and cons, these included.

David,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2023","It used to be, and in fact still is with my old hue lights, that if you turned off the switch and turned it back on it would reset to the default white light, which I liked. Now if you flick the standard switch on and off, it diverts back to the last state, no matter what state you select in the settings of that bulb on the app. I searched far and wide as to how to correct this issue, because sometimes instead of going to my app to turn a light on that i turned off using my app, I just want a fast way to turn the light on, which used to just be flick the standard light switch on and off. I turns out, you can still do this, but you need to count 20 seconds after you flick the switch off, and the light will turn on when you flick the switch on again.

To explain more, when all the lights are off and i flick the standard switch on and off fast, only my old lights turn on. The new lights remain off, unless I wait 20 seconds before flicking the switch on. I don't know who thought that would be better.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Steve from Boston,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2022","These bulbs were a little tricky to set up in the Hue app using Bluetooth, mostly due to an unstable Bluetooth connection. The app offers lots of control, once you figure out how it works. But for the life of me, I couldn't make it connect to my Google Home speaker. Google tech support knew a lot and spent lots of time on the phone with me, but we couldn't solve it. Phillips tech support was pretty close to useless. Finally, I figured out that there's a setting in the Hue app that makes the bulb discoverable. I'd tell you where it is, but I can't find it again. Anyway, once I made it discoverable, the Google Home app found it right away and connected it by Bluetooth to my speaker. It seemed pretty good for the first day.
.
Over time, I came to understand that my Bluetooth connections were extremely unstable, both between my phone and the bulbs and between the Google Home speaker and the bulbs. Every time a bulb lost a connection, it dimmed and then came back on. It gets old and annoying right away. After a day of this nonsense, my Google speaker lost its grip and never succeeded in doing anything with either of the bulbs. After a couple of days, I gave up and ordered a pair of GE ""Cync"" bulbs, which set up without a hitch and seem to be working great at a fraction of the cost.

Rachel LePine,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2023","The specifications on this page outline that these bulbs are indoor/outdoor use. They are NOT outdoor compatible. I put mine in an outdoor light post that is covered and protected from the elements (doesn't get wet or dirty). The light bulb died within 2 months (bought end of July and it died 2 weeks ago). I reached out to Phillips on Facebook and they just stated the description is wrong but did not offer any help/compensation.

I love the bulbs and have a ton of Philips products throughout my home, which is only why this is getting 3 stars.

Lisa Ours,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2020","So let's start with the fact that I'm pretty high maintenance and my work setting is my ""Safe Space"" so I really require it be as comfortable as possible. I've got some health issues so the ability to modify my environment, especially my lighting is imperative. With that understanding, here are the PRO's. I purchased the two pack of these white/color bulbs for my desk and standing lamp in my office. I have an Echo set up in my office, and the Hue App on my phone. They are TOO much fun. The lights do exactly what they claim - all kinds of awesome color combinations, brightness configurations, and I'm able to turn them on and off with my smartphone via bluetooth. I really do enjoy them.
The CON's - Alexa doesn't seem to like my desk lamp. When I attempted to configure the echo to verbally command lights on and off, Alexa was happy to do so but only with my standing lamp (which is farther from the echo than the desk lamp which is less than 4 feet from the echo's spot on my desk). I won't lie - kind of frustrated there. SO, I purchased a Hub/bridge thinking this might better help the integration in my office space (Please see my review of the Hub/Bridge for my displeasure at that outcome). Long story short - If you work at an institution or company, where there is a network, you may not be able to set up a Hub/bridge to do the extra magic or assist your echo in its job. Final resolution - I am still happy with the purchase. I simply use my Hue App to take care of my lights instead of my Echo. Minor inconvenience in comparison with the benefits of having control of my lights at any time.

SomeReviewingGuy,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2023","These bulbs worked fine for several years along with our Echo Dot. However the connectivity stopped working. We can still turn them on and off with the wall switch, but neither Alexa nor the App can connect to them. Neither can my phone's bluetooth detect them. Not sure what happened.

Followed the suggested reset procedure many times but no luck. They need some sort of physical reset button on the device perhaps. Also the Philips app is clunky to use because of ads, the ads are placed in a way that you could easily sign up for some paid service thinking it is related to the bulbs when it is not. This just seems really cheap for a company the size of Philips to do.

Overall they were fine while they worked, until they didn't. I will say they worked several years so you would have to decide if that makes them worth the price or not.",3.0 out of 5 stars
K.L.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2022","Sorry for the low-light photo; I remembered to take a picture just before dropping them off for return: I do love Hue bulbs, but I returned these because the listing photos shows these as the “new” “richer colors” version that I understand does the blues/violets more vibrantly (the difference on the package is the green bulb on the box’s front bottom left corner). I think the part number is the same, which is the difficulty.
Anyway, as you can see, these are not those, despite the listing photos. I even submitted an error that I received the wrong item, and the replacement was the same.

Don’t get me wrong — I love and recommend Hue lights! I was simply choosing, at the about same price point, either the 60W “richer color” bulbs or the 75W regular colored bulbs — so I’m going go ahead and order the brighter bulbs for ~$3 less.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Bingzhong,"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2021","I bought a bulb roughly around Q3 of 2020, and worked immediately out the box and synced flawlessly with my Google Home(s). Fast forward to January, an update to Google Home caused the bulb to strangely stop working one day. Turns out, Philips is now demanding Hue owners to purchase their Hue Bridge smart system for the bulbs to even connect and take commands again.

With that said, the bulbs are brighter than any of the generic lights you'll find on Amazon, including some name-brand ones such as C bulbs by General Electric. However, this doesn't justify the already quite pricy tag that comes with the bulb as the Hue Bridge can easily run you $60-$80 depending where you go. When it's all said and done, this isn't a great investment especially if you're like me who only needed one.

On the other hand, the Hue bulb provides overall the best RGB bulb for any large room using showcase/ceiling lights. And if you're running an Alexa, you're in better luck than us Google Home users as Alexa doesn't require the Bridge.

tl;dr: Hue Bridge is now required for all Google Home owners, but not for Alexa. Best bulbs you can buy, but can get pricy.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Also, dont be fooled, you can only control these with phone ap or dot in your home without a hub. The lamps are blue tooth controlled not wifi controlled and Philip's cs hub has to be plugged into a router port to work, not stand alone wifi like it should be in the year 2020. Typical Philip's. I knew this would not be easy and Philip's would let me down like they have so many times before. I got 8 lamps to put in 8 rooms of my hse to have an emergency all lights on all lights off system. The Hue ap let's me do that although not always instantaneously again because its blue tooth and distance limited. The ap has to poll the lamps, make connections and then u can control.

First of all, if you want to set this up with Google assistance you cannot use the Phillips hue app nor the Phillips BT app. These apps don't speak with Google assistance from my experience even though I think it's supposed to. What you need to do is installed Phillips BT app, connect the lights and then factory reset them. From there you can easily add them onto Google assistance. This is all because I went cheap and didn't buy the Hub. Just buy the Hub if you value your time. Secondly, just the other night the disconnected from my Google Home system.

Ldallas,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2022","I bought these bulbs because I’d read they work through Alexa or Bluetooth.

Will probably buy Alexa plugs to control my lights. Obviously I haven’t used the bulbs so can’t speak about their reliability etc. UPDATE 6/26: Bought Hue Hub from BB, it came with 2 bulbs. Those bulbs are the only ones working. The two from Amz work if turned on manually, but will not pair with the Hub. Hub says no other lights found even after entering the serial numbers.

Richard C.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2020","THE GOOD:
- There is absolutely NO comparison between Hue and other brands. If you believe you can compete, feel free to reach out, however, thus far, nobody has been able to dethrone Philips.
- Does not use WiFi. Normally I wouldn't mark this as good, but every WiFi bulb I've ever used requires a 2.4GHz network. Zigbee is the way to go, folks.
- Bulbs are bright, colorful, and long lasting. I had one of the white bulbs previously in a 150F degree environment for well over a year. It still works flawlessly.
- Philips continues to add new features to their new bulbs. For example, the newest version supports bluetooth.

THE BAD:
- The Hue Hub does not support many, if any third party Zigbee bulbs.

THE UGLY:
- The PRICE! I'm not above paying a premium for a good product, but $40+ for a single color bulb is pushing it. This would be a 5 star product if color bulbs were $25 each. Note that as of this writing, $20 will get you 2 RGB bulbs that run on WiFi. Don't get me wrong, Hue Bulbs are far better, however, they absolutely DO need to come down on price.

Andrew Matejuans,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2021","I purchased this set of bulbs instead of others because of the blue tooth capability, and the fact I don't need a hub. I love the wakeup and sleep routines on bulbs as they are excellent for improving the quality of my sleep and my ability to wake up with fewer alarm snoozes. The color is also nicely warm and they are plenty bright enough.

The only issues and the reason I knocked two stars off my rating is that my bulbs lose the ability to connect about once a month. The fix is simple enough, all I have to do is set the app to forget the lights and then reconnect them. All of my routines still carry over, but it is still annoying. The other reason I'm knocking off a star is that every time I reconnect the lights, I am required to provide my email address in the app again, when I don't think I should ever be required to provide it in the first place, or at the very least the bulbs/app should remember it.

TomK1,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","The positives are that the bulbs were relatively easy to set up without a hub, although the Phillips Hue app won't connect directly to this device, they have a 2nd app that's called Hue Bluetooth (it should be one app, not two)

That works reasonably well, and you have your light bulb up and working in really no time. At this point you can turn on/off the bulb and dim it from your phone. You can also use your bulb with Alexa and Google, although it will be called ""First Light"" which will become difficult to change later in Alexa, even if you change the bulb name in the app.

You can turn the light on, but at it's brightest, it's probably the equivalent of a very dim incandescent bulb.

If you want to control it with Apple Homekit, you're out of luck; it only does that if you spend another $50 on a bridge.

So out of the box, this is a fine light for turning on with your phone, perhaps with Alex/Google Assistant. But if you want something like that, there's a lot cheaper choices that do multi-color lights and much brighter.

Jake,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024","They’re ok. Really hard to get a decent indigo out of them and there’s no way these have as high a cri as are claimed in their advertising. I’m a warm light guy because I have a soul and stuff and don’t want to make everyone look like vampires. The warm light spectrum in these is a real color killer. It almost looks a bit fluorescent. It’s not horrible if the only white light in the room is coming from these, but if you pair them with a quality soft or warm bulb, it’s clear that they don’t hold up. (Better than lifx whites though. Big yikes there)

The colors are annoyingly muted too. When I’m creating a color scheme, I really like to get a rich indigo going for the room and something warm to light the subjects. For some reason, it seems like hue products engage the white diodes when you hit that blue to purple part of the spectrum. Lifx for colors all day every day no contest.

Dean,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2023","There are a ton of things to like about these bulbs. There are lots of different presets of color combinations to choose from, you can set alarms on the lights so the lights are on by the time you have to get out of bed, and you can turn off the lights FROM bed, which is sooo nice.

There are definitely some downsides that come from having essential life items be smart devices. You have to always have your bluetooth on to use these. That means if you disconnect it on accident, or need to put on battery saver mode: you're disconnected from the lights in your home and you'll need to reconnect them before you can use them. Kind of a downer.
Also, if your phone is older than Android 10 (I'm sure there is an equivalent for Apple) you straight up cannot get the app from the store. It's just not available for you. I learned this only after buying these lights, and thankfully my partner has a newer phone and is able to control them -- but if he isn't home then I simply don't get to turn on/off the lights or alter them at all. Obviously that's a bit of a let down.
We also could not get these to connect to our Google Home no matter what we tried. Not sure if that's just because we don't have a Hub, or because our Google Home hates us, but beware it might not work for you either.

As the years went by I added more devices from other brands, including other-brand WiFi color bulbs that were much less expensive than the Hue bulbs. However the cheaper WiFi bulbs started showing their cons, as I would experience random lost connections, every few months I had to reset one or two of them, and of all the other devices I had in my Smart Home, the WiFi bulbs were what gave me the most trouble.

Then I realized - this whole time that I've been using Smart home devices, I never - ever - had an issue with the Hue bulbs! With that in mind, I decided to pick up a pack of 4 Hue bulbs to finally get rid of the cheaper, unreliable WiFi bulbs that I couldn't stand anymore. Sure enough, with the Hue bulbs installed, I have had zero issues with the lights. If I had just stuck with Hue from the beginning I wouldn't have wasted about $80 on inferior WiFi bulbs.

The only downsides is that the hub is necessary to have the full experience. The app is missing several features lower ended light bulbs have such as transitioning color mode(where the color changes on its own). I expected these features when buying lightbulbs at this price.

They are a bit expensive for the color bulbs, but given the flexibility, long life, and low cost of operation... you get a lot of features. Think carefully about your application and whether you will use the color feature in the intended location beyond the ""novelty"" timeframe. If not, the ""non-color"" white bulbs are much cheaper and do provide various ""colors"" (temperatures) of white light from warm (yellow-orange) to cool (bluer-white).

Both my echo dot 1 and 3 can control the lights including on,off AND dimming functions. I do think you will need the echo dot 3 to discover and link up to the bulbs.

K. Camp,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2020",Let me start by saying this is my second set of bulbs. I purchased these Hue bulbs because I wanted a light system that work with my new echo devices. After a few days my first set lose signal with my Echo dot and the Hue app. Amazon sent me a new set of bulbs and these haven't showed any issues like the first set. These hue bulb are really bright which is perfect for someone like me with vision issues. A really nice feature of the bulbs is the dimmer because you can set your own lighting need and that will help with the energy efficiency. Once slight annoying issues with this device is that response time between it and the echo device is a little slow. It takes a few second so it's not a big deal but still annoying. I would still recommend these bulb because overall they work well.,4.0 out of 5 stars

I feel more awake by the time I have to drive in to work.

The shortcomings that I have run into with the lights are 2 simple ones, you can not set the lights to:
1) a daily schedule, you must set it each night.
2) a wake-up routine through Google Home. There are articles which say it's possible, but my lights just turn on (strait to 100%) at whatever time I specify. A simple $5 light timer could do this, if I wanted it to.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The white ones do not dim as much as the colored ones.
The white ones have a very noticeable & annoying delay in when you turn the light switch on to when the bulbs turn on.

Once they’re disconnected, go into the Google Home app FIRST and pair the bulbs there (same for Alexa). You should be able to pair them now.

Z,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2024","I recently upgraded to the Philips Hue Smart 60W A19 LED Bulbs, and they’ve been a fantastic addition to my home lighting setup. This 4-pack offers excellent value and a great way to bring smart lighting into your space.

First off, the installation is super simple. Just screw in the bulbs, and you’re ready to connect them to the Philips Hue Bridge via the app. The setup process is straightforward, and the app itself is user-friendly, allowing for a wide range of customization options.

The soft warm white light provided by these bulbs is perfect for creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. At 800 lumens, they offer ample brightness without being too harsh. The light quality is excellent—consistent and evenly distributed, which is great for both reading and relaxing.

One of the standout features is the ability to control the bulbs remotely via the Philips Hue app or with voice commands if you’re using a smart assistant like Alexa or Google Assistant. You can adjust the brightness, set schedules, and even create lighting scenes that match your mood or activity.

Another plus is the energy efficiency. These LED bulbs use significantly less power than traditional incandescent bulbs, which helps lower your energy bills and is better for the environment.

Overall, the Philips Hue Smart 60W A19 LED Bulbs are a great choice if you’re looking to enhance your home lighting with smart features. The soft warm light, ease of use, and energy efficiency make them a solid investment. Highly recommend for anyone wanting to add smart, customizable lighting to their home!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Setup was a breeze, and the bulbs connected seamlessly to my existing Hue Bridge. Setup was a breeze, and the bulbs connected seamlessly to my existing Hue Bridge. While Hue lights definitely run on the more expensive side, their seamless integration is undeniable. I have gone with other less reliable brands and still found myself coming back to the dependability of Phillips Hue. The ability to control the lights through the app or via voice commands with Alexa or Google adds an extra level of convenience. The range of color temperatures is impressive, allowing me to set the perfect mood for any occasion. Whether it's warm light for relaxing evenings or bright, cool light in the morning for focused tasks, these bulbs deliver. The energy efficiency is a bonus, making these bulbs a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to upgrade to smart lighting.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Double Deuce,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024",I have Hue bulbs throughout my house and I couldn’t be happier with them. These white ambience and color bulbs are great for using in my table lamps and sconces. They give off plenty of light and Philips has tons of light recipes to choose from in their app so you can set the mood according to how you feel. You can also create your own light setting. These light will work with Bluetooth or for a full slate of settings you can connect them with the Hue bridge. If you are going to use more than 10 lights then you must use the bridge. I love these lights and highly recommend them. They aren’t cheap but they are worth it especially if you are just starting out with smart lighting as no other company offers you the quality and variety of lights that Philips does. If you use Apple HomeKit these work great. They also connect to Alexa and Google Assistant for voice control. I personally prefer the security and the user interface of Apple but I have tried it with Alexa as well and was happy with the results. You can’t go wrong with these lights. They work great straight out of the box. Setup is a breeze and you can start using them within minutes. I like that I can program them to turn on when it senses me coming up the driveway so I never have to enter a dark house. You can also set them to turn on and off according to whatever schedule you want. They are truly amazing. Once you buy one you will want more and more of them.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Sean M.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2024","After something like 7 years one of my Hue bulbs wouldn’t show blue colors. Annoying given the price but it far exceeded the expected lifespan. So back to Amazon for a replacement. We’ve switched almost all of our lights over to the Hue system and are very happy with it. The light is nice. The system has gotten much more stable over time, and integrates well with home assistants. Lastly, in my experience they really do work well and last a long time, which makes the premium price go down a little easier. Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Barista143,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2022","I can’t say enough how much I can’t stand Alexa with smart lights. It is honestly the worst “smart” anything I have ever used. Alexa can control smart lights like an infant can control their bowel movements.

I have tried multiple companies, multiples lights, wyze, Phillips, Sengled and after 6 months of Alexa losing connectivity and constantly have to reset, re-pair, reboot wifi, reboot Alexa, reboot life, I finally found the issue.

It is ALEXA!!

Alexa is an awful, absolutely awful way to make your home “smart”.

I’ll give you an example. When I finally got my fill of “cheap” lights like Sengled, I decided to try the higher priced lights, Phillips in this case.

Highly rated, great lights. “Work with Alexa only, no hub needed!”.

Sounds to good to be true? Yes! Because it is!

I added all my Phillips lights, everything was perfect. All my routines for sunset and sunrise were working.

It was as great as the Sengled lights were, for about 1 week. THEN, just like with any smart light you will pair with Alexa, connectivity is lost. ALWAYS, LOST. ALWAYS!

No matter what you do. Lost.

Sent Amazon customer support a message. No help.
Sent Phillips a message, they said the issue was with Alexa. Same as Sengled said!!

I immediately returned the Phillips lights and then what happens. When you add ANY Phillips light to Alexa, it will stay with you until you die.

I tried to delete the lights from Phillips. They said the issue is with Alexa. I contacted Amazon. They said the issue is with Phillips!!!

So now, EVERY TIME I add ONE smart light, ALL EIGHT of the old Phillips lights try to re add AGAIN!

So instead of one device being added, it’s NINE LIGHTS. I have to delete any time I change anything on Alexa. ANY DANG TIME.

If I lose connective and fix it, 9 lights.
If I have to add them again, 9 lights.

So if you want to purchase a smart lighting system, stay AWAY from Sengled and stay AWAY from ALEXA.

Alexa is good at telling you the time. Not making your house “smart”. It will surely make your house “dumb” though.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Ca,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2024",I’ve own the same bulbs for over ten years and they still work perfectly. So I ordered more for new lamps we recently bought. Easy to set up and easy to control.,5.0 out of 5 stars
DVJ Luna,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2022","Ever since I went to a large electronics retail store near me to get something totally different than these bulbs and saw the Philips Hue demonstrated in concert with what I was looking for, I was hooked on them. I have them throughout my home and have them in my office at work. I have about 30 of them in my house and 10 of them in my office. To say the least, I am more than satisfied with the Philips Hue products.

Now the review…

Philips have been making bulbs for many years and then when they broke into the industry of smart wifi bulbs, they became quite the hit. Pair the hue bulbs with the Hue Bridge and the app, one’s creative side can really shine.

The Build Quality.

These bulbs have a little heft to them whereas there is a lot of technology that needs to be crammed into a space the size … well the size of a light bulb. The build quality in my opinion is pretty solid and done well. The illumination part diffuses the LEDs used in these bulbs are very smooth and do not see any hot spots whatsoever from the LEDS inside. The colors produced from the RGB LEDS are pretty rich and vibrant but as in every RGB style bulb, the light output will vary from color to color and different white temperatures. Case in point. If you choose the bulbs to light up in blue, the overall Lumens factor will be less than if you choose to use Yellow or other bright colors of the spectrum. But if you go with the white ambiance aspect, the whites will pretty much be equal in Lumens factor from the lower temperature like 2700K to the higher temperatures like 6500k.

Features.

These bulbs are full of them when you connect them with the Hue bridge. You can have them turn on and off with the use of Google Home, Assistant or Alexa. You can turn them on or off with the use of the user-friendly app and even turn them on or off when you are out and about as long as you have the app connected to the cloud server set up within your smart home. You can set up various different scenes as long as you have multiple Hue Bulbs. Scenes really don’t look great or seems simplistic if you have just one bulb. To get the best results, I recommend 5 or more of the Hue Bulbs in a room to get the different color scenes to show off well. (Refer to the bedroom pic I posted with this review.)
The latest versions of the Hue Bulbs can be operated via Bluetooth on the dedicated Bluetooth version of the Hue app. So, with bulbs having the Bluetooth technology, you do not need to have the Hue Bridge. The downside to that is you will not be able to set up multiple rooms and you can only control 10 Hue Bulbs via Bluetooth vs. up to 50 Hue Bulbs with using the Hue Bridge.
If there is anything that would be considered a downfall to these bulbs, is they are a bit on the pricy side. I have a few thousand dollars invested in my Hue Echo System and love everything about these bulbs. That would be the only flaw I can find with them.

The Recap.

These are some of the top of the line of smart bulbs. Can you find cheaper bulbs as far as costs is concerned? Yes, you can. But the saying goes, “You get what you pay for.” And that holds true with these bulbs. If you are willing to invest into the Hue System, you won’t be disappointed.",5.0 out of 5 stars
nikkolaus,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024","I'm happy with my new lights. Been running them for about a year, and the only negative that I have to say about them is that it's hard to balance between a high lumen output. You don't want too blue, and you don't want too yellow, and it's hard to find that in-between. I got these because I love to have the ability to change to a color of my choice to help with things like sleep, migraines, and motivation.

Several studies, including one conducted in 2016, found that green light significantly decreased light sensitivity and reduced the intensity of headaches in migraine sufferers. In contrast, blue light, which is prevalent in many modern light sources like LED screens, has been shown to exacerbate migraine pain due to its higher energy and shorter wavelength.

When I wake up in the morning I like to have the lights a nice soft-blue, at 25-40% brightness, until my eyes can adjust. With these lights and the app that PH has, it's easy. You can even set timers to make the lights fade-in, so it's not a sudden blast as soon as your alarm clock goes off. Other times I don't want to turn the lights completely off because I want to watch a movie and still be able to see around the room when I need to get up and use the bathroom or something without opening the app to turn the lights back on or up brighter. So, in that instance, i sent the light to a dim blue light at 8-10% brightness. The real problem with these LED lights lies in the app, which is a bit slow when it comes to connecting to the lights each time you open the app, but it gets there, just have to be patient. Every time you open the app it will do a remote connection to each light individually, and check their status, essentially. Sometimes it happens where the app will see 2 of the LED light bulbs, but the third one it just doesn't connect to for ~30 seconds. Sometimes you even have to fully close the app then try to ping that light again.

The physical size difference between a standard light bulb and the PH LED bulbs is noticeable but barely an issue; They fit just fine. They're just slightly taller or same size as other compact LEDs and traditional filament bulbs, but shorter than the A21.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I recently added the Philips Hue Smart 60W A19 LED Bulb 3-Pack to my growing smart home setup, and I must say, they're a fantastic addition. While the initial price might seem a bit steep, I've found that collecting them over time allows for maximum savings without breaking the bank all at once.

Nefrai Laysh,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2021","I love these lights, I use 6 A19 bulbs and 4 BR30 bulbs for the kitchen. I have the 6 bulbs spread between 2 bedrooms and a bathroom.
I started getting these in 2018, and have bought a couple more each year. So far, I have had no issues. I see some low reviews for Google Assistant, I can't say anything on the Google stuff - I use the Hue Hub and Echo Show/Echo dots.

Using Hue Hub and Echo, I've so far never had a connection issue with these bulbs, like I have had with cheaper bulbs I tried in the past. I have bedroom lights set to turn on when my alarm goes off, and they have never failed so far. Echo and Hub both find the lights right away, and I can set routines with either app. I never bothered to look at the instructions the bulbs come with, if you have connected any smart devices to apps before, there isn't much to it. Turn on the bulb, and Echo/Hub will find it. Just note that if you have a power outage, the bulbs will typically turn themselves ON when power is back...that can be a little jarring at 3am! You can also set the bulb to remember it's last setting, so if you flick off/on the light switch (normally leave the switch ON all the time), it will turn on at the same color/brightness it was last.

I use the base wattage bulbs, and they have been perfect for me, but I generally keep my lights lower, such as 10% for bedroom lighting, and around 60% for my kitchen. At 100%, it's more than bright enough for me. Colors look great, and make my home office way more comfortable. Using a setting like ""energize"" in the office helps my eyes feel less sore, I'm big on setting just the right color for working.

I have given these lights a 5, because I have never had an issue with the 10 total I have (and may be getting 4 more today), I've never had an issue between these bulbs and my phone apps Echo/Hue Hub, lighting is great and color is what I wanted in a bulb. I love smart-lights, and after testing cheaper ones, these have been much easter to work with (in my experience), and unlike my old ones they have always stayed connected to my apps. 3 years so far with never having to reconnect is a win for me. Just bear in mind, I can only speak to using Echo and Hue Hub with them.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The range of colors available is truly impressive, allowing me to create the perfect ambiance for any occasion.

The ease of control is another standout feature. Using the Phillips Hue app, I can effortlessly adjust the brightness, switch colors, or set lighting schedules right from my smartphone. It’s not just convenient; it adds a layer of fun and interactivity to my daily routine.

One of the best aspects is the integration with smart home systems. Being able to control the lights with voice commands through my smart home assistant has been a game-changer. It’s not just about turning the lights on or off; it’s about crafting an environment that suits my mood or the task at hand.

They're so bright and cheerful, they make me feel like I'm waking up on a tropical island instead of in my dingy apartment. And if I ever need to set the mood for a romantic evening, I just dim those bad boys down low and boom! Instant ambience. My only complaint is that they're not great for taking selfies, but I guess you can't have everything.

Here’s what changed my life though. I haven’t touched my light switch SINCE buying these bad boys. Dear golly you hook these lights up on your phone and a Apple HomePod your house turns to heaven. “Hey siri turn on lights” BOOM, let there be light.. “hey siri turn off light” BOOM your back in the dark ages. “Hey siri turn the lights red at 20%” BOOM bring out the rose pedals and champagne. If you got the dough the make your whole house full of these you can separate the lights into rooms. So “siri turn on kitchen lights/ porch lights/ bedroom lights/ have a disco party in the bathroom.” Whatever you need. hate getting in/out of bed and messing with the lights? Have Siri do it. You ever walk outside your house or apartment to see you left the lights on? Scroll down on your phone and Tap the lights and BOOM theyre off. No need to go back inside or waste energy.

dezandseth,"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2020","Some friends had a few of these Hue color changing bulbs and at first i thought it was kinda gimmicky. I'm not one to get too much into techy gadgets but my wife and i decided to give it a try. Now i'm addicted and have 6 of the philips hue color changing bulbs in the living room, 1 of the color changing rope lights around the back of the tv, and 2 of the philips hue white bulbs in the bedroom.

They are AWESOME.

Aside from being fun to change the colors manually, you can choose from a bunch of preset color ""themes"". You can also create your own color theme and save it as a preset. There's also something called the Philips Hue Labs and that has various features you can use too, some of which i'll probably never use but some are useful.

One feature we really like is the ability to set ""routines"" which is basically a timer for the lights. You can set routines to do the same on/off every day, every other day, any combination of days and times, and it has a ""random"" feature that mixes up the on/off time so it's not exactly the same every time. We were using the inexpensive plastic white mechanical timers plugged in to outlets and lamps, but those are a thing of the past now. I just set up a bunch of routines if we go out of town. So so so good.

So there you go. We LOVE these lights. The app you get is also excellent and easy to set up and navigate.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Chris,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2023","When I initially got into smart lights I would stick to ""knock off"" brands that can work with the Lumia software (for streamers, but I mostly use it for the house) but those just dd't have a quick enough response time. When Halloween came around I decided to add a Hue kit with a hub in my arsenal, and I further beefed up my lineup with four more bulbs in this order. Finally I have been able to sequence lightning strikes with sound effects, sudden rapid color changes and a whole set of fun effects. When not being used for effects, these lights illuminate my porch with a realistic yet not too distracting flame effect. I've also delved into the Phillips Hue Sync app, which can sync the lights with contents on a screen, which has greatly helped in adding a ""jazzy"" touch to my gaming content. I am truly pleased with these despite their steeper price.",5.0 out of 5 stars

B Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2022","I clearly like these things. I’ve collected over 14 of them over the years. One of my favorite features (outside of the colors) is its ability to fake that I’m at home whenever I’m away. Both through your choice home assistant or through the Hue app, you can setup customized away modes.

I got theses for my Halloween decorations. I have a lot of outdoor lights and I wanted to add a little something extra for yard. These are great at setting a mood while still providing some safety lighting around the property. Now, they are not recommended for outdoor use and your individual mileage may vary, but I was willing to risk it and installed them onto a few fixtures. Since then, I haven’t noticed any issues nor do I really anticipate any so long as they stay relatively dry.

I’m using them for Halloween decorations but they will easily transition to Christmas decorations after Nov. 1st.",5.0 out of 5 stars
S Henry,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2023","I got these today and already have them setup and running with Alexa. I love Phillips Hue lights! The setup and maintenance is nearly effortless but the main reason I use Phillips is because back when I was first getting into smart lighting I found out that each smart bulb I plugged in pinged my WiFi individually, eating up valuable data. With Phillips the bulbs ping the hub so the hub only pings the Wifi. This may not seem like much until I considered all the additional plugs, pet feeders, and doorbell not to mention my regular devices; PC, tablet, etc. Now that I've used Phillip's Hue lights for over a year I won't ever use anything else.

electonics hobbyist,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2022","I bought two of these to add to the ones I already had. I don't do anything fancy, basically use them on a timed schedule. On before sunset and off at sunrise. Once you have the Hue bridge, then this is the cheapest remote control lighting solution. The other plus is that I do not want another account on the cloud, like almost all the other solutions, that can be hacked into.
The plan was to add these to my outdoor lamp fixtures. I had already set up my time schedule for the bulbs I already had. To make things easy, I plugged each one into a lamp socket indoors, then added them using their serial number and the Hue bridge found them in seconds.
I added them to the existing scene, tested to see if the would turn on and off and after that I went outdoors to screw them into the outdoor lamp sockets.
The whole procedure took less than 10 minutes. Could not be happier.

The default app's settings are very simple and only take several minutes to explore and get used to.

I saw some reviews before I purchased about how much of a pain it was to use with Alexa. I don't know what they were on about! I screwed mine in together, and she immediately recognized them, but I missed her prompt to connect them to her. Ahh! Minor panic. I said jokingly, not wanting to look up the instructions, ""Alexa? Do you sense any smart lights around?""
""I do. Philips Smart Hue lights. Would you like to add them?"" Crisis averted! Technology is honestly so amazing.
As far as having Alexa control them when I ask her, it's been a game changer. As someone with movement difficulty, sometimes it's not an option to get back up and walk back to the light switch if I forgot to turn it on or off. This has saved me so much time and pain!

They are pricey, but they work perfectly with Alexa, no third party app which is a big deal if you've ever had to deal with a third party app for your lights. The fact I can not only turn on my lights with my voice, coming home at night its the best cause I don't have to leave on any lights and as soon as I open the door I say to Alexa, Alexa its dark in here and the one light I set up for that saying turns on right by the door. I use the color to attract the kids when they are in their rooms. Its better then yelling across the house. I can also use the Alexa echo's as intercoms but the light thing is the easiest to do and it doesn't stop my music on my echo. If you can budget for these instead of the cheapos that require that third party app, I would suggest it.

I use them in my bedroom to automatically turn on when getting ready for bed and turn off after a preset time period. I like the fade feature after five minutes to gently turn off the lights.

Also, the Philips hue are easy to reset, like if you change your network name. In the Alexa app, you just select the Philips light. In the upper-right hand corner is a help icon.

Setup is easy and quick. The bulbs work reliably with the hub. The hub, bulbs, and accessories receive occasional software updates which are important for security and functionality improvements.

I am using a couple of blubs behind my PC monitor with the Philips Hue Sync program and it works well. I have 19 bulbs in total around my home and am pretty happy with them. Using my phone and app control has been totally reliable. I also have them linked to my Goole assistant and that works pretty well but sometimes there seems to be a problem between Google and Philips because the assistant will say it is having a problem reaching Hue and you will need to retry a command.

One of the standout features is the ability to control the bulbs remotely via the Philips Hue app or with voice commands if you’re using a smart assistant like Alexa or Google Assistant. You can adjust the brightness, set schedules, and even create lighting scenes that match your mood or activity.

Another plus is the energy efficiency. These LED bulbs use significantly less power than traditional incandescent bulbs, which helps lower your energy bills and is better for the environment.

Overall, the Philips Hue Smart 60W A19 LED Bulbs are a great choice if you’re looking to enhance your home lighting with smart features. The soft warm light, ease of use, and energy efficiency make them a solid investment. Highly recommend for anyone wanting to add smart, customizable lighting to their home!",5.0 out of 5 stars

The light is nice. The system has gotten much more stable over time, and integrates well with home assistants.

Ann,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2024","The Philips Hue Smart 60W A19 LED Bulb offers soft, warm white light and smart connectivity for enhanced home lighting. With 800 lumens, the brightness is sufficient for most settings, though it may not be as bright as some might prefer. The bulbs are energy-efficient and compatible with various fixtures due to the E26 base.

These bulbs work seamlessly with Alexa, allowing for easy voice control and integration into a smart home setup. However, they sometimes have connection issues, which can require resetting. Despite this, the bulbs are a decent addition for anyone looking to integrate smart lighting into their home, combining modern features with a cozy ambiance.",4.0 out of 5 stars

nikkolaus,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024","I'm happy with my new lights. Been running them for about a year, and the only negative that I have to say about them is that it's hard to balance between a high lumen output. You don't want too blue, and you don't want too yellow, and it's hard to find that in-between. I got these because I love to have the ability to change to a color of my choice to help with things like sleep, migraines, and motivation.

Several studies, including one conducted in 2016, found that green light significantly decreased light sensitivity and reduced the intensity of headaches in migraine sufferers. In contrast, blue light, which is prevalent in many modern light sources like LED screens, has been shown to exacerbate migraine pain due to its higher energy and shorter wavelength.

When I wake up in the morning I like to have the lights a nice soft-blue, at 25-40% brightness, until my eyes can adjust. With these lights and the app that PH has, it's easy. You can even set timers to make the lights fade-in, so it's not a sudden blast as soon as your alarm clock goes off. Other times I don't want to turn the lights completely off because I want to watch a movie and still be able to see around the room when I need to get up and use the bathroom or something without opening the app to turn the lights back on or up brighter. So, in that instance, i sent the light to a dim blue light at 8-10% brightness. The real problem with these LED lights lies in the app, which is a bit slow when it comes to connecting to the lights each time you open the app, but it gets there, just have to be patient. Every time you open the app it will do a remote connection to each light individually, and check their status, essentially. Sometimes it happens where the app will see 2 of the LED light bulbs, but the third one it just doesn't connect to for ~30 seconds. Sometimes you even have to fully close the app then try to ping that light again.

The physical size difference between a standard light bulb and the PH LED bulbs is noticeable but barely an issue; They fit just fine. They're just slightly taller or same size as other compact LEDs and traditional filament bulbs, but shorter than the A21.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I only have 3 of these bulbs, one I just bought within the last year, and at $50 a piece they honestly are terrible. Before this they always disconnected. I have 6 bulbs from GE CYNC that I purchased about 3 months ago, they’re half the price and they seriously NEVER disconnect, even when the power goes out they reconnect themselves.

Double Deuce,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024",I have Hue bulbs throughout my house and I couldn’t be happier with them. These white ambience and color bulbs are great for using in my table lamps and sconces. They give off plenty of light and Philips has tons of light recipes to choose from in their app so you can set the mood according to how you feel. You can also create your own light setting. These light will work with Bluetooth or for a full slate of settings you can connect them with the Hue bridge. If you are going to use more than 10 lights then you must use the bridge. I love these lights and highly recommend them. They aren’t cheap but they are worth it especially if you are just starting out with smart lighting as no other company offers you the quality and variety of lights that Philips does. If you use Apple HomeKit these work great. They also connect to Alexa and Google Assistant for voice control. I personally prefer the security and the user interface of Apple but I have tried it with Alexa as well and was happy with the results. You can’t go wrong with these lights. They work great straight out of the box. Setup is a breeze and you can start using them within minutes. I like that I can program them to turn on when it senses me coming up the driveway so I never have to enter a dark house. You can also set them to turn on and off according to whatever schedule you want. They are truly amazing. Once you buy one you will want more and more of them.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Sean M.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2024","After something like 7 years one of my Hue bulbs wouldn’t show blue colors. Annoying given the price but it far exceeded the expected lifespan. So back to Amazon for a replacement. We’ve switched almost all of our lights over to the Hue system and are very happy with it. The light is nice. The system has gotten much more stable over time, and integrates well with home assistants. Lastly, in my experience they really do work well and last a long time, which makes the premium price go down a little easier. Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars

It was pricey compared to other bands, but the customer and expert reviews were excellent. So I purchased a Hue hub and 4 bulbs. They started burning out after almost 3 years, so I went to order more and cheaper ones popped up. They worked for a week and wouldn't stay connected. I returned them and paid a bit more for Hue bulbs and I'll never go back to the bargain bulbs.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Barista143,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2022","I can’t say enough how much I can’t stand Alexa with smart lights. It is honestly the worst “smart” anything I have ever used. Alexa can control smart lights like an infant can control their bowel movements.

I have tried multiple companies, multiples lights, wyze, Phillips, Sengled and after 6 months of Alexa losing connectivity and constantly have to reset, re-pair, reboot wifi, reboot Alexa, reboot life, I finally found the issue.

It is ALEXA!!

Alexa is an awful, absolutely awful way to make your home “smart”.

I’ll give you an example. When I finally got my fill of “cheap” lights like Sengled, I decided to try the higher priced lights, Phillips in this case.

Highly rated, great lights. “Work with Alexa only, no hub needed!”.

Sounds to good to be true? Yes! Because it is!

I added all my Phillips lights, everything was perfect. All my routines for sunset and sunrise were working.

It was as great as the Sengled lights were, for about 1 week. THEN, just like with any smart light you will pair with Alexa, connectivity is lost. ALWAYS, LOST. ALWAYS!

No matter what you do. Lost.

Sent Amazon customer support a message. No help.
Sent Phillips a message, they said the issue was with Alexa. Same as Sengled said!!

I immediately returned the Phillips lights and then what happens. When you add ANY Phillips light to Alexa, it will stay with you until you die.

I tried to delete the lights from Phillips. They said the issue is with Alexa. I contacted Amazon. They said the issue is with Phillips!!!

So now, EVERY TIME I add ONE smart light, ALL EIGHT of the old Phillips lights try to re add AGAIN!

So instead of one device being added, it’s NINE LIGHTS. I have to delete any time I change anything on Alexa. ANY DANG TIME.

If I lose connective and fix it, 9 lights.
If I have to add them again, 9 lights.

So if you want to purchase a smart lighting system, stay AWAY from Sengled and stay AWAY from ALEXA.

Alexa is good at telling you the time. Not making your house “smart”. It will surely make your house “dumb” though.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Ca,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2024",I’ve own the same bulbs for over ten years and they still work perfectly. So I ordered more for new lamps we recently bought. Easy to set up and easy to control.,5.0 out of 5 stars
DVJ Luna,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2022","Ever since I went to a large electronics retail store near me to get something totally different than these bulbs and saw the Philips Hue demonstrated in concert with what I was looking for, I was hooked on them. I have them throughout my home and have them in my office at work. I have about 30 of them in my house and 10 of them in my office. To say the least, I am more than satisfied with the Philips Hue products.

Now the review…

Philips have been making bulbs for many years and then when they broke into the industry of smart wifi bulbs, they became quite the hit. Pair the hue bulbs with the Hue Bridge and the app, one’s creative side can really shine.

The Build Quality.

These bulbs have a little heft to them whereas there is a lot of technology that needs to be crammed into a space the size … well the size of a light bulb. The build quality in my opinion is pretty solid and done well. The illumination part diffuses the LEDs used in these bulbs are very smooth and do not see any hot spots whatsoever from the LEDS inside. The colors produced from the RGB LEDS are pretty rich and vibrant but as in every RGB style bulb, the light output will vary from color to color and different white temperatures. Case in point. If you choose the bulbs to light up in blue, the overall Lumens factor will be less than if you choose to use Yellow or other bright colors of the spectrum. But if you go with the white ambiance aspect, the whites will pretty much be equal in Lumens factor from the lower temperature like 2700K to the higher temperatures like 6500k.

Features.

These bulbs are full of them when you connect them with the Hue bridge. You can have them turn on and off with the use of Google Home, Assistant or Alexa. You can turn them on or off with the use of the user-friendly app and even turn them on or off when you are out and about as long as you have the app connected to the cloud server set up within your smart home. You can set up various different scenes as long as you have multiple Hue Bulbs. Scenes really don’t look great or seems simplistic if you have just one bulb. To get the best results, I recommend 5 or more of the Hue Bulbs in a room to get the different color scenes to show off well. (Refer to the bedroom pic I posted with this review.)
The latest versions of the Hue Bulbs can be operated via Bluetooth on the dedicated Bluetooth version of the Hue app. So, with bulbs having the Bluetooth technology, you do not need to have the Hue Bridge. The downside to that is you will not be able to set up multiple rooms and you can only control 10 Hue Bulbs via Bluetooth vs. up to 50 Hue Bulbs with using the Hue Bridge.
If there is anything that would be considered a downfall to these bulbs, is they are a bit on the pricy side. I have a few thousand dollars invested in my Hue Echo System and love everything about these bulbs. That would be the only flaw I can find with them.

The Recap.

These are some of the top of the line of smart bulbs. Can you find cheaper bulbs as far as costs is concerned? Yes, you can. But the saying goes, “You get what you pay for.” And that holds true with these bulbs. If you are willing to invest into the Hue System, you won’t be disappointed.",5.0 out of 5 stars
nikkolaus,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024","I'm happy with my new lights. Been running them for about a year, and the only negative that I have to say about them is that it's hard to balance between a high lumen output. You don't want too blue, and you don't want too yellow, and it's hard to find that in-between. I got these because I love to have the ability to change to a color of my choice to help with things like sleep, migraines, and motivation.

Several studies, including one conducted in 2016, found that green light significantly decreased light sensitivity and reduced the intensity of headaches in migraine sufferers. In contrast, blue light, which is prevalent in many modern light sources like LED screens, has been shown to exacerbate migraine pain due to its higher energy and shorter wavelength.

When I wake up in the morning I like to have the lights a nice soft-blue, at 25-40% brightness, until my eyes can adjust. With these lights and the app that PH has, it's easy. You can even set timers to make the lights fade-in, so it's not a sudden blast as soon as your alarm clock goes off. Other times I don't want to turn the lights completely off because I want to watch a movie and still be able to see around the room when I need to get up and use the bathroom or something without opening the app to turn the lights back on or up brighter. So, in that instance, i sent the light to a dim blue light at 8-10% brightness. The real problem with these LED lights lies in the app, which is a bit slow when it comes to connecting to the lights each time you open the app, but it gets there, just have to be patient. Every time you open the app it will do a remote connection to each light individually, and check their status, essentially. Sometimes it happens where the app will see 2 of the LED light bulbs, but the third one it just doesn't connect to for ~30 seconds. Sometimes you even have to fully close the app then try to ping that light again.

The physical size difference between a standard light bulb and the PH LED bulbs is noticeable but barely an issue; They fit just fine. They're just slightly taller or same size as other compact LEDs and traditional filament bulbs, but shorter than the A21.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Jake,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024","They’re ok. Really hard to get a decent indigo out of them and there’s no way these have as high a cri as are claimed in their advertising. I’m a warm light guy because I have a soul and stuff and don’t want to make everyone look like vampires. The warm light spectrum in these is a real color killer. It almost looks a bit fluorescent. It’s not horrible if the only white light in the room is coming from these, but if you pair them with a quality soft or warm bulb, it’s clear that they don’t hold up. (Better than lifx whites though. Big yikes there)

The colors are annoyingly muted too. When I’m creating a color scheme, I really like to get a rich indigo going for the room and something warm to light the subjects. For some reason, it seems like hue products engage the white diodes when you hit that blue to purple part of the spectrum. Lifx for colors all day every day no contest.

Nefrai Laysh,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2021","I love these lights, I use 6 A19 bulbs and 4 BR30 bulbs for the kitchen. I have the 6 bulbs spread between 2 bedrooms and a bathroom.
I started getting these in 2018, and have bought a couple more each year. So far, I have had no issues. I see some low reviews for Google Assistant, I can't say anything on the Google stuff - I use the Hue Hub and Echo Show/Echo dots.

Using Hue Hub and Echo, I've so far never had a connection issue with these bulbs, like I have had with cheaper bulbs I tried in the past. I have bedroom lights set to turn on when my alarm goes off, and they have never failed so far. Echo and Hub both find the lights right away, and I can set routines with either app. I never bothered to look at the instructions the bulbs come with, if you have connected any smart devices to apps before, there isn't much to it. Turn on the bulb, and Echo/Hub will find it. Just note that if you have a power outage, the bulbs will typically turn themselves ON when power is back...that can be a little jarring at 3am! You can also set the bulb to remember it's last setting, so if you flick off/on the light switch (normally leave the switch ON all the time), it will turn on at the same color/brightness it was last.

I use the base wattage bulbs, and they have been perfect for me, but I generally keep my lights lower, such as 10% for bedroom lighting, and around 60% for my kitchen. At 100%, it's more than bright enough for me. Colors look great, and make my home office way more comfortable. Using a setting like ""energize"" in the office helps my eyes feel less sore, I'm big on setting just the right color for working.

I have given these lights a 5, because I have never had an issue with the 10 total I have (and may be getting 4 more today), I've never had an issue between these bulbs and my phone apps Echo/Hue Hub, lighting is great and color is what I wanted in a bulb. I love smart-lights, and after testing cheaper ones, these have been much easter to work with (in my experience), and unlike my old ones they have always stayed connected to my apps. 3 years so far with never having to reconnect is a win for me.

Dean,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2023","There are a ton of things to like about these bulbs. There are lots of different presets of color combinations to choose from, you can set alarms on the lights so the lights are on by the time you have to get out of bed, and you can turn off the lights FROM bed, which is sooo nice.

There are definitely some downsides that come from having essential life items be smart devices. You have to always have your bluetooth on to use these. That means if you disconnect it on accident, or need to put on battery saver mode: you're disconnected from the lights in your home and you'll need to reconnect them before you can use them. Kind of a downer.
Also, if your phone is older than Android 10 (I'm sure there is an equivalent for Apple) you straight up cannot get the app from the store. It's just not available for you. I learned this only after buying these lights, and thankfully my partner has a newer phone and is able to control them -- but if he isn't home then I simply don't get to turn on/off the lights or alter them at all. Obviously that's a bit of a let down.
We also could not get these to connect to our Google Home no matter what we tried. Not sure if that's just because we don't have a Hub, or because our Google Home hates us, but beware it might not work for you either.

But ultimately I am glad we got these. Being able to choose the vibe of the room with the colors at any time is nice",4.0 out of 5 stars
Joshua Shlenker,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2023","I’ve recently upgraded my home lighting with Phillips Hue Color Smart Bulbs, and it’s been an absolutely transformative experience. The range of colors available is truly impressive, allowing me to create the perfect ambiance for any occasion.

The ease of control is another standout feature. Using the Phillips Hue app, I can effortlessly adjust the brightness, switch colors, or set lighting schedules right from my smartphone. It’s not just convenient; it adds a layer of fun and interactivity to my daily routine.

One of the best aspects is the integration with smart home systems. Being able to control the lights with voice commands through my smart home assistant has been a game-changer.

They're so bright and cheerful, they make me feel like I'm waking up on a tropical island instead of in my dingy apartment. And if I ever need to set the mood for a romantic evening, I just dim those bad boys down low and boom! Instant ambience. My only complaint is that they're not great for taking selfies, but I guess you can't have everything.

Here’s what changed my life though. I haven’t touched my light switch SINCE buying these bad boys. Dear golly you hook these lights up on your phone and a Apple HomePod your house turns to heaven. “Hey siri turn on lights” BOOM, let there be light.. “hey siri turn off light” BOOM your back in the dark ages. “Hey siri turn the lights red at 20%” BOOM bring out the rose pedals and champagne. If you got the dough the make your whole house full of these you can separate the lights into rooms.

Thomas H.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2021","I have been wanting Philips Hue lights for about 10 years. Since they first came out. The day finally arrived when I had some extra money.

So I was very excited to try these. But from the time I turned these on, they have been a horrible experience.

I am an IT specialist that has been using a computer for 37 years. So if I have trouble setting these up, good luck...

Just finding the app was a nightmare because Google suggests unofficial apps instead, with the Philips app nowhere to be found. I actually had to type in a URL and it still went to the wrong address at first.

Their app doesn't even work with Android Marshmallow 6, so I had to use it with another smartphone,... because???

But I had already paired the light with that phone, so then I had to go through quite an adventure to get it working with my other phone. The lightbulb simply refused to work. It ""rejected"" being unpaired/paired. I would say that took about 2 hours.

After some struggle, finally, I had the other 2 lamps working with my phone, connected, now the real challenge had begun.

The lights are not unified in the scene, so if you pick a scene, the lights will be different colors. It never explains this. So I had two lamps on my desk which -- no matter what I did, they were different colors. It was so frustrating. I literally had to manually adjust one of them to match the other. Because by default, I guess people like their lamps to be different colors??? HAHAHA

You cannot even adjust the lights at the same time. For example if you wanted the 3 lights to change to a certain color and brightness, you have to adjust each one of them separately! Hahaha, what kind of smart app is this??

The app requires location to be turned on. HAHA, I'm using Bluetooth, I am literally right here where you are.. it would be impossible to control it over bluetooth if I wasn't standing before it. What kind of ""smart"" light is this.

Why do my light bulbs need my GPS location - are you serious? My location is not Philip's business.

Second, having location turned on to use your lamps means that all apps now have location turned on.

Third, this uses a lot more battery ... for what exactly, Philips?

Every time you open your phone, it will give you a location error. ""These require location to be turned on,"" this is despite the fact that location is turned on... Luckily, it's just a momentary issue each time (a few seconds)

The lights are dim, it's like living inside a cave lit by a candle. The lights barely light themselves up. If you use scene ""Bright"" you can almost find your way around the room.

I guess they are somewhat adequate in the white settings, but leave a lot to be desired.

If you want color mode, the lights barely light themselves up. You can stare directly at the lightbulb with brightness turned to the max. Christmas tree lights are brighter than these!

I have no idea in the world how these are like $50 each.

Now let's talk about the updates. Every single time you open the app, there is some update. Seemingly because it never finishes them.

You have to update each light bulb individually!!! It won't just download the update to your phone and then begin installing to all or each light. Haha, no that would make too much sense!

It will download the update, and it takes about 12-24 hours, and if you do anything else, it will cancel the update, apparently.

It never gives you any clues like maybe you're not close enough to the light bulb, or ... what.

Is this the slowest CPU/processor in the world? Combined with the slowest storage in the world? I'm serious, it probably is! Sure, they have to cut costs somewhere, but this is absurdly slow. And you can tell because when you turn the light switch on, it takes about 2 seconds for the lights to come on!

I had left my phone on the entire night, plugged in with the screen on, and when I woke up it was still updating one of the bulbs. 8 hours later, it says ""finalizing update"" and it was stuck there. Like maybe now I can never use the light again. I am literally in the dark here. Then I realized I had it it switched off!

2 days later, now it's time to update the 2nd bulb! YAY torture!

James R.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2022","When I started incorporating smart devices into my home a few years ago, one of the earliest devices I added was a Philips Hue Bridge and two Hue color bulbs. As the years went by I added more devices from other brands, including other-brand WiFi color bulbs that were much less expensive than the Hue bulbs. However the cheaper WiFi bulbs started showing their cons, as I would experience random lost connections, every few months I had to reset one or two of them, and of all the other devices I had in my Smart Home, the WiFi bulbs were what gave me the most trouble.

Then I realized - this whole time that I've been using Smart home devices, I never - ever - had an issue with the Hue bulbs! With that in mind, I decided to pick up a pack of 4 Hue bulbs to finally get rid of the cheaper, unreliable WiFi bulbs that I couldn't stand anymore. Sure enough, with the Hue bulbs installed, I have had zero issues with the lights. If I had just stuck with Hue from the beginning I wouldn't have wasted about $80 on inferior WiFi bulbs. So if you want reliable, high-quality color bulbs for your Smart home, go with Philips Hue. They are indeed worth the premium price.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Shawn,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2023","The lights are bright and the color is very vibrant. They are also responsive.... when they work. So far, every time the internet resets or anything changes, it takes about 2 or 3 hours of playing around in the app to try and get them to work with Google home. It's advertised as ""seamless"" integration but it absolutely IS NOT. They also HEAVLY try to make you buy a $60 ""bridge"" to connect the bulbs to Google home which is outrageous, considering the older bulbs (that used Wiz) never needed a bridge and would ACTUALLY connect seamlessly. You can connect without one, but you'll be spending several hours factory resetting devices, and uninstalling and re-installing apps and sometimes, they just decide they don't wanna work right until you spend another 3 hours. Between the 3 or 4 times I've had to battle with these things to try and get Google home to be able to discover them, then actually be able to connect to them I've probably factory reset the bulbs and my Google home about 5 times before they'd show up.

Overall a nice bulb but setting up is a CHORE and the ""seamless"" integration is very misleading when they try their best to force you to buy a $60 accessory you don't actually need unless your whole house is set up with several of these things.",3.0 out of 5 stars
anon.mamut,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2019","So first let's start off with the light and not the technology. it's great wonderful colors that you can get on these bulbs and that's the best part about it. Going down to probably what is 2200 k That's a really warm orange color that allows you to really feel relaxed especially when dim down. And then you can scale that up to somewhere around 4,000 k or something a little more stimulating or if you really need some kind of bright bright color turn all the way up to 6500 k. I love that aspect about this bulbs and that's the best thing about them.

Now it's dive into why this only gets three stars. first I almost want to give this 1 and 1/2 stars for the false advertising. this does not work with the Google Assistant which is stated in this Amazon listing as well as printed on the box. It does not work with the Google Assistant. It only works with the Google home. Only way that this works with the Google Assistant is to get the Philips hub. Anyone that's buying the Bluetooth is buying it because I don't want the hub. so if I could give this two and a half stars I would because I don't like false advertising and I bought these because I wanted it to work with my Google Assistant and not have to get the hub.

Second multiple user setup is very complicated even for someone like me running my own tech company setting up advanced networks. there's conflicting information out there and I actually had to call Phillips to figure this out because even he had to ask an advanced tech because they had conflicted information in the office.

To summarize, this is a subpar beta product that should never have been released to the public. Don't advertise that it works with something when it doesn't. and for the price of these bulbs it better work with the Google Assistant and have much more seamless setup. That said, everything is in context and then the smart light world there isn't anything great yet so this is why I bumped it up to three stars and because I really do like the color and the lighting and that's where Phillip's really does come through",3.0 out of 5 stars

One of my favorites being the “fireplace” scene that’s great for winding down in the evening. This bulb paired with the Hue Go created the perfect lighting ambiance I was looking for. It’s great and simple that these two devices can be controlled simultaneously. Also, being able to create routines has helped me to wake up for those early morning workouts.

fifty50,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2019","I stayed up until 4:30 am trying to figure out how to work this new lightbulb with my new Echo Dot 3. First, you have to ignore the directions that came with the bulb. They were useless and misleading and one of the reasons I've been up half the night. No, you do not need a pricey Hue hub. You don't need the google playstore or the Apple store to download an app. You don't need to select ""Hue"" from the Alexa Skills menu and you don't need to sign up for a Hue account.

All you do is set up your Echo Dot if not already done. You should probably wait while it connects to your other devices. Then screw in the lightbulb and turn on the lamp/light fixture. At this point, Alexa should say new light found, but it didn't. I had to say ""Alexa discover devices"" Alexa named the device ""First Light"" Then I was able to say turn on first light, turn off first light, dim first light. There is a video on this page that tells you the exact same thing. This is the video to follow.

Tim,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2024","These are absolutely perfect light bulbs, especially for beginners. I would recommend these to anyone who wants a simple, easy-to-setup, basically out of the box, clean solution. If you’re starting out, with no budget constants - buy these bulbs. Otherwise, I’m not sure what the hype is all about. Yeah they’re great. But it’s a lightbulb. There’s quite a few cheaper options with pretty much the same capabilities. And yeah the App is fairly easy to navigate. But I’ve used many different apps and it’s really not my favorite. It sometimes feels like it’s made to be more complicated than it needs to be. Anyway.

I’ve checked through various bulb vendors: GE, Wink, Sylvania, Philips, Sengled, etc. They all had pros and cons, these included. If you’re more experienced, and depending on the types of bulbs you need, you can go with a cheaper brand with an easier app that is easily controlled via Alexa, Google Home or Apple Home. I rarely use a bulb vendors app to control the bulb anyway. Good luck!",3.0 out of 5 stars

Just mount the button on the wall and you basically have a switch.
As for the performance of the bulbs themselves, the color range is huge, brightness is fantastic, and you can use a darker color to dim them way down for night lights or hallway lights outside your kid's room, where you don't want the full brightness of even a 40W incandescent. The white Hue bulbs don't get quite as dim, and the new different hue colorscapes, etc. were great for our front porch on Halloween.

dezandseth,"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2020","Some friends had a few of these Hue color changing bulbs and at first i thought it was kinda gimmicky. I'm not one to get too much into techy gadgets but my wife and i decided to give it a try. Now i'm addicted and have 6 of the philips hue color changing bulbs in the living room, 1 of the color changing rope lights around the back of the tv, and 2 of the philips hue white bulbs in the bedroom.

They are AWESOME.

Aside from being fun to change the colors manually, you can choose from a bunch of preset color ""themes"". You can also create your own color theme and save it as a preset. There's also something called the Philips Hue Labs and that has various features you can use too, some of which i'll probably never use but some are useful.

One feature we really like is the ability to set ""routines"" which is basically a timer for the lights. You can set routines to do the same on/off every day, every other day, any combination of days and times, and it has a ""random"" feature that mixes up the on/off time so it's not exactly the same every time. We were using the inexpensive plastic white mechanical timers plugged in to outlets and lamps, but those are a thing of the past now. I just set up a bunch of routines if we go out of town. So so so good.

David,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2023","It used to be, and in fact still is with my old hue lights, that if you turned off the switch and turned it back on it would reset to the default white light, which I liked. Now if you flick the standard switch on and off, it diverts back to the last state, no matter what state you select in the settings of that bulb on the app. I searched far and wide as to how to correct this issue, because sometimes instead of going to my app to turn a light on that i turned off using my app, I just want a fast way to turn the light on, which used to just be flick the standard light switch on and off. I turns out, you can still do this, but you need to count 20 seconds after you flick the switch off, and the light will turn on when you flick the switch on again.

To explain more, when all the lights are off and i flick the standard switch on and off fast, only my old lights turn on. The new lights remain off, unless I wait 20 seconds before flicking the switch on. I don't know who thought that would be better.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I got theses for my Halloween decorations. I have a lot of outdoor lights and I wanted to add a little something extra for yard. These are great at setting a mood while still providing some safety lighting around the property.

With Phillips the bulbs ping the hub so the hub only pings the Wifi.

The plan was to add these to my outdoor lamp fixtures. I had already set up my time schedule for the bulbs I already had. To make things easy, I plugged each one into a lamp socket indoors, then added them using their serial number and the Hue bridge found them in seconds.
I added them to the existing scene, tested to see if the would turn on and off and after that I went outdoors to screw them into the outdoor lamp sockets.

Steve from Boston,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2022","These bulbs were a little tricky to set up in the Hue app using Bluetooth, mostly due to an unstable Bluetooth connection. The app offers lots of control, once you figure out how it works. But for the life of me, I couldn't make it connect to my Google Home speaker. Google tech support knew a lot and spent lots of time on the phone with me, but we couldn't solve it. Phillips tech support was pretty close to useless. Finally, I figured out that there's a setting in the Hue app that makes the bulb discoverable. I'd tell you where it is, but I can't find it again. Anyway, once I made it discoverable, the Google Home app found it right away and connected it by Bluetooth to my speaker. It seemed pretty good for the first day.
.
Over time, I came to understand that my Bluetooth connections were extremely unstable, both between my phone and the bulbs and between the Google Home speaker and the bulbs. Every time a bulb lost a connection, it dimmed and then came back on. It gets old and annoying right away. After a day of this nonsense, my Google speaker lost its grip and never succeeded in doing anything with either of the bulbs. After a couple of days, I gave up and ordered a pair of GE ""Cync"" bulbs, which set up without a hitch and seem to be working great at a fraction of the cost.

Tara,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2020","These are so worth it. They are pricey, but they work perfectly with Alexa, no third party app which is a big deal if you've ever had to deal with a third party app for your lights. The fact I can not only turn on my lights with my voice, coming home at night its the best cause I don't have to leave on any lights and as soon as I open the door I say to Alexa, Alexa its dark in here and the one light I set up for that saying turns on right by the door. I use the color to attract the kids when they are in their rooms. Its better then yelling across the house. I can also use the Alexa echo's as intercoms but the light thing is the easiest to do and it doesn't stop my music on my echo. If you can budget for these instead of the cheapos that require that third party app, I would suggest it. If not, those cheapos, which I have one that's just whites, warm white to cool white, and it works just fine, but if given the choice, I would go with the Philips Hue brand.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Rachel LePine,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2023","The specifications on this page outline that these bulbs are indoor/outdoor use. They are NOT outdoor compatible. I put mine in an outdoor light post that is covered and protected from the elements (doesn't get wet or dirty). The light bulb died within 2 months (bought end of July and it died 2 weeks ago). I reached out to Phillips on Facebook and they just stated the description is wrong but did not offer any help/compensation.

I love the bulbs and have a ton of Philips products throughout my home, which is only why this is getting 3 stars. I'd give it a 1 if I could since I'm out $30 (technically $80 since I would not have bought the pack of 3) due to their incorrect information provided but do like their products overall and compatibility with my Alexa devices.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Terry L,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2022","Ok, I said seamless. It does take a little effort to learn how to setup the bulbs in the app, link to Alexa and to other control apps.

I have more than 28 devices in my Smart Home. I have tried numerous bulbs from different manufacturers. My first set of bulbs came with the hub. Once I had the bulbs connected to the hub and configured in the Hue app and in Alexa, I haven't experienced any issues that were common with other bulb types.

I use them in my bedroom to automatically turn on when getting ready for bed and turn off after a preset time period. I like the fade feature after five minutes to gently turn off the lights. I can easily control them with a command to Alexa, use the Hue app, my Samsung Smart Things app on my phone and even on my watch!",5.0 out of 5 stars

David Godin,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2023","The software app is easy to use and the bulbs work great. Eliminates the need for dimmer switches. You can turn on the lights from anywhere, making it look like you are home. Amazing technology.",5.0 out of 5 stars
