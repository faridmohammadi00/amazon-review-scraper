Bruce E. Munck,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2024","Hue first impressions. The box arrived a few minutes ago and it felt heavier than I expected it to, but maybe, I thought, that was because of the included bridge. Upon opening the box I found three bulbs packaged beside each other. I removed the upper cardboard piece and below it was the fourth bulb along with the bridge, power supply, cords, and instructions. This was where I realized that the weight wasn't only the bridge: these bulbs are wonderfully heavy! I have a pack of four Fovaa bulbs and the whole pack doesn't weigh as much as a single Hue bulb. I haven't even put power to a Hue bulb yet and I already feel confident in what I have purchased. Next I opened the instruction booklet; and as professional as everything else in the box feels, I was disappointed with the instructions. They are basically a collection of stick drawings with no textual guidance whatsoever. I was not daunted, though, since there is so much help available online.

The Hue bulbs are more expensive than the bargain brands and I wondered why until I began researching them. Philips uses Zigbee radios in their bulbs and bridges which increases the cost significantly. And after holding one of the bulbs in my hand I could actually feel the difference in quality compared to the other bulbs that I own (Fovaa). Until I actually put these bulbs into service I can't comment on their function, but I expect to be very satisfied with them. My Fovaa bulbs work very well, although when set to blue or green they are not as bright as I think they should be. I am expecting much better brightness with the Hue bulbs. I have read that Wyze makes some really good bulbs in terms of color output that rival the Hue bulbs. Still, the Hue bulbs are constructed differently and are able to do some things that the others evidently cannot do. Once I have these lights going and I have a chance to put them through their paces I will report back with some updates. I'm anxious to try a simulated fireworks display and am hoping that four bulbs are enough to do it. Some of the scenes and animations require more than four bulbs to get the color mixtures right, but I think that a fireworks display could be done using white plus three other colors. At least a small fireworks display. I'll let you know when I have tried it.

Edit 2-12-2024
OK, I have the lights up and running and I can give you a little more insight now. First of all, if you look at the many photos of Hue lights you will know exactly what to expect in terms of color. These bulbs have colors that are full and rich yet are mellowed a bit as they are made to provide ambience to a space instead of producing stark coloring. You can get very deep blues, greens, and reds, and still have good brightness. A word that comes to mind is pastel, and yet the colors can be much deeper than pastel; in fact, the room color can become very red, very blue, very green, and yet still maintain some small bit of pastel quality. Again, I'd say look at a lot of the available pictures and you will know. In contrast to this, my Fovaa bulbs give very dark blues, reds, greens with no mellowing at all. There is no way to brighten the Fovaa bulbs when those colors are cranked to the maximum and maybe that is as it should be. Then again, I have read articles that claim Wyze bulbs have more intense colors than Fovaa bulbs (in fact they are ranked close to the top of all bulbs in that category) and also have more brightness; so it may be more a matter of design. If you want absolute, saturated, bright colors with no compromise you might want to try the Wyze bulbs; however, if you want lights that are tailor made for enhancing the atmosphere of your living spaces I can't imagine a better choice than Hue lights. I want to reiterate here just how good the bulbs feel in the hand, and after screwing them in and setting them up how good they look in action. Something else to touch on is that there are numerous apps available in addition to the official Hue app that can add to the functions your Hue lights can perform. The fireworks display I referred to above is in one of those apps: the app is called ""hueDynamic"" and the fireworks is under the Experiences heading. The fireworks display cycles your bulb colors mimicking real fireworks. The colors ramp on and off at speeds that seem realistic and your room is bathed in a frenzied display of light. Now that I have tried it I probably won't ever use it again, but hey, these lights can do that! Some other, more restful effects on the menu are flickering candles and a fireplace. If I actually had a fireplace I could see myself using that to enhance the natural flicker of flames. The candles...maybe I will use that one, maybe not. The animations can actually be rather distracting. The ambience settings are probably the most useful, but I should tell you that it is better to have the bulbs located next to walls so that the reflected light can add to the overall effect. I have mine temporarily in a ceiling fan in the middle of the living room and looking up at the light you can see all four bulbs with different colors and it doesn't look so good. Eventually they will be relocated to individual lamps around the room where they should provide a much better experience.

If you buy any bulbs other than Hue bulbs you will be tied to one single app: the official app from the manufacturer of the bulbs. Or you may be limited to tying in to Alexa and the set of skills available because your choice of bulbs doesn't even have an app. With Hue bulbs you have many choices of apps, and you will find that Hue apps, even the third party apps, have a level of professionalism not found in apps for other bulbs. Yes, Hue bulbs cost more...but you will get what you paid for. Top quality, great looking light, an almost endless list of ways to use them; Hue bulbs are probably the very best you can buy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
mgf_db5,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024","I use this primarily for rotating illumination when nobody is at home (using the App's Automation feature). It is easy to setup the Bridge and update the firmware. For ease of identification, I recommend setting up one bulb at a time. The App (for Android) works very well. I use it for three rooms and a carport. If need be, it is easy to override Automation. It is well thought out and simple to control.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Kyle Margerum,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2020","I’ve wanted some of the lights for a long time!

This is actually my second shipment of the same product, because the wall plug was bent on the first one. Amazon sent me a new one, and it works like a dream.

Let me start by saying I put these lights in my bedroom and bathroom. My bathroom has a slot for four lights, but I only put two in. I had been using the type of lights that get really hot, which isn’t what you want when you like to take hot showers. Plus, they never got that bright, so really, what’s the point? I figured using two in my bathroom would probably be equivalent to the amount of light I was already getting, so I went for it. You know those really nice, well lit bathrooms in magazines? They must have been using Hue lights, because just two lights on the “energize” setting can illuminate the furthest corner. Man, I need to clean now!

My bedroom lights are the “fun” lights. I’ve been playing with the dimmer and colors for the past day. You can make both bulbs the same color, or you can make each a different color. If you can imagine it, Hue can do it. I’ve only scratched the surface of what they can do.

I don’t integrate my smart devices with Alexa, even though I have two Echos. I do it through the HomeKit app on my iPhone, so I can’t speak for how it works with Alexa, but Siri does a pretty good job. The only thing that’s bothersome is I keep wanting to flip the light switch! I’ll have to get one of the Hue dimmers at some point.

If you’re looking to put a little pizzazz in your home, I’d definitely recommend getting this kit and trying it out. The bulbs are expensive, so it’ll be a gradual integration. Pick a room or two you spend most of your time in, and screw these bad boys in and have some fun!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Marc,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2023","Philips Hue is by far the best lighting you can get. I’ve tried several other brands and the quality just doesn’t compare. That being said, the Philips Hue app is abysmal. The UI and automation controls are a complete mess. Seriously, trying to do something as simple as turning lights on or off at a specific time becomes mind boggling. If you dare introduce a motion sensor, all of your automations are suddenly worthless. I’m at the point where I’ve joined their developer program just so that I can create my own app to control my lighting. Maybe in a few months I’ll finally be able to make my lights function the way I want.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Jeff,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2023","I have been using the Philips Hue A19 LED Smart Bulb and the whole setup for over a year and I am extremely happy with my purchase. One of the things I love most about these bulbs is the ability to change the color of the lights based on the time of day. In the morning, I have the lights slowly turn on to help me wake up naturally and a bright white during the middle of the day to keep me focused! At night, I have the schedule setup to turn the lights off automatically via the app when it's time for bed.

In addition to the convenience of being able to control the lights from my phone or Alexa, I also appreciate the endless customization options where I can set them each to a different color or ""scene"" as Philips calls it. It's great for a wind-down at night as it lets you dim the light, or change colors to green and red for a holiday party.

Overall, I highly recommend the Philips Hue A19 LED Smart Bulb Starter Kit to anyone looking to add some smart lighting to their home. It's been a game changer for me and has greatly enhanced & automated my daily routine.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Timothy Dayao,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024",Philips does make a really reliable smart lightbulbs. Just FYI: this is a refurbish item. I thought I was buying a new one. But the device works with no issue.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Marc,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2024","I have my house outfitted with Hue lighting and other devices controlled via Google Home. Recently, I purchased a set of four white/color 1100 lumen bulbs, but only one would connect to my bridge. To troubleshoot, I bought a 'starter kit' with four more bulbs, wondering if my bridge was full or outdated. Surprisingly, two bulbs from the new set also wouldn't connect to the new bridge. The bulbs that did connect did so very quickly, while those that didn’t connect required manual entry of their serial numbers for multiple attempts. I received four additional bulbs, and these connected immediately.

After a lot of swapping and rotating near the bridge, using both the automatic find option and the serial number method, I managed to connect eight of the bulbs, but interestingly, not to the new bridge. Before starting, I had updated both bridges to the latest firmware, and they were identical. In the end, while I love the rich color depth and reliability of Hue lights, this experience has made me question the quality of the newer models. Has anyone else experienced similar issues? Additionally, I used the third-party app 'Hue Essentials,' as well as various YouTube tutorials, to connect and reset the bulbs.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Jason,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2022","Original

I got these to replace some sengled lights thinking they would be better but I was wrong. Hooked up the bridge to the router and initially the app found it and tried to update but the update failed. After that I could see the bridge had an IP address on the network so I tried to add via IP address but that didn't work either and then it wouldn't even show on the network after that. Tried to factory reset and nothing would happen with the lights on the top of the bridge. I am returning this junk for a replacement and hoping I just had a defective product and the next one will work. If so I will update the review but right now I am quite disappointed at having shelled out almost $200 for something that doesn't work.

Edit:

I did order a replacement and this bridge updated and connected without any issues. The reason for not going all the way to 5 stars is because none of the lights were found until I added them by serial number. In addition one of the lights in the box would not work. Luckily I still had the previous box that didn't work correctly and swapped out the non-working light for a working one so problem solved.

Also, the hue connect skill on Alexa does not work properly. I kept trying to link up the lights through the Alexa app but kept getting a ""Can not connect now, try again later"" error. I did manage to get Alexa to control some of the lights but I had to go through the web page and then discover the lights that way and add them.",4.0 out of 5 stars
William Saul Hayden,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2024","The product itself is good, but the stock Amazon sells is from a period with a firmware glitch that keeps a use from being able to connect to the Bridge and update it. The lights are also and old version that won't update to new firmware.

Once you contact Philips to get them replaced with new ones, they work great! The new lighting effects like fireplace and candlelight are very atompsheric. It maybe not be worth getting into the entire Hue ecosystem, but getting a few of these bulbs and a bridge is a great way to figure out if you want to go further into Hue products.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Drew,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2022","These bulbs have both hubless (via Bluetooth) and hub (via Hue Bridge with Zigbee) connection methods, which are great for not congesting your Wi-Fi network and makes setup and usage easy and painless. The colors are accurate, vivid ,and beautiful, but sadly not as bright as cheaper competitors as the bulbs are ""up to 1100 lumens"" for the 75w equivalent model.

I was pretty happy with my Hue bulbs, other than the price, however my package had 2 defective bulbs that refused to update to the latest firmware even after power cycling the Hue Hub several times throughout the day; leaving two of them stuck with less features than the other 2. This made me return the whole set for a refund and try other brands. In case you're curious about which brand won in the end with me, I eventually settled on GE Cync which has almost all of the same features, with almost as good software, but with better brightness and a fraction of the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Crimson Lolita,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2022","As a starter kit it works! The hub is annoying, as it MUST take up a network slot on your router and just sorta sits there taking up that and an outlet. Furthermore, because these are the starter bulbs, there's not much to really say about them in relation to the app. I often find myself off the network and it's kind of annoying you have to be connected directly to the same wifi and can't just access the bulbs at a whim (think Simplisafe and/or other connectivity apps where you can access even if you aren't at home)

As a wakeup timer, works wonders as the lowest setting still feels blinding at 5am. As far as doing anything particularly expressive, I mean they're just a solid color bulb, so y'know... bright/dim. I will say at the brightest setting, one bulb will illuminate a room and furthermore, the actual smoothness of the dimming really surprised us. The brightness doesn't change in sudden increments which is perfect!",4.0 out of 5 stars

Jérome A.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2024",I ordered a pack with 4 bulbs and the bridge. I was unable to setup the bridge with the IOS app (button press was not recognized) until I realized that it might be due to the fact that the firmware was too old. I don't know how long this bridge was sitting in the box... Long story short I had to use Blue stack android and an old version of the Hue app (4.3) to finally be able to perform the firmware update and now everything works.

I will say after connecting all my current lights (only after we recorded each lightbulb’s serial number, since the new bridge couldn’t “find” them) they all are working…the new app to set them up isn’t as easy as the original app, which seems par for hue.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Cryptobyte,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2022",I was originally against the idea of getting into the Hue ecosystem because it requires a bridge and the bulbs are expensive but after a lot of thinking and finding useful accessories I decided to give it a try when I found the new 75W equivalent bulbs on Amazon. I’m very glad I took the chance - going from cheap Walmart smart bulbs to these is huge they look and function like a far more polished product and they are so popular that many other smart home devices can integrate with them. These are nice and bright and I love that there’s a fade in / out when you toggle them on and off. The colors look great and they don’t flicker when you change the color like the cheap bulbs do.

Regardless of if you have the bridge or not, the Philips Hue skill doesn't work with Alexa anymore and it's a known issue (the skill has a 1 star rating and should be removed from the Alexa app). The smart bulbs supposedly require a Philips Hue bridge and separate Philips app to control the lights and while yes, the brand's own app allows you to have smart functionality, they're advertised as compatible with Alexa but it never works. Also, the bridge and app can't be controlled outside your house. So if you want to turn on the lights before you get home, tough luck.

Jeanann Mueller,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2021","The first thing that annoyed me was finding out the hub isn't wireless. I though like with most wireless devices it would need to be connected for initial configuration and then could be moved to wherever. This is not the case. Per their tech support it has to remain connected via ethernet to your wireless router. Even though right on the bottom of the hub it states wifi certified. I suppose it is for the bulbs only.

Which brings me the next thing that annoyed me. The instructions that come with this a very vague. They don't come with any information other than a 4 step process that is supposed to be easy, but when you have issues isn't.

The other issue is the hub has issues connecting to the network. It worked fine on the initial start up, but once I went to enable the skill for Alexa it disconnected momentarily as you have to push the button on the hub. I finally got it connected but was pretty annoying to get it connected.",3.0 out of 5 stars

After I purchased these I thought I would change all the lights in the house, but I’ve decided to keep some regular (led) lights in place. If I’m looking for something at night, one bulb in my living room lamp just isn’t bright enough at 100%. But being able to tell Siri that I want to relax, and watching her dim the bulbs and set the color to a calming sky blue, is worth the price.

EG,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2022","The only nice thing about these bulbs is how they dim on and off and how you can change them from yellow light to white light. Otherwise, a complete waste of money.

Regardless of if you have the bridge or not, the Philips Hue skill doesn't work with Alexa anymore and it's a known issue (the skill has a 1 star rating and should be removed from the Alexa app). The smart bulbs supposedly require a Philips Hue bridge and separate Philips app to control the lights and while yes, the brand's own app allows you to have smart functionality, they're advertised as compatible with Alexa but it never works. Also, the bridge and app can't be controlled outside your house. So if you want to turn on the lights before you get home, tough luck.

TL;DR: if you're looking for smart bulbs that are Alexa compatible, stop and look elsewhere. These are a waste of money for that until Philips fixes the Alexa compatibility.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Marc,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2024","I have my house outfitted with Hue lighting and other devices controlled via Google Home. Recently, I purchased a set of four white/color 1100 lumen bulbs, but only one would connect to my bridge. To troubleshoot, I bought a 'starter kit' with four more bulbs, wondering if my bridge was full or outdated. Surprisingly, two bulbs from the new set also wouldn't connect to the new bridge. The bulbs that did connect did so very quickly, while those that didn’t connect required manual entry of their serial numbers for multiple attempts. I received four additional bulbs, and these connected immediately.

After a lot of swapping and rotating near the bridge, using both the automatic find option and the serial number method, I managed to connect eight of the bulbs, but interestingly, not to the new bridge. Before starting, I had updated both bridges to the latest firmware, and they were identical. In the end, while I love the rich color depth and reliability of Hue lights, this experience has made me question the quality of the newer models. Has anyone else experienced similar issues? Additionally, I used the third-party app 'Hue Essentials,' as well as various YouTube tutorials, to connect and reset the bulbs.",3.0 out of 5 stars
William Saul Hayden,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2024","The product itself is good, but the stock Amazon sells is from a period with a firmware glitch that keeps a use from being able to connect to the Bridge and update it.

Once you contact Philips to get them replaced with new ones, they work great! The new lighting effects like fireplace and candlelight are very atompsheric.

Jeanann Mueller,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2021","The first thing that annoyed me was finding out the hub isn't wireless.

Per their tech support it has to remain connected via ethernet to your wireless router. Even though right on the bottom of the hub it states wifi certified. I suppose it is for the bulbs only.

Which brings me the next thing that annoyed me. The instructions that come with this a very vague. They don't come with any information other than a 4 step process that is supposed to be easy, but when you have issues isn't.

The other issue is the hub has issues connecting to the network.

Jason,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2022","Original

I got these to replace some sengled lights thinking they would be better but I was wrong. Hooked up the bridge to the router and initially the app found it and tried to update but the update failed. After that I could see the bridge had an IP address on the network so I tried to add via IP address but that didn't work either and then it wouldn't even show on the network after that. Tried to factory reset and nothing would happen with the lights on the top of the bridge. I am returning this junk for a replacement and hoping I just had a defective product and the next one will work. If so I will update the review but right now I am quite disappointed at having shelled out almost $200 for something that doesn't work.

Edit:

I did order a replacement and this bridge updated and connected without any issues. The reason for not going all the way to 5 stars is because none of the lights were found until I added them by serial number. In addition one of the lights in the box would not work. Luckily I still had the previous box that didn't work correctly and swapped out the non-working light for a working one so problem solved.

Also, the hue connect skill on Alexa does not work properly. I kept trying to link up the lights through the Alexa app but kept getting a ""Can not connect now, try again later"" error. I did manage to get Alexa to control some of the lights but I had to go through the web page and then discover the lights that way and add them.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Drew,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2022","These bulbs have both hubless (via Bluetooth) and hub (via Hue Bridge with Zigbee) connection methods, which are great for not congesting your Wi-Fi network and makes setup and usage easy and painless. The colors are accurate, vivid ,and beautiful, but sadly not as bright as cheaper competitors as the bulbs are ""up to 1100 lumens"" for the 75w equivalent model.

I was pretty happy with my Hue bulbs, other than the price, however my package had 2 defective bulbs that refused to update to the latest firmware even after power cycling the Hue Hub several times throughout the day; leaving two of them stuck with less features than the other 2. This made me return the whole set for a refund and try other brands.

Crimson Lolita,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2022","As a starter kit it works! The hub is annoying, as it MUST take up a network slot on your router and just sorta sits there taking up that and an outlet. Furthermore, because these are the starter bulbs, there's not much to really say about them in relation to the app. I often find myself off the network and it's kind of annoying you have to be connected directly to the same wifi and can't just access the bulbs at a whim (think Simplisafe and/or other connectivity apps where you can access even if you aren't at home)

As a wakeup timer, works wonders as the lowest setting still feels blinding at 5am. As far as doing anything particularly expressive, I mean they're just a solid color bulb, so y'know... bright/dim. I will say at the brightest setting, one bulb will illuminate a room and furthermore, the actual smoothness of the dimming really surprised us.

Bruce E. Munck,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2024","Hue first impressions. The box arrived a few minutes ago and it felt heavier than I expected it to, but maybe, I thought, that was because of the included bridge. Upon opening the box I found three bulbs packaged beside each other. I removed the upper cardboard piece and below it was the fourth bulb along with the bridge, power supply, cords, and instructions. This was where I realized that the weight wasn't only the bridge: these bulbs are wonderfully heavy! I have a pack of four Fovaa bulbs and the whole pack doesn't weigh as much as a single Hue bulb. I haven't even put power to a Hue bulb yet and I already feel confident in what I have purchased. Next I opened the instruction booklet; and as professional as everything else in the box feels, I was disappointed with the instructions. They are basically a collection of stick drawings with no textual guidance whatsoever. I was not daunted, though, since there is so much help available online.

The Hue bulbs are more expensive than the bargain brands and I wondered why until I began researching them. Philips uses Zigbee radios in their bulbs and bridges which increases the cost significantly. And after holding one of the bulbs in my hand I could actually feel the difference in quality compared to the other bulbs that I own (Fovaa). Until I actually put these bulbs into service I can't comment on their function, but I expect to be very satisfied with them. My Fovaa bulbs work very well, although when set to blue or green they are not as bright as I think they should be. I am expecting much better brightness with the Hue bulbs. I have read that Wyze makes some really good bulbs in terms of color output that rival the Hue bulbs. Still, the Hue bulbs are constructed differently and are able to do some things that the others evidently cannot do. Once I have these lights going and I have a chance to put them through their paces I will report back with some updates. I'm anxious to try a simulated fireworks display and am hoping that four bulbs are enough to do it. Some of the scenes and animations require more than four bulbs to get the color mixtures right, but I think that a fireworks display could be done using white plus three other colors. At least a small fireworks display. I'll let you know when I have tried it.

Edit 2-12-2024
OK, I have the lights up and running and I can give you a little more insight now. First of all, if you look at the many photos of Hue lights you will know exactly what to expect in terms of color. These bulbs have colors that are full and rich yet are mellowed a bit as they are made to provide ambience to a space instead of producing stark coloring. You can get very deep blues, greens, and reds, and still have good brightness. A word that comes to mind is pastel, and yet the colors can be much deeper than pastel; in fact, the room color can become very red, very blue, very green, and yet still maintain some small bit of pastel quality. Again, I'd say look at a lot of the available pictures and you will know. In contrast to this, my Fovaa bulbs give very dark blues, reds, greens with no mellowing at all. There is no way to brighten the Fovaa bulbs when those colors are cranked to the maximum and maybe that is as it should be. Then again, I have read articles that claim Wyze bulbs have more intense colors than Fovaa bulbs (in fact they are ranked close to the top of all bulbs in that category) and also have more brightness; so it may be more a matter of design. If you want absolute, saturated, bright colors with no compromise you might want to try the Wyze bulbs; however, if you want lights that are tailor made for enhancing the atmosphere of your living spaces I can't imagine a better choice than Hue lights. I want to reiterate here just how good the bulbs feel in the hand, and after screwing them in and setting them up how good they look in action. Something else to touch on is that there are numerous apps available in addition to the official Hue app that can add to the functions your Hue lights can perform. The fireworks display I referred to above is in one of those apps: the app is called ""hueDynamic"" and the fireworks is under the Experiences heading. The fireworks display cycles your bulb colors mimicking real fireworks. The colors ramp on and off at speeds that seem realistic and your room is bathed in a frenzied display of light. Now that I have tried it I probably won't ever use it again, but hey, these lights can do that! Some other, more restful effects on the menu are flickering candles and a fireplace. If I actually had a fireplace I could see myself using that to enhance the natural flicker of flames. The candles...maybe I will use that one, maybe not. The animations can actually be rather distracting. The ambience settings are probably the most useful, but I should tell you that it is better to have the bulbs located next to walls so that the reflected light can add to the overall effect. I have mine temporarily in a ceiling fan in the middle of the living room and looking up at the light you can see all four bulbs with different colors and it doesn't look so good. Eventually they will be relocated to individual lamps around the room where they should provide a much better experience.

If you buy any bulbs other than Hue bulbs you will be tied to one single app: the official app from the manufacturer of the bulbs. Or you may be limited to tying in to Alexa and the set of skills available because your choice of bulbs doesn't even have an app. With Hue bulbs you have many choices of apps, and you will find that Hue apps, even the third party apps, have a level of professionalism not found in apps for other bulbs. Yes, Hue bulbs cost more...but you will get what you paid for. Top quality, great looking light, an almost endless list of ways to use them; Hue bulbs are probably the very best you can buy.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I had been using the type of lights that get really hot, which isn’t what you want when you like to take hot showers. Plus, they never got that bright, so really, what’s the point? I figured using two in my bathroom would probably be equivalent to the amount of light I was already getting, so I went for it. You know those really nice, well lit bathrooms in magazines? They must have been using Hue lights, because just two lights on the “energize” setting can illuminate the furthest corner. Man, I need to clean now!

My bedroom lights are the “fun” lights. I’ve been playing with the dimmer and colors for the past day. You can make both bulbs the same color, or you can make each a different color. If you can imagine it, Hue can do it. I’ve only scratched the surface of what they can do.

I don’t integrate my smart devices with Alexa, even though I have two Echos. I do it through the HomeKit app on my iPhone, so I can’t speak for how it works with Alexa, but Siri does a pretty good job. The only thing that’s bothersome is I keep wanting to flip the light switch! I’ll have to get one of the Hue dimmers at some point.

If you’re looking to put a little pizzazz in your home, I’d definitely recommend getting this kit and trying it out. The bulbs are expensive, so it’ll be a gradual integration. Pick a room or two you spend most of your time in, and screw these bad boys in and have some fun!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Jeff,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2023","I have been using the Philips Hue A19 LED Smart Bulb and the whole setup for over a year and I am extremely happy with my purchase. One of the things I love most about these bulbs is the ability to change the color of the lights based on the time of day. In the morning, I have the lights slowly turn on to help me wake up naturally and a bright white during the middle of the day to keep me focused! At night, I have the schedule setup to turn the lights off automatically via the app when it's time for bed.

In addition to the convenience of being able to control the lights from my phone or Alexa, I also appreciate the endless customization options where I can set them each to a different color or ""scene"" as Philips calls it. It's great for a wind-down at night as it lets you dim the light, or change colors to green and red for a holiday party.

Overall, I highly recommend the Philips Hue A19 LED Smart Bulb Starter Kit to anyone looking to add some smart lighting to their home. It's been a game changer for me and has greatly enhanced & automated my daily routine.",5.0 out of 5 stars
joyce,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023","I had the original Hue Hub, so was forced to get the “new” bridge so all my expensive lights would continue to work…not too happy with the additional cost to keep an older system up & running as advertised years ago…I would give only 3 stars to Hue for neglecting those that bought so many things previously. I will say after connecting all my current lights (only after we recorded each lightbulb’s serial number, since the new bridge couldn’t “find” them) they all are working…the new app to set them up isn’t as easy as the original app, which seems par for hue.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Cryptobyte,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2022",I was originally against the idea of getting into the Hue ecosystem because it requires a bridge and the bulbs are expensive but after a lot of thinking and finding useful accessories I decided to give it a try when I found the new 75W equivalent bulbs on Amazon. I’m very glad I took the chance - going from cheap Walmart smart bulbs to these is huge they look and function like a far more polished product and they are so popular that many other smart home devices can integrate with them. These are nice and bright and I love that there’s a fade in / out when you toggle them on and off. The colors look great and they don’t flicker when you change the color like the cheap bulbs do. Overall it’s been a great experience so far and I would recommend giving them a try.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Nick,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2022","I've been thinking about switching from LIFX to Phillips Hue for quite awhile, mostly due to the connectivity issues I have with those bulbs over WiFi. Phillips Hue definitely solved these issues with their bridge.

The bridge booted right up and I was able to add my Phillips Hue lights to the app without an issue. The lights are bright, vivid, and responsive. I've yet to have an issue! The Phillips Hue iOS app has been user friendly and responsive as well, it's easy to navigate, set up, and maintain my smart home!

jraist,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2023",These are great. They are a little pricy but they end up being worth it.

Dudley Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2020","Love this bridge and bulbs. Alexa integration is great.

However, please note that you need to test all of your bulbs with as many color scheme presets as possible as soon as you get the item. I found that one of my bulbs was throwing off the wrong color with certain color scheme presets. For example, the Savanna Sunset scheme worked fine, but with the Tropical Twilight scheme, it threw off the wrong color (mis-matched colors with the other three bulbs).

Amazon was able to ship me a new item, where I can swap out the defective bulb, and then return the original item so that I didn't have to setup the Hue Bridge and apply firmware updates all over again. Very nice of Amazon to do this.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Tobal Salvaje,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2021","These bulbs were insanely easy to install and they hook up to their hub (required) and HomeKit smoothly. They are not the brightest bulbs in the box (never said that and meant it literally before). After I purchased these I thought I would change all the lights in the house, but I’ve decided to keep some regular (led) lights in place. If I’m looking for something at night, one bulb in my living room lamp just isn’t bright enough at 100%. But being able to tell Siri that I want to relax, and watching her dim the bulbs and set the color to a calming sky blue, is worth the price. In all fairness I haven’t tried any other bulbs in the market, but I’ve had these for about a month with no problems. Highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Which is super awesome for dialing in that perfect shade of ocean water you want. Works perfect with Alexa, I've set up multiple scenes and commands and now I just come downstairs and tell Alexa good morning and she fires up all my lights and everything is a joy.

Erik P.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2023","This is a really good starter kit for creating your smart home or smart office. Because of the hub, this has been the most reliable smart light system I’ve ever used. The lights are not the brightest, and their RGB colors are wildly inaccurate, but they always turn on and off when commanded without any lag.

Setting up the hub is not easy - make sure to do it in the Hue app first if planning to add accessories that aren’t just light bulbs. Of the 4 bulbs in the pack, only 2 wanted to automatically connect. I had to manually add the other 2 using their serial numbers. Once all connected to Hue, adding to Apple HomeKit is easy, though I did experience some weird errors where the names and rooms would sometimes not match.

The Hue system is wildly expensive. There are so many other cheaper options. But also, it always works flawlessly once set up, which is better than most other systems can claim.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Las funciones que ofrece la app son muy funcionales, como encenderse o apagarse según se programa, regular la intensidad de la luz en cada foco o simultáneamente, encender sin estar en el hogar, configurar un tipo e intensidad de luz en caso de apagón o si se de conecta y al encenderse nuevamente iluminarse como se programó, crear ambientes o escenas con combinaciones de luz y guardarlas, o iluminarse como despertador por la mañana, así como atenuarse o incrementarse en tiempos definidos,

Mauricio Ontiveros,"Reviewed in Mexico on August 20, 2023","Mis queridos amigos de la tecnología y el estilo, permítanme presentarles las Phillips Hue Multicolor, el toque mágico que ha convertido mi hogar en un escenario de vida colorido y emocionante. 😄

Desde que instalé estas luces en mi casa, la vida cotidiana se ha vuelto un espectáculo de luces digno de un show de Broadway. No importa si estoy en una reunión de trabajo virtual o en una cita en casa, puedo ajustar la iluminación para que se adapte a cualquier ocasión.

La instalación es tan fácil que incluso mi gato podría hacerlo (si tan solo tuviera pulgares). Atornillé las bombillas, conecté el puente y, voilà, mi hogar se convirtió en una paleta de colores digital. Cambiar la luz es tan sencillo como tocar una aplicación en mi teléfono.

El poder de las Phillips Hue Multicolor reside en su versatilidad. ¿Quiero una luz brillante y fresca para trabajar desde casa? ¡Listo! ¿Quiero una luz suave y cálida para una cena romántica? ¡No hay problema! ¿Quiero que la habitación se convierta en una discoteca para una fiesta en casa? ¡Por supuesto, y que comience la música!

La integración con asistentes de voz es como tener un mágico genio digital en casa. ""Hey, Google, pon la luz en modo 'Atardecer en la Playa'"", y la habitación se ilumina con los tonos adecuados. Es como vivir en una película de ciencia ficción (pero con menos robots rebeldes).

En resumen, las Phillips Hue Multicolor son un toque de magia moderna en mi hogar. Hacen que cada día sea un festival de colores y diversión. ¡Nunca supe que necesitaba luces de humor hasta que las tuve! 🏠🌈💡😄",5.0 out of 5 stars
Cliente de Amazon,"Reviewed in Mexico on June 5, 2021","Siendo sincero, la primera vez que vi estos focos me parecieron bastante caros. Luego, en el hot sale los encontré en $3000 y aún después de haber hecho mi pedido me preguntaba si no habia tomado una mala decisión.

Sin embargo, vaya sorpresa me llevé al instalar estos focos ! La calidad es impresionante. No tienen el mayor brillo, pero es suficiente para una habitación con techo de 3.5 metros. Y los efectos que se pueden lograr son simplemente sorprendentes.

La aplicación es muy amigable y con la última actualización se cuenta con un gran número de efectos. Cada uno hara que se sumerjan en estados de ánimo, completamente diferentes. Desde concentración hasta un estado relajado con luces de colores.

Los focos se pueden usar directo por Bluetooth, pero el hub facilita mucho la inclusión de nuevos focos y también su integración con un dispositivo Alexa u otros del mismo tipo.

Sólo tengo elogios para estos focos y definitivamente estoy más que contento con mi compra.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Lex Martínez,"Reviewed in Mexico on June 26, 2020","El principal motivo por el que las compre fue por su función de atenuación de Luz (para disfrutar de la TV con menos luz) y el control remoto desde el celular (No más preocupaciones de haber dejado la luz encendida) Sin necesidad de instalaciones adicionales y he quedado satisfecho.

Definitivamente hay muchas tecnologías de smart lights en el Mercado, pero esta fue la que me convenció a mí, como quiera les recomiendo ver reviews a fondo y videos en YouTube.

Mi casa no es muy grande así que la limitante de solo poder conectar 50 dispositivos al Bridge es suficiente para mí. A diferencia de otras tecnologías, a mi no me molesta tener el bridge conectado al módem por cable de red, así me aseguro de poder administrar las luces de manera remota aún cuando no estoy en casa (siempre y cuando tenga luz e internet en la casa).

Puede ser muy confuso al principio y para personas de la tercera edad, ya que el botón de la Luz física del foco debe permanecer encendida todo el tiempo y la luz se controla con la aplicación del celular, Siri, Alexa o Home Kit. Así que si estás muy acostumbrado a usar el botón físico del apagador, puede que te cueste un poco de tiempo acostumbrarte, y la otra es no olvidar el celular ya que solo con el podrás manipular las luces.

La gana de colores también es muy amplia y se ven muy bien, el puente y los focos son la versión 3.

Una duda grande que yo tenía era qué pasa cuando se va la luz? ya que todos los botones físicos estarían encendidos y cuando volviera la luz estarían todos los focos encendidos. La respuesta es que la aplicación te deja configurar manualmente los focos para que conserven el último estado en el que los dejaste antes del apagón (encendidos o apagados). De otra manera, los focos se encienden automáticamente después del apagón.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Primero que nada hay que decir que lo ideal es combinarlo con Alexa u otro asistente virtual para que su uso sea más amigable, ya que de lo contrario tienes que cargar el celular por la casa para ir prendiendo las luces. La aplicación es muy sencilla de usar y bastante estética, te permite cambiar el color de los focos, poner configuraciones de escenas, cambiar la intensidad de luz, configurar rutinas de colores o de encendido. De lo mejor es la rutina que prende los focos cuando llegas a tu casa de forma automática o la que apaga las luces al salir, incluso hay aplicaciones de terceros donde puedes hacer que la luz se sincronice al ritmo de la música o de tu monitor de la PC(se requiere cierta compatibilidad).

Marc,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2024","I have my house outfitted with Hue lighting and other devices controlled via Google Home. Recently, I purchased a set of four white/color 1100 lumen bulbs, but only one would connect to my bridge. To troubleshoot, I bought a 'starter kit' with four more bulbs, wondering if my bridge was full or outdated. Surprisingly, two bulbs from the new set also wouldn't connect to the new bridge. The bulbs that did connect did so very quickly, while those that didn’t connect required manual entry of their serial numbers for multiple attempts. I received four additional bulbs, and these connected immediately.

After a lot of swapping and rotating near the bridge, using both the automatic find option and the serial number method, I managed to connect eight of the bulbs, but interestingly, not to the new bridge. Before starting, I had updated both bridges to the latest firmware, and they were identical. In the end, while I love the rich color depth and reliability of Hue lights, this experience has made me question the quality of the newer models. Has anyone else experienced similar issues? Additionally, I used the third-party app 'Hue Essentials,' as well as various YouTube tutorials, to connect and reset the bulbs.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Once you contact Philips to get them replaced with new ones, they work great! The new lighting effects like fireplace and candlelight are very atompsheric.

Bruce E. Munck,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2024","Hue first impressions. The box arrived a few minutes ago and it felt heavier than I expected it to, but maybe, I thought, that was because of the included bridge. Upon opening the box I found three bulbs packaged beside each other. I removed the upper cardboard piece and below it was the fourth bulb along with the bridge, power supply, cords, and instructions. This was where I realized that the weight wasn't only the bridge: these bulbs are wonderfully heavy! I have a pack of four Fovaa bulbs and the whole pack doesn't weigh as much as a single Hue bulb. I haven't even put power to a Hue bulb yet and I already feel confident in what I have purchased. Next I opened the instruction booklet; and as professional as everything else in the box feels, I was disappointed with the instructions. They are basically a collection of stick drawings with no textual guidance whatsoever. I was not daunted, though, since there is so much help available online.

The Hue bulbs are more expensive than the bargain brands and I wondered why until I began researching them. Philips uses Zigbee radios in their bulbs and bridges which increases the cost significantly. And after holding one of the bulbs in my hand I could actually feel the difference in quality compared to the other bulbs that I own (Fovaa). Until I actually put these bulbs into service I can't comment on their function, but I expect to be very satisfied with them. My Fovaa bulbs work very well, although when set to blue or green they are not as bright as I think they should be. I am expecting much better brightness with the Hue bulbs. I have read that Wyze makes some really good bulbs in terms of color output that rival the Hue bulbs. Still, the Hue bulbs are constructed differently and are able to do some things that the others evidently cannot do. Once I have these lights going and I have a chance to put them through their paces I will report back with some updates. I'm anxious to try a simulated fireworks display and am hoping that four bulbs are enough to do it. Some of the scenes and animations require more than four bulbs to get the color mixtures right, but I think that a fireworks display could be done using white plus three other colors. At least a small fireworks display. I'll let you know when I have tried it.

Edit 2-12-2024
OK, I have the lights up and running and I can give you a little more insight now. First of all, if you look at the many photos of Hue lights you will know exactly what to expect in terms of color. These bulbs have colors that are full and rich yet are mellowed a bit as they are made to provide ambience to a space instead of producing stark coloring. You can get very deep blues, greens, and reds, and still have good brightness. A word that comes to mind is pastel, and yet the colors can be much deeper than pastel; in fact, the room color can become very red, very blue, very green, and yet still maintain some small bit of pastel quality. Again, I'd say look at a lot of the available pictures and you will know. In contrast to this, my Fovaa bulbs give very dark blues, reds, greens with no mellowing at all. There is no way to brighten the Fovaa bulbs when those colors are cranked to the maximum and maybe that is as it should be. Then again, I have read articles that claim Wyze bulbs have more intense colors than Fovaa bulbs (in fact they are ranked close to the top of all bulbs in that category) and also have more brightness; so it may be more a matter of design. If you want absolute, saturated, bright colors with no compromise you might want to try the Wyze bulbs; however, if you want lights that are tailor made for enhancing the atmosphere of your living spaces I can't imagine a better choice than Hue lights. I want to reiterate here just how good the bulbs feel in the hand, and after screwing them in and setting them up how good they look in action. Something else to touch on is that there are numerous apps available in addition to the official Hue app that can add to the functions your Hue lights can perform. The fireworks display I referred to above is in one of those apps: the app is called ""hueDynamic"" and the fireworks is under the Experiences heading. The fireworks display cycles your bulb colors mimicking real fireworks. The colors ramp on and off at speeds that seem realistic and your room is bathed in a frenzied display of light. Now that I have tried it I probably won't ever use it again, but hey, these lights can do that! Some other, more restful effects on the menu are flickering candles and a fireplace. If I actually had a fireplace I could see myself using that to enhance the natural flicker of flames. The candles...maybe I will use that one, maybe not. The animations can actually be rather distracting. The ambience settings are probably the most useful, but I should tell you that it is better to have the bulbs located next to walls so that the reflected light can add to the overall effect. I have mine temporarily in a ceiling fan in the middle of the living room and looking up at the light you can see all four bulbs with different colors and it doesn't look so good. Eventually they will be relocated to individual lamps around the room where they should provide a much better experience.

If you buy any bulbs other than Hue bulbs you will be tied to one single app: the official app from the manufacturer of the bulbs. Or you may be limited to tying in to Alexa and the set of skills available because your choice of bulbs doesn't even have an app. With Hue bulbs you have many choices of apps, and you will find that Hue apps, even the third party apps, have a level of professionalism not found in apps for other bulbs. Yes, Hue bulbs cost more...but you will get what you paid for. Top quality, great looking light, an almost endless list of ways to use them; Hue bulbs are probably the very best you can buy.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Setting up the hub is not easy - make sure to do it in the Hue app first if planning to add accessories that aren’t just light bulbs. Of the 4 bulbs in the pack, only 2 wanted to automatically connect. I had to manually add the other 2 using their serial numbers. Once all connected to Hue, adding to Apple HomeKit is easy, though I did experience some weird errors where the names and rooms would sometimes not match.

Jeff,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2023","I have been using the Philips Hue A19 LED Smart Bulb and the whole setup for over a year and I am extremely happy with my purchase. One of the things I love most about these bulbs is the ability to change the color of the lights based on the time of day. In the morning, I have the lights slowly turn on to help me wake up naturally and a bright white during the middle of the day to keep me focused! At night, I have the schedule setup to turn the lights off automatically via the app when it's time for bed.

In addition to the convenience of being able to control the lights from my phone or Alexa, I also appreciate the endless customization options where I can set them each to a different color or ""scene"" as Philips calls it. It's great for a wind-down at night as it lets you dim the light, or change colors to green and red for a holiday party.

Overall, I highly recommend the Philips Hue A19 LED Smart Bulb Starter Kit to anyone looking to add some smart lighting to their home. It's been a game changer for me and has greatly enhanced & automated my daily routine.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Crimson Lolita,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2022","As a starter kit it works! The hub is annoying, as it MUST take up a network slot on your router and just sorta sits there taking up that and an outlet. Furthermore, because these are the starter bulbs, there's not much to really say about them in relation to the app. I often find myself off the network and it's kind of annoying you have to be connected directly to the same wifi and can't just access the bulbs at a whim (think Simplisafe and/or other connectivity apps where you can access even if you aren't at home)

As a wakeup timer, works wonders as the lowest setting still feels blinding at 5am. As far as doing anything particularly expressive, I mean they're just a solid color bulb, so y'know... bright/dim. I will say at the brightest setting, one bulb will illuminate a room and furthermore, the actual smoothness of the dimming really surprised us. The brightness doesn't change in sudden increments which is perfect!",4.0 out of 5 stars
Drew,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2022","These bulbs have both hubless (via Bluetooth) and hub (via Hue Bridge with Zigbee) connection methods, which are great for not congesting your Wi-Fi network and makes setup and usage easy and painless. The colors are accurate, vivid ,and beautiful, but sadly not as bright as cheaper competitors as the bulbs are ""up to 1100 lumens"" for the 75w equivalent model.

I was pretty happy with my Hue bulbs, other than the price, however my package had 2 defective bulbs that refused to update to the latest firmware even after power cycling the Hue Hub several times throughout the day; leaving two of them stuck with less features than the other 2. This made me return the whole set for a refund and try other brands. In case you're curious about which brand won in the end with me, I eventually settled on GE Cync which has almost all of the same features, with almost as good software, but with better brightness and a fraction of the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars

EG,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2022","The only nice thing about these bulbs is how they dim on and off and how you can change them from yellow light to white light. Otherwise, a complete waste of money.

Regardless of if you have the bridge or not, the Philips Hue skill doesn't work with Alexa anymore and it's a known issue (the skill has a 1 star rating and should be removed from the Alexa app). The smart bulbs supposedly require a Philips Hue bridge and separate Philips app to control the lights and while yes, the brand's own app allows you to have smart functionality, they're advertised as compatible with Alexa but it never works. Also, the bridge and app can't be controlled outside your house. So if you want to turn on the lights before you get home, tough luck.

TL;DR: if you're looking for smart bulbs that are Alexa compatible, stop and look elsewhere. These are a waste of money for that until Philips fixes the Alexa compatibility.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Jason,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2022","Original

I got these to replace some sengled lights thinking they would be better but I was wrong. Hooked up the bridge to the router and initially the app found it and tried to update but the update failed. After that I could see the bridge had an IP address on the network so I tried to add via IP address but that didn't work either and then it wouldn't even show on the network after that. Tried to factory reset and nothing would happen with the lights on the top of the bridge. I am returning this junk for a replacement and hoping I just had a defective product and the next one will work. If so I will update the review but right now I am quite disappointed at having shelled out almost $200 for something that doesn't work.

Edit:

I did order a replacement and this bridge updated and connected without any issues. The reason for not going all the way to 5 stars is because none of the lights were found until I added them by serial number. In addition one of the lights in the box would not work. Luckily I still had the previous box that didn't work correctly and swapped out the non-working light for a working one so problem solved.

Also, the hue connect skill on Alexa does not work properly. I kept trying to link up the lights through the Alexa app but kept getting a ""Can not connect now, try again later"" error. I did manage to get Alexa to control some of the lights but I had to go through the web page and then discover the lights that way and add them.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Bruce E. Munck,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2024","Hue first impressions. The box arrived a few minutes ago and it felt heavier than I expected it to, but maybe, I thought, that was because of the included bridge. Upon opening the box I found three bulbs packaged beside each other. I removed the upper cardboard piece and below it was the fourth bulb along with the bridge, power supply, cords, and instructions. This was where I realized that the weight wasn't only the bridge: these bulbs are wonderfully heavy! I have a pack of four Fovaa bulbs and the whole pack doesn't weigh as much as a single Hue bulb. I haven't even put power to a Hue bulb yet and I already feel confident in what I have purchased. Next I opened the instruction booklet; and as professional as everything else in the box feels, I was disappointed with the instructions. They are basically a collection of stick drawings with no textual guidance whatsoever. I was not daunted, though, since there is so much help available online.

The Hue bulbs are more expensive than the bargain brands and I wondered why until I began researching them. Philips uses Zigbee radios in their bulbs and bridges which increases the cost significantly. And after holding one of the bulbs in my hand I could actually feel the difference in quality compared to the other bulbs that I own (Fovaa). Until I actually put these bulbs into service I can't comment on their function, but I expect to be very satisfied with them. My Fovaa bulbs work very well, although when set to blue or green they are not as bright as I think they should be. I am expecting much better brightness with the Hue bulbs. I have read that Wyze makes some really good bulbs in terms of color output that rival the Hue bulbs. Still, the Hue bulbs are constructed differently and are able to do some things that the others evidently cannot do. Once I have these lights going and I have a chance to put them through their paces I will report back with some updates. I'm anxious to try a simulated fireworks display and am hoping that four bulbs are enough to do it. Some of the scenes and animations require more than four bulbs to get the color mixtures right, but I think that a fireworks display could be done using white plus three other colors. At least a small fireworks display. I'll let you know when I have tried it.

Edit 2-12-2024
OK, I have the lights up and running and I can give you a little more insight now. First of all, if you look at the many photos of Hue lights you will know exactly what to expect in terms of color. These bulbs have colors that are full and rich yet are mellowed a bit as they are made to provide ambience to a space instead of producing stark coloring. You can get very deep blues, greens, and reds, and still have good brightness. A word that comes to mind is pastel, and yet the colors can be much deeper than pastel; in fact, the room color can become very red, very blue, very green, and yet still maintain some small bit of pastel quality. Again, I'd say look at a lot of the available pictures and you will know. In contrast to this, my Fovaa bulbs give very dark blues, reds, greens with no mellowing at all. There is no way to brighten the Fovaa bulbs when those colors are cranked to the maximum and maybe that is as it should be. Then again, I have read articles that claim Wyze bulbs have more intense colors than Fovaa bulbs (in fact they are ranked close to the top of all bulbs in that category) and also have more brightness; so it may be more a matter of design. If you want absolute, saturated, bright colors with no compromise you might want to try the Wyze bulbs; however, if you want lights that are tailor made for enhancing the atmosphere of your living spaces I can't imagine a better choice than Hue lights. I want to reiterate here just how good the bulbs feel in the hand, and after screwing them in and setting them up how good they look in action. Something else to touch on is that there are numerous apps available in addition to the official Hue app that can add to the functions your Hue lights can perform. The fireworks display I referred to above is in one of those apps: the app is called ""hueDynamic"" and the fireworks is under the Experiences heading. The fireworks display cycles your bulb colors mimicking real fireworks. The colors ramp on and off at speeds that seem realistic and your room is bathed in a frenzied display of light. Now that I have tried it I probably won't ever use it again, but hey, these lights can do that! Some other, more restful effects on the menu are flickering candles and a fireplace. If I actually had a fireplace I could see myself using that to enhance the natural flicker of flames. The candles...maybe I will use that one, maybe not. The animations can actually be rather distracting. The ambience settings are probably the most useful, but I should tell you that it is better to have the bulbs located next to walls so that the reflected light can add to the overall effect. I have mine temporarily in a ceiling fan in the middle of the living room and looking up at the light you can see all four bulbs with different colors and it doesn't look so good. Eventually they will be relocated to individual lamps around the room where they should provide a much better experience.

If you buy any bulbs other than Hue bulbs you will be tied to one single app: the official app from the manufacturer of the bulbs. Or you may be limited to tying in to Alexa and the set of skills available because your choice of bulbs doesn't even have an app. With Hue bulbs you have many choices of apps, and you will find that Hue apps, even the third party apps, have a level of professionalism not found in apps for other bulbs. Yes, Hue bulbs cost more...but you will get what you paid for. Top quality, great looking light, an almost endless list of ways to use them; Hue bulbs are probably the very best you can buy.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Kyle Margerum,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2020","I’ve wanted some of the lights for a long time!

This is actually my second shipment of the same product, because the wall plug was bent on the first one. Amazon sent me a new one, and it works like a dream.

Let me start by saying I put these lights in my bedroom and bathroom. My bathroom has a slot for four lights, but I only put two in. I had been using the type of lights that get really hot, which isn’t what you want when you like to take hot showers. Plus, they never got that bright, so really, what’s the point? I figured using two in my bathroom would probably be equivalent to the amount of light I was already getting, so I went for it. You know those really nice, well lit bathrooms in magazines? They must have been using Hue lights, because just two lights on the “energize” setting can illuminate the furthest corner. Man, I need to clean now!

My bedroom lights are the “fun” lights. I’ve been playing with the dimmer and colors for the past day. You can make both bulbs the same color, or you can make each a different color. If you can imagine it, Hue can do it. I’ve only scratched the surface of what they can do.

I don’t integrate my smart devices with Alexa, even though I have two Echos. I do it through the HomeKit app on my iPhone, so I can’t speak for how it works with Alexa, but Siri does a pretty good job. The only thing that’s bothersome is I keep wanting to flip the light switch! I’ll have to get one of the Hue dimmers at some point.

If you’re looking to put a little pizzazz in your home, I’d definitely recommend getting this kit and trying it out. The bulbs are expensive, so it’ll be a gradual integration. Pick a room or two you spend most of your time in, and screw these bad boys in and have some fun!",5.0 out of 5 stars

That being said, the Philips Hue app is abysmal. The UI and automation controls are a complete mess. Seriously, trying to do something as simple as turning lights on or off at a specific time becomes mind boggling. If you dare introduce a motion sensor, all of your automations are suddenly worthless. I’m at the point where I’ve joined their developer program just so that I can create my own app to control my lighting.

Jeff,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2023","I have been using the Philips Hue A19 LED Smart Bulb and the whole setup for over a year and I am extremely happy with my purchase. One of the things I love most about these bulbs is the ability to change the color of the lights based on the time of day. In the morning, I have the lights slowly turn on to help me wake up naturally and a bright white during the middle of the day to keep me focused! At night, I have the schedule setup to turn the lights off automatically via the app when it's time for bed.

In addition to the convenience of being able to control the lights from my phone or Alexa, I also appreciate the endless customization options where I can set them each to a different color or ""scene"" as Philips calls it. It's great for a wind-down at night as it lets you dim the light, or change colors to green and red for a holiday party.

Overall, I highly recommend the Philips Hue A19 LED Smart Bulb Starter Kit to anyone looking to add some smart lighting to their home. It's been a game changer for me and has greatly enhanced & automated my daily routine.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Marc,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2024","I have my house outfitted with Hue lighting and other devices controlled via Google Home. Recently, I purchased a set of four white/color 1100 lumen bulbs, but only one would connect to my bridge. To troubleshoot, I bought a 'starter kit' with four more bulbs, wondering if my bridge was full or outdated. Surprisingly, two bulbs from the new set also wouldn't connect to the new bridge. The bulbs that did connect did so very quickly, while those that didn’t connect required manual entry of their serial numbers for multiple attempts. I received four additional bulbs, and these connected immediately.

After a lot of swapping and rotating near the bridge, using both the automatic find option and the serial number method, I managed to connect eight of the bulbs, but interestingly, not to the new bridge. Before starting, I had updated both bridges to the latest firmware, and they were identical. In the end, while I love the rich color depth and reliability of Hue lights, this experience has made me question the quality of the newer models. Has anyone else experienced similar issues? Additionally, I used the third-party app 'Hue Essentials,' as well as various YouTube tutorials, to connect and reset the bulbs.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Jason,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2022","Original

I got these to replace some sengled lights thinking they would be better but I was wrong. Hooked up the bridge to the router and initially the app found it and tried to update but the update failed. After that I could see the bridge had an IP address on the network so I tried to add via IP address but that didn't work either and then it wouldn't even show on the network after that. Tried to factory reset and nothing would happen with the lights on the top of the bridge. I am returning this junk for a replacement and hoping I just had a defective product and the next one will work. If so I will update the review but right now I am quite disappointed at having shelled out almost $200 for something that doesn't work.

Edit:

I did order a replacement and this bridge updated and connected without any issues. The reason for not going all the way to 5 stars is because none of the lights were found until I added them by serial number. In addition one of the lights in the box would not work. Luckily I still had the previous box that didn't work correctly and swapped out the non-working light for a working one so problem solved.

Also, the hue connect skill on Alexa does not work properly. I kept trying to link up the lights through the Alexa app but kept getting a ""Can not connect now, try again later"" error. I did manage to get Alexa to control some of the lights but I had to go through the web page and then discover the lights that way and add them.",4.0 out of 5 stars
William Saul Hayden,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2024","The product itself is good, but the stock Amazon sells is from a period with a firmware glitch that keeps a use from being able to connect to the Bridge and update it. The lights are also and old version that won't update to new firmware.

Once you contact Philips to get them replaced with new ones, they work great! The new lighting effects like fireplace and candlelight are very atompsheric. It maybe not be worth getting into the entire Hue ecosystem, but getting a few of these bulbs and a bridge is a great way to figure out if you want to go further into Hue products.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Drew,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2022","These bulbs have both hubless (via Bluetooth) and hub (via Hue Bridge with Zigbee) connection methods, which are great for not congesting your Wi-Fi network and makes setup and usage easy and painless. The colors are accurate, vivid ,and beautiful, but sadly not as bright as cheaper competitors as the bulbs are ""up to 1100 lumens"" for the 75w equivalent model.

I was pretty happy with my Hue bulbs, other than the price, however my package had 2 defective bulbs that refused to update to the latest firmware even after power cycling the Hue Hub several times throughout the day; leaving two of them stuck with less features than the other 2. This made me return the whole set for a refund and try other brands. In case you're curious about which brand won in the end with me, I eventually settled on GE Cync which has almost all of the same features, with almost as good software, but with better brightness and a fraction of the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Crimson Lolita,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2022","As a starter kit it works! The hub is annoying, as it MUST take up a network slot on your router and just sorta sits there taking up that and an outlet. Furthermore, because these are the starter bulbs, there's not much to really say about them in relation to the app. I often find myself off the network and it's kind of annoying you have to be connected directly to the same wifi and can't just access the bulbs at a whim (think Simplisafe and/or other connectivity apps where you can access even if you aren't at home)

As a wakeup timer, works wonders as the lowest setting still feels blinding at 5am. As far as doing anything particularly expressive, I mean they're just a solid color bulb, so y'know... bright/dim. I will say at the brightest setting, one bulb will illuminate a room and furthermore, the actual smoothness of the dimming really surprised us. The brightness doesn't change in sudden increments which is perfect!",4.0 out of 5 stars

Cryptobyte,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2022",I was originally against the idea of getting into the Hue ecosystem because it requires a bridge and the bulbs are expensive but after a lot of thinking and finding useful accessories I decided to give it a try when I found the new 75W equivalent bulbs on Amazon. I’m very glad I took the chance - going from cheap Walmart smart bulbs to these is huge they look and function like a far more polished product and they are so popular that many other smart home devices can integrate with them. These are nice and bright and I love that there’s a fade in / out when you toggle them on and off. The colors look great and they don’t flicker when you change the color like the cheap bulbs do.

Regardless of if you have the bridge or not, the Philips Hue skill doesn't work with Alexa anymore and it's a known issue (the skill has a 1 star rating and should be removed from the Alexa app). The smart bulbs supposedly require a Philips Hue bridge and separate Philips app to control the lights and while yes, the brand's own app allows you to have smart functionality, they're advertised as compatible with Alexa but it never works. Also, the bridge and app can't be controlled outside your house. So if you want to turn on the lights before you get home, tough luck.

SarahW,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024","I ordered this as a gift for my husband. The outermost package was damaged and upon opening it, one of the go it lightbulbs was shattered. So disappointed as I do not have the ability to return it in time for his birthday. Hopefully he likes the rest of the kit, but I’m very disappointed that he won’t get to use all four lightbulbs, especially with how pricey they are.",2.0 out of 5 stars
PHILLIP D. WOODS,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2022","I am not very technical, but I was able to set up the Huw system. I put the two bulbs in my garage lights, put them on the Hue timer and linked them to Alexa. I liked it so much, I bought two more bulbs and put them in my bedroom. Then, I bought two more bulbs and put them in my hallway. I plan on doing my living room in the future.",5.0 out of 5 stars
JZ,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2022","When I try to set this up, the app finds the Hue Bridge right away, but says it requires a mandatory update. I click ""Update Now"" and after 10 minutes or so, the update fails every time. The app won't let me get any further without the update and it is incapable of installing the update. Philips Hue support is also completely unhelpful. This has easily been the worst smart home purchase I've ever made and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Edit: After multiple unhelpful support sessions, I talked to someone who sent me a new one, which worked perfectly. The whole experience was still terrible, but I guess I can bump my review up to 3 stars.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Rory,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2023","Quite expensive set of four light bulbs that take about five minutes every night to turn off. Using the app a different member of my family attempts to turn the lights off at the end of the night and one bulb continually turns back on. It’s maddening but whoah look we can make the room look like a sunset. Foolish Americana purchase, looking forward to buying some regular lightbulbs. Not very smart and NYSEG now offers this $180+ item for under $50.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Jeanann Mueller,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2021","The first thing that annoyed me was finding out the hub isn't wireless. I though like with most wireless devices it would need to be connected for initial configuration and then could be moved to wherever. This is not the case. Per their tech support it has to remain connected via ethernet to your wireless router. Even though right on the bottom of the hub it states wifi certified. I suppose it is for the bulbs only.

Which brings me the next thing that annoyed me. The instructions that come with this a very vague. They don't come with any information other than a 4 step process that is supposed to be easy, but when you have issues isn't.

The other issue is the hub has issues connecting to the network. It worked fine on the initial start up, but once I went to enable the skill for Alexa it disconnected momentarily as you have to push the button on the hub. I finally got it connected but was pretty annoying to get it connected.",3.0 out of 5 stars
MOM OF BOYS,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2022",After 2 years stops working! They say 22 years in description to justify the cost. Bold face Lie. When I called support at Hue they hung up on me. Great while they lasted,1.0 out of 5 stars

Tobal Salvaje,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2021","These bulbs were insanely easy to install and they hook up to their hub (required) and HomeKit smoothly. They are not the brightest bulbs in the box (never said that and meant it literally before). After I purchased these I thought I would change all the lights in the house, but I’ve decided to keep some regular (led) lights in place. If I’m looking for something at night, one bulb in my living room lamp just isn’t bright enough at 100%. But being able to tell Siri that I want to relax, and watching her dim the bulbs and set the color to a calming sky blue, is worth the price. In all fairness I haven’t tried any other bulbs in the market, but I’ve had these for about a month with no problems. Highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Matthew Pennington,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2020","From the first second I plugged these bad boys in, and hooked it up to my router, I was like whaaaaaaa, this is AWESOME. Lights go infinite shades of whatever color you want, which is so cool. Not just like 16 colors but ALL variants between the ends of the color spectrum. Which is super awesome for dialing in that perfect shade of ocean water you want. Works perfect with Alexa, I've set up multiple scenes and commands and now I just come downstairs and tell Alexa good morning and she fires up all my lights and everything is a joy. Love LOVE these bulbs. I knew they existed but never got them. Now I'm like geeez I waited way way WAY to long to join the wifi lightbulb club. These are awesome, you'll love em. Simple installation, easy app setup, BAM. A+ 5 stars.",5.0 out of 5 stars
David,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2022","Fairly easy to set up, loved that it works with Apple HomeKit and Siri. Only thing we’ve noticed is that there are more options/features for the lights in the Hue app, wish all of the same options could be pushed to the HomeKit app, as well. Also, wish we could control the lights out of home with voice control rather than having to got into the app manually. All in all, love the scenes options, automation technology availability and easy setup.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Parker Medlin,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2022",Ordered this 4-pack and unfortunately had to return it due to a mistake on my part (ordered the wrong type of bulb) and the return was going to be a huge hassle but DRUMM worked with me and bent over backwards to help get the situation resolved.
