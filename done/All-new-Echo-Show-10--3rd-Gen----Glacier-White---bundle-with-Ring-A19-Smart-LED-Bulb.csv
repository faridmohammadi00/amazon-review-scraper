BornForTech,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2022","So let's look at the model Echo Show 10 itself. Thought it was going to be something like putting a tablet on top of an Apple Home Pod (first gen). Well....it's not. Keep forgetting the Echo Show devices are not tablet user interface devices and the sound quality is not even close to the Home Pod, so just a tad disappointed with that. That said, I do really like the device. I don't have a problem with the Echo UI, in fact i kinda like it better than a tablet. The sound isn't bad, it just isn't what I was hoping for after looking at the design and certainly the price point. The screen and camera quality are really quite good, although when I watch the home screen transition from one picture to another the transition is not super smooth, like maybe the processor is a little under-powered. Not sure about that one tho. The motion feature is nice that it moves to ""look at"" whoever in the room is talking to it (nice feature), the problem is you can turn the motion off, close the camera and still it's gonna move to what ever section of the house has the brightest light. That is so annoying. I might want it to stay looking ""at me"" and not move around so I ask it to play something, turn any motion option OFF and it will eventually move anyway. Drives me up the wall. I think that could probably be addressed in a software OS fix, hopefully soon. Also, when you talk to it, it will move around a lot like it's trying to figure out where you are exaclty. All in all, it isn't a bad device for the living room, picture, sound, camera all nice, just needs the motion adjusted to ""don't move"" means ""don't move"" and they could probably upgrade the processor or maybe adjust the OS a little. If you need an Echo Show and you are only going to purchase one AND don't need it to function as a hub, I'd go with the Echo Show 8 (2021). Otherwise, wait for some changes to this model. Gave it 4 stars for all nice features, but minus one big star for the motion. Does play live video feeds like ABC News really well, that's a plus...and my favorite Sci-Fi (Expanse) looks amazing on it too. If they fix any issues I'll update this review. Hope it helps.
Review Update 9/3/2022: So I moved the Echo 10 into a different room where the lighting was more even and that stopped most of the moving around problems. Then one day it seemed to want to move again and when I was finished a screen popped up that asked if I wanted to change the direction limits. I said yes and it had a great feature I wasn't aware of that let me set the boundaries to the smallest movement possible. With those two changes I have updated my 4 stars to 5. Problems solved and now I don't have to constantly look at the back of the screen. Very happy, really like this product. Thinking about buying another one to replace an Echo 5. The 5 is amazing, but I've gotten to the point where I just want the biggest screen possible, thus the only reason to replace the 5. Good luck, hope this info helps!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Vlad,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021","I was enthusiastic when I ordered my Echo Show 3rd Gen. It was supposed to be a robot but not quite. Awesome speakers, great camera, rotating screen?! I got it out of the box, set it up and although I was a bit thrown off by the white cord sticking out of the black unit like a sore thumb, I really didn’t have major issues. The problem was that after using it for a bit longer bugs started to pop out.
Bugs observed:
- Screen rotates past you.
- Barely touching the screen for an action result in a path is blocked message.
- Can’t rotate at night because if an area is lit dimly will result in motion stopping and an error message
- Some error messages disappear pretty quickly
- During a video call the zooming, orienting of the lenses is not quite right
- Sometimes it won’t respond to the wake up word.
Hardware wise though, this one is better in every regard than its predecessor, which I considered a 5 star product, so the potential is there. So, while I think they would have benefited from a bit more of development time, I think the potential is there. Hopefully, they can do a firmware update to correct the issues. At this point I am not returning it, but if you haven’t bought it, I would wait for a few updates.
UPDATE JAN2022 (Raised one star):
Some of the most annoying bugs have been fixed but not all of them have. However, the improvements are significant enough that I would consider purchasing another one if on sale. If not,the current Gen Show 8 is really good too.
UPDATE JUL2022 (Raised another star)
This is what I expected when I ordered this device. Haven’t had a bug in a while. Screen rotation is significantly better, stopping at the correct spots and following better. Additionally, a friend that ordered a current gen black Echo Show 8, received a black power cord with it; it appears that Amazon is moving in the right direction with the power cords. Given that those were my main issues with the device, I raised it a star.",5.0 out of 5 stars

tobor,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2023","I've got 9 Echo devices in my home. I've been using Echos (and upgrading to the latest models) since they were first made available. This Echo Show 10 replaced an Echo Show 8 (1st Generation) in my kitchen. I use it multiple times each day to play Spotify, listen to radio (via TuneIn), set timers, etc. The sound quality is very good and I place it only slightly behind my Echo Studio + Echo Sub pair as it pertains to sound quality.

The screen is, likewise, excellent. I have my Show 10 set to rotate a series of fine art prints I've uploaded to Amazon Photos and the colors really pop and look gorgeous on the screen. I find this feature really enhances the ambiance in my kitchen and every time I glance at the screen and see a piece of art I'm glad I purchased the device. I like the screen being larger than the Show 8, although I don't think I'd recommend an expensive ""upgrade"" merely for the screen size.

I have read that many people dislike the number of ads or stories that the Show 10 displays. You can go into settings and select the content you want to see. I've reduced it to only weather and news--everything else is turned off. I almost never see ads and feel that this type of criticism is unwarranted. My Show 10 (like my Show 8) displays content I've allowed and almost nothing more.

The Echo Show 10 loses a star for voice responsiveness. I have it placed in a corner that is pretty wide and open--it's not obstructed in any way. Unfortunately, about 30% of the time the device doesn't ""hear"" a command when I'm standing 4 feet away. Instead, my Echo Studio--which is in an entirely different room--responds. Sometimes it is even worse with an Echo in my bedroom (which is multiple rooms away) responding to my attempt to set a timer whilst in the kitchen. I find it very odd and frustrating. My first generation Echo (the original) did a far better job in this area than the Echo Show 10. And as far as I can tell there is no way to set the mic sensitivity via the Alexa app. That said, the positives still outweigh this negative, but I'm dropping 1 star from my rating.

I'd also add that the ""follow"" feature in which the device's screen moves to face you is not very compelling for me. I can envision other people finding it useful, but for me it seems more like a gimmick. The device is generally reliable following me, but whenever it reaches the edge of the boundary I set it flashes a giant warning message that I'm out of range. That large pop-up is really annoying and there is no way to turn it off. If it didn't flash that warning literally EVERY time I work in the kitchen I might be able to overlook it--as it is, it's just a reminder that Amazon has failed to improve the device. There should be a way to turn off that notification.

The Echo Show 10 is a decent device, but I'm not so sure of the value proposition. Adding a motor to turn the screen increases complexity and cost yet the benefits of this design are not compelling. And because this is the only device in the Echo lineup to employ this feature, Amazon hasn't really prioritized improving Echo Show 10 functionality. I don't know what is going on with the mic sensitivity, but it's not as good as it should be. The sound quality, however, is solid, and the screen is decent and a great size.",4.0 out of 5 stars
C,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021","The new Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is a big improvement over the previous 2nd Gen version. The Show 10 is now attached to a swivel base that lets the Show 10 constantly rotate to face you as you move around the room. Other changes include: a new speaker configuration, MUCH better camera, better processor, and Amazon Sidewalk support. Here are my thoughts so far:

THE GOOD:

-SETUP – Setup was super easy. The Show came configured to my account, I didn't have to log in or even enter wifi passwords. It connected, downloaded some updates, and then walked me through customizing the range of motion.
-MOTION- This is the most obvious new improvement. The Show 10 will now track your movement and turn to face you as you move around the room. The Show seems to have very good facial tracking, and it will rotate on its horizontal axis to follow you (you can also manually tilt the screen up and down to your desired vertical position.) We tested this while playing movies and while viewing our remote cameras, and it worked perfectly. We also tested with multiple people in the room; and the Show seems to lock onto one face and moves to follow that face, until it can't see that face anymore and will move to another face. Or if someone uses the Wake Word “Alexa,” it will turn toward where that voice was coming from. This also works for video calls, though we noticed that on video calls the Show will rotate to try to keep ALL of our faces in view. Sometimes this might mean it faces in between two people so that the camera can see both of us, and then automatically zooms the camera in or out to adjust. Which brings me to the next big improvement:
-13MP CAMERA – We were very impressed with the quality of the new camera, and with the tracking technology it uses. Not only are images crisp and detailed on video calls, but the camera will actually automatically zoom in and out to adjust to the people in the shot. For example I can back up from my kitchen into the living room, and the camera will zoom in and follow me. When you combine this with the movement and facial tracking, it is almost like having your own camera man follow you around the room on your call. The family members we called said they could see so much more detail. There is also now a physical shutter that you can close to cover the camera if you want to.
-SPEAKERS – The old 2nd Gen Show 10 had dual 2” neodymium drivers, but this new 3rd Gen Show 10 has two 1” tweeters and a 3” woofer. I can definitely tell the difference, although I really don't use the Show for listening to music very often. In testing out a few songs, I noticed that the new 3rd Gen seems louder at max volume, and less muffled. Definitely an improvement, though maybe not quite on the level of the Echo Studio.
-PROCESSOR – The new Show 10 has both an upgraded main processor, and also a second Amazon AZ1 processor. This should result in slightly faster repose times, and better future performance; although I really haven't been able to tell much of a difference so far. AZ1 is supposed to be faster and more efficient, and allow voice commands to be processed locally instead of having to go to the cloud; so we'll see if this is noticeable in the future.
-ZIGBEE/SIDEWALK – The previous version included a Zigbee hub, but this version also includes Amazon Sidewalk compatibility. Sidewalk is a long range connection technology that Amazon plans to use for devices that will be able to reach much further; (the initial announcement estimated up to half a mile). This technology isn't really being used yet, but it is nice to know this future tech is built in.

THE BAD:

-WHITE POWER CORD – Yes, for some reason that same white power cord that ships with the Echo 4th Gen is also included for this Show 10. No matter what color Show you get (I got black), you still get a white power cord. I'm a little surprised that they went with this decision again, but it really doesn't bother me much at all. Just thought I'd mention it in case that matters to you.
-LARGE FOOTPRINT – Since the device rotates, you really have to be careful about where you put it. The Show 10 comes with a footprint guide, that suggests that you make sure you have enough space around the device to avoid the screen knocking over a glass of water, for example. This also wasn't a big deal for me, but keep in mind you will probably need more space than the previous version. The specs recommend a 10” by 15” space, but I think you could get away with less.

*Note – You can disable the movement by saying “Alexa disable Motion,” or by turning it off in the Alexa app on your phone. Also, when you first setup your Show, there is a slider bar that let's you choose how far the screen should rotate in each direction. It seems to go almost 360 degrees maximum, but you can limit the radius so it turns much less. You can also change this in the 'Motion' menu under Settings.

Overall, I am VERY pleased with this new Show 10. The camera clarity is great, and the face tracking technology is so impressive; there's just nothing else like it for video calls to our family. This is a huge upgrade!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Vincent,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","I have owned the last two Generation Echo Shows. The Echo Show 1 & Echo Show Gen 2. The Echo Show 10 solves all the issues that the first two devices had, and adds even more features jam packed into one great device.

Now before I get into the meat and potatoes — let me tell you about the truly magical experience I have had with this device. It arrived in a box almost double the size of the previous model — and this device is BIG! The screen is huge! The speaker is also apparently much more powerful than the last generation — and I can tell, that is most definitely the case.

But the true magic comes when you power on and set up the Echo. The Amazon team really did wonders creating this device. Both the camera and the AI in this thing are crazy good. Assuming you have motion enabled, as soon as you say the wake word, i.e., “Alexa” the device honed in on my direction, rotated towards me, and began listening.

If you walk around the room, this device follows you. You can’t understand how cool this is until you try it out. I would upload a video, but I’m sure you can look it up on YouTube, and there will likely be hundreds of reviews showcasing it here.

There’s something about the tracking technology that Amazon has gotten just right. I called up my Grandma who has my old first gen echo show, and she didn’t even realize we were conversing as I was walking around my room. She thought I was just stationary the whole time. When I pointed it out and showed to her, her jaw dropped.

The way the camera zooms in on you, and the range of video it can show is phenomenal. I can jump onto my bed (my echo is on my nightstand) and the echo will zoom in and focus on me. When I go off the side of my bed, it follows zooming out, and can follow my body all the way as I walk back across the room towards the device.

It all feels so natural. The only thing that is missing would be if the Echo device itself moved! You can now have a conversation with someone when moving around your environment, without having to remain stationary.

In a kitchen, a home gym, or anywhere you’d want to talk with someone actively, this device would be really extraordinary to play with, especially during covid times.

I use my device in my room as an Alarm clock — so previously, my camera would be staring across the room as to not let me look at the screen if needed (for time/alarms, etc). Now, with the camera cover, I feel much more comfortable covering the camera and rotating the device to look towards me at night.

Now, take these into consideration as you decide if you want to purchase:

First, if you want to get the latest and greatest Echo device, the purchase is a no brainer. I am an Amazon loyalist, and can say that even from first impressions, this device blows all other Amazon devices I’ve owned away.

Second, if you’re a user who doesn’t mind the camera being uncovered, then you’ll have no problem with this device. You’ll love it. The motion features will be left on 16/7 for me. I wouldn’t be comfortable allowing having the camera on while I’m sleeping (and staring at me), but for a public area in your home — who cares? I wouldn’t mind, I’d leave it on all day — it following you around is magical.

Third, if you fall into the second issue above, you CAN use the camera cover to disable motion. If you don’t mind sliding the cover open and closed every morning/night, this could work for a nightstand alarm clock, and the hassle/inconvenience would be worth it.

Pros:
- Motion is magical
- Camera is high definition
- Sound is great. Music sounds lively. Lyrics on screen that follow you around the room
- Adaptive screen dimming still works even when camera/motion is blocked/disabled
- You can manually rotate the device when motion is off i.e. I’m going to bed, to point it towards me. I don’t know if that’s safe for the motor — I’ll ask Amazon!

Cons:
- If your room doesn’t have a full range of motion, the Echo might get confused when following you around. Since it is on my nightstand, the echo really only needs to turn about 90° to see in front if itself, and when I go to the left of my room. If I go to exit my room, it might start losing tracking, which could probably fixed in a future OS update (to halt moving at a specific point, which it already does).

Bottom Line: I 100% recommend this as an upgrade to an old device or a new device for any potential Echo owners. If you don’t feel comfortable with the motion controls, turn them off, but you won’t get the full package and what I think is the biggest selling point of this device. Put this in a public room and try it out — you won’t regret it.

EDIT: After seeing more reviews a few points to mention:

1. White power cord. Who cares? You dock a star for this? Don’t listen to normies giving poor reviews who think the color of a power cord which is draped out of sight will have any effect on how the device improves over it’s predecessor
2. Complaints over resolution: if you’re not buying this thing to watch full-fledged movies on, it’s fine. You won’t notice.
3. Complaints over tracking: it won’t track you with the camera in the dark. A future models can probably have an infrared light added (similar to FaceID) to fix that problem.
4. I saw someone complaining about Airplay and multiroom audio. Echo devices support multiroom audio through Amazon’s Ecosystem — not bluetooth. It has never supported that. Why would you expect this to change without notice?

Don’t listen to the haters. People reviewing are acting as if this device isn’t 5x better than the last generation of the Show. Motion is a stellar addition that would bring moving smart devices into the mainstream. No one here knows what a
the Facebook Portal is, because there was never a solid backing behind the product line. Echos are in homes across America, and I’m sure that this will lead to better smart devices from Amazon in the future.

For reference, I have owned an: Echo Show 1, Echo Show 2, Echo Dot, and have coded ~5 Alexa Skills. I know these devices. This gen is great. Give it 1 month and these will be 5/5. These reviews all read so fake. Who purchases a device and returns it same-day due to a different colored power cord? Who returns a device that doesn’t do something they expected when it was never said the device did it?

Low-information consumers and people with too high expectations... there’s a reason why it’s called PRE-ORDERING, because you KNOW you are going to like it and/or take what you get. No one forced you to buy a day 1 device.

TL;DR: Don’t listen to bad reviews. Buy this if you’re in the market.",5.0 out of 5 stars

kenya Garcia,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2024","I recently started using the Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen). Here’s a review focusing on its convenience:
Convenience:

The Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is an incredibly convenient addition to my home. The standout feature is its ability to move and follow me around the room. The smart display’s motorized base means it rotates to keep me in view during video calls or while watching recipes and tutorials. This hands-free feature is fantastic for multitasking—whether I’m cooking, working out, or just moving around the room, the Echo Show 10 stays with me, ensuring I never miss a beat.

1. Smart Movement:

The Echo Show 10’s ability to automatically pivot and track me during video calls or while I’m interacting with it is a game-changer. No more awkward adjustments or missed moments—this device ensures I stay in the frame and can see the screen clearly, regardless of where I move.

2. Crystal-Clear Display:

The HD display is vibrant and sharp, making it perfect for watching videos, browsing photos, or following along with recipes. The 10.1-inch screen size is just right—not too big and not too small—offering an excellent viewing experience without dominating my countertop or desk space.

3. Premium Sound Quality:

The sound quality is top-notch, with rich, clear audio that fills the room. Whether I'm listening to music, catching up on the news, or watching a movie, the Echo Show 10 delivers an immersive audio experience. The built-in speakers are powerful and provide crisp sound, enhancing the overall convenience of the device.

4. Voice-Controlled Smart Home Hub:

Integrated with Alexa, the Echo Show 10 acts as a central hub for my smart home devices. I can control lights, thermostats, and other smart gadgets with simple voice commands. The convenience of managing my smart home from a single device, especially with voice commands, simplifies my daily routines.

5. Video Calling Made Easy:

The Echo Show 10 simplifies video calls with its high-definition camera and auto-framing feature. It’s easy to connect with family and friends, and the camera ensures that everyone in the room is visible and in focus. Plus, the privacy shutter provides peace of mind when not in use.

6. Interactive Features:

The touch screen interface is intuitive and responsive, making it easy to interact with apps, view photos, or check the weather. The device integrates seamlessly with various services, including Amazon services and third-party apps, enhancing its versatility.

7. Home Automation Integration:

The Echo Show 10 works well with other smart home devices, allowing me to automate tasks and create routines. Setting up routines for daily tasks like turning on the lights or adjusting the thermostat is straightforward, making home management more efficient.

Cons:

While the Echo Show 10 excels in convenience, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider:

1. Size and Placement:

The device is relatively large and requires a bit of space. Its size might be a consideration if you have a smaller kitchen or desk area.

2. Price Point:

It is on the higher end of the price spectrum for smart displays. While the features justify the cost, it may not be the most budget-friendly option for everyone.

3. Motion Tracking Sensitivity:

While the motion tracking is a fantastic feature, it can sometimes be overly sensitive. In certain lighting conditions or with rapid movements, the device may have difficulty keeping up.

Final Thoughts:

The Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is a highly convenient and feature-rich smart display. Its ability to move and track users, combined with excellent sound quality and a sharp HD display, makes it a valuable addition to any smart home. Despite a few minor considerations regarding size and price, the Echo Show 10’s functionality and ease of use make it a worthwhile investment for those looking to enhance their smart home experience.",5.0 out of 5 stars
A. Pena,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2021","Full disclosure, I receive gift cards from my place of work from time to time and I used some of that money to pay for half of this unit, though it is not related to Amazon of course so this review is fully of my own opinions.

I own a few of the Amazon Echo show units dating back to the original Gen 1 Echo Show (7 inch). I currently still own that unit and had a place in my kitchen for several years. My wife now working from home needed an Echo in her upstairs office (where it was becoming troublesome to reach her from the other end of the house) so instead of purchasing an all new one, we decided based on her casual usage that we would replace the Gen 1 Echo Show with the latest generation for the kitchen. At the time, I wasnt aware of the new Echo Show 10, but was intrigued to find out there was a new version with a motorized screen display. I am somewhat of an early adopter, but my profession is in computer/electrical engineering and wanted to see if this was worth the substantial increase in costs. The gift card funds just help take that sting out of the purchase that made the decision easier over the costs of the non motorized Show product line.

Unboxing:
Unboxing was straight forward if you are familiar with the Show lineup and not much to say other than that reviews had led me to believe the unit was big, but I was not surprised by what I found. Essentially a large speaker base with what appears to be a tablet stuck to it, not that surprising and what anyone would expect. The cable like many others have mentioned on the charcoal colored unit is a bit annoying that it is white, but not the end of the world. Just would have appreciated more attention to this detail. Packaging looked well capable of protecting the unit as it was a box within a box, within another Amazon box, but this is where I have a small gripe. Did we need 3 boxes for this, Amazon, please work on the overuse of packaging for wastage.

Setup:
Setup was pretty standard if you have ever performed an Echo setup, but a bit elongated to perform the turning radius setup limits which is handy if your Show will have objects nearby or walls to contend with. I have none in this case as it is going at the end of the counter bar that divides the Den area with the Kitchen area. It can turn 360 degrees freely and this was easy to see how to limit or run unhindered. The rest of the setup was just confirming the Amazon account, wireless connection, and home screen details. All within about 3 minutes or less.

First impressions:
My first impressions were the unit is very sleek looking and the weight seemed adequate for the unit to be stable on the bench. The screen was perfectly bright and just the right size to view from a reasonable distance. The speed of the rotation as some have mentioned being too slow I found just fine as I want it to be quiet (which it is in motion - perfectly silent) and yet not aggressive in the movements as to call too much attention to the unit. My family thought it was pretty interesting how it can follow if you interact with it, but normally it stay put unless you ask it a question. In locating the person to point at with the voice trigger, I actually found the unit a little less sensitive to the wake command than any of my other generation units including the latest 8 inch and 5 inch Show units (I own 4 x 8 inch units and 4 x 5 inch units, along with 3 echo dots). In fact I have an upstairs Echo Show 8 (open ceiling through the Den into the movie theater room, that many times ""bongs"" to the wake command sooner than the kitchen one will standing within a few feet of this new unit. This isnt a huge issue once you get used to it, but I hope Amazon tweaks the sensitivity of the wake command to be more in line with other models in the lineup. One of the reason I got this new unit was my impressively fast results with the other latest generation Echo Show 8 units being so fast to work a command over the 1st generation.

After a few weeks of usage:
I have found that the unit motorized feature is a little bit of a novelty, but in daily use it has been a welcome change. For the price difference, I am right on the fence of whether I would pay the difference knowing what I know now and I know that may not help anyone reading this, but it is really right there with I would or wouldnt pay the extra. As the price knowingly will come down over time, this should become easier to make a decision.

Sound Quality:
Sound quality is above par for my expectations, as it is more clear than the preceding model. It has more depth to me and sound dispersion to 360 degrees is far better than the rear/side facing speakers of the past. Potentially largely due to the screen being out of the way which is a bit expected. Louder volumes were reached without distortion compared to previous units and the highs were clear and pronounced without overdoing it. Happy with this as an area speaker, but this wont replace your bookshelf stereo for instance. It can be paired with other devices so you can expand this if necessary.

Motion tracking:
As mentioned from others, this is a bit laggy, but in the ""works well enough"" category. It is not quick to jump around, but can trail someone easily walking around. What I found is that it rarely loses focus of the individual completely even though it will trail the motion. And if the user is continuing to speak, it almost never loses track of the user in my testing. Of note, it of course does not track up and down as the motorized function is swivel only, but the wide angle of the lens makes this mostly unnecessary.

Final verdict:
Would I get this again? In this same scenario, definitely, no regrets. Had I needed to pay the entire amount? At $250 at the time of writing while the 8 inch is $109, this is a hard justification, but when we remember that a year ago the previous 10 inch model was selling for $229, it gets a lot easier to see that the extra $20 delivers quite a bit. Better sound, motorized swivel, a better screen, and a much better tilt/angle/level than the previous unit had out of the box. I think this is a win, if it isnt a solid win over the previous generation. I hope that the mic sensitivity gets better with updates, but I dont have many complaints over what is delivered today from this model.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Char, The (Mostly) Happy Shopper","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2023","Here I am again with yet another echo review. Anyone who follows my reviews knows I have quite a few of these things. I'm always buying a new one and then doing the echo shuffle, placing them in different rooms with every upgrade. I have the echo dot 2nd gen (well, had....we'll get to that in a bit), an echo dot 4th generation, three echo show 5's, an echo show 8 and now, with my latest purchase, an echo show 10. I have them all over our house. I've been watching the 10 and 15 for a while now. Then, one day, I got a notification that the 10 had a deal. I took it and noticed they'd give me more off in I traded in one of my other devices. Out went the 2nd gen because I knew, with the upgrade and shuffling, I wouldn't use it anymore. The sadness washed over me. It was our first echo relationship. So many memories. The good times, the bad times. I will look back at them fondly. I took some time to say goodbye before packaging it up and taking it to the UPS drop-off. They say getting over your first is hard, and they are right, but it was time to move on.....

I purchased the 10 and it arrived the next day. Set up, as always, was a breeze. Took less than 5 minutes thanks to the preset up email. The 10 is about the right size for our kitchen (where it replaced the 8, which got moved elsewhere, hence the shuffle) and I love having the bigger screen to watch the news while I get ready for work in the morning. The sound and picture quality are pretty great. I did get a little stand for it so it sits a bit taller, but other than that, it's just about perfect. Just about you say? Yea, just about. My issue is with the one feature that the others I own don't have. Motion detection. I hate it. Why? Well, first, I don't ever use my echos for phone calls. I know some people do and that's cool. Just not my thing. Second, I placed my echo in a corner. It can't swivel without hitting a wall. So, I turned that feature off. Simple enough. Or so I thought. It did an update recently and I walked into my kitchen, only to find it stuck against the wall. It had reset itself. Bad Alexa, bad. I turned the feature off again. It started to move once more, telling me it was stuck. I gave it a good amount of side eye and double checked the settings. It showed that it was turned off. Hmmm. I did what our IT department always says to do when faced with a tech crisis. I turned it off and back on again. I also closed the camera lens, something I had forgotten to do with this one. It hasn't tried moving since. Let's hope it stays that way.

Since it does come with motion detection, one nice thing about it (yes, there is something positive about it I guess) is that even when disabled, the screen can be swiveled. Now, I do like that. I have had to adjust the screen a little depending on where I am in the room or because of the glare of the lights and it's nice to not have to move the whole device. I do sometimes wish you could lock it into place though. No swiveling at all. If there is such a feature (outside of the motion detection disable), I haven't found it yet.

Aside from that, just as with my other echos, I really like it. It's great for checking our blink cameras, watching news or tv, playing music throughout the house, controlling our lights, creating shopping lists, reminders and the like, or just being entertained by asking silly questions. Me and Alexa can have hours of fun with the last one. She's a crazy gal. There are so many things you can do that I doubt I will stop with the 10. As a matter of fact, I know I won't. As Amazon keeps making them, I will probably keep buying them, eventually having one in every single room in our house. I'm honestly pretty close. What will I do then, you ask? Well, we do have a garage and I have a workout shed, so we shall see.....",4.0 out of 5 stars

The sound quality from the speaker is good, much better than my echo show 5. The screen size is perfect for my kitchen, on the counter. Fits well in this otherwise wasted space and looks great.
I have it connected to my ring cameras and it alerts if someone's at my door. I also connected my Spotify to it and I can play music on all three of my echo shows at the same time, in multiple rooms.

J,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023","We're approaching the two year mark with the Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) in our kitchen and as such it has been used heavily. We've tinkered around with just about every bell and whistle that is available on it. Ultimately, we've decided that it is just a poor design across the board and consequently a frustrating user experience.

Honestly, most of these ""bells and whistles"" really aren't something anyone would make use of other than to ""try them out"" once as we've done. The news and sports widgets may interest you, but I feel like we are drowning in those two types of widgets on every screen we encounter these days; phone, watch, PC, work laptop, home laptop, tablet, TV. I feel like I have enough news, weather, and sports widgets to last me a lifetime at this point.

We ended up disabling everything except the rotating photos, so it's nothing more than a glorified digital photo frame for us. It's decent for that, but frankly the majority of digital photo frames out there will do a better job. Just stick an Echo Dot next nearby for Alexa...

As far as the lackluster photo experience, for example, you can't make it default to photo frame mode, or even force it to stay in that mode for an extend period of time. It always ends up back at the home screen after awhile. So, if you set it up to do so, you end up with rotating Amazon Photos photos on the ""home screen"" which you get forced to. The home screen photos are decent but, just like everything else in the Echo Show, still feels buggy and clunky. When you set a 10 second or 30 second photo rotation (or whatever) it definitely doesn't follow that setting. Sometimes it will hang on a photo for several minutes, other times it will rotate in 10 seconds. It feels like that setting is for Photo Frame mode, which (as mentioned) is essentially a useless feature, since it does not stay persistent.

Another drawback while being forced into the home screen for making it a digital photo frame is the clock/date are in the bottom left hand corner, and they are absolutely massive. They cannot be adjusted or disabled, as most everything else on the device... very little customization options. We have like 700 clocks in our kitchen, and would totally be fine with disabling the Echo Show clock... Often it will rotate to a photo and then the focal point of the photo ends up blocked by the huge clock. This happens a lot to us because we end up taking family selfies, and (having the longest arms currently) I normally take them, so I end up in the upper right of the photo, with the wife more towards the left, and then the kids in the bottom left... so, the huge clock cuts the kids out of the picture and most of the time half of my wife gets cut. That clock really does wreck a ton of photos, family selfies or not. Long story short the photo experience is decent, but there are way better options/devices out there, especially since the other options will integrate with other services such as Apple or Google photos, but with the Echo Show you are forced into Amazon Photos which is severely lackluster compared to the ""other two""...

Aside from the photos I have no idea why anyone would like this device, let alone rate it 5 stars. The speaker looks like it should be awesome, but it's also lackluster. The hardware just kinda sucks... it is quite sluggish in terms of performance.

We do have Spotify integration set up and do also use that a bit just because my kids play music on alexa in general a lot... but, if you have read this far, then it's not going to be a shocker when you hear we feel the Echo Spotify app is a clunky, sluggish, and just overall lackluster experience when compared to the Apple, Android, PC, Mac, and Web Spotify apps.

It seems like it could be great for video calls. We did try that some when I was traveling for work and it's just too sluggish and clunky, we always ended up flipping over to our phones. Also forget the ""follow me"" screen rotation mode thing, it sounds cool, but works like garbage. Same with streaming videos in general, just doesn't work well, I'd rather just use a small phone.

All of that said, having a digital alexa photo frame is decent enough... These things aren't too pricey, especially when you catch them during Amazon's big sales...

But.... the two straws which broke the camel's back, and makes me want to go office space this thing, are:

a) Our family loves shopping on Amazon, we spend a disgusting amount on Amazon every year, so take this point for what it is... but in pure slime ball fashion Amazon forces advertisements on the screen which pop up periodically trying to get you to buy random stuff. Sometimes, this stuff may not even be something you'd like advertised to your kids or guests. There is absolutely no way to disable these ads. So they charge you 100 to 300 bucks for something like this, and force their ads on to you. That in and of itself should be a hard stop for anyone considering one of these.

b) I'm not sure how this next point is working behind the scenes over there at Amazon, but it appears that any new or updated feature forces itself to be turned on (even after previously disabling it). This is a regular occurance. Like I said we've literally disabled everything, but things just pop up out of nowhere, or are periodically turned back on, such as news, sports, joke of the day, etc etc. And nope, it's not my kids messing with it, they can't even reach it.

TTLD;, the Echo Show 10 kinda sucks, part due to hardware issues, but bigger part due to software issues, which leads me to believe whatever version comes next will also suck. That said, 45,458 reviews as of this post, and 4.5 stars... so the masses appear to love this big weird clunky rotating wonky crappy weak sauce robot tablet... :D",1.0 out of 5 stars

PMR,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2023","I bought this mainly to use it as a video call unit (I intend to buy a second one soon, which will be installed at a relative's house). My second use is watching the house when I'm away (via the app on my cell) and seeing a couple of cameras I have installed.

That said, here are my PROS and CONS.

PROS:
- Nice screen of a good format and size. The resolution is really good, too.
- Good sound, equivalent to (if not better than) what my Echo 3rd gen produces.
- Should make a nice video call set (more on that when I install the second unit; I will get back here to update my review).
- The screen follows you (most of the time)!

CONS:
- The screen is way too reflective. That makes it hard to read if there's a window behind you.
- A white power cord for a black unit, really, Amazon?! OK, I understand it saves YOU some bucks, but it's an eyesore at my all-black countertop. A black unit should come with a black cord, period. Good thing I had an Echo 3rd gen. with a black cord I could use (my Echo can keep the white cord since it falls hidden behind a piece of furniture).
- While I'm at that... the power cord has a different adaptor than the Echo Dots. So you can only replace the eyesore white cord like I did if you have an Echo (not the dot, but the taller one, which also uses a different adaptor -- come on, Amazon, standardize that stuff!)
- Somewhat harder to hear you... and I can attest to that since I have five other Echo Dots 3rd gen plus an Echo 3rd gen in the house. You call it, it doesn't hear you, and you need to repeat it louder. It's so annoying that sometimes a Dot in a far-away room will reply to your command instead of this unit, which is right on your face.
- Besides, you can say ""Alexa, do [whatever]"" to an echo dot, while you have to call ""Alexa"" (wait for it to find you) and then ""do [whatever]"" on this thing. Not as fast/responsive as the Echo Dots.
- No infrared vision, so don't expect it to be helpful as a night camera to watch your house.
- It does follow you, but sort of ""crooked."" Its camera is off-center, so it usually doesn't ""look at you"" directly but a little sideways. No, there's no way to fine-tune that either. And sometimes, for no good reason, you can walk in front of it, and it won't follow you... I haven't yet figured out why and when it does follow me, even after telling her to ""follow me"" and activating that mode.

Finally, let's be honest: I love what it does, and many years ago, I was impressed with what this technology promised. But almost a decade later, Alexa isn't becoming smarter. It recognizes my face and my voice. But if I tell her my birthday or some other fact about me, she's still incapable of memorizing it (yes, I can create a note, but that's not the same as this thing really KNOWING when my birthday -- or anyone's birthday -- is).

Today, it also should be smart enough to receive two or more commands at once, like ""turn off my office light, turn on my bedroom light, and play music.""

And even though I have a Fire TV at home, it took way too many commands and internet searches until I got this new unit to control it (it kept replying, ""your Fire TV can't do that"" to every command; I finally got it to work, but definitely not a user-friendly set up as I'd have expected).

So the promise of Artificial Intelligence is still in the air. This thing has good voice recognition, but its features and skills are still not worthy of being called ""intelligence.""",4.0 out of 5 stars

Jace,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2024","This is by far our family’s favorite Amazon product. We started with an echo dot (2nd gen) in 2017, then fire tv sticks, plug ins, fire tablets, echo auto and echo shows. We pretty much have an alexa/echo device in each rooms.
It was very easy to install especially if you already have an amazon account. Also, check out their trade-in program. Take advantage of upgrading your echo devices and experience how amazon develops their products and try their best to give customers great and reliable products.
Now, this Echo Show 10 does a lot of work in our home. I won’t discuss about any technical things about it since I do not speak that language. However I will review this from a Mom’s standpoint.
As a parent of curious kids, you’ll get hundreds of questions a day. Sometimes you’d know the answers and there are times you don’t. The device helps me with that. Sure the other echo dots can do it but having a screen that follows you is more fun and more informative for kids. It makes my kids interested in current events as it shows news articles and photos. It would give some facts and interesting topics for us to discuss further. Of course, my kids will do their own research and it keeps them more interested. From music, history, conversation, spelling, you name it, it would have the answers.
Next is the camera feature, any approved contacts can drop in on this device. It’s amazing since they could pretty much video call other relatives that have alexa app or devices. It makes us feel more connected with our loved ones that can’t operate phones to video call.
So aside from connecting us with humans, it connects us to other non humans; my vacuum cleaner, air purifier, lights, window blinds and so much more. It helps me multi task. As a mom, life gets busy and I forget a lot of things! I rely on this device to remind me about my schedule, chores, shopping lists, recipes, etc. I do have other ways to remind myself about things but it helps that there’s a device that will show me and tell me to do it. It makes me remember more when I see my list and this thing does it for me without all the paper clutter.
Then there’s more features to explore!

Jason Gaines,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2021","UPDATE 4-17-21: Still working fine, no issues. Only thing I wish, is that I had just waited a month to purchase this as it went on sale super quick for $50 less. What’s the point of being an early adopter if it’s a negative?! I’d rather have just waited; next time I will. ;(

UPDATE 3-30-21: Our Video Apps Crashing issue came back, so I contacted Amazon again and they decided it would be best to replace the unit. A new one will be here in another day, so I can see if that one has any issues. I do like the Show 10, but I'm a little less smitten with it then I thought I would be. Again, the motion part is not as useful as one would like due to it's ability to actually track you properly without getting lost. I do really enjoy having a device to watch something in the kitchen while chilling out or cooking, and playing music on it is actually quite nice. Maybe it just needs to grow on me some more, and absolutely have the video apps stop crashing that is a definite.

So we’ve had this for a month now. It’s been fun to get to use it and see what it can do. That being said, it’s not as useful as I thought it would be. This is much less a tablet and more a media player. You can’t customize it like a Kindle or other tablets and put your own apps on it. It does play music really well and it does okay with smart home stuff. But that is an Alexa issue not Echo Show problem. I was hoping we had more customization with this but the OS is pretty closed loop.

Motion: Hit or Miss. it will follow you when you tell it to, but it will lose you easily, especially if you are too close to the unit or move to rapidly. There is a happy space of probably about 5ft to 8ft where it will follow you well. Too close and it will focus on something else, same thing for too far away. It loses you and once it does it forgets who it was following. Too many people around can confuse it as well. If it’s just you and your cleaning dishes or cooking, you should be okay.

Video: we had an issue with our unit crashing any video app such as Prime Video or Netflix after about 5-8mins of watching something. It would just go back to the home screen and forget what you were watching. If you started the app up again you had to start back from where you began as it would not save your progress. Calling support just recommended a factory reset which was going to be our next step anyways, and so far that has corrected the crashing.

Security: it’s easy enough to view the camera on the Show and move it left or right to see what’s around the area. Just remember you can’t move the screen up or down remotely, so if it tilted too far up it will limit your view. Otherwise it works well, and the screen notifies you when someone is remotely viewing on the screen.

Customization: Meh, it’s okay but will take some time getting used to the OS. It works like a tablet in the fact you tap or swipe to get to stuff, but again you can’t add any apps from an App Store. The OS is locked to what it is, and maybe that’s a good thing so it doesn’t get corrupted by junk we all like to add. Still, it limits the functionality and use of this device.

Overall: It’s a sound bar with a video display that can control smart home apps. The sound is really good, loud and crisp. Video is nice and smooth and if you have issues try a reset of the device. Not as full featured as a full on tablet, but pretty good over all. I gave it a four star rating. Really it’s a 4.5, but not a full 5 so I’m not picking that just because they don’t give us half ratings to use. It’s not cheap at $250 new right now, but it is worth the price if you want a good setup for say the kitchen or other room except for living room.",4.0 out of 5 stars

J. Fernandez,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","First the camera is offset, so the screen is always offset when it follow you, that is when it does actually follow you, because more than half of the time it does not, and God forbid you try to touch the monitor, because it will constantly tell you the screen has bumped into something... It has way too many bugs in the software ... I am not at all impressed with this update, because it doesn't seem like a lot of thought went into this model!

BUT ... My biggest gripe has to do with the electrical cord, it is way too short, and plugs into the bottom of the base, which is also insanely difficult to reach without the monitor swinging all around, and good forbid you have to unplug it for any reason, because it will constantly make you put in your password over and over!

I am sorry, but this update is a big fail! It is definitely not ready for consumers! They really should have worked out the bugs before releasing it to the public! This unit truly seems like it should be in beta testing still, because it has way too many issues that need to be addressed!

Update: The advertisement makes it look as if you can use the device to scan one’s surroundings, when not at home, but what only the small print reveals, which most people will miss, that it only does this FOR A PRICE AND with a SUBSCRIPTION to HOME GUARD plus!

At $250, this should have been included, at least for a year, free of charge! I bought this believing I could scan a room, from my mobile device, only to find out ... you can’t, NOT EVEN WHEN YOU ARE AT HOME! Really Amazon, you couldn’t include that at least for a year free! As a prime member, for many years, I find this totally unacceptable, from a billion dollar company, that is charging way too much for this device! Do yourself a favor and wait until Amazon addresses the many issues and bugs this device does have at the present time!

Xtra, And apparently there is no way to pair the Amazon Remote in the software! I have search high and low for a way to pair my remote, but the option is no longer in the settings on the device or app!

After several months of owning this device I can say with all honesty it is the WORST device and echo show I have EVER owned!, along with the new Echo, Amazon has me truly believing it is time to cancel all my Amazon accounts, because the majority of their devices don’t work like they claim!

JD,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2023","*Updated 11/23/23* - so it appears that Amazon reintroduced a toggle in the ""Home Screen"" section this month to turn off the highly annoying ""things Alexa can do"" or ""things to try"" interruptions and it seems to be working at this point. I increased my rating to 3 stars.

Original review
Echo Show 10 - in use for 3 months. I have 4 other echo audio-only devices and a variety of other smart home devices - nearly 50 in total. I added the Echo show as a central device in the kitchen/great room where I could monitor selected security cameras and use the numerous other features WHEN I ASK IT TO (see below).

The GOOD News - the Echo Show handles all of the Alexa capabilities and provides basic integration with my smart home environment. The 10"" screen is good quality and adds a number of useful video features like displaying recipes, streaming videos, video calls, video monitoring of security cameras, etc... The sound quality is good - perhaps a tick better than the audio-only Echo balls. Almost certainly you will find something useful in the broad array of capabilities. The feature for the display to ""follow you"" around the room is interesting, but after a while it started feeling creepy so I turned it off - but I can see where that would be useful to some depending on how you are using the device.

The BAD news -
(1) At times I want to use this device to monitor one of my security cameras without interruption - unless I specifically ask the Echo Show 10 to do something else. Although there are a bunch of ""home screen"" settings where you can select whether you want a rotation of content (pictures, recipe ideas, news, ""suggested"" movies, social media drivel, etc.) to appear on the Alexa screen while it is awaiting your next command - in my case I don't want ANY of these things to interrupt my camera feed, so I turned them ALL off. Despite doing so, the device regularly stops the camera feed to display a ""things to try"" or ""things Alexa can do"" screen. REALLY ANNOYING and per my conversation with Amazon yesterday (10/11/23) there is no way to prevent the device from doing that. I find myself having to re-start my camera feed all day long. If you are contemplating using the Echo Show 10 to monitor a baby-cam, security cam, or some other static content display (e.g. bedside clock), just be aware that Amazon have decided that having Alexa tell you what else you should try is always more important than whatever else you have the Echo 10 doing. (At one point, there was a toggle to turn ""things to try"" off, but it didn't really work and that toggle disappeared a few weeks ago)
2) The integration with non-Amazon-branded smart home devices is still pretty weak and while I eventually got everything to a basic level of integration - it was a pain and took far too much troubleshooting. I recognize that integration requires coordinated action by the smart home device vendors and Amazon, but it needs to be much clearer what ""Alexa Enabled"" means. Often the integration is the absolute barest minimum (e.g. voice control to turn something on/off) and nothing more. As an example, my fancy AI security camera can tell me what it is seeing (a person, a car, a herd of buffalo, etc..) - the Echo Show 10 advertises a ""person detection"" announcement feature, but inexplicably when a person IS detected by my AI camera, instead of showing me the camera, it shuts OFF the video feed to display a text message - ""Person detected in driveway cam"" - Huh? And the Echo can't announce the car or anything else that the camera sees. Amazon should be pushing themselves and their ""Alexa Enabled"" partners aggressively towards the new ""Matter"" home automation integration standards to make it far easier to setup and clearer what capabilities you are really getting than at present.

J Schaeffer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024","Overall, I loved this Echo. I have a variety of Echo devices throughout my home, and this was my favorite one, until a little after 2 years old it quit working. I have tried everything recommended in the forums and have asked for the assistance of Amazon (the rep was extremely rude, and absolutely no help.) It will not stay connected to my wifi. I have moved it around (it was already the closest device to the router), shut down most everything in the house, turned it on and off, reset my router, and a host of other things. It will connect, but within 5 minutes, it drops the connection. For the price, it should still be working. I looked at ordering another Echo, but this one has no trade-in value. If this is such a great device, why is it not even listed for trade-in. My guess, they are having a lot of trouble with them and don't want them back. I have had Amazon Kindles and Echos since the Kindle was first released, but I may be done with Amazon's devices.",3.0 out of 5 stars

RBrylawski,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2024","We've had one of the early Echo Shows for a few years now and while it was fine, it was starting to show its age, so it got moved to a bedroom and after looking at all the new models I chose the newest Echo Show 10 (3rd generation). It's quite an upgrade in every way.

The screen is bigger and high definition at 10.1"" and it follows you around as you move around, which for a kitchen application is great. I can be using the Echo Show while I'm cooking and moving from counter to counter and the screen stays with me.

One of the biggest advantages of this new Echo Show is the speaker. It's really a big speaker and the moving screen is mounted to the speaker. But the output of the speaker is quite remarkable and music actually sounds terrific on it. The speakers deliver realistic sound which is directional.

Like most of the Echo Shows, once you've set up one through the Alexa app on your iPhone, setup is a breeze. In fact, when you order this 3rd gen Echo Show, you answer some questions about your network at home and out of the box it basically sets itself up. Though, I must admit the first one we received wouldn't connect and Amazon immediately sent a replacement device, which did work.

You can use this for video calls and it even has a 13PM digital camera which you can use to take a selfie. You can integrate as many photos as you want to the display from your cell phone or Amazon Photos collection if you use Amazon Photos to store your pictures (we do, actually). You can open the app and see what's happening in your kitchen or speak to someone in the kitchen from anywhere. If you have a Ring Doorbell, you can just say Alexa, show me my Ring Doorbell. Or ask Alexa to pull up a recipe quickly if you need one. It's all just so easy to use.

The options to integrate things like your car, security system, smart devices, are pretty much endless and super easy to set up as well.

All in all, I couldn't be happier with my decision to move up to the Echo Show 10!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Andrea D. Wilson,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2023","I recently purchased the Echo Show 10 HD smart display from Amazon, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed. The Echo Show 10 delivers an outstanding audio experience that truly stands out. The sound quality is simply amazing, providing a rich audio experience that elevates your entertainment.

The picture quality on this smart display is top-notch as well. The HD display offers crisp and vibrant visuals, making it a pleasure to watch your favorite movies and shows. Whether you're streaming content or catching up on the news, the Echo Show 10's screen display ensures a fantastic viewing experience.

One of the standout features of the Echo Show 10 is its dynamic motion functionality. The fact that the display moves to follow you as you move around is a game-changer, especially during Alexa calls. This means that the person you're talking to can continue to see you as you go about your daily tasks, whether you're cooking, cleaning, or simply multitasking. It adds a whole new level of convenience and connection to your video calls.

While the dynamic motion feature is impressive, it's not always flawless. There are times when the motion can be a bit off, which can be a minor inconvenience. However, I'm optimistic that with future updates and improvements, this feature will become even better over time.

The Echo Show 10 also offers premium sound quality, allowing you to enjoy your music and content with exceptional clarity and depth. The combination of stunning visuals audio creates an all-encompassing entertainment experience that's truly top tier.

In addition to its audio and visual capabilities, the Echo Show 10 provides a versatile platform for doing more. You can effortlessly watch your favorite movies and shows, stay updated with the latest news, and access a wide range of Alexa skills that enhance your daily life.

Overall, the Echo Show 10 HD smart display is an incredible addition to any smart home setup. It offers outstanding sound and picture quality, and its dynamic motion feature makes it a standout device for video calls. While there's room for improvement in the motion aspect, the overall experience is highly satisfying. This device's premium sound and its ability to do so much more make it a worthwhile asset for anyone looking to enhance their home entertainment. You will not be disappointed.",4.0 out of 5 stars
daveinlaca,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2021","The idea of the Echo Show 10 is such a game changer, I was ready to make it the hub of my music and entertainment center at home. Echo already controls my television remote, my lights, and my spotify. With the Show, I was expecting it to do the same with photos and other features.

Unfortunately, nearly every feature I was excited about underdelivered.

Photo Booth
I was most excited about the idea of telling my show ""Alexa, take a picture"", have it find me and my friends and snap a selfie. What a great addition to parties! And while the camera has improved, the lighting adaptation has not. Most of the photos came out extremely average if the lighting wasn't perfect. The kind of quality I would have expected to post on my MySpace in 2006.

The other great addition was the ability to tell my Show, ""Alexa, take a video"". It did a good job of finding me, but every video has to end with you saying ""Alexa, stop video."" I called customer service, certain that there must be a gesture I could assign, or perhaps a way to set a time and have Alexa take a 10 second video. But no, after exploring all options like ""routines"" and ""IFTT"" every video has to end with you telling Alexa to stop.

There's also no way to get the photos and videos straight to your phone, so you're stuck waiting for it to upload to Amazon Photos, then going into your phone, opening Amazon Photos, finding what you want, then downloading, then editing the end of that video so it doesn't end with your stop command. Clunky and unnecessary when there are so many easy ways they could have programmed all this to work better.

MUSIC
I was excited about the lyrics feature on Amazon Music. They advertised ""Have your own karaoke night!"" But there are almost no karaoke songs on Amazon Music. They are plentiful on Spotify and other music services. A speaker with a screen makes karaoke such an obvious use, that it's shocking there's no way to do it. Either you can bring up the lyrics with the original song and vocals, or you can stream Spotify, but then the lyrics don't come up. Looked for third party solutions, but they were all just a few karaoke songs for small children. Another wasted opportunity.

SOUND
The sound was good. I was expecting it to be more like the Echo Studio with a screen, but the speaker is much smaller. Solid, but nothing that impressive. I ended up buying the Echo Sub to pair to it and that improved the sound greatly. Now my music sounds like a sound system...IF I STREAM FROM A SERVICE.

I write and produce music, so a lot of times I like to play my own music from my phone. To do that you need to pair your phone with your echo, at which point the echo acts just like a bluetooth speaker. That's fine, except now the Echo Sub no longer works, since that connects to your echo through bluetooth as well. So that great bassy sound I get with regular music isn't available for my own music if I play through my phone via iTunes or Soundcloud. Yet another opportunity missed.

YOUTUBE
YouTube...works. You access it through a web browser which is just clunky. The promise of a user friendly youtube playing all your videos and exploring and going down a youtube hole on a Friday night just doesn't work through the browser the way a dedicated app would.

FACES
It may not make sense to complain about a feature that isn't included that was never promised, but with echo having a screen, it seems like a logical step to create skins/faces that mimic what Alexa is saying. i picture a translucent face, like Snow White's mirror, or something cartoony. I'm surprised a third party developer wouldn't have made something like this available, and it would give the Show that much more of a personality.

Overall, I enjoy using the Echo Show 10. There seem to be a lot of kinks and falls short of its potential, but I knew that being an early adopter and purchasing the day it became available. And while most of these things are little frustrations, a big frustration is that only about a month after purchasing, Amazon has dropped the price $40, effectively punishing the early adopters for getting behind their product. That, along with my other issues, dropped my review from the five stars I wanted to give, down to the three I gave it.

Hope this helps others!",3.0 out of 5 stars

I have always liked in general all the Amazon brand products, but the electronics draw my attention, but much more in 2022 when I bought my Eco show, and I was happy with my purchase but even more in September 2023, on this date my kitchen stove exploded and the whole kitchen are got on fire, I always liked having my Echo show in the kitchen, I listen to music watch my shows see recipes a number of things while I cook or do the cleaning, that afternoon the firefighters arrived and they did what they do put the Fire off, now remember my Echo show had already received all the heat and on top of that the jet of water; the next day when we saw everything that had burned I remembered my speaker!!, and I thought oh my Echo burn, I cleaned it put it to the side after two days that I was going to put it in the trash, I realized that it didn't look so bad and I decided to plug it in and to my surprise it worked, almost a year after the fire it is still working, and with all this History the only thing I can say is that Echo show is EXCELLENT!!!!

My disappointment was not with the system but with the representatives when there’s an issue for repair even though a warranty was paid for. Contacted Amazon who only stated that they will send a new system and they will provide a return label. What they don’t tell you is that you must send the system back and a replacement is not on the way. You must wait until they receive your item and they will see if they can repair or replace it with a possibility it will be a refurbished item. There’s more to this issue that will be too long to explain. Just know you can get numerous representatives telling you different things. Totally disappointed in this awful process. Also even though you paid for the warranty there may be a $15 additional charge.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Colleen,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2023","Okay, I'm having fun with Alexa. This morning I said ""Alexa, goodbye"". She replied, ""Let's make like a volcano and blow this place"". I will greet her when I return, and she often has a witty reply. She wakes me up to music which starts playing low then gets louder and louder until I tell her I'm awake. The sound is amazing for such a little speaker. I can hear the ""thumping"" coming from my room when I walk down the hall. Drawbacks, I know there is so much I can do with her that I haven't learned and have had a hard time finding the features. Most I discover by looking at the screen. I just learned I can play Jeopardy and found out about a podcast. I have had her give me reminders at certain times. Such as, ""Colleen, you better start getting ready, you have company coming in an hour."" She created a playlist of my favorite songs, but when I ask her to show me my favorite playlist, she only shows me the first song I added to it. In the end, I've had it about a week and I love it. I just want to know what else I can do. -- UPDATE -- so I have had this a couple of months. I love almost everything about it, except I know there are a lot of things than can be done and finding information on that is difficult. For instance, it let me make an outgoing call, but I don't know how to assign a contact and when I called the person, I didn't know what number to give them to call back. My phone is crap, so this would be a great alternative when I'm home. The screen will show a feature, but when I want to get more information, it has changed to a different screen, and I don't know how to back up to review what it just showed me. I will ask Alexa to go back to last screen and she's confused, I will ask her to tell me about it, and she's confused. For instance, the screen flashed something about a ""Bot"" for cooking and DYI, I wanted to know more about it and couldn't get it back. Or something will flash, but I don't have time to see what it is and I don't know how to bookmark it. Like I said before, I know there are a lot more options out there to utilize, but it doesn't come with any sort of manual. I've gone to YouTube videos, etc.. but haven't find anything to help. Other than that, I love the product and would buy it again.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jay,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2023","Bought this on amazon prime day a few weeks ago. It is currently placed on a kitchen counter between the kitchen and living room in an open concept style house. Purchased mainly for the rotating feature that uses the camera to track the user as they walk around. This and the large screen have been great for working in the kitchen or asking about the weather from the living room. The downside of this feature is that below a certain level of light the device no longer moves the screen to follow you, displaying a message that says ""light level too low, movement disabled."" So at night if we don't have bright kitchen and dining room lights on, it doesn't move; and we largely keep those lights off when not in active use. In our home at night we noticed that just ambient light on from lamps in the room isn't enough for it to follow us. The device really needs something like an infrared sensor so it can work at night time like what Ring security cameras use for night vision. Adding this hardware would make this a must have product for your kitchen and bump this up to 5 stars. Other than that drawback, the included speaker, screen quality, and snappiness of the processor is better than past Eco Shows I've owned (still have the original echo show, 5 inch, and 8 inch models). As far as voice recognition it's the same as other models, although for the team working on Alexa it never understands the word ""closet."" We placed smart lighting in our closet, and she always replied with ""What device?"" and we'd have to yell ""closet"" a second time and it was hit or miss on the second attempt. Out of frustration we renamed the smart lighting to ""bathroom"" and that works 100% in turning on the lights in the closet, but that's been our only real issue with voice recognition.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Mark E Timperley,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2021","My first real Alexa enabled product, if you don't count my Kindle Fire... but more on that later.

First, I bought two Echo Show 10s, one for our kitchen and one for grandma. They were very easy to setup and have worked well so far (4 days in). I'm definitely impressed with the design and the quality of components, from the touch screen, buttons, motion and sound. All physical aspects are very well done. Do you need a screen that moves on its own? Yes! I can't imagine this product without motion. So far, we use the Echo Show 10 to ""drop in"" on grandma virtually, several times a day and every night for dinner. We love this ability! The Echo Show turns to whoever is speaking and zooms in on them, so she feels like she is right there with us and her grandchildren (not 25 feet away, outside a fish bowl). The best part of this technology is that Grandma didn't have to learn how to answer the ""video phone"", since it just connects when we want. In general, it works all by itself in her apartment (mostly) and we can control much of it remotely if needed. I do set and adjust reminders and alarms for her when needed, but beyond that we just ""drop in"" and say hello, whenever.

So that's the awesome part. We are discovering a few annoyances as we go, so I'll share one that is probably unique to this product: The process of adjusting and setting the range of motion is not well thought out. If you only ever did this once and then set the thing in cement, then maybe. But we set it on a counter and have already found that it must be moved for cleaning, to temporarily get it out of the way, or for use in another position. It takes about 4 minutes to reset... which is about 3.5 minutes too long for me. The other annoyances are all about ""Alexa"" so I'll mention them last.

Also, I've described a somewhat ideal grandma use case, so keep in mind that we only live 10 minutes from grandma and have had to drop by and ""fix Alexa"" (turned off, moved, lost wifi, screen rotated by hand) while she and visitors are getting used to it, so it's definitely not a set and forget type of technology, but I'm not going to reduce my rating because of that.

My rating would have been 5 stars, if it wasn't for Alexa herself and the somewhat puzzling UI design, menus, etc. Did I mention my Kindle Fire? Here's my point. You need one to control this thing and use many of the ""Alexa features"" with any level of certainty. You could also use a smartphone with the Alexa app, and we actually use both, but I find the Fire is a bit easier to use. This probably isn't news to someone who already has an Echo, but in case you are new to Alexa, using voice commands to find and select a book or other media for it to show or read by voice, to set a reminder, or just about anything beyond a few words, can be a terribly frustrating experience. It is amazing what it can do, but hopefully, engineers are still hard at work improving voice recognition and comprehension. Until then, my recommendation is to pair them. Echo Show 10 + Kindle Fire (with Alexa off on your Kindle) makes a great product together!

So Alexa, how do you spell frustrating? Her dutiful answer is ""F R U S T R A T I N G"" but also awesome, all at the same time. She doesn't get the joke yet... but given what she is capable of, why would she think I'm joking?",4.0 out of 5 stars

Roxie Muzic,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2021","Prior to this the household has the Gen 1 & 10"" Gen 2 Echo Shows, frankly I prefer the Gen 2 10"" Echo Show for most rooms over this model, but then...with firmware improvement/updates that opinion may change.

Other than the slight reduction in sound (I could care, I have multiple Sonos speakers) and screen resolution (as others have pointed out), the overriding feature of this iteration of Echo Show is the camera and 360 degree motion.

The camera is outstanding in resolution, very outstanding, worth the reduction in sound and screen resolution.

Motion however, needs work, the hardware used in this device to detect stability and motion needs serious firmware tweaking, way to sensitive, everything is ""unstable"", even the most stable. Understanding the need to be cautious, in that this slues around, to follow or view it's human or humans, however, ratchet the sensitivity down some to avoid the error messages that are unfounded when the device is on a stable, unimpeded full motion area. Currently if it even rocks a millimeter when turning, it throws the ""unstable"" error. I ordered two of these 10"" Gen 3 Echo Shows, both are behaving in this fashion. A little tweaking to the firmware of the device should solve this little sensitivity issue I would hope. This is not a game changer for me, this will be refined as customer feedback is received, or at least I have found that their development team is very responsive to these consumer observations. Kudos to them for that.

Next, that obnoxious, unnecessary screen of ""Alexa For Your Day"", for the love of every customer that you have, get rid of this, please, it is not a selling feature. Or, at least give us the option to have it show or not show in the Home Screen toggle switch section of the settings. It really is a ""bummer dude""...... if it keeps it up, it could be a game changer for me.

I can live with the HUGE time notification on the screen, I am old, but not blind, can we scale it down or have an option to scale it down, please, thank you. Not a game changer, but it is quite large you must admit...

All in all for the kitchen or the main floor/office in houses this is a great device, allows camera viewing 360 degrees, great idea for those who do not have indoor cameras already and as an adjunct for those of us who do. Have not used it for recipes in the kitchen yet, but I suspect that this will be a vast improvement over the Gen 2 10"" Echo Show, in that it will follow me in my meandering attempt to cook (hopefully it will not catch me crying on the kitchen floor over cooking fiascos). Phone calls to other Echo Show owners should be improved as I meander when talking to folks as well... I believe as the feedback rolls in, there will be improvements to screen data that pops up uninvited (please, pretty please), and the motion sensitivity concerns.

I am pleased with this purchase, but most likely will replace the rest of my Gen 1 Echos with Gen 2 10"" Echo Shows, this model has limited placement criteria and may not be the best Echo for every spot in the house. I will purchase one additional 10"" Gen 3 Echo Show for my office, but for bedrooms the Gen 2 10"" Echo Show should be sufficient.

Unfortunately, that email included no information addressing any of the issues below. As far as I can tell the CS agent read neither my review, nor Amazon's public statements warning users not to disclose account information to callers from unknown numbers. -----

***What I wanted:***

A ""third screen"" organizer that could show me a dashboard of calendar entries, weather, to do, etc. Maybe something like THE PICTURES THEY USE TO ADVERTISE IT (See Pic #2 - ""Taylor's Birthday"" displayed next to weather, a podcast, and the time). Also, a screen to play YouTube or Twitch videos as I putter on something else.

***What I got:***

- Home screen is ONLY a rotating set of cards. You have no other options. There is no dashboard style option, no quick launch (you can use ""Tap to Alexa"" as a really mediocre one, kinda). The assumption is that in a world of touchscreens you must only want to shout at your devices.
- The Home screen is not even in your control. You can add pictures, and turn off some things, but Amazon will also randomly add whatever nonsense they think you want. You cannot adjust the rotation speed. Heck, you can't even make the clock overlay bigger.
- You cannot add utility to this home screen. You can't add widgets (they only live on a slide-out panel, and that closes after 10s). You can't adjust how the time and weather are displayed, or set the calendar slide to show things in a useful view. You can't add a big easy ""Open my YouTube Playlist"" button. You get pictures, ads, and gimmicks - end of list.
- That dashboard view (""Taylor's Birthday"") from Amazon's promotional materials - THIS DEVICE DOESN'T DO THAT
- You can technically watch YouTube, eventually. That is until it crashes. Because you need to use Silk, since they didn't include an app for the #2 site on the internet. (Actually, this runs on Android so they REMOVED that stock functionality)
- You can Technically view Twitch, in that the website loads for a few minutes. But you cannot login or use chat because Twitch.tv does not support the Silk browser. Yes, they are both owned by Amazon.
- The screen follows you around the room, or your dog, or any noise, or no noise. It also tries to follow you while you're using the touch screen so you end up chasing it back and forth.
- Interacting with this thing is so SLOOOOOW - How is a new device this underpowered?
- Sure, it does Video calls... which I don't care about because I already have a phone and I spend all day on MS Teams.
- Technically it has Follow-along recipes... No, not the recipes I have on my phone, or the one I found online. There's no way to share a link to this thing, and If I find a video on YouTube, I can't really even watch it.

This isn't even the nitpicky stuff, like when my headphones power off at 2 AM Alexa insists that we all wake up and hear about it, and there's no way to disable it.

Once you get past the gimmick turntable base, this thing is slow, unresponsive, buggy, and very limited in functionality. It is the epitome of ""Technically does what we promised, but not the way you probably want it to, or very well at all"".

Most of the ""Skills"" (Apps) are slower than just taking your phone out of your pocket. ""Is it going to rain?""
Option A: Look at your phone: picture of rain clouds on the weather widget - 2 seconds.
Option B: Ask Alexa - ""Right now in your area it's 64 degrees and partly cloudy with light wind..."" only after slowly describing what can be seen out of any window will she tell you if it's going to rain. And that's *only* if she heard you correctly! There's a good chance you'll get ""Shuffling songs by the Weatherman and similar artists, on Amazon Music"" instead.

Despite being built on an android OS, so much basic functionality has been stripped out of this thing it's infuriating. I can get apps on my WATCH that are easier to use and faster than the barely functional ""Skills"" I can occasionally find from 3rd parties since there is almost no support for this thing. Everything I figure should work out of the box requires sideloading something to connect to IFTTT so I can get another device to do the actual work. Heck, even YouTube - most sites tell you that ""You can make YouTube music work, just Bluetooth connect your phone to the echo!"" because the Echo refuses to run anything that isn't some gimmicky ""Read me my email slowly"" or ""display rotating pictures"" nonsense.

I cannot stress this enough: The best digital experience I can achieve with the Echo Show is by leaning my aging Samsung Tablet against it and launching the stock YouTube app.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Priscilla,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2023","Love the size and the look; However, compared to its sister products I own it is very hard to navigate. 1) I find myself constantly repeating the commands over and over as ""Alexa"" doesn't know that or a lot of ""Hmmmms"" very frustrating; 2) I primarily purchased this to watch TV in the kitchen - well that doesn't seem to be working well either; for starters I cannot download the apps I have on my firestick so that's annoying (please help if avail in this area); if you do actually get to watch content and want to ""pause"" forget asking her via voice she has no clue how to do this, so, I pause manually (usually with my hands full of dirty gloves which also is a pain) so, now we have it paused for a little bit - the screen goes to screensaver mode and the content goes Into the black hole and I cannot retrieve it again or if I'm lucky to retrieve it it is no longer paused and I have to watch from the beginning!!! Super annoying! This is one of the most costly items in the Amazon line and for that reason alone I wish it would work as it's beloved firestick; firetv or even the echo!!! As I have zero issues with these products. I find myself extremely frustrated every time I try to operate this product and it doesn't seem to be getting better after I have watched and tried dozens of ""how to's"" ; it just seems limited, sensitive and honorary to me and my needs - unless I am not using it as it's intended purpose.

nadanix,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","I will give my 5 cents to this device. The unboxing experience is uneventful, however a warning here: You do need a smartphone or tablet to be setup with Alexa or this will not work. That is nowhere mentioned in the advertisement. The Alexa software is by far one of the worst I have seen in years. There is no real menu, you have to scroll through pages and pages of stuff, cluttered with things that are not helpful and confusing. Pictures and advertisement do not belong in a menu. The structure again, horrific.
Neither on the Alexa app or on the device itself is a home screen where you see all your apps.
It’s a cluster of menus, very hard to navigate.
Now, to our device. The first thing I turned off was motion. The screen does a lousy job following you and always seems to be angled off. Even when you turn motion off, every time you hit the screen to use a menu, the screen will bounce around and you need two hands. One to hold the screen and one to use the menu. The touchscreen is very unresponsive and often needs multiple touches to respond. There is a lot of glare coming from the display as well
The sound is good (not great) for a small device and you can pair Apple Music if you don’t want use Amazon Music. Warning: This device is not Airplay compatible, so it will not work in a multi-room setting in the Apple ecosystem. You can stream directly or from your phone via Bluetooth, to a single device. If you have a TuneIn Radio account you can stream from that, but I have not figured out yet how you play your favorites. The Echo will respond to stuff like “play NPR Radio on TuneIn” This device has no way to create or view playlists or use existing playlists in Apple Music.
The amount of consent you have to give to let the Echo read your calendar in your email account is worrisome. I decided against it because exposing your email account to Amazon simply is not my cup of tea. The build in web browser needs work. It is super-slow and will just stop working for no reason. I have the Echo now 2days and had multiple occurrences of freezing screens and the entire Echo going dark. This also happened to me in Food Network.
I turned on the news and when I came back to the kitchen 10 minutes later, the screen is dark. It simply stops, without command. The “try Alexa” feature is a nagging unstoppable insult and can get you mad enough to go the psych ward. No matter what, you cannot turn it off fully.
So after careful consideration and two days of use I decided to keep it a couple more days and wait for a software update. Amazon do you hear me? Add an option to turn off “try Alexa”. Give this thing a real menu. If not, you will get it back before the end of next week.
Edit: Now, on day three, it starts to just turn off. There is no setting to prevent that. Alexa is tired and goes to sleep. I am tired too and today Echo goes home to Amazon.",1.0 out of 5 stars

J,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023","We're approaching the two year mark with the Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) in our kitchen and as such it has been used heavily. We've tinkered around with just about every bell and whistle that is available on it. Ultimately, we've decided that it is just a poor design across the board and consequently a frustrating user experience.

Honestly, most of these ""bells and whistles"" really aren't something anyone would make use of other than to ""try them out"" once as we've done. The news and sports widgets may interest you, but I feel like we are drowning in those two types of widgets on every screen we encounter these days; phone, watch, PC, work laptop, home laptop, tablet, TV. I feel like I have enough news, weather, and sports widgets to last me a lifetime at this point.

We ended up disabling everything except the rotating photos, so it's nothing more than a glorified digital photo frame for us. It's decent for that, but frankly the majority of digital photo frames out there will do a better job. Just stick an Echo Dot next nearby for Alexa...

As far as the lackluster photo experience, for example, you can't make it default to photo frame mode, or even force it to stay in that mode for an extend period of time. It always ends up back at the home screen after awhile. So, if you set it up to do so, you end up with rotating Amazon Photos photos on the ""home screen"" which you get forced to. The home screen photos are decent but, just like everything else in the Echo Show, still feels buggy and clunky. When you set a 10 second or 30 second photo rotation (or whatever) it definitely doesn't follow that setting. Sometimes it will hang on a photo for several minutes, other times it will rotate in 10 seconds. It feels like that setting is for Photo Frame mode, which (as mentioned) is essentially a useless feature, since it does not stay persistent.

Another drawback while being forced into the home screen for making it a digital photo frame is the clock/date are in the bottom left hand corner, and they are absolutely massive. They cannot be adjusted or disabled, as most everything else on the device... very little customization options. We have like 700 clocks in our kitchen, and would totally be fine with disabling the Echo Show clock... Often it will rotate to a photo and then the focal point of the photo ends up blocked by the huge clock. This happens a lot to us because we end up taking family selfies, and (having the longest arms currently) I normally take them, so I end up in the upper right of the photo, with the wife more towards the left, and then the kids in the bottom left... so, the huge clock cuts the kids out of the picture and most of the time half of my wife gets cut. That clock really does wreck a ton of photos, family selfies or not. Long story short the photo experience is decent, but there are way better options/devices out there, especially since the other options will integrate with other services such as Apple or Google photos, but with the Echo Show you are forced into Amazon Photos which is severely lackluster compared to the ""other two""...

Aside from the photos I have no idea why anyone would like this device, let alone rate it 5 stars. The speaker looks like it should be awesome, but it's also lackluster. The hardware just kinda sucks... it is quite sluggish in terms of performance.

We do have Spotify integration set up and do also use that a bit just because my kids play music on alexa in general a lot... but, if you have read this far, then it's not going to be a shocker when you hear we feel the Echo Spotify app is a clunky, sluggish, and just overall lackluster experience when compared to the Apple, Android, PC, Mac, and Web Spotify apps.

It seems like it could be great for video calls. We did try that some when I was traveling for work and it's just too sluggish and clunky, we always ended up flipping over to our phones. Also forget the ""follow me"" screen rotation mode thing, it sounds cool, but works like garbage. Same with streaming videos in general, just doesn't work well, I'd rather just use a small phone.

All of that said, having a digital alexa photo frame is decent enough... These things aren't too pricey, especially when you catch them during Amazon's big sales...

But.... the two straws which broke the camel's back, and makes me want to go office space this thing, are:

a) Our family loves shopping on Amazon, we spend a disgusting amount on Amazon every year, so take this point for what it is... but in pure slime ball fashion Amazon forces advertisements on the screen which pop up periodically trying to get you to buy random stuff. Sometimes, this stuff may not even be something you'd like advertised to your kids or guests. There is absolutely no way to disable these ads. So they charge you 100 to 300 bucks for something like this, and force their ads on to you. That in and of itself should be a hard stop for anyone considering one of these.

b) I'm not sure how this next point is working behind the scenes over there at Amazon, but it appears that any new or updated feature forces itself to be turned on (even after previously disabling it). This is a regular occurance. Like I said we've literally disabled everything, but things just pop up out of nowhere, or are periodically turned back on, such as news, sports, joke of the day, etc etc. And nope, it's not my kids messing with it, they can't even reach it.

TTLD;, the Echo Show 10 kinda sucks, part due to hardware issues, but bigger part due to software issues, which leads me to believe whatever version comes next will also suck. That said, 45,458 reviews as of this post, and 4.5 stars... so the masses appear to love this big weird clunky rotating wonky crappy weak sauce robot tablet... :D",1.0 out of 5 stars
J. Fernandez,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","First the camera is offset, so the screen is always offset when it follow you, that is when it does actually follow you, because more than half of the time it does not, and God forbid you try to touch the monitor, because it will constantly tell you the screen has bumped into something... It has way too many bugs in the software ... I am not at all impressed with this update, because it doesn't seem like a lot of thought went into this model!

BUT ... My biggest gripe has to do with the electrical cord, it is way too short, and plugs into the bottom of the base, which is also insanely difficult to reach without the monitor swinging all around, and good forbid you have to unplug it for any reason, because it will constantly make you put in your password over and over!

I am sorry, but this update is a big fail! It is definitely not ready for consumers! They really should have worked out the bugs before releasing it to the public! This unit truly seems like it should be in beta testing still, because it has way too many issues that need to be addressed!

Update: The advertisement makes it look as if you can use the device to scan one’s surroundings, when not at home, but what only the small print reveals, which most people will miss, that it only does this FOR A PRICE AND with a SUBSCRIPTION to HOME GUARD plus!

At $250, this should have been included, at least for a year, free of charge! I bought this believing I could scan a room, from my mobile device, only to find out ... you can’t, NOT EVEN WHEN YOU ARE AT HOME! Really Amazon, you couldn’t include that at least for a year free! As a prime member, for many years, I find this totally unacceptable, from a billion dollar company, that is charging way too much for this device! Do yourself a favor and wait until Amazon addresses the many issues and bugs this device does have at the present time!

Xtra, And apparently there is no way to pair the Amazon Remote in the software! I have search high and low for a way to pair my remote, but the option is no longer in the settings on the device or app!

After several months of owning this device I can say with all honesty it is the WORST device and echo show I have EVER owned!, along with the new Echo, Amazon has me truly believing it is time to cancel all my Amazon accounts, because the majority of their devices don’t work like they claim! If I have to yell one more command to turn play a show on Hulu and Netflix only to told you cannot play HULU or NETFLIX on this device, I will start looking for devices that actually do ….

JButters,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2022","I've owned a few of these through the generations of them, starting with the first Echo Show. The concept was great, I could do cool quirky things no one would think to do and in general I've been an amazon fan boy so Ive owned a bit of the tech.
I've owned the Echo Show 10 for about a year now so I'll start with the pros.
It has a nice screen, you can watch TV from it which is cool so it acts like a mini TV for me and my primary use for the screen has always been a nice digital photo display (amazon photos) with the forecast and weather alerts. The first few generations of the show line of products did those very well. Sound was great and when they made it to where you could sync your devices for a music party it was awesome.
This device has good sound to it and the video is nice for two way viewing.
The motion on it is a little wonky in my opinion and I've kept it off most of the time. It usually goes to far for the motion in either direction and is a pain sometimes to get it to center back. Easy fix because I personally dont need it to follow me so I turned the motion off and just stuck it in a particular direction. Its voice detection is ok at best. Sometimes it does well, others not so much.

Now for the cons (which is why I am writing this review).
Just about every month amazon adds a new feature to these devices and by default turns it on. I walk by one day and its giving me some display about how my day can go. Cant turn that feature off, but most others I have to go in and find out to turn it off. Walk by another month, its giving me suggesting recipes. Walk by a month later, its telling me things I should by. Walk by another month, its telling me people in my area have covid. What is absolutely annoying is I have to go in and turn each of these off every month and when they include it they turn it on by default.
I want something simple - to display my photos, display the forecast and my calendar and for voice control of smart devices. That is it. With all of these features I find less photos are more junk.
What is about to set me over the edge for these devices completely are the ads. Now these devices show me ads for movies - of which from what I have read (and I cant find it myself) you cannot turn off. Some might say - its just a few ads get over it. But I see them every few minutes - and here's the problem: I pay for the service (amazon prime and all that jazz) and I paid 250 for the device. Why would I be seeing ads??? Pay for the service and the device and they still give ads. That and to me its in my house - thats already an area that is supposed to be sacred where we allow what comes in and out of our house. We give up a lot letting these things in as it is. I didnt pay 250 and for prime for a device to show me ads.

Amazon needs to change their model quick or a number of people are going to dump these. Im already thinking of going back to the echo dots. Having a screen at this point isnt worth it if I cant control whats on it.

UPDATE Dec 2022
Amazon reached out based on 1 star feedback with general PR emails (nothing really accomplished beyond pretending to care). Not only do the ads still continue, but they have doubled down with adding sponsored content. This content allows you to hide a particular sponsored piece or submit feedback (like clicking the hide this ad on youtube or facebook). Two minutes later you see a different sponsored content.
If youve ever seen Futurama where everyone got a chip with ads getting sent to them - Amazon is bridging that gap. They truly have capitalized on ad content to bring it inside your home. I also get to see it on my FireTV which I ignore and doesnt bug me as much, but seriously its getting bad.
Im downsizing my Amazon device list on anything that has a screen at this point. I have a few Echo Shows and I am getting rid of some. I will no longer buy an Amazon device with a screen until they stop bringing ad content into the home - which by not having them I will probably never know when that will be. Ive already removed devices I was planning to purchase off of my list.

I can see why the Amazon device department is failing and I doubt it will improve anytime soon.",1.0 out of 5 stars
JAM,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2024","I was very excited to get this unboxed and set up. After running though the startup process and a 10 minute update, everything was ready to go. That’s when the screen just started flipping though ads for Amazon products. I went into settings and turned off nearly every feature (other than the weather report) and basically made it into an overpriced digital frame and I’m still getting ads! I went online and it’s a common complaint. There’s no way to get rid of all the ads. Amazon should be paying us to be putting an Amazon billboard in our homes instead of charging us.

Update: After hours, and I mean HOURS of my life spent on the phone with Amazon customer service reps trying to get rid of the ads - none of whom seemed to have received the same training, because I got a different story every time - I was shipped a replacement Show on the grounds that the ads must be the result of a hardware failure. I know what you’re thinking and no, that didn’t make sense to me either.

The replacement was malfunctioning right out of the box, but with determined stubbornness, I was able to get it up and running. Turns out, the ads were still showing up so I called customer service again. At this point I politely asked if it were possible to speak with anyone who actually knows how these devices work, so as to save everyone’s time. I was told that all the agents are trained on how the devices work. When I presented my case to the contrary, I was again told that all agents know how the devices work and that in any event, there is no way to get rid of the ads.

At this point, I took a deep breath and politely explained how nice it would have been if that had been communicated on the product page or, at the very least, by ANY of the many reps I had spoken with prior. She apologized and said she’d pass along my feedback. Most assuredly, Mr. Bezos had a hard time getting to sleep that night after reading the notes from my call.

The final chapter in this trial of errors is that I ended up having to pay for the return of one of the two Shows. Good joke, jerks.",1.0 out of 5 stars
BeccaM,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2021","Editing May 2024: The device just keeps getting worse and worse. I just wanted a simple static display showing a single photo, the clock and weather. Instead, every 10 seconds or so, the screen keeps refreshing, meaning there's no way I can keep this thing on my desk anymore because it's a constantly shifting and infuriating distraction. I have everything turned off in the homescreen settings, but it makes no difference. In essence, Amazon took a product that mostly worked and now it's nothing but an eye-distracting advertising spam generator. A shame, because warts aside, if it didn't do these things (ads, constantly refreshing), I'd consider it a useful device, warts and all.

Editing June 2023, and dropping from 3 star recommendation to 1 star: About 8mo ago, Amazon decided to turn Echo Show devices into a non-stop advertising platform. Even when you tell it to hide a particular ad, a month later it will be back. Or if you have multiple Show units, it'll appear on one of them. Even when you say an ad is personally offensive, it won't hide it from view. I didn't sign up for this. We have five Show devices in our house and at any given time, one of them will be pushing an ad for Jeopardy or a 3rd party skill or some Prime movie we don't want to see. There is no way to disable the ads, and believe me, we have tried. I can no longer recommend this product.

Stick with an Alexa-enabled smart-speaker if you want Alexa services if you don't want to be bothered with annoying ads.

Editing in mid-December 2021 for further details, six months later: I really wanted to like the Echo Show 10 smart display with motion, but I finally gave up and went back to the earlier gen Echo Show 10 (Gen 2) I owned for one important reason: The newer Echo Show simply could not hear me properly. Over and over and over, I would ask it to turn on the lights in my office using a routine, and it would insist on trying to present me with various Skills it had identified or just play some random piece of music. The older Echo Show? Never got my commands wrong. Never mis-heard me. At first, I thought it was because I like having a floor fan running during hotter months, but here we are in the winter, no fan, and I still could not just the newer Echo to hear me right. ""Echo, turn on evening lights."" ""Hmm... here are some skills I've identified..."" ""No! Turn on evening lights!"" ""Hmm... here are some skills I've identified..."" ""TURN ON EVENING LIGHTS!"" ""Here's 'Friday Night Lights,' on Amazon Prime video.""

Anyway, I hope they fix this, because other than as a display, this newer model is useless.

Previous review: Like many, many reviewers here, my top #1 complaint about the new Echo Show 10 w/Motion is the fact we cannot disable ""Alexa For Your Day"" and even setting a background image not to rotate doesn't stop the home screen from shifting and changing constantly.

I keep my Echo device on my home office work desk, and what in Gen 2 was a nice, always there display has become an irritating corner-of-my-eye distraction.

Yes, the screen is very nice. Yes, the sound is quite good (although Gen 2 sound was also pretty decent). I like the motion feature—it's really quite neat. I like that they've put a physical camera shutter control on this new model. I like that the onscreen clock seems most of the time now to default to a larger clock in the lower left corner of the display.

But I absolutely loathe the Alexa For Your Day feature. It does not tell me anything I don't already know about Echo devices or Alexa's capabilities. If I'd known there not only was no way to turn it off, but that months later, nothing will have been done about it, I probably would've stuck with my Gen 2 Echo Show 10...and frankly, might go ahead and swap it back, at least on my desk. (Unless a software update is going to ruin that, too?) Maybe put this new one somewhere where it isn't a constant irritating distraction, unless or until Amazon decided to listen to us and let us disable the feature or limit it severely to how often it's allowed to show.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Raoul Duke online shopper,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2021","Update: second one that has stopped working. This last one only worked 7 months then stopped connecting to internet. I have two echo shows now that won't connect to wifi so they can't complete any tasks. None of my other amazon or smart devices have any issues with my wifi

I have been waiting for the release of this device for since Amazon started advertising it over the summer. I had an echo show 8 in my living room. I was drawn to the fact that I could use it remotely to view the rooms in my house. So I ordered it adding it to my 5 other devices. I moved the echo show 8 to basement and put this new echo show in living room. I placed it in a location where it would swivel and be able to veiw the living room, dining room and kitchen.

Remote viewing: When remote viewing it defaults to a smaller image in the portrait mode of the app. You have to click an icon in corner to get it do landscape and show a larger image. You then swipe to move the screen/cam around to view areas. The problem is you have to swipe, not continuous drag. So it only moves about 30 degrees at a time and goes all blurry when it moves. You cannot just pan in a continuous motion with a clear vision of the surrounding areas. Also your options for angling the screen are straight forward slightly upward or upwards. No way to point it a little lower. The worst part is while remote viewing there is a message displayed on the screen that states something similar to "" a member of your family is remote viewing"" with a stop button to turn it off. So if a burglar is in your house while you are away and you are trying to use remote viewing to see what is happening (major selling feature of device) the burglar can just push the stop button on the screen and turn off your remote viewing. Also I have 1000 mbps internet (not a lot of bandwith being used) and it takes a good 20 seconds for the image to load when remote viewing with this echo show.

Motion: I have it set up to follow me all the time through all activities. With the location I am walking around it in multiple directions from multiple distances. It only picks you up and follows you on random occasions. During set up you determine the range of motion and idle position for camera. The problem is once it stops following you or you stop remote viewing it does not return to the idle position, it just stays where it last was. I have not found a button or command to get it to return to the home or idle position. This if probably one of the most annoying issues, it just stopping facing random directions.

Sound: the sound is pretty decent, the same as it would be with an echo. Better than the previous models of echo show with the smaller speakers. I am satisfied with the sound.

Screen: the screen has a nice image. But it constantly transitions between background scenes (you get to choose limited options), advertisements, weather, etc. But when it transitions, it goes dark for about 1-2 seconds. Definitely seems like a slower transition than my other echo shows leaving more blank screen time.

Cord: yes it comes with a white cord which is lame, probably to save cost on production. honestly I am not that annoyed with that compared to other issues.

Overall I have been anxiously anticipating purchasing this for months since they started advertising it over the summer. It is my sixth echo device, so I am an amazon loyal customer and fan of devices. My main purpose of purchasing this (since I already had to show 8 devices) was to be able to remote view and keep an eye on my house when gone. With the glitchy issues stated above I am more that disappointed and considering returning it.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Darshana,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","As an IT professional with over 14 years of experience, I am well-versed in using various devices and maximizing their utility. Additionally, I am a smart home owner with multiple smart devices connected primarily through Alexa. Allow me to share my background before diving into my product review.

My experience with this particular device has been incredibly frustrating. As a fan of Alexa devices, I own several of them and have even recommended them to others. However, this specific device, the Alexa Echo 10, has left me disappointed. Since 2021, it has failed to deliver much beyond its large screen.

The device does serve some purposes, such as displaying photo slideshows, weather alerts, time, and calendars. Its impressive speaker quality produces pleasant sounds. However, the lack of support from the internet community and Alexa’s official channels is concerning. Perhaps the limited user base or its cost contributes to this lack of attention.

Recently, the device stopped working with Bluetooth. After updating to its latest Fire OS version (7.5.6.2), none of my devices could connect. I attempted pairing with various models of Apple iPhones, MacBook Pros, Windows 13th generation laptops, and older devices, but none were discoverable. Interestingly, the Echo 10 could detect Samsung TVs, yet connecting to them remained impossible. Neither voice commands nor manual settings via Bluetooth or the mobile app resolved the issue.

Another limitation is its inability to connect to 2.5GHz Wi-Fi networks. It only communicates with 5GHz networks. While I’m uncertain if this is specific to my router, my other Alexa devices have no trouble connecting to 2.5GHz networks.

I reached out to Alexa product support, but unfortunately, they were clueless about this error. When I inquired about rolling back to a previous Fire OS version, they informed me that it was not possible. In contrast, my Echo Show 5, running Fire OS 6.xx, has no connectivity issues and works seamlessly with both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

In summary, the Echo 10’s problems likely stem from device drivers. Fire OS 7.5.6.2 appears to lack proper firmware updates to fully support its hardware. Despite its larger screen, the Echo 10 offers little beyond what the Echo Show 5 provides. If you’re considering purchasing this device, be aware of its limitations. It’s essential to weigh its features against its drawbacks before making a decision.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Rachel N.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2024","I know I had previously written a review for this, but it appears to be gone. Curiously, after writing the review complaining about how many ads were on it, all ads on my device disappeared for several months. Unfortunately, they're now back with a vengeance.

This device is otherwise neat. It has a good quality speaker that's large, and I like that it has the screen for watching news stories and recipes. I might use it to watch streaming videos from my kitchen too, except I already have a small TV in my kitchen for that purpose.

One other reason I bought this was so that I could check in on my dog while away, with the Echo's camera. Unfortunately, that doesn't work if your phone isn't connected to wifi. The phone looks like it is talking to the echo, and the echo will say someone is watching, but no video plays on the phone, it's just black. I have good unlimited 5G cell service, and there's no setting on the echo or in my Alexa app to tell it I am fine streaming video without wifi. If I tether my phone to my husband's phone, so my phone thinks it's on Wi-Fi, only then can I see video from my Echo. Clearly, if the idea is to check in on your home while you're out, not being able to do it over cellar data makes it nearly pointless.

But it's the barrage of ads all day long in my living room that makes me dislike this thing. Every few minutes, it's an ad, and there's no way to opt out of them, not even for a fee. I will never buy another Echo Show again, because of the intrusive ads.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Mountain Man,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2022","Play Video
Update video below as now it’s multiple sponsored adds in a row with only a picture or two from my photos once in awhile.

These devices had great potential but Amazon is missing the opportunity by forcing ads onto the users. I recently got two sponsored ads back to back in the rotation of the options that I have enabled. I’ve basically removed/unticked most of the options this device can provide in hopes to lower the number of forced “cards” or sponsored ads. Obviously this didn’t work but it decreases the usability of the device. After spending 30 minutes talking to the tech support they informed me they will continue with the sponsored adds and “cards” (Alexa for your day) for the foreseeable future. Since this is being forced upon the customer after they have paid for the device AND there is no mention or disclosure of this in the sales page I can see a class action or the Consumer Protection Agency getting involved at some point. As far as the forced sponsored add I see major problems with them as one of mine was about a movie called “Puss in Boots”. Who puts a cat into boots. That’s terribly embarrassing and even offensive. Not really but I’m sure you can see my point. What Amazon deems passable to display on an individual’s screen without their consent is setting themselves up for problems down the road.

The device performs poorly in dimly lit rooms in that it won’t rotate. It has a hard time connecting to and it will not stay connected to the Blink or Eufy security cameras even with a strong WiFi signal. The two Blink cameras I have are stored in a junk drawer as a result. Thanks Amazon for selling us junk. The screen on all these devices flicker with a burst of light to get my attention making me think there’s something wrong with it but as soon as I look at it there’s a sponsored ad. It’s time to unplug these devices and put them up for sale.

The tech department has gone downhill and fast and I even read reports that they are reducing the number of staff that they do have. That’s unfortunate for us as a consumer but hey as long as Amazon makes it’s $ right?
A couple of days ago I asked Alexa to send one of two Roombas on a cleaning mission. “Alexa, tell the upstairs Roomba to vacuum everywhere”. It sends the downstairs Roomba on a mission two times in a row. I change their names to Roomba one and Roomba two hoping this would solve the problem but it didn’t work. Back to the app to initiate the cleaning cycles.
When Alexa hears me it responds in a different room even when I’m sitting right next to the device I prefer the response from.
If I were the paranoid type I’d think somebody in the tech department was just doing these things to have something to do or to poke fun.
It’s time to start digging deeper into finding a better voice assistant. I just wish amazon would revamp this system as I’ve invested a ton of money and time into my smart home over the years.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Quin,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023","I had hopes of adding this Hiseeu camera with an Echo Show for security purposes but both devices are totally disappointing. Unfortunately, these devices require a 2.4Ghz WiFi configuration. I could normally accept that condition, but I discovered that these devices also have a limited password vocabulary and cannot use any special characters in the password for their WiFi connection! So here I am trying to increase our security, but these devices crush that idea by supporting only simple password strings. I had to change my 2.4Ghz router password to meet their limitations. After setting up the camera and mounting above our front door, we discovered that the video to the Echo is consistently 5 seconds or more delayed. That won’t be very effective when an intruder is standing at your front door. They could smash the door open before they would even show up on the Echo Show display. In addition, the video shown on the Echo Show says “buffering” every 2 or 3 seconds! We have high speed internet here with typical down load speeds over 300Mbs connected to a high speed router. Most 2.4Ghz WiFi signals can support up to 600Mbs. The camera interface says it is only using about 18Kbs, so I have to assume the video delay is due to the terrible EseeCloud turn-around for the video. It is ridiculous to require a camera configuration go through some company’s servers, but then EseeCloud would like you to pay for their cloud supported playback and storage which I have absolutely no interest in getting another monthly charge for simple security camera setup.
I have installed a MicroSD card in the camera for storage but cannot find out how to delete the videos it stores there. If you go to the camera manufacturer’s website and search for my camera, you get this: “Home / Search: 0 results found for 5523-3W-Q"".
I also attempted to contact support via the app itself, but once again I get these ridiculous results: The support link gives you: “There is currently no customer service online, please submit a message. When you click on leave a message you get this:
“The network is not strong, please click to try again.” Clicking “try again” does nothing and I am literally 7 feet away from my router! Until these manufacturers can provide some devices designed with common sense, I would strongly advise against a purchase with them. After months of setting up both devices over and over I am giving up. The camera says it is on line. I can see the camera on the EseeCloud app. The Echo Show is on the same 2.4GHz wifi as the camera and can get to internet pages but if I ask it to show the Front Door Camera it says, ""hmmm, the camera is not responding"". They are making millions off of equipment that DOES NOT DO what they say.",1.0 out of 5 stars
C. May,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2024","Unlike Facebook the Echo 10 is not a free product. Nor are any of its variants. I had to pay hundreds of dollars for each of them to be scattered throughout my home. Yet, despite setting my Echos 10 and 8 to refuse advertising, to refuse reminders to buy more of previous purchases on Amazon, to refuse to grant Alexa permission to announce to the world what is in my Amazon shopping cart, and all news about blankety blank Sportsball, the Echos persist. So I double then triple, then quadruple check my settings. All set to off. Obviously Amazon doesn’t give a flying squirrel what I want from this object I paid for.

“Don’t want advertising…? Surely you want to hear the “theme” music about this here Lexus that we are displaying…. And the theme to Alicia Keys Soulcare Makeup products… And the theme to the latest Kung Fu Panda movie…
“What size of these men’s sneakers do you want Alexa to put in your Amazon shopping cart…?”
“Introducing Lee cargo jeans in which comfort meets style.”
“Hey, roomful of people! This user has a case of vaginal lubricant in her shopping cart!”
“Take this unrelenting stream of sports quizzes that you have no interest in.”

Monk,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2023","I ordered this device on June 1st of this year, and I was furious with Amazon and their customer service for the very poor job of handling this expensive defective item. I have finally calmed down enough to write this review. I received this echo show 10 and had problems trying to set it up right out of the box. When I got to the part in the instructions to ask alexa a question, it replied "" I am having a problem right now and to contact customer support. I contacted customer support and we went thru the steps again to set up the echo show 10 with the same negative results. I unplugged this device as instructed and then plugged it back in with no change. I reset it as instructed with no change. I reset it back to factory as instructed with no change. I powered off my router and powered it back on with no change. This echo show 10 was defective and I spent a lot of time trying to get it to work properly. I called customer service the following day to return this device. I explained to the person that I and customer service did everything we could and this echo show 10 would not work. I was sent a return label and took the echo show 10 to UPS. I find out later that I did not receive my full refund. I called customer service numerous times to get the rest of my money back and they told me there was nothing they could do because the customer service person who created the return label checked a box stating item no longer required. I called customer service for assistance again with zero help. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told the supervisor would not change it either. I was put in hold for a while and then was told here was no supervisor there. I asked to speak with someone from the United States and was informed there is not a person from the United States that I could speak with.

Matthew Ricci,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2024","The screen interaction is awful, recognition of your touch is janky, inconsistent, and delayed. Screen navigation is not intuitive.
Alexa app integration is horrendous. The Alexa app itself is the worst and also not intuitive. Trying to setup groups and organize rooms and commands is a nightmare. Not simple b/c there's all these backdoor setups that you also need to toggle in place in the App that are not clearly presented and difficult to navigate.
The echo here also constantly falls out of sync with any other echo devices I have around here grouped with it.
Navigating between apps on the Echo Show is bad. Controlling Netflix, Hulu, and Pandora is a joke. Trying to type in my login credentials to Hulu, the Echo Show suddenly gives up and decides to take me back to the home screen. Trying again to login, using voice command, the Amazon Alexa brain is seriously unsophisticated compared to Apple Siri. It can't even type an email address. It thinks ""@"" is spelled as ""at"" when speaking into an email address input field. Alexa is so stupid, like a Wish version of Siri.
I like how the screen does follow you by pivoting around as you move about the house. Like HAL 9000's eye.
On the Echo Show and Dots, even when I set Alexa to limit talking back, I still state simple command and when it does choose to comply (sometimes it errors out and does nothing in response) it continues to talk at me saying a bunch of unrelated stuff and making recommendations, droning on and on. Just do what was asked, when asked, and then shut up. If Alexa echo show was as slick as Amazon thinks it is, then I might value the offerings it babbles on about, but it's not slick at all.

Ryan,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2022","Pretty much a useless overpriced piece of junk. What's the point of installing a tablet on an echo device if it doesn't do anything a touchscreen device from even 15 years ago could. Pretty lame. It has almost zero app support or usability. Even if you manage to get it to go to Amazon Prime or Netflix you can't properly navigate through it.
How are they going to pretend you can use Netflix, Amazon Prime or other streaming services simply by talking to it but not being able to actually visually navigate through it in a reasonable manner?
I use YouTube music, the only way to use it on the echo Show is to use it through the internet and it is so slow, laggy and glitchy it's not even worth using, it truly is that bad. Even if you use Amazon music you can't click on an album and see all the tracks it's virtually useless how am I going to look through my music by talking to it? There's no reason it can't allow you to navigate through your music by using the touch screen, it's absolutely terrible.
This would be the equivalent of only being able to speak to your tablet then your tablet giving you very limited information based on what you asked, the whole point of the echo show is that you're supposed to also have touch screen and interface usability beyond just speaking to it.
In Amazon's defense the only thing I can say is they did call it the Echo Show.
There's no excuse it can't support any app or function as a tablet except they have gone completely out of their way engineering it not to. You installed a tablet on the device, it should work as one but it doesn't so I see no point in its existence. I don't need a display to kind of show me what I asked with the least information given.
Even the most mundane of tasks asking it the weather the best you get is the temperature as it shows the temperature on screen with zero other information or even something to click on to give you more, nothing. What do I need that for??
I could look at my thermometer outside my window for that. What an absolute joke.
It's just a $250 display that sits on my counter now. Great, thanks Amazon for manufacturing a useless device!!
Another huge thing is for the amount of space there is for a speaker in the device it has subpar sound at best.
I have speakers half the size of this that sound better with fuller sound and dynamic range.

Douglas Draeger,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2022","I bought this so I could see who was at the front door with the ring doorbell. It will connect and show the camera when it rings, but only for about 5 seconds. If you’re not in the same room, it’ll be gone before you get there. So, pretty worthless for that. The time it’s displayed cannot be adjusted. Almost all ring doorbell features are unsupported for Alexa routines. I was able to have it display the camera when motion is detected through a routine: “Alexa, show the front door and turn off the speaker” since I don’t want to hear everything whenever someone walks by walking their dog. The camera will stay on for about 10 minutes and half the time Alexa will NOT mute the speaker and Alexa ALWAYS says “OKAY” from routines so I’m constantly being annoyed by it. The “Brief Mode” setting does NOT stop Alexa from saying OKAY. (Even after toggling on/off and restarting) It also freezes up about once a day on the camera, showing a still image until you unplug it. I set up a second routine activated by motion with a timer and “Alexa, stop” so now I got the camera to turn off after 2 minutes and the alexa show doesn’t freeze up as often. I set up a third routine to mute the speaker after a 5 second wait activated by motion, to attempt to get it to consistently mute the speaker. As you can see, getting the Alexa show to do simple things is overly complicated and it won’t stop saying OKAY.

Alexa is designed to be constantly talked to and talk back to you. If you don’t want to talk to it, they did make a poor attempt to integrate shortcuts of commands that can be painstakingly entered by keyboard (but not adjusted, you have to delete and start a new one) There are no apps to touch on the screen, the shortcuts can kind of work get it to play music, or show the front door camera (but it’ll be a small picture-in-picture) - If you just want to walk up to it and touch buttons or touch things on a screen THIS IS NOT THE DEVICE TO GET.

The device has updated itself with additional content on the Home Screen that are turned on by default.

One of my wife's favorite shows is ""America's Test Kitchen"" and she generally watches it on Tubi. Well the Echo Show offers a Tubi that is just a random collection of stuff and offers maybe only a 1/4 of what Tubi normally offers.

To add insult to injury, any time you ask Alexa to play any episode of ""America's Test Kitchen"" even ones we own and can access (albeit only manually) through the Echo Show it brings up an episode of ""America's Test Kitchen: The Next Generation"" on the Amazon owned FreeVee instead. That show is a cooking competition, it has really nothing to do with ""America's Test Kitchen"" beyond branding. It's like if I said ""Alexa show me the recipe for Gordon Ramsey's Amazing Hot Dog Tower"" and it showed me an episode of ""Hell's Kitchen"" instead.

So at the end of the day, I use this expensive paper weight to listen to the radio. Which by the way, I listen to the same station literally every day and Alexa gets it right about 60% of the time, I'm not a person with a thick accent or speech impediment so I'm not sure what the issue is there, but also you'd think that maybe just maybe that if I ask for the same station every day at 6:30 AM that I'm not asking for something that doesn't even sound like what I said.

Also, I use it to listen to Spotify, which I guess means that instead of buying this monstrosity, I could've just signed up for a supermarket credit card, gotten a free blue tooth speaker and called it a day.

Another fun fact is when you say ""Alexa turn off screen"" so you don't have to see the parade of Amazon ads, it will usually take another 3 or 4 times of saying that before Alexa hears and complies with that. On several occasions, I've just unplugged the thing instead.

Sound is nice though.",1.0 out of 5 stars
J. M. Grant,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2021","Update 8/29/2022:
Have had it since release and regret buying it. Very invested in Amazon ecosystem but this one isn’t good.

Audio (music) cuts out regularly. The so is sitting a foot away works fine all the time.
Still can’t make the display useful.
Worst of all - I need to reboot it every few days for it to keep working, or it will stop responding fully to commands.

Original review:

I've been using Echo devices since the pre-order days of the original and have a dozen connected. Amazon's decision to increase the amount of information that you cannot turn off is causing me to look at switching all of them out for a competitor.

Before I dive deeper, understand that I've gone through every menu and disabled everything I can - if you don't do that, the device is a non stop Amazon commercial. But even so, there's too much you can't disable for a product you had to pay to own, on top of the annual Prime membership.

The Echo Show line, in particular, usually displays things I do not want. While you can select some options, there are other settings that you simply can't turn off. I know how to use the thing and don't need half the screen on a Show 5 wasted by telling me I can look at Recipes while in my office.

The older Show devices let you control this but this new one seems to tighten quite a few things down in a way that you cannot simply have the device display a background photo and the weather/time and leave it at that. It's not possible. Sooner or later an ad or useless suggestion will pop up.

While playing music, it always suggests other things, often blocking part of the lyrics or preventing you from seeing the Artist + Song Name.

Ads for Prime Videos and other Amazon services are fine if the device was low cost or free. But I paid $250 for something and did not even have the option (as with the Kindle) to purchase an ad-free experience.

And others that are linked to ads. Want warnings about dangerous weather? OK but they'll also randomly (including 3am) sound a chime to tell you we have some products you might want to buy. Can't have one without the other.

As far as the latest hardware- Audio is fantastic, tremendously better than the earlier Show devices. The screen movement is somewhat gimmicky but does work well if one person is in the room. If there are two, it's wobbles between them and like most compromise, leaves it so nobody gets what they want. The main issue I have with the hardware is the glare on the screen. It's pretty hilarious to have to move your head so the glare doesn't block the screen, only to have the screen move to continue to face you... thus putting the glare back. Amazon should use a matte screen for these, it would make a world of difference.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Zerauskire,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2024","My son’s name is Aidan. I named the echo in his room “Aidan’s Room”. When I say “Alexa, drop in Aidan’s Room” the echo hears “Alexa, drop in Aiden’s Room”. It only interprets Aidan to be spelled Aiden with an “E”. Because of this, it will not drop in his room without asking every single time if I mean “Aidan’s Room” because it interprets what I said as “Aiden’s Room” with an “E” instead of the “A”. So it’s really annoying that I have to confirm this every single time when this should be a very simple fix.

I have just dealt with it and I have been reporting this issue since 2018. 6 years I have been reporting this issue and still no fix. I refused to change my son’s name in the settings to be spelled wrong because I shouldn’t have to. But recently I got tired of wasting 6 years of reporting this when it’s obvious that no one on Amazon’s side is listening. No one over there cares to fix this extremely simple-to-fix issue. I did what I put off for this long and just changed his name in the app which I shouldn’t have to. I should not have to spell my son’s name wrong just to make this work. I could understand if he had some crazy spelling for his name but it’s such a basic name. It’s crazy to me that it can’t understand that when I say “Alexa, drop in Aidan’s Room” that I’m referring to the device literally named “Aidan’s Room”. It can’t figure out that it’s not spelled with an “E”. How ridiculous is that? As smart as this thing is and it can’t figure that out.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Dr-Phone,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2023","I'm totally blind. I had a very very hard time to get the device setup! But I did do it on my own. Like I said, not easy at all. You cannot do it through the Alexa App on your phone like you can with normal Echo's. That would have been sweet if that was doable. It would have probably taken me a few minutes and not over 1 hour. Even then; There was a spot in the process, the things just stopped on one screen and wouldn't go past it with the built in screen reader. So if you are totally blind and want to get this to set it up on your own because you live by yourself! Be ware!

Looks like you cannot set any type of automation to tell you when the camera switch is on or off. If you initially don't know what way to slide the switch you will never know. Down side for me. Changing some setting in the Alexa App the setting wouldn't apply and the Show is online and responding to commands. Looks like you really need to do most things through the touch screen to get settings to take.

No USB port on the Show 10 so if you have trouble with the touch screen, you cannot use a normal keyboard to enter information for like user names and passwords.

The voice volume is lower in volume then the Start of request tone. I was hoping this would souind close to the Echo 4th generation with premium sound and Zigbee hub! But the sound isn't the same. The over all volume is lower. The speakers for the Show 10 are in the back stand for the unit.

It does look like it works for announcements that I have setup for Automation routines. So that is good.

At this point, I don't know if I'll keep it or not. At this point, I cannot tell someone who is totally blind and wants to do it on their-own to get one.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Eduardo Herrera,"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2023","To start I'll say that this is a very interesting device executed very poorly. Setting it up is very straightforward but when it comes to daily use is lacking in pretty much all aspects.
The echo show 10 3rd gen is very slow and takes more time to process the same smart prompts than other echo devices, all my echo dots are way faster than this at processing normal prompts like turn lights on/off.
Answering the Ring doorbell with this is useless as it would take about a minute just to bring the camera feed up.
I purchased the Echo show 10 as a smart hub for my kitchen area which turned out to be a terrible idea (even though is marketed as being great for kitchens) since the microphone is awful, I had to change the wake up word from this device because when saying alexa in the kitchen this device wouldn't respond but my echo dot all the way in the living room would.
Now I really have to shout for this device to start listening.
The screen is ok but the following feature doesn't work most of the times and when it does is not centered to the eyesight so it feels awkward to look at, many times it moves by itself or doesn't move accurately when I move around my kitchen counter.
Connectivity seems fine now but this is my second unit as the first one lost wifi connectivity for some reason after a few months of owning it, it could have been a dud but dealing with Amazon customer service about this device and its issues has been a very frustrating experience.
Now I can't even trade it in to upgrade to a better device because according to customer services this device in inelegible for trade in even though there's a picture of it in the trade in page on the Amazon site.

I would recommend anyone to steer clear from the amazon echo show 10 3rd gen.
It's just not worth it.",1.0 out of 5 stars
jesse johnson,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2024","I have multiple echos and none of them want to work together. Spent days trying to get these to work, hours over the phone with the ""echo team"" in 2 different languages. Ive followed the instructions on every form online I could find. Several of these speakers do not work in a group.

The Echo Show specifically will not play music in a group. It will tell me its playing music and do nothing. This device has shown me ads and doesnt understand my commands a lot of the time. Doesn't turn on my lights about half the time I ask.

I have more things I could say about the app, software, customer service and expenses even just to play white noise. But those have less to do to with this specific device.

I am dumbfounded, the quality of these devices and software are leagues below what I normally would expect out of any Amazon product. I love Amazon and their brand of products but the programing on these is disgusting.

Having said all that the sound quality of the speakers themselves is good, but there are many devices of the same sound quality that cost much less.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Ed,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","UPDATE: I have had it for over 3 months Home Screen still isn't fixed screen goes black after showing a few of your photos. DO NOT BUY THIS ONE IF YOU WANT A SHOW BUY THE PREVIOUS VERSION WHERE THE HOME SCREEN WORKS! I have communicated for 3 months with support and I have given up it being fixed ever! Very disappointed from a user that has 2 older versions of show, several echo dots and other echo's which are great. Makes me afraid to buy any new Amazon products since this one has definitely disappointed!

I have had the other Alexa Show's so I am familiar with the settings etc. But in the new Show the option of having your photos going to the screen continually gets interrupted by an ANNOYING Amazon screen that says at the top ""Alexa for your day"" it seems there is no way to shut this off and no one would want to continually see this. Also after showing home screen pictures for a little while the screen goes black and stays that way until you ask Alexa something. My other Amazon shows (I have two) work great with these features. Why the software functioning was changed in this unit is bizarre. They need to go back to the programming of the home screen that they successfully used in the previous show models!

Also the movement of the unit is continually confused by the tv being on in the room making that feature almost useless. Also became confused when our dog barked. Surely the unit needs to refined and a human does not sound like a dog. The setting where it should only move when video calling and drop in doesn't work always moves when asking even temperature or any other simple request. Also it is supposed to go back to a home position and it never does. Have not seen any improvement in software problems.

Wait until these annoying things are fixed! Great idea that needs lots of programming work get busy fixing these issues and I will edit my review!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Francesca,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2023","Amazon has proven, after years of ignoring (and making it more and more difficult to give) feedback, that they care more about sales than customer needs. They simply do not respect customer needs/privacy.

It’s like playing whack a mole to turn off new “features” that are mainly advertisements. And then come the actual advertisements that pop up in our kitchen, when all we’ve authorized are our pictures and deliveries.

Forcing ads on people does not build loyalty! It builds resentment. And it’s unethical. We paid a lot for these devices and we pay for content separately. Amazon has NO RIGHT to invade our home with ads.

Even after a lengthy chat rabbit hole about turning off ad preferences. The fact that it’s that complicated to get ONLY what we want on this screen says a lot about Amazons increasing entitlement and arrogance.

THIS IS AN ACCESSIBILITY ISSUE.
As a neurodiverse family, we struggle to keep distractions out of our home. Alexa has officially made that impossible. Overstimulation and constant distraction are unhealthy.

All of this unauthorized crap popping constantly up is bad for our family. And trying to make it stop has become a source of stress.

After more than a decade and four Amazon devices, we’ve had to switch to google hub.

Wake up and change course, Amazon. Use your powers for good.

Break away from this, the latest in the disturbing wave of corporatecentric, (not customer centric) business practices, which are seriously eroding Consumer Rights.

Yes, Relentless is a better name for the company. And not relentlessly customer centric as was supposedly the initial idea.

Amazon is now relentlessly profit-centric, sinking further and further into aggressive, coercive sales tactics. There is no concern for customer comfort or boundaries, and therefore absolutely no regard for customer loyalty. We are finding alternatives to Amazon.

Market niche for a company that values respect, boundaries and health!",1.0 out of 5 stars
John C.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2021","Here is my first impression right from the start. The motion detection does NOT work very well even with good lighting. It must be very bright surrounding the unit for this thing to follow me. I paid a lot of money for this one feature and even with every light on in my kitchen and den I still get the “low light detected, motion not available.” Essentially the motion detection will not work after sundown in my house. It’s upsetting when you pay a lot of money for something that doesn’t stand up to what it claims to do. Very disappointed. And a white power cord for my black Echo?? Really Amazon?? Plus, the cord is about 12” shorter than the previous Show’s. My first gen model I could run the cord along the floor to the outlet but this one is draped across my wall and the bright white stands out like a sore thumb. Poorly executed. Amazon should send black longer cords to every person that ordered a black unit.

Set up took about 20 min because it made me go through the entire setup just to reach the point where it had to do mandatory updates/reboot and basically reset itself to a point where I had to literally go through the same set up process twice. Here’s an idea Amazon, why don’t you have me do the set up after the updates take place.

Finally, I will say I love the bigger screen and the sound quality is far better that the my original (first generation) Show. Not sure if these two attributes are worth keeping it for the $250 price tag. One more thing since I pre-ordered the device as soon as it became available, I paid $250 and the option to add a Blink camera for $5 was not available at the time. So, I basically got penalized for pre-ordering this thing early and missed out on the $5 camera add-on. Never again will I pre-order anything from Amazon.

I feel this unit isn’t worth the hype and the extra cost if you already own an Echo Show. Wait for the price drops to get one or skip this and wait for an improved motion detection system. Amazon, you’re slipping.
I will post updates in the future.

Update: as of March 22, 2021. I am returned this unit. I don’t know if it was a lemon
or just the way the echo show 10 is but in my opinion it is not worth $250. The other night it lost network connection for no reason and I could not get it to connect to my network. I tried resetting, restarting and even going back to factory default settings and still it would not connect to my Wi-Fi. Sorry Amazon I’m returning this and hopefully you get these bugs worked out on the next rendition.

Cassandra,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2023","This device did not work correctly. Smart motion could not find you. It did not respond to it's wake name. Personal setting kept dropping out forcing me to go through set up all over again. All other Echo and Echo Dot devices I purchased could not sync with it. ( I wont review those here but I'll say I returned all of them).
I called in to troubleshoot and after no luck, agreed to receive a replacement, which did not work either. I could not initiate a return for the new (exchanged) Echo show. The screen said I have to call in to customer service, which I did and initiated the return. However, the person had to email me a link to get the return label. A QR code could not be given on the AMZ orders screen like a usual return (I still have no idea why???) I received the emailed label and took it to my UPS store where I was forced to purchase packaging at my own expense (Are you kidding me????!!!!)
Meanwhile, my orders screen on my Amazon account still shows no record of this return being initiated (12/10/23). All other Amazon devices returned at the same time have been refunded. So I call Customer Svc again this a.m. (12/10) and the person tells me no return was initiated. I explained the details and was put on hold. After about 15 minutes, I am dropped from the call.

Last night, I was using it as normal, but suddenly it got stuck out of the blue, so I moved it to my my side. Then, the screen didn't follow me anymore. So I left it there and thought about restarting it today after work. But then I saw the screen was completely black, nothing happened, so I unplugged it. When I came back from work, I unplugged it and nothing, it didn't respond. So I noticed that this time the screen was very light, wereas before it was heavy to move. I contacted Customer Service and they transferred me to Support, I thought it was technical support, but no. They only checked the warranty. Not a single trouble shooting, I had to repeat myself several times to explain my problem, so that at the end, their only brilliant solution was for me to buy another one with a discount. Imagine, you spend a lot of money on something you think is going to last longer, just to find out, that the warranty expired a month after you bought it. How convenient. The guy didn't tell me a thing about actually having this fixed. Nothing at all, they insisted on turning the on/off button, this thing doesn't have one. That was it. This is just a SCAM. I am not buying any of these products ever again. They just stop working out of the bue. You cannot even open the device to check what is inside.

The offer to trade in was again, and is still shown on the Echo 10 page so I sent in another device got the credit I expected but no additional 25% off.

ShuMO,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2021","I recommend you not buy this unit.
The movement of the screen is sketchy at best. During setup, it seems great, since I'm literally sitting right in front of it. But walking near it, camera image was off center constantly. the motorized is only left and right, it doesn't go up and down so depending on the screen tilt, your always off screen. Seems pointless to have all this mechanical tech and no PTZ. (Pan Tilt Zoom).
Basic features, like other show units (the 5, 8 and 10 Gen 2) function as expected EXCEPT:
this is a gen 3 and as such, they've screwed with the unit OS. I have security cameras which stream to a high end security server. I have not had a problem displaying any camera on any Alexa in years. Now, I can't show any camera on this unit, it just doesn't work - but only on this device.
In attempts to workaround the failure, I've installed a gateway to resolve a well known SSL problem, disabled audio - but still no camera on this device - and it seems Amazon is not helping anyone - they point the finger at everything but themselves.
Would I purchase this again? No.
Get the 8 or 10 (hard to find) and be done with it - or better yet - use a DIY Alexa device running on a Raspberry PI and get more features than you can imagine! Thats what I'm doing :)

Update: tried to get help from Amazon - both Chat and Phone - After waiting 2 hrs on chat, no answer - 30 minutes on phone - no answer. Sending it back.

Update: during the return, I got prompted for a direct connection to a support person. I took the stab and actually got a call back 10 minutes later.

A. Savage,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2021","Update - March 2024: still slow after resets. Spotify connection has become iffy at best. Ads on weather display. Ads ads ads.

Update - June 2023: this is officially the last Alexa product I’ll ever buy. The assistant has become almost useless, they add new ads to the home screen all the time, the follow on questions are infuriating, and it needs to be restarted frequently due to sluggishness. Touch screen hasn’t been snappy in a long, long time. Navigating the settings is a chore. I think Amazon is killing it on purpose as Alexa operates at a major loss. Again: this is a decent Bluetooth speaker and mediocre kitchen timer (that now ignores you on “stop” commands half the time). Not much else. Definitely do not buy at full price, Prime Day only.

Original: This has a much weaker microphone array than the Dots or other Echo products. Doesn’t always hear you well, and you need to be extra crisp to ensure accuracy.

Speaker quality is excellent. Nice, balanced, room-filling. Good equalizer settings.

Touch screen response is pretty good, not an iPad, but rarely wholly frustrating. Not super fast though.

Infuriating follow on questions from Alexa, enough to almost push me away from the ecosystem. I don’t remember it being this bad in the past few years, and the control settings have been reduced as well. Needs a concise mode. I don’t think I’ve ever been happy or helped by unprompted info/questions from Alexa.

Home Screen customization is pretty weak too. Loves pushing Amazon stuff on you, but this can be changed. Have a rotating home screen of photos, with a small weather card.

Top use case is with Spotify, and it doesn’t really run a Spotify app, more than stream from another source. You pretty much will only control the music from phone/computer. Can’t speak to other music services.

Haven’t used the rotation function all that much either, but I’m not a big video chatter. It does track well, if a little abruptly.

Overall, it’s an excellent solo home speaker with solid Alexa functions. Nicely positioned in the kitchen; we have ours on the bar that connects the kitchen to the dining area. Far from perfect, but overall worth buying at discount.

Updated: slowly became terrible. Slow screen, awful interaction, advertising added. I needed to de-register it for some reason, and getting it back online has been a nightmare.

Donald Koch,"Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2023","I just unboxed and setup an Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) device only to find out that I cannot use it because I do not own a smartphone.

After spending nearly an hour on the line with Amazon technical support I was told that in order to use the device for video calls I would need to purchase a smartphone (or a recent model tablet) and install the Alexa App to be able to input my home telephone number that Alexa would then us to place the call. There is NO PLACE in the Echo Show settings to input the number; it can only be done through the Alexa app.

This is quite frankly monumentally stupid. There should be a section of the ""Settings"" on the device to allow the input of the telephone number that should be used to enable the calling feature of the device, but instead I am being told that I have to purchase an additional device, that I do not want, just so that I can use a device that I just purchased.

I have been an Amazon customer since 1999 and I have, until now, never been disappointed in a product that I have purchased. That Amazon would market a device that is so incompetently designed is almost beyond comprehension. I do not believe for one minute that it is technologically impossible to design the ""Settings"" subsystem to allow the input of such a crucial piece of information as a telephone number.

To make the experience more infuriating, there is no information on the Echo Show product page that indicates that one MUST have a smartphone or recent generation tablet in order to use the Echo show.

Effective this month, it's officially worse! The constant barrage of ads is incredible. Dismiss an ad for an item and it comes back in another color anyway. Amazon doesn't care what you've paid for - they want to push incessant ads into your private space!

=====
UPDATED 12-NOV-2023
Ok, I PAID for this device, and I keep PAYING for Amazon Prime. So why is this thing displaying ads ALL the time? I didn’t BUY a smart speaker/screen so Amazon could push sponsored content into my home! And you cannot turn this off either on the device or in the Alexa smartphone app. This stinks!!

Further, Amazon keeps changing my Home Screen settings in order to push more of their desired content. Again, I didn’t PAY for this device so Amazon can push THEIR content into my home. Yes, there are device settings to turn this off, but I expect Amazon to honor my settings and not keep turning undesired content on AGAIN to my Home Screen. Seriously, Amazon changes YOUR settings so they can shove whatever THEY want down your throat.

I’ve had nearly every Echo smart speaker, and recent models listen very well to my spoken input. But not this model!! I am constantly having to repeat myself or completely restate instructions to this device, when the others in my home work just fine. Even other SHOW devices work normally. It’s only with this device.

Boasts great features, but they’re poorly executed. Mostly software flaws I’ve not observed on my numerous non-screen Echo devices. This thing even puts itself into do-not-disturb mode despite this feature (and schedule) being disabled. And the opposite is true: scheduling do not disturb mostly has no effect. And even when DND is active, it still lets Amazon updates through. Just constant bugs.

Numerous other design problems. Such as the camera being offset, so the screen never quite follows you; it’s always a little offset. When it actually follows you. More often than not, it doesn’t follow at all. And it never resets to my set default position.

I keep hoping Amazon will make software improvements, but I think shoppers are better off with a regular Echo smart speaker until Amazon can figure out this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
John C.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2023","Updated review:

My echo show 10 has started showing “person detected” at the top of the screen every single day, it actually blocks stuff and doesn’t go away until I unplug it. Occasionally it swaps it out for “guard is using your camera”.

—

The Echo Show 10 is a decent device with some notable strengths and weaknesses. One significant strength is the addition of motorization, which allows the screen to follow you as you move around the room. However, there are some issues that need to be addressed.

One significant problem is the ""Person Detected"" banner, which cannot be disabled without unplugging and replugging the device. I currently have an open ticket with support about this issue and hope it can be fixed soon. Additionally, motion detection can be finicky, and the camera cannot detect motion in low light.

The integration with Ring could also be improved. Live view only works in the Alexa app, not in the Ring app, and defining which cameras can be used can be confusing when setting up which cameras are used during different Alarm modes. For example, by default, Motion recording is turned on when the Ring Alarm is disarmed, which can be inconvenient for privacy.

Furthermore, Amazon's trade-in program has become more frustrating. Previously, you could set up a trade-in and immediately take advantage of the 25% off discount. Now, it appears that you don't receive any discount until the device has been received and appraised, which can be inconvenient if you want to make a purchase at the same time you do the trade-in.

Despite these issues, the Echo Show 10 is a solid device, especially if purchased on promotion. The motorization feature is a significant improvement over previous models, and the sound quality is good. However, it could benefit from further refinement and attention to detail, particularly with regards to the issues discussed above. Overall, the Echo Show 10 is a good purchase, but it's not without its flaws.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Joe A,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2022","In my original review (see below) I complained that we couldn't get this Echo Show to work with our Ring cameras.

Amazon responded to my review and said that function exists and works just fine. Our experience was that we could not get all of the cameras to just passively be on the screen. Maybe there is a difference for different types of cameras? We have 3 different types of Ring cameras - the doorbell cam, an indoor cam, and 2 outdoor wired floodlight cams. I tried for a couple hours, then my girlfriend tried for a couple hours. We couldn't get it to do what we wanted.

So I'll change my review to say that while Amazon claims this functionality exists we were unable to make it do this despite hours of trying.

===============
My original review:
We purchased this to use with our Ring alarm system, so that we could have a monitor on the kitchen counter to see the Ring cameras. We figured since Echo and Ring are both part of the Amazon family that they would have really nice integration.

Oh so wrong we were!

You can get a full-featured app for the ring alarm on an android or an apple tablet. Weirdly there is no skill for this on Echo, and super weirdly there isn't even one on Fire Tablets. (You have to use a backdoor to install the android app store and then you can download it). It does do some basic things with Ring doorbell, but that's it.

I had expected to be able to do other things - video conferencing (nope, not with any normal service like Zoom or Google Meet) or watch directTV (nope).

I found this product only marginally more useful than an echo speaker. While its cool that it rotates to follow you around, I was left with the question - what is this for? It wasn't worth the money and it wasn't worth the countertop space.",1.0 out of 5 stars
JM,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2023","First of all, and most annoying, is the fact that display will not face directly at you. I thought I had a defective one, but when I googled it I found out what the problem is. The camera is located on the top right of the tablet instead of the center. So when it tracks you, it centers you in the camera frame, but the camera is not centered on the tablet. This might not seem like a big deal, however it literally prevents the display from facing directly at you. Instead it faces as if it's pointing towards someone standing beside you. The further away you are the less it points away from you, but it's so dumb when you come close to it so you can see, and it literally turns away from you.
Second of all, you set up users and you can tell it to ""follow me"" while your cooking. So even with me logged in as the active user, and an active command to ""follow me"", if anyone walks through the kitchen it locks onto them, follows them out of the room, then stays facing the opposite direction. If you have anyone other than yourself in your house, then this device is useless cause you have to end up turning off the motion tracking features anyways. I'm glad I didn't buy the robot version of this awful product.

Craig,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2023","Update - I lowered this from 2 stars to 1 star because when it's showing ads and you ask it to show your photos it does so, but then slides down a quarter-screen sized ADVERTISEMENT to order prints of your photos.
If you are considering this for an elderly person as a means of checking in on them I recommend non screen echo devices. We already use two echo dots in other rooms of mom's house. We are considering replacing the show 10 with another dot and a ring stickup camera with pan/tilt. We're also considering an omni fire tv as (so far) there are no advertisements on the ""ambient"" screen which can be set to your photos slide show or several other still or moving images.
-------
Sponsored content can not be removed from the home screen. Customer service said to turn off all the home content switches. They said go to to amazon.com/adprefs and select do not show me interest-based ads provided by Amazon. After two days and several chat sessions they said this can not be removed. That was the only honest thing they said about it. At this point they said but it's only when it's idle. This was also disingenuous. Even swiping the screen often shows two to four more ads before getting back to your slide show.

I bought this for my mother who is in her nineties. We pay extra for Alexa Together for elderly, but still can not remove these ads. A shaky hand can easily make a ""touch"" instead of a ""swipe"" and this opens the advertised product.

Trevor Cherry,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2023","The echo worked great for about 2 weeks and suddenly stopped running. Would not turn on at all. I tried the factory reset and several different outlets. I called customer service and they gave me 2 options: send in the one I have and they would fix it and send it back to me or pay $40 and receive a new one. I did not want to spend another $40 when I just spent a lot of money on the original product. I sent off my echo and 3 weeks later I received it back. IT STILL WONT TURN ON!! They didn’t do anything to fix it. Just put it in a new box and sent it back to me. Now the customer service girl won’t send me a new one or fix the one I have. She didn’t even want to give me a refund!! After arguing with her for 30 minutes she finally said she could refund me. Not happy at all with this product, customer service, or Amazon. Absolutely horrible experience.

Update: When I send it back the first time, they told me not to send the power cord with it. I ordered a new power cord and that fixed it. Not sure why they didn’t check that as well. Now the second cord has gone out. 2 cords in 10 months. It never gets unplugged and the cord never gets messed with. Seems like the cord is designed to self destruct so you have to keep buying new ones.

Also, you would think that Amazon would continue to improve Alexa but I swear she is regressing every week. She understands less and less, wants me to pay for music all the time, and never plays from the device I am talking to.

If you like a large clock display don't expect it to stay large on your screen all the time because during the all day everyday ads showing the clock display is reduced significantly. Watching movies is another thing you won't do much of unless it's from Prime. Music is a no go unless you pay for a service. Amazon is a pay for everything. I mean, remember 1 day shipping? Yea, you pay more now and there's no guarantee if it will arrive in one day or 10. Video calls are a nuisance due to freezing video/audio issues.

Justin Vicknair,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2024","I’d recommend getting Google devices. I have smart switches and outlets everywhere in my house after I renovated. The echo show is constantly going offline. The newest issue issue of many is that the microphones are very poor. Microphones are supposed to have compression in them to drown out background noise to receive the correct signals. You’d have to turn off your TV or anything else running for the device to understand your commands. Often times I have to yell to the point that the Alexa device in the other room fulfills the command. I’ve reported the issue but just as you expect Amazon doesn’t do anything. Some low level tech person who has minimal training will just tell you to factory reset it and set it up from scratch…which is both a pain and an ineffective waste of your time. I have a Google puck in the same room right by the TV now and it can hear me all the time while the closer Alexa device does not. Now that my experiment is complete I urge you to avoid Amazon devices. I’ve had to return an echo before and now that the expensive ones messed up I’m over it.

When I delete the commercials and say I’m not interested, it says it will not be shown on this device again, but that’s just not true and it shown multiple times after that. .

What hot garbage. (First posted on 9/18/2022)

Follow up (11/28/2021)
I don’t think there is piece of technology that has ever generated more fury to me than piece of crap Alexa Echo Show.

First when I posted my review a couple of months ago, within minutes (!) Amazon called me and asked me if they could help me with the echo show. It was kinda creepy but also kind nice. After 35 minutes futzing and downloading and redoing settings on the device and the phone it STILL couldn’t do zoom calls, even though the agent thought with the latest update it should. It was like a glimmer of hope and then nothing. I was just as frustrated as when I first realized this was a waste of money. However it was enough for me leave the thing plugged in and not actually throw it in the trash. Even though it did nothing.

A couple of months later. I have found *one* very awkward use for the device. If I set up an Alexa to Alexa call on my phone and the show, I can use the Show screen, and my phones camera to give me a view of myself while weightlifting. It’s cumbersome to setup and neither device can do anything else but at least it’s *one* use.

The show is screen, a speaker, a camera, and a computer. It does all of these jobs hilariously badly. The screen can’t cast and streams very few services. The speaker can’t multi task. The camera struggles with video calls. And the computer, good god they have done everything possible to make it only usable in the very idiotic way they want you to use it.

It’s the most egregiously Company-centric, gather-your-data device I could have imagined. The “customer first” motto and was definitely missing from the design and implantation of this device. I really hope the teams involved read this.",1.0 out of 5 stars

This device has been nothing but constant issues and when trying to get any kind of support you’re met with an insane lack of accountability. If you’re someone who was lucky enough to get one that works, I’m sure you’ll love it. For anyone else good luck, or if you got this as a gift, they won’t help you troubleshoot and won’t even help when they attach it to someone else’s account.

The “Alexa for your day” is on for most of the screen time. There’s nothing you can do about it. Same with the ads they’ll have for new movies or shows. They’ll stay in the screen 10 times longer than any image or sometimes just stay all day. I have had the issue of suggestions, Covid tips and more popping up even when I have them toggled off. Then it started just being a blue screen and not even the nature pictures I had set as the Home Screen images before rotating a bunch of Amazon ads or these suggestions I had tuned off. Looking at some of the reviews I can see that others have reported the same glitches I have but have been told “the device is operating as intended” even when sending video and pictures of the device clearly not working or connecting to my account.

I was sent a replacement and it’s been literally days where it won’t even turn on to be set up because the one sent to me was associated to the person who purchased the original one as a gift.

First, the bluetooth sound is unacceptably HORRIBLE. Constant stuttering, clicks, pops, and other sound artifacts. Sounds like a $10 speaker from the Dollar Store. Second, the volume is a problem. The laptop and Echo volume are not synced. So at normal Echo volume, I could not hear the bluetooth sound at all. I had to turn the Echo to 8 to hear anything. That is when I noticed the horrible sound quality noted above. This means that Alexa will scream at me for everything except the sound that I asked to hear which is barely audible. I chatted with tech support to check. NATURALLY, they had me restart the device then factory reset...because that is always the first step. And when you factory reset, you have to do everything all over again--wifi, password, Amazon account, password, etc. Be warned, as part of the setup, it will AUTOMATICALLY start uploading all the photos on your phone to Amazon.

Bruce O,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2022","Super sluggish, doesnt respond quickly to taps and when dropping in from other devices the show takes a long time to get in focus if it ever does. Also even when it focus it hunts around which is super annoying when you are talking to 2 deaf poeple trying to sign. The unit is right next to the Wifi so the signal is max.

If I'm on my Galaxy S22 and dropping in the video when I'm in portrait orientation is in landscape so it is hard to see the deaf people signing. Then if I turn to landscape the video stays in the portrait orientation. There is a rotation button but it only rotates my video from portrait to landscape not the people I am signing with. There is literally no way the UI designers use this app for video communication it is super bad. Even when I start the drop in it selects the mic source as a watch located in another room instead of defaulting to the handset.

The interface is not intuitive the whole alexa/echo ecosystem software ui is a convoluted mess.

Almost never focused on calls if it does connect and the device is always moving and zooming seemingly randomly. If you use the alexa app to drop in for a video conference the landscape video of the echo will only show in portrait so it's a small video with black bars top and bottom of course if you rotate the phone it stays in portrait. If you hit the rotate button it will rotate your little selfie camera but not the main video which remains unintuitively in portrait. It will also just connect the studio to another device like a watch in another room instead of the obvious default of speaker. This has been going on for at least 6 months with not a bug fixed.

Pedro Freitas,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2021","Mic and Alexa wake command:
The new 3rd Generation Show is by far the worst Echo device I've had to pick up the voice Alexa wake command. I have to yell Alexa for it to wake when the Show is playing content at any volume. My old original Show wakes up more than 15 feet away while the 3rd Gen Show does not wake when I'm standing right in from of it.
This happens mostly when the 3rd Gen Show is playing content like music or video. Maybe the larger speaker is overwhelming the mic, or the mic in the 3rd Gen Show is worse than previous Echo devices.
This is bad enough that I'm considering returning the device. The original Show works much better in this scenario and the new Show almost does not work at all.

Motion display:
The display moves away from you then you put your hand on it to adjust the volume buttons. The proximity of the hand seems to confuse the motion sensor. I have to use both hands and hold the display from moving to adjust the volume.

Bugs canceling timers:
I got the 3rd Gen Show stuck several times. Canceling a timer right when the timer expires puts the Show in a loop and the timer alarm cannot easily be dismissed.
Canceling multiple timers using the touch screen sometimes does not work. Swiping to cancel failed and the timers stayed active. I had to use voice to cancel each timer, but calling each timer by the original duration (e.g. cancel 20 minute timer) does not work. It failed to recognize the timer by duration and tells me have multiple timers. I had to ask for ""cancel timer"" and wait for it to ask which, and only then say ""20 minute timer.""

The new Show seems buggy. I hope software updates will improve things over time like the motion of the display and the timer bugs.
I'm not sure the poor mic issue is solvable by software. It could be related to a hardware issue or choice that may not be addressed until a future product refresh.

If you have a choice, I suggest choosing another Echo device for now and skipping the 3rd generation Show until it has been improved. You'll need the patience of an early adopter to put up with its current buggy state. Its is disappointing for a 3rd generation device.",1.0 out of 5 stars

The Echo Show 10 behaves almost as if it's made by a different company. It can't hear me half the time, often another device much farther away answers instead of this one, it misunderstands me most of the time when it does hear me, and it also tends to respond differently when it finally does understand me, telling me it can't do a certain thing I'm asking or trying to use a 'skill' when one of the other devices would just fulfill the request directly. It gets to the point where, if I'm close enough to an Echo, I'll just lean in that direction and try to aim my voice that way, hoping it will answer instead of the Show 10. Actually considered disabling the mic or just putting it away somewhere, and the only reason I haven't is because it cost so much (!!), so I'm still trying to work with it. I regularly go into the 'voice history' settings and provide feedback when it misunderstands me, but that hasn't improved its performance.

It's also been having a lot of trouble tracking/rotating to follow my voice, a problem that's gotten worse the longer we've had it. Restarting it sometimes helps, but we currently have the rotation turned off because it just doesn't work often enough, which defeats the purpose of the feature (not to mention the price we paid).

The screen is fine, and I'd rate the sound quality a B/B+, but that really doesn't matter when the whole point is that you control it with your voice, and the voice recognition is so incredibly poor.

I love all my other devices, but this one, I'm not a fan. I was hoping it was going to be something more like a central hub, where, at a glance, you could get your news, weather, calendar events, control of other smart devices, etc... Although it does some of those things, it doesn't do them well and it ends up being a chore, rather than a help. Review Update: After writing my review a rep from Amazon contacted me. Unfortunately, at the time I was tide up in a meeting. They asked when would be a good time to call back. I gave them a time and never heard anything from them again. I continue to be aggravated and frustrated with this device. I have several of the other devices and really love them. However, this one is garbage. I ask it to set a timer while a few feet away from it. It doesn't listen and one of my other devices (one that is not only in a different room, but also on a different floor) sets the timer.

Tim,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2022","Can't use it as an alarm clock. The room must be well lit and camera has to be on for the display to turn toward you. It doesn't find you just by voice as one would expect, and then it could be used at night. Night Mode is now a gray screen with white date and time, it lights up the whole room and here is no option to change the colors. You cannot change it back to the old Night Mode which was a black screen with red font, which was fainter at night and easier on the eyes. You have to dim it down so much you can't see the display when you call it from sleep mode. You can't see your Ring Camera when it's activated if you have it dimmed, annd it doesn't ""wake up"" and brighten then screen as it should when called. They should have made an option for the screen to light up when called or not to if not wanted like the prompt sound. Also, I could not get the Ring display go away when telling it to dismiss the camera. No command worked.

The alarm with music still comes on at the last volume setting instead of slowly asending like the buzzers do. And you still can't set the alarm to run selected routines unless that is the only trigger you give a particular routine. It says it has an option to run a selected routine from a list it attempts to populate, but is alway ""Unable to fetch routines, try back later.""

In short, instead of improving everything that needed to be with the pervious Echo 5 version, they made no improvements and changed the good stuff. I returned mine of course.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Allie,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2023","I can’t tell you how long I’ve been looking for a designated screen to display advertisements to me in my kitchen. How else would I be reminded to play Jeopardy on a daily basis or to purchase mediocre movies on Prime video?! The UI is excellent if you’re looking for something that’s not very interactive or useful. Were you hoping to avoid a useful Alexa assistant with a screen? Then this is for you! The echo show is guaranteed to be exactly as useful as the timer on your microwave!!!! My absolute FAVORITE part is that I got to spend $200 on a clock!

Wow! It surely can’t get better than this, right?! WRONG! There is an extremely laid back, chill, widget screen that takes life one day at a time. You’ll come to envy this screen as it has clearly escaped the toxic capitalistic expectations of productivity in our society. After the widget page spends 30 seconds waking up, it will give you some really cool and useful options for everyone in your home! There are so many different fish-tank displays to choose from, I was frankly overwhelmed!

However, if your expectations for a smart display include an efficient means to browse Spotify or your calendar, display recipes of your choosing, provide an interactive checklist for daily chores, or anything else that may be considered useful, you simply won’t be compatible with this one. That doesn’t make the Echo Show wrong… just different.

txmom,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2023","I traded in a perfectly good echo show 8 for the echo show 10. The only 2 things that I like about the echo show 10 is the size of the screen and the quality of the speaker when playing music. Besides that it doesn’t operate correctly. we have the motion turned off because it doesn’t follow people correctly. Here’s an example of the kind of irritation that we deal with daily: I installed the Santa skill so that my grandson could call Santa. Half the time when he asks her to call Santa she calls Santa the other half the time she says she can’t call Santa because he is not in my contacts list.
When I ask you to open up my playlists, half the time it opens up my playlist and the other half the time it just starts playing one of my playlist randomly. if I tell it to turn on my living room light, it gets it correct about 70% of the time. Sometimes it doesn’t respond at all and other times it tells me that it can’t find it. This is how this thing operates all day long. It can’t get anything right 100% of the time. it’s extremely frustrating. I unplugged it and reset it multiple times and it doesn’t help.

C.Ciavolella,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2021","I've lived with this thing for over a year now, but I've been holding off on my review in the hopes that maybe just maybe software or app updates would make it actually function correctly. Sadly, no. So after all this time, it gets one star, and I really should have just returned it on day one.
We purchased this, as well as one for each of the grandparents, so our kids could easily connect with them and see them (we all live very far away from each other and rarely see each other). When asking Alexa to make a call, it will state, ""calling grammy on Alexa device"" but then literally not do anything, no matter how long we wait. Sometimes Alexa won't even finish that sentence, it'll just cut off. Repeating the request gets similar results.
Asking ""Alexa, why are you broken"" sends her in to a ""Every thing seems to be functioning normally"" loop where she repeats this phrase over and over never finishing the word ""normally"".
We also have a few Echo Dots (mostly received for free with other purchases). And occasionally, asking the show to call grammy will trigger an echo dot in the other room to make the call, for some unknown and absolutely terrible design reason.
And the app, dear god. How a multi-billion dollar company can fail so hard at basic app design is astonishing. Amazon should have waited for someone else to produce this item, then just bought the rights, like they did with Wyze, which actually has a decent app. God help you in your attempts to set up any Echo device, it's going to take you a few tries, I hope you have the patience of a saint.

There are moments when I asked Alexa to do very blatant clear commands that I’ve used on all the other devices in My Home and I get the response,” I’m having trouble hearing you” which is so upsetting because I’m standing right in front of the device. And let’s not forget the 7 out of 10 times (yes I said 7) I try to use the device to complete a 1-action item like “Alexa, make it colder inside” to which I get “I didn’t get that” or it may just hear the request, but does absolutely nothing nor responds - these instances I check the log in the app and it lists what I said verbatim with no reason for just plain ignoring me.

Michael Buczek,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2022","This device is practically unusable. It fails in the fundamentals - to hear you, and it fails in it’s unique feature - to rotate towards you.

When I ask this device to do something, Echo devices in two (!) adjacent rooms respond before this one does - even if I stand just a few feet away. Its microphones seem very sensitive to other noise in its surroundings, so god forbid you use it in your kitchen when the fan is on or water is running.

If you ask it to play the headlines, it just shows random videos, so to get any content you have to walk up to it and touch the screen. That in turn makes the screen rotate away from you, unless you actually touch the content displayed in the middle.

If you try to control the lights, since its “hearing” is so bad, it will respond “I can’t do that” at least 50% of the time. Luckily the Echo I have in another room frequently hears me instead, and sets my light to the desired setting.

Whenever you speak to it, it’s supposed to turn towards you, and it does - if you tell it to rotate towards you two or three times.

Using the drop-in feature to connect to another Alexa device in the house takes about a minute, so I end up broadcasting messages to all the devices in the house instead.

The overall user experience is just incredibly bad, at least in my case where we have several other Echo devices and rarely are closer than 5 feet from the device. The only thing it does reasonably well is play music - if it hears what you ask for. Because what it plays may often be a total surprise.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Barbottawa,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2024","Very disappointed. This thing does not work. It is not user-friendly. I have eight different Alexa products and this one is the worst. Bought it in order to monitor my three doorbells. No instructions on how to do it. Phoned Amazon three times and nobody could tell me how to do it as they didn’t know. Seriously!

Finally, figured it out myself. However, I got it to show the front door, but even with a “wait for 30 seconds”, command followed by a “stop” command it will not turn itself off. Therefore, any time the doorbell is activated the screen stays on at the full volume. Very annoying especially if you’ve been gone and come back and it’s still on so we turned it off.

Further, you have to talk extremely fast for it to not interrupt and answer with something else that you didn’t ask about (Even if you keep your question short). Trying to get it to play some music is ridiculous if you’re trying to say the album and the name of the artist.

If you want an expensive screensaver, that’s very basic and not user-friendly that’s all you really get. Would definitely not recommend to anyone. It’s a waste of money.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Toney,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2021","I used to be in love with Alexa. The more time passes the worse our relationship has become. And, it’s getting worse every day. I purchased these new devices thinking that the issues we were having would be resolved and that we could rekindle the relationship. Sadly that has not been the case. The devices are frequently unresponsive and mostly respond inaccurately when they do. The follow feature is clunky and does not work at all in dimmed light. Time spend with support is wasted time I’ll never get back and resolved nothing. I absolutely hate this purchase and will be seeking a return. The echo devices are getting dumber, not smarter.

So… I returned these following Amazon’s guidelines immediately following a call from them when this review posted. I tracked the shipping and called on the day they received it. I was told that the refund would be issued and that it could take 3 to 5 days for it to post. Now, it is day 11 and I have not yet received my refund. I called and was told that the refund had not been released, for some reason, but that it was now and that I should expect it within 3 to 5 days. WTF!

Update: so recently my “smart” devices (all Amazon Echos) have started asking “Sorry, what device?” every time any of us make a request. Repeating it exactly the same gets the job done. So I spent a great deal of time chatting with someone who told me that I would have to delete/rename all of my groups and then hard reset all my devices. This is not the first time I’ve run into this. Only before the echo devices simply didn’t recognize the group and did nothing. Now at least it gets it on the second que. Clearly there is something going on with updates. If you marry into the Amazon “smart” world be prepared for a lifetime of wedded grief and frustration.",1.0 out of 5 stars
DPerry,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2021","I preface my review with this information. I have been an avid echo device user since they were released and I've owned and setup dozens of these devices including the 1st, 2nd, and now 3rd gen 10 show. This new device has been so annoying and unsatisfying that we have contemplated ""gifting"" this thing to someone we don't like.

To the review...we have this device setup in the kitchen, replacing the Echo Show 10 2nd gen.

Pros: The screen is large and the speaker sound is good. This is where the pros end.

Cons: I'll list a few of the cons but won't bore you with all.
1. Despite numerous setup wizards and responding to feedback regarding the screen bumping into the wall, the screen continuously bumps into a wall that hasn't moved in the months since I purchased the device.
2. Unlike previous models, this echo show doesn't listen very well. My family has to raise their voices so loud to get the attention of this device that other echo devices in the house respond instead of this one. You either raise your voice beyond what should be expected or you have to repeat commands each time you try to access the device.
3. The camera follow feature is now more entertainment than usable function. The family enjoys watching the screen turn to the opposite of the room when we try to get the show's attention.
4. The Live View camera connection to the Alexa App for iphone\ipad works only occasionally. For comparison, my Wyze cameras respond and can be viewed every time, in the Alexa app. You would think Amazon could get that right with their own app and hardware.

G M Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2023","The idea was great .. 10"" screen Echo with motor drive that causes screen to follow you around the room to keep you in frame.

It could download stuff or advertisements, or push marketing from Amazon, but ask it a question and it would simply respond "" Check your wifi settings, cannot connect""
I rebooted, but no good.. So I went to Amazon (For the first time for a repair), and although it indicated it may be possible to replace a defective unit, there was no link or instructions on how to do so. Search Amazon help, went to all links, but nothing that would allow to send back for repair. While I like Amazon, this may be the last Amazon Product I ever buy. A $250 plus product worthless.

We removed all the junk content that rotates on the screen by default as soon as we set up the devices (Settings > Home Content). However, with this new Sponsored Ads crap – that you cannot opt out of – or remove – we are considering getting rid of all Amazon devices.

Amazon also has begun annoying notification messages that say, “You purchased something from this author before, they have a new book out now, would you like me to buy it now?” This is highly annoying as well. I don’t want notifications to buy crap, nor do I want to see ads on a very expensive device. This device makes me want to unfollow everything on Amazon and never buy anything again on Amazon with all the ads that you cannot stop/remove.

David Casteel,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2022","I went all in with Echo from the beginning and was excited to get the latest version of the ECHO SHOW, despite the cost. I have three other ECHO devices in the house (SHOW 5, DOT and SHOW MINI) and one in the car and the car Echo works way better than the SHOW 10. I've purchased and upgraded a dozen times since Gen 1, sent each of my kids one as they moved out. The SHOW 10 is by far the least intelligent AI I've purchased. Devices that work with other Echos around the house do not work with the SHOW 10. It is VERY slow to respond, much slower than the DOTs or other SHOWS that I own... sometimes I query the SHOW 10, then have to go to another room to get an answer while the SHOW 10 is still thinking. Often, it thinks for a long period, then goes back to showing ads and pictures like it was never invoked. Constant ""The internet is not working"" from this one, so I go ask another fully functioning ECHO device.

Want to get your SHOW 10 to go blank for 5 minutes, then ignore you for 10 or even shut down? Ask it for the Latest News. You'll be lucky to get a weather report.

I can hardly be more disenfranchised with this product. After investing so much into Echo devices, I wish I had gone with Apple Home. Siri doesn't try to tell me jokes, just gets the job done.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Jason,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2021","And now we are down to one star.

I've came to the conclusion that echo show is just an overpriced ad machine. I'm convinced deep in the bowels of Amazon labs (or whatever they call it) scientists are coming up new annoying ways to shoehorn even more advertising into this thing on a daily basis. I honestly keep hoping for this overpriced thing to die so I can justify tossing it in the trash.

Original review below.

So Alexa for your day has completely soured me on the echo show. There is no way to disable it and turning off continuous rotation in the options (what amazon suggests to remove/reduce it) just makes it appear more. It's been going strong for the last 20 minutes as i add this update.

Look I get that Alexa can do all kinds of stuff I don't need a dedicated slide telling me to ask different things. I won't be recommending or buying another echo show until something is done about it.

Original, original review below

I'd say this echo show is just okay for the price. It is nice to have the 10"" screen in our kitchen to replace the previous 5"" show.

I don't like how the screen feels unstable when you touch it or how the motion feature will place the screen off center because of the camera placement. I turned the feature off the first day I had it.

Why is there a full screen slide called ""Alexa for your day"" that you can't turn off? It's like Amazon wanted a more annoying option than the ""try"" banner they put at the bottom of every slide. Ironically it's the only slide that doesn't include the ""try"" banner.

Overall all I'm happy with the purchase but annoyed by the bloat especially at this price point.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Ron in Florida,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2021","With great hopes & expectations, I packaged up my old Show and shipped it to a family member. A most important feature, for me, was the ability of the new Echo Show 10 to remotely access its camera and get a live view of the inside of our home. Tirelessly, I’ve opened my phone app, selected Devices, chose Cameras, and then selected my brand new Echo Show 10. The accompanying photo shows what it’s response. This happens every time, without exception! I could live with its intermittent following, but this failure is inexcusable. My plans to subscribe to Amazon’s Guard Plus are out the window. If it’s not going to let me view the interior of my home, there’s surely no reason to waste additional money.
Update (Same Day): Upon posting my review, I received an email regarding my problem. A call was apparently attempted but the phone only rang once & then my answering was not acknowledged. Nonetheless, I was given enough info to enable me to ultimately solve my problem. Better information, on the part of Amazon, could have enabled me to accomplish my goal without registering a negative review to begin with.
I upped my rating from 1 star to 4. It’s definitely a good product, but far better instructions and help info would have prevented the frustration to begin with, and a 5 star rating might have occurred.
Update: 8/29/21 My wife, who seldom listens to what I say, obviously hears better than Alexa. Song or videos begin when a command to turn a light on is giver, or she’ll ignore the amount of time stated when told to start a ten minute timer. It’s getting worse and worse, every day. If didn’t have 13 echoes in the house, I’d be switching to their chief competitor.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Pat Kelly,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2023","I purchased the Alexa 10 Show along with the matching sub wolfer. My objective with this purchase was to have a kitchen computer and stereo that would do Alexa type things but most specifically show recipes and play music. I thought the screen tracking feature would be cool as the screen would move left to right tracking my wife in the kitchen displaying her recipes as she cooked dinner. Also as the kitchen tend to be the primary place in the house for gathering, I wanted a good sound system to play music.
The Show 10 tracking feature isn't great and it often rests itself in a direction that can't be seen. So it tracks but when it looses the person its tracking it doesn't return to center. In my case it tends to stop at all the way left or all the way right, which is typically where someone steps far enough out of sight from
the device. When it does this it impairs your ability to view the screen from a distance and is annoying. I quickly found myself turning this feature off. So this no longer was a selling point of the product.
Next were recipes and the display. So by default Amazon loads this product up with setting that ensure the greatest amount advertisements. At initial setup you have a device that is following you around the room tracking your position displaying ads. Amazon NO ONE WANTS THIS!!! I didn't purchase this device to force feed me ads! To turn this feature off you need to Google it, find the others who thought this was annoying and follow their instruction to change these setting as it isn't straight forward.
OK, now you can upload photos, display some weather and have it display some fun and useful things, on to recipes. My wife likes to find recipes on the web or share recipes with friends. We'll out of the box this product isn't good for that scenario as it doesn't by default have a web browser loaded on it. That's right, again I had to go to the web to figure this one out. You have to go into settings to enable a web browser. OK, did that now back to recipes. By default Alexa wants you to use the recipes from their app. The process is ""Alexa show me oatmeal raisin cookie recipes"" and it brings up their app and gives you some selection. This is fine for many but my wife has specific recipes she likes. To get your personal recipe onto the display you need to download another app, configure it and load your recipes into that app. After this your good to go.
After all this we determined simply moving our laptop into the kitchen for this would have been easier. Even an android or apple tablet would have been easier and more useful. Had we simply purchased a new Android tablet we could have loaded Alexa onto it had we wanted. So as a computer screen, it is sub-par.
Next is the sound system. By itself the Alexa Show 10 has mediocre sound, no bass. We'll thankfully we also purchased the Alexa subwoofer as paired on Amazon Prime. Unfortunately after a couple hours on the phone with Amazon tech support we were never able to get the sub to pair with the Show due to 5GHZ WIFI settings. That's right, the sub doesn't pair via Bluetooth. It has to pair across your WIFI and because we have 5G we were told by Amazon it wouldn't work. So as a kitchen stereo it was inadequate.
So in the end the tracking feature works but not well, the screen works but a tablet or laptop is better and easier. The default configurations don't enable you to do much more then see advertisements and the sound system isn't all that good. I spent many hours setting it up to get it close to what we thought it would be out-of-the-box and turned off features I thought initially were selling points. Additionally not getting the sound system to work properly due to my WIFI network was super frustrating and disappointing. For my family and what we needed this product to do for us, it failed.",2.0 out of 5 stars
LegoDude,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021","I grabbed this out of curiosity, not need. I had the 2nd gen 10"" show in my great room where this is now sitting, and I also have an 8 and 5"" 2nd gen Show in my bedroom and at the office, so I'm used to all of these. My first gen Show went to my mom's.

Still can't set up with a phone? I had to manually type everything into the screen, wifi, my account, etc. Then it went and found updates, updated itself, and then I had to REDO the same info for my account and such. Very annoying in the age of easy confirmation on my phone for any Amazon activities. They ought to simplify setup so all you have to do is give an email address at the most on the screen, then get a confirmation via your phone or email that you want it to run.

Once that was done, you set up the rotation. You can limit it how far you want it to move in each direction..

Fortunately you can tell it to only rotate for certain activities, since I found far too often it hears something while I'm trying to ask something, and it pivots away from me. It does a decent job of pivoting to where you are if you're talking, but I think other than video calls or video playback, I wanted to leave it stationary. It often doesn't quite center itself back to the ""default"" location anyway, which means I don't see it well from the couch.

And, of course, this setting to ONLY move during video calls or video playback, doesn't work at all. I have that enabled, not the always option, and it still moves all over when people are talking to it for anything else like smart home commands...

Video calls worked well though, and it did a good job of tracking my movement as I walked around the room.

The sound is disappointing though. One of the big hopes I had for this was the base, with NO screen in front of it, may do better sounds out the front, where you would be sitting, rather than relying on reflecting sound off walls and such with the rear facing speakers. But nope, the sound is *NOT* at all improved. To me, music sounds a bit worse actually, not as full sounding, not as good a low end (though the Echo Show 2nd generation wasn't by any means an audiophile's dream). So the fact that this did not improve sound at all is a disappointment at this price point.

Screen is crisp and clear though, and the camera works well. It also has the privacy switch now for people who do NOT want the camera available even if they've disabled things like drop in.

Functionally it's all you'd expect it to be for most functions. Hopefully they tweak the location algorithms so it doesn't seem to hunt for who is speaking with the same jumps it has now.

But for a first attempt of theirs at this tracking option, it's a half pass for their score.

But ultimately I returned it since I was tired of it seeming to ignore my ""default"" angle, and it always ended up tilted off to a side somewhere, so we couldn't see it easily without talking to it and getting it to try to rotate back towards us constantly. Far more annoying than useful.",2.0 out of 5 stars

2. Netflix si reproduce como app pero me costo muchísimo saber como ejecutarla, es lenta
3. Todas las demás apps Streamig son por Web no tiene app
4. Si ves Netflix y pones un temporizador tendrás un problema cuando termine, se congela y no funciona, deberás desconectar el alexa y reiniciar
5. Es un aparato super lento, se congela, la he desconectado 4 veces en una semana, porque se congela
6. No es muy funcionable, no pudes poner gadget en pantalla así como listas o un calendario
7. Su pantalla móvil si te sigue es cierto, pero muchas veces se pierde o queda perdida, no es muy funcional
8. La calidad de pantalla no es muy buena es como que tengas una tablet de las primeras que salieron
9. Esperaba un sonido mejor, claro tiene mejor calidad de sonido que sus anteriores alexas, pero esperaba más
10. No tiene botón de volver a inicio, esto es útil porque a cada rato se congela
11. Las aplicaciones son muy pero muy básicas, prácticamente no puedes hacer nada en sus aplicaciones

Lo bueno
1. Se ve bonita estéticamente
2. su sonido es decente, pero no es ultra bueno, lo catalogo 4/10

Si quiere algo funcional para ver TV o escuchar musica, comprate una tablet de buena calidad con un soporte y parlantes Bluetooth, yo tenia eso y estaba mejor

Si quieres algo estético para que se vea bonito y decorar compra Alexa

FTB,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021","The new echo show 10 is pretty cool at first. It does exactly what it says it does. There are things it does well, and a few things that are in my opinion, unforgivable flaws.

Pros:
- A physical camera shutter that blocks the lens for privacy
- Motion swivel allows you to glance at more information from anywhere in the room (weather, security cam etc.)
- Allows custom photos for the background
- Electronic mic disconnect for privacy
- Can turn to face you when asking questions (what's the weather?)

Cons
- White power cord with black device? This is just bad design/no attention to detail.
- The camera shutter/blocker on the black device is white, making it look like a cheap sticker on the black bezel.
- Glitchy UI... most aspects of the user interface is responsive, except it takes multiple taps to go back a page.
- For those who are planning to use this as a smart photo frame, this is implemented poorly. There are no settings for how long to display each photo. No custom captions for each photo.
- Regardless of what you set the background to (nature photos, travel photos, custom photos), it rotates through photos but every other photo it rotates through, you are greeted with a page ""Alexa for Your Days"". The page is just full of ""things to try to ask Alexa"". This page is entirely unnecessary, obtrusive, and impossible to disable within the settings.
- The motion swivel feature works by tracking a person with the front facing camera. However, the camera is offset to the right side of the display...so relative to the camera frame, you appear to be farther left than you are if you get close. This results in the display turning too far left any time you want to touch the screen. This is a very bad design overlook (attached photo shows how far left the display turns when you get close to it). The easy solution is to put the front facing camera in the direct middle, where the microphone is. If you put to camera module to the right side of the display, it will swivel relative to your position facing the camera, not the display. I have no idea why they didn’t catch this problem before release. It’s like the hardware department and software department never even talked to each other in development of this product.

The last two cons are what made me take off 2 stars. Most of this device is really well thought out, except for two very annoying and obnoxious flaws that should have been thought of when this product went under testing by developers. Similarly to almost all Amazon devices, unnecessary information is thrust upon you in its user interface in the worst way possible.

Echo dot/speakers - If you ask Alexa a question, she'll sometimes follow up with unwanted suggestions on things to try asking it. No way to disable this.

Fire TV - Permanent Ads in the user interface/home that break up all your App rows. The ads are obnoxiously inserted in between all your applications, clutters the home menu and slows down the device as it tries to load 1 billion ads as you scroll. Again, no way to disable this... or even pay to remove ads.

Echo Show series - Every Echo show product has a variation of ""Things to try"" permanently plastered on its homepage. In the previous generation Echo Show 10, it was a tiny line on the bottom of your photos that was not removable. In this new generation Echo Show 10, it has now become an entire rotating constant page of unnecessary and unwanted advice to try Alexa skills or commands. The theme here is Amazon apparently thinks that people like unwanted information obnoxiously inserted in between personal/customized apps, Home Screen, and UI. This is bad design language and anti user-friendly. Makes everything a cluttered mess.

With the ""Alexa for Your Day/Things to try"" page constantly on rotation, it makes the Echo Show 10 feel like a store display model. We get it, we bought it, no need to advertise its abilities on the home screen for all of eternity.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Bryan,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2022","I bought this through the trade-in program. I am sending my Echo Show 8 back to Amazon for a credit toward the cost of this one. I thought I was upgrading, and I am, kind of. Buckle up for this review, it's a roller coaster of emotion.

The screen quality itself is great. It's like a swiveling iPad mini with a pretty amazing speaker attached. From there, though, the ""upgrade"" part is a misnomer.

After about a year of decent connectivity, my Echo Show 8 began giving me issues with video quality while on a drop-in or video call. I assumed that it was possible the hardware was showing its age. The best Amazon support had to offer is to reboot every last thing in the house, perform a blood sacrifice to the WiFi Gods, and say a prayer to St. Bezos for redemption. None of these things worked. At first I thought it was that the feral cat I sacrificed didn't please the WiFi Gods, so I tried using my neighbor's dog. That didn't work either. Rebooting my router, changing the WiFi channel, dancing in my living room naked wearing nothing but a lei, nothing worked. The video has been consistently laggy and pixellated. In addition, the audio began giving me issues as well. Enter new and improved Echo Show 10!

Or not.

I was super excited to get this, now I had something that would follow my face around the kitchen while I made futile attempts at cooking something gourmet. I could use this to make video calls and talk to my long-distance girlfriend and not worry about tying my hands up with my pesky iPhone. I was free to have great quality video AND have my hands free for Xbox sessions!

As soon as I plugged it in I could see the screen quality was much better than the previous 8"" screen I had grown accustomed to, the touch features just felt smoother. Then the first red flag. It dropped wifi 3 times trying to download the initial updates. It was 4 feet from my router. It finally rebooted from the update and...froze on the ""Echo"" screen. I restarted it and crossed my fingers and all 11 of my toes. Finally it booted and I could finish setting it up. But wait, why does this alert say it couldn't connect to the network? How is it shuffling beautiful 1080p images curated from the Amazon photo collection? Odd, but, it works.

So I tried a quick video call to check the quality and say ""Hi"" to the girlfriend. I waved and smiled and then dropped my hand. Then I counted to 5 and watched my visage on the screen finally do the same. Her reply made her look like she was dancing the robot, only I didn't hear any techno music in the background.

I am running a Nighthawk router that gives all of my other devices pure, unadulterated high-speed inter webs. I can stream 4k at 120hz to my television, I can play Xbox without lag and single digit pings. I can download entire movies in mere minutes. Why can't I make a video call with my Echo Show without it looking like an episode of Max Headroom? Why does Amazon refuse to address this wide-spread issue in their support topics and instead insist that somehow everyone on the planet just has a bad internet connection? As much as I like the convenience, I am seriously considering switching my smart home over to Google. At least they don't hide the fact that they are using us as a data mine to accelerate their plans of galactic conquest.",2.0 out of 5 stars
BW,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2024","I'm pretty tech savvy, and when it comes to tech, I typically like the latest and greatest because last years tech can easily be far less advanced.

When this device came out, I figured this would be the perfect companion for my kitchen. It's on the floor where I spend most of my time and due to it's size, my other smaller echo devices do better in bedrooms, bathrooms, etc. This floor is also an open concept design, so no other room is closed off to the kitchen.

At first, I was relatively happy with it. It did all the basic things an echo should do and it had a nice big screen to see the widgets and whatever skill you wanted to use. Over time, I've found that 99% of the time I'm using it to control the other smart devices in my home. The suggestions it makes are pretty useless, and I've found that it is more or less frustrating to use when trying to display a recipe or whatnot.

Also over time, it has become increasingly unresponsive when I tell it to do anything. It'll either not hear me and I end up having to yell from 20 feet away, or it'll wake but it will just think about what I've said and not understand or basically ignore what I've said. I've done a number of factory resets, retrained it to my voice, etc. This really doesn't seem to help at all. So, now... It's just taking up counter space in my kitchen and it does (sometimes) the same basic commands an echo dot would do.

I've really come to expect more from Amazons tech here. In today's day and age, this thing seems super basic and outdated compared to what new AI technology can do and Amazon should be a frontrunner to deploy something better than this piece of junk. They better come up with something fast, because Samsung and Google like to work together and if Samsung starts deploying a home assistant with Samsung tech and Google as it's assistant, Amazon doesn't have a chance.",2.0 out of 5 stars
FGSouza,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2024","I purchased the Echo Show and have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, I appreciate the sound and image quality, and its integration with other Alexa speakers is seamless. It's functional for audio, recipes, weather, and news.

However, some of the content itself is quite uninteresting (such as the polls), and the **advertisements** are a major annoyance for me. Lately, the ads have been showing more frequently, turning my Echo Show into a billboard in my kitchen. Despite repeatedly asking to not show certain ads, they persist. What's even more frustrating is that when I approach the screen to interact with the content (to press the unlike button), the ad immediately disappears, jumping to another screen without giving me the chance to dislike it.

I've tried unchecking options in the setup to reduce ads, but nothing seems to work. This issue with the advertisements is the main factor behind my disappointment and lower rating. If you don't mind having a billboard in your home, go for it.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Mark Masaki,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2023","New update, this turning Echo Show device suddenly lost its ability to connect to the WiFi. I tried everything and it still says out of range, but the other 20 smart devices in our home work fine. Unfortunately the tech support was of no help either. New technology can be interesting. While it worked for (for about half a year) the thing could turn its screen around and follow your every movement. Sounds Orwellian, but I figured whomever wants to waste their time to spy on me has to be crazy; Nothing to see here anyway, lol. I set mine to face the screen at me only when I say the waking word. It has issues following you in low light conditions and will tell you so when it does, which can be irritating from time to time. If I want privacy I can use the camera lens blocker, which is basically a thin plastic panel that shifts to cover the camera lens. I don’t think the audible privacy is a possibility but if I cared about that, I wouldn’t have a cell phone either. For the microphone issues, my other Echo devices sometimes answer for this Echo Show instead, and that can be annoying when you are asking to see or watch something in particular. Most annoying is when Alexa is telling you from a regular Echo that she does not have the capability to do “that” on this device. Nothing like a smart home device giving you a “Duh” moment. Positioning for acoustics while maintaining view ability can be quite challenging given the limited power cord and Wifi limitations in the average household, mine included. The sound though, was amazing; I could feel the power in the vibrations it exudes, as well as hear the crisp sound quality from the somewhat heavy cylindrical base that the screen rotates around. The touchscreen is kind of like a tablet, just not nearly as quick in reacting to tapping or swiping. In conclusion, I think this will improve with time, and for the money I spent on it, that was forgivable (at one third the cost of my iPad Air, this refurbished unit was a steal, at the time, though currently it is a paper weight). I don’t watch TV in my household and we don’t have to pay for cable service, so this was really the only thing we had besides our cell phones for viewing entertainment and getting the news, so for what it is worth, my family appreciated what it had to offer while it lasted. I cannot give this more than 2 stars due to the fact that no device I have ever possessed had “forgot” how to connect to WiFi.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Chas Brightly,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2023","This amazing device can have the volume turned to zero... for 2 seconds. Every time someone says Alexa (here or on in a Zoom call from across the country) the device swivels to look for them AND turns the volume up, creating instant feedback if using this as a second camera (which I do) from the main screen. I have to create routines replacing every action with one to do the action and then change volume to 0 on the device 5 seconds later. And it forgets to do this about 60% of the time. The rest of the time it works, and then resets the volume to 3.

Yes, it has been muted. Yes, it happens when I mute the device via phone app or the buttons or the on-screen controls. Yes, I did a factory reset. Yes I Googled. This is my third Show, the problem is in the software and is specific to this device. Whenever it needs to beep (the beeps are turned off!) the volume turns up at level 3 and stays there. No matter what. The minus volume button actually won't take it below 3 at all. In the app it's kind of amazing, you can turn it down and watch the bar actually slip back up to volume 3 regardless of how many times you pull it to 0.

The Echo Show 8 this replaced worked perfectly. This device, when told to connect to a Zoom meeting says ""try this on a zoom compatible device."" Nice. You have to tell it to ""open zoom"" instead. The Show 8 could actually join a meeting with a meeting code directly by voice command. We're moving backwards.

In case you think the fix to this is not talking to is, the device also turns the volume up randomly when making awful suggestions for what things I should buy WHILE I'm in the call, covering half the screen with a ""buy pasta now?"" popup. The only way to close it is to walk up to the screen and close it out, which also turns up the volume. Nice.

I also have a routine to turn off ""by the way"" suggestions daily, but this device doesn't care that I've specifically ordered it to NOT do that.

If you don't want to ever mute your device and just want a cool screen that follows you around, and you could get this under $99, there might be a use-case for you. Otherwise, get an Echo Show 1 from Woot for $25 to view your doorbell or view recipes. It takes up less room and can be forced into silence.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Caleb Evenson,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2022","The idea is very cool. My wife is an amazing cook and is always using her phone to follow her recipes/notes. I thought it would be great for her to be able to have recipes displayed for her on a large screen and scroll automatically without touching it with her flour covered fingers. Not to mention, we’re big sports fans so being able to watch a game while she was cooking meant she wouldn’t miss all the big plays. Or, listen to music while cooking.
The reality of how the Echo Show 10 operates is a completely different story.
The first thing my wife did was ask it to show recipes for “chili”. It pulled up TWO recipes. That’s it. We realized very quickly that the only recipes it will scroll and read out loud are VERY limited. And NOT from Pinterest. Yes, you can find other recipes from Food Network and a couple other places, but only using those respective apps. And it won’t read them or auto scroll.

Ok, we’ll figure out how to just use the Pinterest app.
And then it kept freezing. Wouldn’t scroll when looking through Pinterest. And the motion kept freezing and resetting. Then it forced closed the Pinterest app. Then it said “motion offline. Reset the device.”. Over and over.

Can’t watch a game unless it’s streaming on Prime. YouTube app works, but can’t use YouTube TV.
ESPN radio works, but can’t watch games.
“Silk”, Amazon’s version of a “browser”, is very limited.

While using the Pinterest app to follow a recipe, my wife asked the Show to play music. It closed the Pinterest app and opened music and she had to completely reload Pinterest and go find the recipe she was using. There is no switching between two functions, let alone finding a game to watch and switching back and forth. If we could even watch a game in the first place. Which we can’t.

The CONSTANT stupid ads is unbearable. And no way to shut them off.

Asking it to show us a security camera was cool, but it took FOREVER to load the picture. And we have the best internet available and the best modem/router on the market. So it’s not that.

I’m sure this thing is fine as a novelty…watch some YouTube videos, drop in on friends/family that have a Show as well.
But all the other functions can be done on a Dot. Ie: set a timer, add an item to your shopping list, play music, etc…
For what we wanted it for, it isn’t worth it.

We have an extra iPad. Going to get a stand for it and have it semi-permanent in the kitchen.
It will do everything we wanted in the first place, and more, and better.
Except follow you. And who cares. You can have that.

DaytonaDan,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2023","I have owned a lot of Echo devices over the years and this one is definitly the worst of the bunch. The worst setup experience of any Amazon device I have ever owned.
It was a mess straight out of the box, despite the whole ""online setup"" thing, which would be a good idea if it worked. It did not, at least not very well. After attempting to update on startup, which took forever, it crashed, or said it did. Blaming a ""network error."" Which I knew was BS (I have an Amazon eero mesh wifi 6 system) . I told it to continue and then went into my alexa app on my phone and saw it was listed. Once I clicked on it there, it magically completed its update and came up but still had major issues.
The biggest was its refusal to play any music. Just a long silence followed by ""I am having trouble connecting to Amazon music..."" All my other echo devices were working fine. I spent several days attempting to fix this with reboots and option changes, with no success.
I finally resorted to a factory reset. That resulted in yet another slow boot and update and forced me to manually enter wifi network and account info.... but it finally came up And music finally worked for unknown reasons. The new speaker arrangement on this device , another supposed major improvement, was OK but nothing special in my view.
As for the ""smart motion"" thing, the major new gimmick with this model... it's a waste of time too in my view. Loses track of you if you are too close and move to quickly, like when sitting down in a chair next the Echo 10. then it is facing the wrong way and you manually have to turn the screen to face you. Sort of defeats the purpose. So best just to turn it off.
If I had not bought this on sale when it was heavily discounted, I almost certainly would have returned it right away. But will give it a little more time in hopes I will find something to like about it.
Still, I would advise everyone else to save yourself some grief (and a ton of money) and go with the 8 inch model, which is far more solid. I have several of those and have never had any problem with them.",2.0 out of 5 stars
a_yu,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024","The wifi stopped working on the device 3 years after purchase. Amazon said the device was outside of the 1 year warranty and offered a 15% discount on purchase of a new one.

Because the price had increased to $250, the device was actually more expensive to purchase the 2nd time even with the discount. I would not pay more for a 2nd device that originally broke on its own.

Even if I considered buying this again, I have no confidence that the device will not break again.

With my experience on this device, I'm not buying anymore Echo devices (I think a simple kitchen timer is sufficient and will last longer).

BigBurton1,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2024",This is literally the first Amazon Alexa device that I have owned. I originally owned Google home and switched to the Alexa because everyone I knew claimed that it was so much better and that she was much better at listening and following directions. I have had nothing but constant issues with Alexa for the past 3 months of ownership. There are three people in the household and no matter who asks her to play Spotify or Pandora she will not play. Today I asked her to play songs nine times in a row and not once did anything turn on and play. We have had to unplug and master reset this device multiple times. We have had to install an uninstall Amazon Alexa on our cell phones. I'm not necessarily sure what the point of owning the device is because it doesn't do half of what I ask it to do. I'm frustrated to the point where I would like to throw this thing in the middle of the street and drive over it with my car 10 or 15 times?!! Basically I think it's only achievement is listening to everything that happens in the house and storing all of that information for the government to review.

Connectivity to other applications is nearly impossible and very difficult to get it to play a specific playlist. It always seems to display ads and you can’t seem to get it to only roll through your pictures. The Alexa app is not very intuitive, even for me (I work in cybersecurity) I use tech all day long.

Sally,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2021","Still in the “bugs” stage. One great bonus I’d like to report is that Amazon tech assistance program is EXCELLENT. Informed & responsive, not to forget to mention , empathetic!

Now down to review of Alexas skills!

‘Motion was erratic’ & did not sync with my locations. Even a factory reset with tech did not fix. Finally just turned that skill off! Too maddening to have to continue to instruct Alexa to follow me, as the screen wandered around its orbit, seemingly at will. Commands to Alexa were followed erroneously. Grrrrhh!

Another skill needing tweaking was in the movie watching. Movies came with ads. After the break for an ad, the movie would not resume, although a blurb said ‘movie will resume after the ad’. Yep another call to tech. They said ‘Now it should be fixed’. No idea what ‘solution’ they intended to employ. Having already gotten the erroneous info from ‘motion tech’ that the motion prob was fixed, when in fact it was not, I requested the ‘ad, resume movie’ tech to stay in the line while I did a check run. Twice! No fix. So, you guessed it, no ability to watch a movie from start to finish. I spent hours trying to fast forward the movie past the ad, then came another pesky ad. And another case of ‘no movie resume’. Hmmmm. I finally quit trying to watch movies.

Last identified bug so far was dear Alexa, if I asked for the weather, she would say. “Hmmm, I don’t know that”. If I asked for a certain track She had just played, she would say “I don’t know that. Here’s a selection you might enjoy.”. More times than I care to report, she was lost in space!

Oh yes. Then there was the the surprise that the ‘relaxation sounds’ tracks ran for about 45 Sec. They would not loop! Alexa kindly offered to let me have a free trial of a PAID SERVICE REQUIRED to get a 10 hour loop!

What is free? What skills operate as required & requested?

When volume was high, I had to yell to Alexa to get her to hear me. My Alexa on my Bose Soundbar system has enough sensitive microphones built in that she can hear you and responds to commands at very high volume. Spoiled by a skill that works!

I’m weary of reporting bugs. I actually speak to Alexa in an unfriendly tone, cause I am crazy enough to think she can do better if she’d just focus. Lol!

In fact what I bought Alexa for, does not function to a degree that it’s useable. I have only 30 days to return it. I don’t WANT to return it, but it’s a long way from having bugs fixed! I’m not sure an update WILL fix these serious bugs. At least not in 30 days.

I have read many a reviewer’s lament (not about Alexa or Echo Show 10 3rd Gen) that they are now stuck with unsatisfactorily working techie toys they knew had bugs. I think I won’t join that crowd.

Get crankin Amazon! Give us a long return window on newly offered bells& whistles, to HELP YOU fix the issues they have. I’m doing the work of isolating bugs & reporting them to your technical department! Cut me some slack!

Thanks! I have great faith in Amazon products. I intellectually know they bugs fixes are coming, but I emotionally do not want to ‘hang in there’ for an unknown period of time.

I think I’ll take this up with the technical department., which I repeat is EXCELLENT! !",2.0 out of 5 stars
Ben,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","Short version:

It's a minimal viable product that's trying to do too many things, most of which it does not do well and are of no value to Echo users. The few things you want it to do e.g. pictures and display the music you are playing through a Sonos device, it does a very mediocre job at best.

Long version:

I've been excited about the Echo Show 10 since Amazon announced it last Fall. I grew concerned that they delayed launch until after Christmas, making me think they didn't have the kinks worked out. Overall, it's a nice looking device from Amazon, but far from earth-shattering. It's beyond annoying how basic it is. Let's face it, it's a more focused UI on a Fire tablet, glued to an Echo. I feel a lot of people giving reviews here have very low expectations and/or never saw other comparable devices before.

Pros:
- The screen is nice... it's the first thing you notice
- The security camera function is a plus
- Seems sturdy

Cons:
- Amazon forces you to view an ""Alexa for Your Day"" screen (not being able to turn this off is enough for me to not buy another Echo Show 10... It is beyond ridiculous that Amazon would force their loyal customers to have this bloatware on their devices). All I wanted this device for is to show me the weather and photos of my family!!! That's it!
- The main thing people likely buy the device for (display photos) Amazon relies heavily on the user for how they look. In other words, you have to crop them to horizontal view or else Amazon throws up a funky looking buffer on both sides. Probably more annoying is that it feels like the pictures are random. It's the same order (my experience linking to an album with over 550 pictures). And, the pictures are random on how long they stay on the screen. I'd like to think Amazon can put together a better photo software program for Shows than whatever this is. Most of us use them to see pictures of our family, and easily share with our parents (our kids' grandparents). Hence, why it would be great to have better control of the device for showing said pictures.
- The Show 10 doesn't display what's playing for music when it's playing through my Sonos device/other speakers.
- The screen goes dark whenever the room goes dark and from what I can tell there's not way to change that. It would be nice to have the Show 10 show pictures when I watch TV or a movie, which 80% of the time is at night when the room is dark (for effect). If it's in a dim room the device goes dark after awhile if it's quiet. Again, no way to change that from what I can tell.

I'm really hoping for a Software Update soon that gives users more control. It's so disheartening to see the same tired ""Alexa for Your Day"" suggestions come up constantly like I'm in Groundhog's Day. Again, I just want this to feature photos of my family, the weather, and communicate to my elderly parents who want the same. Overtime I could see myself adding News and Stocks. I would also love to have my security cameras part of the Show 10's rotation.",2.0 out of 5 stars

PAPA.AMG,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2023","I have owned Alexa devices for years now. With this most recent purchase I wanted to put it through it's paces for a several months - now 8 months, before leaving a review.

To sum it up, Alexa as a whole is a huge letdown. Very basic questions cannot be answered as Alexa does not know. Yet, with Google or SRI, they can. How is it Amazon has not made any customer facing improvements? It is just a basic search engine, nothing more.

It is slow connecting to cameras, loses internet from time to time, even though with over 50 devices in the house, this is the only one to drop connection.

Then, it suppose to move to your voice, perhaps 70% accurate at best, or put another way, 30% or more not accurate.

Then, it does not pick up my voice at times and I have to raise my voice, unlike other Alexa devices that do pickup my voice.

It just does not help my everyday life, more a gimmick. My Samsung S23 Ultra and Iphone 15 Pro, those help me throughout the day. They actually bring value to my life, making it easier, finding answers. Alexa, nope.

The basic infrastructure of Alexa is so behind, no AI whatsoever, no 'assistant' features. This is why I canceled my Astro order, it provides me nothing of real tangible value.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Ed Evans,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2024","As a basic Echo device, it works fine. The screen is nice enough as is the sound. The poblems, however, outweigh the positives on this device.

1. Camera connectivity - I wanted to use this to check in on my house while I was away for a few days. Well, sometimes it worked and other times it didn't. I had someone reboot the device for me and it seemed to work for a short while. It's just not reliable as a camera. Conversely, some of the inexpensive dedicated security cameras I bought at the same time worked flawlessly. When the camera did work, it was SUPER laggy when I would rotate it using the Alexa app.

2. Screen content - Geez, I didn't buy this device so that you could try to sell me more stuff. The type of content that shows up on the screen should be 100% customizable and I shouldn't have to put up with ads. Maybe there's an option that I haven't found yet. But, please hear this Amazon, you are not nearly as customer obsessed as you say you are if you don't give us 100% control over the content.

3. Performance - The device just seems underpowered. Any kind of network call / commands don't work as well as they should.

Overall, this feels like a fairly polished prototype - not a product that was ready to deliver to customers.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Kevin S McKee,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2023","My wife wanted this as a device to use in the kitchen for recipes and watching videos. As we have used it over the months, I have turned off more and more features until it is now functioning like an Echo Dot.

- Rotation - You need a flat space at least 2ftx2ft where NO ONE will set anything else. Otherwise, the Show will stop at an odd angle with an error that it bumped into something, waiting for you to reset it. Motion is now turned off.

- Screensaver content - It will default to screensaver content that will feel invasive. I selected the folders of pictures that I wanted to show. But it also will show pictures ""on this day"". These may be anything: pictures of checks, drivers licenses, screenshots, medical procedures. I had to search through the menus, and then reset the Show to turn this feature off.

- Video - The only native options are Prime, Hulu, and Netflix. We use a lot of Youtube TV, HBOMax, and Apple TV. These only work through the Silk browser which requires using the touch screen. The Show is much less responsive than a Fire tablet, and because the screen rotates you need to hold it still while you try to get the touchscreen to respond. And the Silk browser kinda sucks. So, we do not watch videos.

-Recipes - This is a mixed bag. The biggest problem is that Alexa can't understand us while the kitchen fan is going. It's not that loud, but we need to turn it off to get her to respond. And when we ask for a recipe, the results are very inconsistent. We end up using the Silk browser, which as I stated before, sucks.

So, it's a pretty good Echo and we use it for setting timers and playing music. But I find it infuriating as a Show, and would not recommend.",2.0 out of 5 stars

There has been some bugs where I turn motion off and it still moves working in the kitchen. Sadly, it doesn’t allow you to stream on several platforms, e.g., HBO, Vudu, Paramount. The home screen is not the most user-friendly or intuitive. I bought this on sale but noooo way I would buy this at MSRP.

Update: returned this immediately. When I was FaceTime in with family, the stream was quite poor, compared to my FaceTime. And then it had the audacity to throw up an advertisement during my FaceTime. I was very disappointed in the user interface. You cannot download mini apps and it restricts what you can do. There are some things you can’t change without voice to Alexa. It repeatedly tried to find ways to shut off my setting to send data to their company even though I had it turned off. There was probably 50 settings for home content that I had to turn off, many of which were ads and/or funneling you to buy more things on Amazon. To me, it seems more like an ad machine and I would recommend this. Could’ve been a great device and they missed the mark.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Michael B,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2021","I bought 4 of these for my family so we could video call each other. They do not come with instructions so that is a big frustration. None of us feel the product is worth the money and the we expected more. I would say this is the dumbest of all our Alexa devides (and I have 5 echo dots and 1 Echo show). Perhaps it's video aspect of the echo show that slows it down -- but she has difficulty matching the prowess of the echo dot. The screen is great and the ability to have the Echo Show display uploaded pictures is fabulous. So many good memories scroll by. That said, it's wretched at filming us during video calls. It moves in weird ways and does not capture us well. We often move to sit in front of it -- and that defeats the purpose of the Echo Show which is supposed to follow us as we speak. It does follow but it generally zooms out so we're very small in the video call. We cannot figure out how to get the Echo Show to zoom in on us -- and responds saying she cannot zoom when we ask her to do it. That said, we watch the Echo show zoom in and out on us as it tries to figure out how to best film us -- so it ""can"" zoom in and out. This goes back to the lack of documentation on what the Echo Show can do. All 4 families have agreed it is not worth the money but returning all 4 would be difficult because they're spread out across the continental US. So... while I've decided to not return them, yesterday my daughter called me via Google Duo on her smart phone -- and we used an iPad. That's sad and unfortunate. My hope is that Amazon updates the Echo Show's software and we get a better product as a result. Until then, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend the Echo Show 10 as something someone should buy. Also, my wife is frustrated that the Echo Show does not have a battery that allows it to be somewhere without an AC adapter. Without a battery, it cannot be moved without having to reboot -- so it's not something you can just move around.

Lastly, Amazon allowed us to pre-buy the Echo Show and gave us a $100 discount if I bought a second one. It would not give me a discount however, if I bought 4 -- so I had to have my wife buy 2 and I bought 2. Why make me do that Amazon? Just give me $100 of for every two I buy -- whether it's 2, 4, 6, or 8.

Anna C.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2023","I’d give a one star but the only good thing is the sound quality. We’ve had the Alexa Echo Show for 5 months exactly. The first month or two it was really good, we loved it. It took me awhile to get used to it because it absolutely does not have the better qualities of the Google home. After that it started “glitching.” We’d have to ask it multiple times to do a task, it would just show the blue line at the bottom and say that it didn’t hear us or it couldn’t process the request, even if we were standing right it front of it yelling (you all know what we’re talking about). We listen to music a lot on the device and now maybe 85% of the time we ask and it says it’s going to play but then nothing happens. We have unplug it and troubleshoot at least 1-3 times per day. If we ask it a question it rarely even pulls up an answer or says “hm, I can’t help with that.” It’s horrible. For the amount of money you have to spend on this, you’d think that it would be far more superior that the Google hub that is almost half the price. Honestly what the point of spending the amount on this product. It’s the same with the Echo dots. We spent $400 on all these devices and it has done nothing but give us headaches. The only maybe good thing is that when it does decide to play music, the sound quality is good.

- wayy too often and not configurable amount of times they occur weather alerts (one can turn them off entirely or suffer)
- settings don’t persist - at least the ones that reduce Amazon’s annoying ads (don’t they get money *anywhere else?!

awesomity,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2021","The rotating hardware is fun. It only makes sense if you plan to place this device on an island. The screen quality is fine. Sound quality is good. The user experience is poor. This is my first Alexa device. I am so underwhelmed by the user experience. My kids keep complaining my did I get this dumb device. They have the Google assistant in their rooms.

User experience:
- Poor voice recognition. If room is slightly noisy, Alexa just will hear made up things.
- Alexa does not understand, guesses what the user wants and provides annoying user experience. Something simple like ""stop music"", can randomly result with some Netflix movie.
- Alexa assumes shopping intent for too often and for ridiculous commands. Feels like a pushy salesman. Shopping experience is mediocre. I order dog food once. You get a few options but Alexa failed to specify two weeks shipping. Dog could not wait.
- Alexa handle poorly doing two things at once. If it's playing music and I ask a general knowledge question. The UI will flash the answer for a split second. The voice answer somethings works.
- Alexa has a hard time switching context. If a game is playing Alexa can't do much else.
- Alexa gets stuck in an experience. It's difficult to exit it. It took awhile to learn to say ""home screen"" to exit. Sometime there is a glitch that the screen freezes, you can still see the previous experience but Alexa doesn't know about it.
- Poor smart home integration (might not be Alexa's fault), for example Waze doorbell shows a rotated video.
- Non-existing integration with popular services, like zoom conferencing, chat apps and photo services.

What works?
- Very very simple things and very specific features.
- Play music usually works, though somethings ends up in Netflix.
- Take photo is fun. Though can't delete photo. A real pain to find out to delete it using a computer.
- Drop-in works and respects video privacy.
- Used as a remote security. Very basic user experience. Could have need much better.
- Remind me ____. Works well.
- Alarm works, and time works as expected.
- News is OK.
- A few games are nice.

Joshua R Moore,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2021","To start with, anyone with any sort of vision problems might want to stay away. The first thing they did was shrink all of the fonts so everything is extra tiny on this one. So what if it covers my damn pictures. It’s not meant as a photo frame. Even with photos off the text is ultra tiny and only on outer edges of the screen. Anyone who complained about text on the echo show covering their pictures need to buy an Amazon photo frame or something
Second, they’ve got this annoying hyperactive adaptive brightness feature that can be a pain to turn off that if you just look away for one second, turn the brightness down all the way.
Third the adaptive color. Yuck.
I have used the echo show line since it came out and I’ve been very happy with it the previous models the font size has been perfect. This one however, they decided that all people are going to sit on top of it so we can shrink the font down. Amazon that isn’t the case I know at least for me I like to sit a little bit across the room from it I don’t sit on top of it which brings me to the next failure. The motorized screen is very nice and it does a nice job of following. But it is overly overly codependent on asking you if it moved correctly for you but the problem with this is? It asks You in an on screen prompt that slides in from the side that you have to walk over to the device and click on it and it’s in a very small font and it covers up what you’re trying to do very annoying. It be nice if Alexa would just ask you she hashe had done what you wanted her to do, Like she does on other things. Nope they have this annoying slide over panel in a small font that you have to walk over to it and click to get it dismiss it off the screen how wonderful Amazon and you had how long to designe the software?. Is designing software that difficult from home? ( no, it isn’t )
I can’t help but be disappointed after spending $250 on what I was sure was going to be another slam dunk excellent Amazon device when it just seems like it was half baked. Small fonts, hyperactive adaptive brightness, on-screen prompts from Alexa asking you if she had move the way you wanted her to that you have to dismiss with a finger click.

Nerd_iNC,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2021","We have an echo dot and it has been useful for playing music, setting alarms and finding out quick information. So When I saw the echo show and watched the reviews I was thrilled to get one.
All the reviews I watched were false, Echo show is worse than echo dot. Hard to believe?

Lets me start with the good part,
-The screen is great. Picture quality is really good.
-The sound quality is really really good and loud.
-The follow feature is pretty nice. I used it when making breakfast and was trying to watch a Netflix show.
-And did you know you can also attend WebEx and zoom calls? Those are really good features.

That's where the good stuff ends.
-The follow feature is slow to react and it never faces me. The camera was always pointing at my left shoulder.
-Alexa does understand simple voice commands but not anything complex. For simple commands Alexa works great, but when you ask something like ""Are blue berries safe for dogs"", she does a bing search and never really answers the question. I have to look at the screen for the search results. I could have just googled myself, which I did and google gave me the answer and I didn't have to look at the screen or the results.

-Echo Show is also slow to respond and misunderstand some commands;
""Alexa play newsy""; ""Playing Music from your amazon playlist""
-When watching a news channel, ""Alexa Stop"" ""Alexa pause"" ""Alexa close"" ""Alexa shutdown"" don't work, I found that ""Alexa cancel"" works. I am not sure why I need to cancel the news feed, but ok.

If you try something like play ABC or CNN those work immediately, maybe its a preference or I guess selective hearing? The above test was done after the news channels were added to the Alexa app and I had customized the settings.

-Another thing it does, is when I am watching a video like news or Netflix, Echo show will either freeze or just stop the video and switch to the home screen.

It has become so frustrating using Echo show that I just stopped using it for the past few days and use my phone to do everything else. Its is so bad that I would prefer just using a simple android tablet that costs less than half and it will do everything I need and more.

For me this product is a worth the money and I am surprised many people like it.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Lyn,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2022","I have a couple Echo devices, and was really excited to add a Show to the mix. The drop-in calling is great, full stop. I can chat remotely with my wife while she cooks dinner, and it keeps her in frame. No more staring at the ceiling and wondering where she went.

That's about where ""great"" ends and the problems start stacking up. Let me be clear: I have owned this thing for 3 days and already have a list of dealbreakers. It's hard to believe I'm this disappointed so soon.

1. Live view doesn't work. I was under the impression I was getting a bonus indoor security camera of sorts, but no. The Alexa app appears to connect, sound plays -- I can even MOVE THE CAMERA -- but the video feed is black. Like I said above, the video feed in the ""drop-in"" feature works... so what's the deal? People have been complaining about this issue for a YEAR now, with no resolution.

2. You know what would be cool? Is if you could listen to music while following a recipe in the kitchen. Unfortunately music closes the browser, and the browser turns off the music. There's no workaround. Thanks, Amazon.

3. You know what would be cooler than cool? If the recipe you were following (while not listening to music) stayed open while your hands were full of food and you were busy following said recipe. But it doesn't. The browser times out and kicks back to the home screen after 5-10 minutes (I haven't timed this yet, just cursed at it). People have also been complaining about this for a year, since release. Why would you market this as a kitchen assistant and then make it incompetent at holding a RECIPE?

I really, really love the follow-cam for drop-in. But that's, like... that's it. Just typing this out feels so ridiculous -- these features you'd just assume would work are completely borked. Given that Amazon hasn't fixed them for a YEAR after release doesn't give me much faith that they ever will.

At $250, I'm returning this thing and will be on the hunt for a better solution. Such a bummer.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Mr. Apodaca,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2022","I bought the echo 10 because it intrigued me! I really liked Alexa’s along with the smart plugs etc. but I have noticed this year that they have slowed down and are dumber than the previous years! I have to ask Alexa either 2 or 3 times to turn on the lights or the plugs. Either it doesn’t understand or it just sits there thinking. Frustrating!

Now I possibly return the echo 10 since they haven’t fixed the issue with the iPhone 13 models. As I have uploaded the pictures. When I log in into the Alexa app it doesn’t shows me my devices. Nor does it let me see my security cameras. I have reseted my iPhone hoping it would fix the problem and nothing. I tried using only WiFi and login in the Alexa app but nothing, I have even used my Mobil data to see if it would make a difference but it was un successful. I have informed Amazon about this problem and one of the reps was helping me said that they knew about the problem and I lost connection with him/her, so I decided to try it again the same day and I had a different person and we chatted but i didn’t get no where. In conclusion he told me that the problem was fixed and that he would close the chat.

Well there’s the proof they haven’t fixed the problem with the app. Pictures don’t lie.

Although I can log in onto Alexa app on my android device just fine when I’m at home but it’s annoying that I can’t access the security cameras at the touch of my fingers when I’m away.

Dwight Schrute,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2021","I bought the new Echo Show to put in a bedroom to essentially be a nursery camera and echo device in one, replacing a second generation Echo dot. The screen on this bad boy is no joke.. it is large and impressive. This device is also very heavy if you are like me and read the specs but it doesn’t translate to what the device will actually look like IRL:). Now, seeing how this device isn’t touched by any hands, I have 2 huge problems with it. First, it keeps appearing in “do not disturb” mode. How can this be? There’s no scheduled DND time in the Alexa app, and the room’s occupant can’t talk or reach. Similarly, the motion in the camera is turned “off,” as per the motion icon in the upper right corner with a slash through it. I don’t want it to “follow” anyone - I want to be able to drop in on it from other shows or the app and see the room. Yet half the time, the device has rotated (on its own) to the screen being facing the rear against the wall. Which brings me to another point - why is there such a wide rotating radius on this device? How would one go about using it anywhere except on a counter or tabletop where this would be beneficial? I’ve tried adjusting the base so that it can’t rotate to view the wall, but motion is definitely OFF and yet it keeps moving. Similarly, back to the DND issue, this is the first and only Echo device we’ve ever had where you turn DND off in the app, only for it to turn back on when you then close the app. Finally, this is definitely not a security camera replacement and you cannot just monitor the room without a drop-in. I have yet to see anywhere that I could pano or scan the room, either, which is shown in the video and is misleading. Another reviewer suggests that’s an additional service. While I haven’t verified that aspect, I can say that there’s a camera feature in the app that won’t load the room - but drop in works just fine. All in all, this device has loads of potential. The sound is great. The screen is bright. It’s just not ready for primetime and I’d say it doesn’t work as advertised. Major bummer!",2.0 out of 5 stars
BJC,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2023","While this product does work with many smart home devices, and is probably more diverse in its ecosystem compared to some of its competitors, it fails in so many other ways. one way it feels is definitely in its search capabilities. Compared to one of its popular competitors. It fails miserably. When I search for a particular recipe that seems to be fairly straightforward it often shows me recipes that are not even close to what I requested. As far as the motion capabilities of this device, it needs some work. One particularly annoying thing that I found was that it didn’t seem to center on me when I was speaking to it. It seemed to be a little off-center. And quite frequently I had to call it over to me in order to see the display. Finally, the interface is pretty challenging. While eventually, I could find all of the things that I wanted to find, it wasn’t as intuitive as I would have preferred. I found too often. The screen showed things that I preferred not to see. I just wanted to see the time and the date and a nice wallpaper. Unfortunately, too often it showed news articles and suggestions and other things that I wasn’t at all interested in. While the concept seems like a good one overall, there needs to be a major overhaul on this device before it can compare to its closest competitor.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Alexa itself does seem to work really well. But you can get that form a small Echo Dot that costs a fraction and doesn't spam you 24/7 with advertisements.

Amazon could at least offer a way to stop the advertisements. Even if that is through a paywall.

But, as a writer, I quickly learned that recently, distraction has now become the norm with Echo Show. Pop-Up Ads show up every 5-10 seconds, disrupting my photo collection and my train of thought. And then to integrate Avatar items into responses is annoying as can be! No, I don't want to play all those games you are showing continuously. I've contacted Amazon and was told that they are paid ads and I cannot remove them or refuse them. Does it show your choice of photos all the time? No, more often than not, I get a Blue screen. So, I am no longer a fan because you see, I also have Google Nest in my home, and truth be told, they show my photo collection much sharper, the sound is better when playing music and I have found, much smarter when in need of information, and the best part... NO ADS! NO INTERRUPTIONS! NO TRYING TO SELL YOU ANYTHING. So you make your own choices, but Google also has a sense of humor. I am done with Echo Show.

rp,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2021","For the high price tag I spent on this device, I’m pretty disappointed in its performance. For some reason this Alexa Show really has a much more difficult time hearing us (while we work here in the kitchen), and doesn’t even follow us very well. I also noticed the engineers who designed it got the CALIBRATION wrong - if you allow it to follow you to train the rotation it will be slightly off center at an angle vs flat perpendicular to your body and view. My other Echo Shows work MUCH better than this expensive one. I thought this would be an improvement in addition to being able to rotate the screen. However while the internal speakers are nice, for whatever reason this one just seems a lot less “smart”? The main thing that bugs me the most is it’s a lack of ability to hear us. It also can’t figure out which Alexa we’re talking to and it will trade off between the Alexa in the kitchen and in the family room. When I had my other echo shows in the same exact location, on top of the counter, this never occurred before I got this rotating, expensive echo. My other Echo Shows work better than this expensive one, and my husband also finds the rotation annoying. They should create a facial recognition feature that will allow Alexa users, to program in whether or not they wish to be followed. That way she does not need to follow him as he walks around the kitchen, but will follow myself or anyone else in the household that we don’t exclude that feature from within the Alexa app (again, not a feature I’ve heard of in the works, but a suggestion for consideration.). Most importantly is to get the sound recognition dialed in and also work out the programming bugs - so you don’t have things like two different Alexis alternating their participation to answering a single question. When this happens I try to correct her or even just inquire, asking her, “why are you speaking on the wrong Echo (or Alexa)?”. She always says, “I don’t know that one.”! 😂",2.0 out of 5 stars

My understanding is that AI is advancing, but there’s been a noticeable reduction in Alexa’s voice recognition over the past several months. She doesn’t listen, but rather rambles on. As a computer, she should be capable of listening and talking at the same time to know when to stop.

MB,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2023","Nearly constant ads from Amazon display, which is annoying. After searching for solutions online to stop the ads, I’ve tried unchecking all options on what to display except our photos uploaded to Amazon Photos and it didn’t reduce the amount or length of ads. Even if you ask Alexa to show photo frame, it will display your photos for a short time; but if you ask Alexa any other command (music, turn on / off a smart device, set a timer…), it immediately reverts to showing ads. I would buy more of these Shows to use as digital photo frames (with the additional benefit of another smart speaker) around the house if it weren’t for the constant ads.

Otherwise, the speaker is good; nearly as good as an Echo Plus. And the screen resolution is reasonable. And showing photos is nice—but you pretty much have to ask for it to show photos every time you want to see photos instead of it just shuffling through them, because of the persistent and constant ads.",2.0 out of 5 stars

The Real Reviewer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2023","Bought this a year ago. This is my 5th echo. Unfortunately, not much has changed since the original echo. As more and more features are getting added, existing ones seem to be breaking. The Alexa app itself is so bloated that it's difficult to find what you really need. Routines and integrations work for a few days, but then stop working without any warning because the SSO token needs to be refreshed.
Coming to the device itself - it's completely hard of hearing. Beyond the initial ""Alexa"" command, it fails to comprehend unless someone speaks ONE WORD AT A TIME or moves within a feet of the device and screams at it. Further, it just can't seem to do anything well beyond shopping lists and set reminders. Every few days we have a ""chicken coop"" timer or ""rice poop"" or ""exorcise"" timer. Weather is so wrong most of the time that it's hilarious! It was 102F here and it said 20% possibility of rain. It probably expected me to make a fool of or burn myself.
In addition, It's beyond comprehension why a ""smart"" device improves only with addition of software features. Why can't reminders and timers be smart enough that they recognize how people live? Don't sell smart devices if all you're using their data is to sell them recipes and advertisements.

Seraphine Flores,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","08/24/2021 Updating Review and changing rating to 2 stars: I’m extremely disappointed in this version of the Echo Show. I also have the Echo Show 5 & 8. The reason I’m so disappointed has to do with Alexa’s ability to hear me, especially when music is playing. I literally have to shout out her name….yelling, which strains my voice and is very frustrating, in order for her to hear me. One might think it’s because of the music, but the other echos have no problem hearing me with music playing even at very high volumes. In any case, I will be moving this out of my main area and putting my Echo Show 8 in its place, since it is more consistent, in every way.

I love the picture quality on this new Echo Show. I also love the fact that the clock has a much bigger font than my old Echo Show 8. However, I’m not impressed with the rotation feature. I thought that the Echo Show rotated based on the sound of your voice. But as it turns out, you have to have the camera on as well, in order for it to rotate, which I don’t like because I’m a private person. (The only time I would really want the camera on, is if I’m doing a video call. Otherwise, I want my privacy, so the camera would need to be off. And this means, I would not be able to to use this feature most of the time.) Also when I was trying to use the rotation feature, much of the time it would start to rotate, but then, when I would get to the other side of my kitchen island, it would stop midway, and never make the complete turn to face me.

All in all, I do like it. But again, the rotation feature, is either beyond my comprehension in getting it to work correctly. Or it just has too many bugs as of yet, for me to be able to use it right now. Still, I plan on keeping it because the rotation feature was not the main selling point for me. The screen size and picture quality were the reasons I wanted it. And they are beautiful.",2.0 out of 5 stars
NEGuy,"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2021","I was really excited to get this my Echo Show 10 (3rd generation), but I'm not so excited anymore. It looks great and it sounds great, but it's a pain in the a**. I've had Echo Dots in every room for years and for the most part they have been issue free and the sound is excellent for such small speakers. I also have Alexa enabled smart bulbs in every room except my kitchen so you can imagine that I'm used to how these things work. I have multiple routines set up and I absolutely love it.

Then comes this shiny new Echo.

Now my music playback is problematic and it's affecting all of my devices, but primarily the Echo Show.
The screen goes blank all the time. Sometimes the music stops for a minute or two on one or all devices or it just stops completely. If I tell Alexa that I like a song that's playing she tells me there's no music playing. None of this happened before I had the new device.
If I'm watching a Youtube video and I give it command such as turning on the AC it stops the video playback and just wont go back to Youtube. I either have to go to another room to give the command or I have to start all over again. Ugh.
sometimes I have to tell it multiple times to do something. It responds with ""OK"" but does nothing, whereas my other devices don't have that problem. The other night my bathroom lights were on all night because she didn't listen and I didn't notice (I guess that's on me).

Mostly it's the music playback and to daily dark screen that get's to me.

And before you ask: Yes I have checked and rechecked my wifi and internet connection. My friend owns an IT company with clients on both coasts and he can't find an issue with my wifi or internet.

Comienzo con la interfaz gráfica que es poco intuitiva, muchas veces paro en espacios en los que no se encuentra como salir, es decir entras al calendario y no hay una opción como una X para cerrarlo, o pongo una configuración (por ejemplo cambiar el fondo de pantalla por imágenes de la naturaleza)
y simplemente no pasa nada lo cual es bastante frustrante, tanto en la app como en el dispositivo echo show 10.

En cuanto a los servicios básicamente deja únicamente vincular amazon prime video y amazon music, aun cuando en mi país hay muchos servicios digitales como Netflix, HBO-MAX, Apple Music, Apple TV+ y otros más en la app no hay forma de agregarlos, al menos me he pasado un par de horas en medio de frustraciones y simplemente ha sido imposible de agregar de una forma intuitiva, vincular cuentas de servicios en la TV o en otros dispositivos inteligentes es algo que no toma más de 5 minutos pero en el echo show no es así.

Dennis F. Cwik,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022","The 3rd generation Echo Show 10 is worse at picking up voice commands, has worse audio, but the screen can be completely vertical which helps for video calling. Overall, I'm not happy upgrading from the 2nd gen to the 3rd gen.

This version of the echo show 10 is objectively worse than the 2nd generation Echo Show 10 at picking up voice commands. This manifests itself in either doing nothing, hanging (taking 15 seconds or so for the blue ""listening"" stripe to disappear, where you can't interrupt it), or asking to repeat your command. It was so bad, I finally decided to return it, but realized I'm outside of the return window. Hence, this review instead.

The sounds quality is also worse than the 2nd generation Echo Show 10. Specifically, voices in audio are just harder to hear from a few yards away compared to the 2nd generation. It feels like the audible spectrum gets distorted quite easily, even at lower volumes. Turning the volume up just gets cluttered and noisy.

I bought this device for the sake of making video calling easier. The fact that the screen can be tilted and get completely vertical is great, as the last generation pointed upwards about about 10 degrees. When making calls with our kid, we'd have to prop up the back end of the 2nd gen Echo Show, and this devices solves that problem. It does this very well.

S. Bant,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2022","I was very happy to receive this device to add to my Alexa device family. I have been using Echo devices since they came out, and have built an infrastructure in my home of about 10 various devices, with this as the crown jewel in the kitchen/dining room area.

The swivel feature is unnecessary and creepy, but kind of fun at times. I had purchased this for what I thought was just a much larger base speaker that doubled as supporting the larger screen, unaware it would want to spin around.

The big issue I am having is Alexa understanding what I want. The algorithm seems to have peaked about a year ago. I was listening to whatever music I wanted throughout my house, setting reminders and adding items to my shopping list with ease.

For the last 3-4 months, Alexa has been getting dumber and dumber. She frequently misunderstands what I am asking for. Plays the wrong songs. Adds the wrong items to lists. Completely ignores requests. Appears to be processing a request and then stops. Maybe its my Wifi...even though I have an extender network? Maybe its the number of devices I have, even though I have several muted so they only serve as speakers? I'm not sure, but Alexa is really making me annoyed, and if I didn't have about a thousand dollars worth of devices spread out throughout my home, I would give up and get rid of them.

I try reporting issues when they happen, but she no longer seems to understand that as well. Yes I have already reset, regrouped and reconnected the devices. It doesn't seem to impact the quality of understanding and performance anymore.

I want the device to display only the time and date, weather, and photos, so I turned the home content settings all off except for weather alerts. I found it annoying but tolerable that new content choices were frequently added and enabled by default, which I had to turn off on each device.
Lately, however, ads have been popping up on my devices. I searched the menus for ""sponsored content"", looking for a way to turn these off, but could find nothing. Whenever I saw an ad, I tapped info and hid the content, but this did nothing to prevent different ads from appearing later. I've found nothing in device or account settings that seems to block ads on my devices, not even paying extra to remove ads. Searches for help yielded nothing but similar complaints. I'm hoping other people are complaining and Amazon hears us and turns this infuriating and intrusive feature off, which will restore my initially favorable opinion of this device.

Normally, it is over 2 years before I have to YELL at Echos to get their attention and have them understand me. Even yelling, frequently it doesn't respond once I have gotten its attention. Timers going off are pure hell as you have to wait for the pause between alarm sounds and yell stop. Doesn't work, next pause yell a curse word and stop. Repeat from 2 feet away and maybe it will stop.

Quite room (kitchen). Set to acknowledge when it hears me. Wake word set to ziggy (because it is between Echo wake word in my bedroom and echo wake word in my office - not calling something Amazon and gf can't pronounce Alexa). Yes, they are all at the yell at them point now!!!

Wondering if updates will also make this obsolete like it did the HD 10 in my bedroom, but also sooner.

I was going to give this 2 stars (1 below Average), but the yelling and cussing pisses off our neighbors. Also, like all Amazon devices, you can't stop the make it obsolete updates. You know, tell the old HD10 to open YouTube and it takes 10 to 30 seconds before you can click on a video thumbnail. What the hell is a devoted device doing that makes it so long and so variable (20 second difference between fastest and slowest). BTW, ditto for the Fire TV sticks that have long delays between moving between icons or opening things. Amazon really needs a way to support their devices working for more than a couple years by stopping updates once it will kill the device (but still allow use with former capabilities).",2.0 out of 5 stars

So now there aren't any cameras that let you view more than 5 minutes without having to request another viewing. Worse, it's often picture in picture on a very small screen in the corner so the ads take front and center(thanks Amazon). My father is not able to click the little x in the corner of the very small pip screen to enlarge it. He loved this device when it worked (during the Cloud Cam era), but it's worthless to him now. It was a waste of money. I bought him an inexpensive android tablet so he is able to watch his street camera 24 hours a day, like he used to.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Integrity Reviews,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2021","So disappointing.

Maybe Amazon over-hyped this but I was expecting a significant upgrade from the Echo Show 8. Sadly that was not the case.

Setup: While straightforward, took a long time. I think there were two updates it immediately applied during setup because it forgot almost everything after the first one and I had to re-enter everything.

The on-screen keyboard is split in two like a physical ergonomic keyboard with a huge space between the left and right halves. This might make sense if the display were removable and you were holding the screen in both hands and using thumbs to type. But on a fixed pedestal it's just clumsy.

The display has a ""blend into background"" mode. It can be disabled but it's on by default. All it did was turn white text a tan or light brown color. If it was just text that would be one thing, but it also applied this to photos which turned a pretty picture into something gross.

The display has huge black borders under the glass so I'm not sure how reliable the 10.1"" screen measurement is.

Sound was the biggest disappointment. While the highs were a bit clearer (due to the addition of two tweeters), the midrange and bass are worse. The Echo Show 8 has a nice warm sound that is completely missing with the Echo Show 10. (This isn't a Hi-Fi system so I expect something clear, pleasant and comfortable to listen to rather than sonic fidelity.)

I never could figure out how to disable the ""How to use Alexa"" screen that stayed in the home screen rotation. It's also that brown background with tan text.

At this point I think the rotating display is more gimmick that useful. It's touchy and overly sensitive.

And seriously, a white power cord/adapter with a charcoal unit?

Maybe Version 2 of the Echo Show 10 will live up to the hype. For now, an Echo Show 8 is half the price and a far better value.",2.0 out of 5 stars
nathan,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2021","Context- we have echo dots all over our house, pretty bought into the Alexa echo system. We just redid our kitchen and now have a big island between our kitchen and dining room so I thought it would be great to have the Echo Show 10 in the corner in a way it could face us if we were in the dining room side or face us on the kitchen side. It does that, it follows us around when we move between the two rooms, the picture is good and the sound is great (again just had dots before this so it's markedly better, both louder and clearer).

Now here's my gripe - We haven't had Echo Shows before, so maybe this is just their M.O. but the screen software is terrible! I have to unplug it and plug it back in every couple of days or it just starts going slow and ignoring our touches, if I'm watching something on Netflix or Hulu and then utter a command like ""Alexa turn on the kitchen lights"" it takes me all the way out of Netflix/Hulu to show me the smart home dashboard and I have to start all over again (""Alexa open Hulu""...wait 30 seconds...click on the show I was watching, because Hulu doesn't respond to voice commands). Also none...like literally none of the apps are optimized for a screen and touch. This makes sense for apps that are developed primarily for voice commands, but all the video players are terrible when it comes to navigation, and other apps that have smartphone/tablet apps, are still cut out at the knees because they only want you to use voice (I'm looking at you Spotify).

When I got the Show, I expected something more like a kindle fire hooked up to a speaker, but instead, I got a speaker with a rarely useful screen.

Again, hardware, all works pretty well, 95% of my complaints are software so hopefully, it's something Amazon will fix down the road.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Jeremy C.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2023","Let’s start off with cosmetic issues. I got the black one as a gift. The camera lens cover is white. Why? Is it that hard to make it match the device color? The power cord and and plug are white. Again, why is it not the color of the device? The screen face follow never is straight, it’s always off to the left. I finally just shut the dumb thing off because it doesn’t work properly. I got this strictly for kitchen use. I use Pinterest for cooking every single day. It was great you can ask Alexa to open Pinterest. But it’s really clunky. It’s not the same look as the Pinterest app or website. You have to click on a button within the recipe that says “make it” then it takes you to some web browser that is horrible. And if you’re playing music and ask Alexa to open Pinterest it stops the music. Then you ask her to play music again and it closes Pinterest. So you can do both at the same time. The menu and settings for the device is really slow. You swipe down or left and there a several second delay to the menu opening. Lame. It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because the speaker sound is decent. Thankfully there’s free returns.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Cal,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2023","It's... fine. Just fine. I was hoping this would be a great way play music, look for recipes, play videos, display photos, and generally integrate several technologies into one object. It does most of those things but just okay. What it does do very, very well is advertisements for things on Amazon on sale. Now don't get me wrong, we basically live on Amazon and shop A LOT for just about everything on the site... but for every 6 second view of a photo, there's 15 minutes of advertising.

The speaker is fine. It can play fairly loudly and the quality is ... fine. We use Apple Music and I have set all the defaults in the app accordingly, but for whatever reason, when I ask Alex to play a song, it randomly picks a song in Amazon music that may not be the same song, unless I specifically say ""in Apple Music."" Why have the ability to set defaults if the defaults don't work??????

tomatthe,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2024","I bought this to use in the kitchen for music while having my recipes up on the screen. I was tired of my phone or tablet as a recipe book, and this seemed like a good option. You can't play music with this while you are displaying a webpage with a recipe. You can only use certain apps with very limited selection of recipes while playing music. There is no way to send a recipe to the device that you might find on your computer.

I basically just use this for music now which defeats the entire purpose of the screen. It was replacing an echo studio, but wasn't really an upgrade at all.",2.0 out of 5 stars

This is the Echo Show 10. I hoped it would be a massive upgrade over the Echo Show 8 1st Gen and it's not really. Same screen resolution, sluggish UI and very suspect voice recognition that plagues this device. I know what a great Alexa device is with good audio recognition. Fire TV Cube is one such device, with a massive microphone array that's excellent, with good CPU performance. Another is the recent gen Echo and Echo dots with the newer CPUs.

Supposedly this device has a faster CPU, but I couldn't tell. It is definitely capable of a quick response time, but it's simply too erratic. Much like Amazon's past screen based Echo devices honestly.

We're also many years removed from Google pulling Youtube from Echo devices, and it's yet to return. My patience is over at this point, and if Amazon can't work out a deal with Google, I have to move on. My kids use Youtube for everything, and I use it for plenty of things. We also sometimes have Youtube TV for watching live shows.

It's likely adios to Amazon. It was a decent decade with Alexa, but i'm off to Nest to see if the grass is greener.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Caitlin,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2024",I am a long time echo and smart home user and I traded in my echo show 8 for this model around the holidays. But we are severely disappointed. The microphones pick up when I'm speaking to it about 40% of the time (hence the two stars) - often times even when I'm less than 2 feet away and facing it. Instead our echo or echo dot that we've had for years and are both 20+ feet away in a different rooms will respond. The device sits on an island so it shouldn't have any weird interferences caused by a wall being too close.,2.0 out of 5 stars
glisle,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2022","Edit:
I finally got the camera to work. But I traded one working feature to lose two others. I now have to stand directly in front of the device for it to answer me most of the time. The worst thing is it now randomly plays music from a type of music I have never asked to be played on my Amazon music account. I doubt I was hacked, I have a firewall and a VPN. Not to say it couldn't happen but I have enough smart devices in my house that I don't see them only messing with music on one device.

This is basically a Kindle Fire on a swivel mount. It works it functions just like other Echo devices. The main reason I chose this model is so I could use the smart camera feature when I have to travel for work.

Unfortunately that is the one function that never worked.

If they get that to work I would think about changing my review.

Edit: I will up this review by one star. Amazon never fixed the issue but I guess they kinda tried.

It was amazing how quickly I received a call from Amazon Tech Support about my issue. Within minutes. Support had me go through and reset the device and all of the usual stuff they do. Nothing worked. I was told I would get a call back and never heard from them.",2.0 out of 5 stars
deffensp,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2021","I have just about every variety of Amazon echo that has been released. If I had bought this new one first, I would have never purchased another one. It is absolutely awful and it's all because of the mics. This thing can't understand anything we say, even from 2 feet away. There was an echo show 5 sitting in the exact same spot until this one arrived and it had zero issues understanding us. Now, from 8 feet away, my son asked about black bears. We got a report on the African American population in the U.S., a picture of blackberries, and several other nonsensical responses. I can deal with the offset camera making the screen follow oddly at times. I like the sound quality, and, the follow feature--though probably not all that practical--really does add to the immersive experience of feeling like Alexa is listening and present. Except that experience is then completely destroyed by having to repeat everything 3 times and hoping that the response will be at all relevant. Until Amazon fixes the mics, this is going to be a frustrating experience, especially if you use the device to control a smart home. I would avoid this product for the time being. We are most likely going to return ours.

Update 08/2022 - We still have this and it is still awful. Sitting two feet away from this, the echo 2 rooms over picks up before this one does. This constantly gets our requests wrong. It can't distinguish between ""turn off"" and ""turn on"". Planning on trading in for something else this fall. We gave it a chance to get the bugs worked out through software updates. It is still, by far, the worst model Echo we own.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I have contacted support five different times each time getting a different answer on the problem, so now they have agreed to send a third unit claiming that the others had technical issues. I guess I will find out when the other unit arrives. The issue seems to be that it is not communicating properly with the Alexa app. However since connecting this new show 10 to the others now the others are having issues as well.

I have mine on the counter in the kitchen and set it up immediately upon arrival. Setup was easy, although be prepared, you may have to do the steps twice. Once is updates it forgets what you inputted and you have to do it all over - language and all that stuff. Not that big of a deal.

I set the motion on the screen where I want it and that was pretty easy. Your will have to play around and find your sweet spot for the device. I guess I need to continue to work on that part as mine is prone to random movements and doesn't follow me at all unless I call out to Alexa. If you put something in its range of motion it will let you know.

I find the sound better than my old one since the speakers are better and not buried in the back. The screen quality is not something I would rate as superior. I actually like my old one better. This one appears ""faded"" and not as vibrant as my old Echo.

As stated, maybe I expected too much at that price point of $249.00. I preordered mine months ago and maybe if there had been a preorder discount I would be more satisfied, but at what I paid I see nothing to shout about.

When selecting a photo album for a background, the pictures used to play oldest to newest. Then after an update a year ago they started playing newest to oldest.

OceanLad,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2022","We are returning our Echo Show, sadly. While the idea is great, and the rotating screen would seem to be a perfect fit for our oddly shaped kitchen, the execution is just not there.

First off, there's the voice recognition, which seems to be far less accurate than the standard Alexa unit this was meant to replace.

Secondly, there's the screen quality. I had wanted this to function essentially as a TV for our kitchen, but the screen is too dark, easily washes out in daylight, and lacks settings to adjust the picture.

Thirdly, the motion following is extremely wonky. Sometimes it works kinda, other times it doesn't work at all. Even when it does work, it seems to be off a few degrees and points the screen just off of where it would be helpful.

Finally, the unit, at least for our family, lacks a natural or intuitive interface. We wanted to use this for TV watching, but watching anything but Prime seems to be a no-go. There may be ways to load other apps, but it's not intuitive.

Dave B,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2022","We've got virtually every Echo device, from the Echo Studio down to the Echo Flex nightlight. Every device has been satisfactory for the price paid until this device. The main purpose for this device was to be located in our kitchen as a screen and paired with our Echo Studio in the adjacent living room to get a fuller sound in there. No, I definitely didn't expect it to have the sound quality that the Studio does but it's lacking much more than imagined. Even playing with the EQ it still sounded thin, lacking bottom end, and doesn't sound any better than the Echo Show 8 which is a much cheaper device.

The other complaint is the amount of movement when touching the screen. Even though it's in no movement mode there's a lot of play in it when touching the screen while going through the settings menu and though we don't touch our other Shows that much, this one was intended for things like recipes and such where you would be touching it.

DG,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2022","Echo Show 10 Frozen Screen
Please Assistance: for almost 2 weeks my Echo show 10 has been frozen with the amazon logo in the middle of the screen and nothing else. A couple of days ago, after hours waiting in the phone, I was able to talk to a agent, who tried to troubleshooting but it didn't work and he finally told me that several people have been reporting black screens on this model, that they were working on that , and that I should connect my Echo back to electricity in 2 days; that the problem should have been fixed by then. He also said that I would receive an email from the technical department giving follow up to my issue. Several days have passed, and I have not received no email or any support to fixing the problem. As I explained to the agent, in my case, this device is not merely used for entertainment, it is a vital tool in my family to monitor my very senior parents who live by themselves in another country. Not to mention that this was a very expensive item for us who manage a very devaluated currency. PLEASE, PLEASE HELP",2.0 out of 5 stars
Reader,"Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2023","We got this so our kids could let us know they made it home while we are all commuting home. Yes, I am aware cellphones are a thing; however, theydo not work well in our area and wired internet connection is more reliable. Other features... It's irritating. It randomly activates. It constantly offers suggestions we have turned off. We set up lists, reminders, chore lists... It is a battle to get it to do what you are asking for and constantly tries to locate something for sale. ""Alexa what are my chores."" is supposed to be all the kids need to say but no it either says it can't do that, pulls up the template chore chart with made up names and activities like ""Buddy clean the living room."" Or it pulls up Prime with charts for sale. Not sure if we will keeo it or not. Maybe I'll try out the camera functions outside our homeand see if I like it as a kind of home security camera system.

Tippy,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2022","I purchased this echo show 10 with high hopes that it would fulfill my expectations as a current owner of 3 other echoes. I was not at all impressed nor satisfied with my echo show 10. For the amount of money I spent on this device only for me to have to request a refund on the same day it arrived I was really disappointed.
Straight out the box I tried about 15 times to get it to connect to my Wi-Fi. I did trouble shoot using Amazon’s trouble shooting instructions and still no connection. I eventually called for technical support and the representative was able to get it connected after being on with her for some time.
After placing my device where I wanted it to be the motion was way off. I couldn’t get it to track properly with my motion. After multiple long attempts of trying to get the motion to follow me and it kept telling me it bumped into something I contacted customer service for a refund. I was completely disappointed with my new device. However, customer service was very helpful and pleasant. I am completely satisfied with my experience with customer service but unfortunately I can’t say the same about the echo show 10 that I received.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Hendry1538,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2021","Got this new echo show for video calls and recipes. Really works well for following you around the room and zooming in. Pretty much what I upgraded for. However, the screen does not move back to the idle position when you stop interacting with it. Well, it will when it sleeps, but it only sleeps when nobody is in view of the camera. People are in my kitchen most of the day in my set up, so it is stuck at whatever angle someone last interacted with it until you interact with it again.

I spent 3 hours with tech support and 4 unplugs, 3 resets, 5 times recalibrating the motion and checking for updates numerous times to find this out. Really poor support for this device. My initial question seemed simple: ""when does the device go back to the idle position?"" To be clear, following you is not the same as turning toward you when you say Alexa. The former has preferences, the latter is either on (turns towards you when you say the wake word) or off completely.

Anyways, i hope the development team is listening and they add a command to put the show back to idle position or even better, implements a time out when not in follow mode and the wake word hasn't been spoken. Maybe even move it back to idle position when the camera slider is closed.

I'll give it a couple weeks to see if any of this updated before I return the 2 I bought.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Kendra,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2021","I was super excited to upgrade to the new Alexa Show that moved when I spoke to it but to be honest it does a better job following the kids than it does me and I'm the one cooking trying to get it to turn to my voice 🙄 I also paid for one of the premium voices and it worked for like a week and then completely quit, telling my my device was too old! 🤬 I had to do a bunch of stuff to ""try and fix it"" and in the end wound up asking for my money back because none of the techs could figure out why it wouldn't work.

I have several routines setup that I've used for years with my old Alexa's both dot's and show's. This one wants to show me pictures or internet articles rather than follow the routine process I've setup.

It's great that I can turn the camera while watching from my phone but I can't tilt up or down and the lighting at night is worthless, she needs night vision. This one also only syncs to one camera of the 3 that I have, no matter what I name them or how I ask, she will not show another camera than my dining room.

I have had more issues where the only solution is to unplug. I find that ridiculous how often I have to do this. I wish I could go back to the old one.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Super* Review,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2024","We use Alexa for smart home things -- lights and climate controls. The Echo Show adds absolutely nothing to that experience. Getting to smart home controls is always clicks away, and it doesn't even include some functions that are available in the app (e.g. thermostat control). So rather than have an always-on visualization of most-used smart home controls, it's just a big clock. That shows full-screen ads.

It feels like a not-very-mature product, and the part that is mature is... ads.",2.0 out of 5 stars

It suddenly doesn’t listen, no longer shows the song or lyrics as they play, I rarely see my own pictures on it, it bombards me with stuff I have no interest in, for example football, and there’s no command that will make it stop doing that. I know that Amazon’s Echo department isn’t performing well, bit ruining the experience for people who already own the devices is NOT helping! Just let me see and hear what I CHOOSE!

JD,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2023","*Updated 11/23/23* - so it appears that Amazon reintroduced a toggle in the ""Home Screen"" section this month to turn off the highly annoying ""things Alexa can do"" or ""things to try"" interruptions and it seems to be working at this point. I increased my rating to 3 stars.

Original review
Echo Show 10 - in use for 3 months. I have 4 other echo audio-only devices and a variety of other smart home devices - nearly 50 in total. I added the Echo show as a central device in the kitchen/great room where I could monitor selected security cameras and use the numerous other features WHEN I ASK IT TO (see below).

The GOOD News - the Echo Show handles all of the Alexa capabilities and provides basic integration with my smart home environment. The 10"" screen is good quality and adds a number of useful video features like displaying recipes, streaming videos, video calls, video monitoring of security cameras, etc... The sound quality is good - perhaps a tick better than the audio-only Echo balls. Almost certainly you will find something useful in the broad array of capabilities. The feature for the display to ""follow you"" around the room is interesting, but after a while it started feeling creepy so I turned it off - but I can see where that would be useful to some depending on how you are using the device.

The BAD news -
(1) At times I want to use this device to monitor one of my security cameras without interruption - unless I specifically ask the Echo Show 10 to do something else. Although there are a bunch of ""home screen"" settings where you can select whether you want a rotation of content (pictures, recipe ideas, news, ""suggested"" movies, social media drivel, etc.) to appear on the Alexa screen while it is awaiting your next command - in my case I don't want ANY of these things to interrupt my camera feed, so I turned them ALL off. Despite doing so, the device regularly stops the camera feed to display a ""things to try"" or ""things Alexa can do"" screen. REALLY ANNOYING and per my conversation with Amazon yesterday (10/11/23) there is no way to prevent the device from doing that. I find myself having to re-start my camera feed all day long. If you are contemplating using the Echo Show 10 to monitor a baby-cam, security cam, or some other static content display (e.g. bedside clock), just be aware that Amazon have decided that having Alexa tell you what else you should try is always more important than whatever else you have the Echo 10 doing. (At one point, there was a toggle to turn ""things to try"" off, but it didn't really work and that toggle disappeared a few weeks ago)
2) The integration with non-Amazon-branded smart home devices is still pretty weak and while I eventually got everything to a basic level of integration - it was a pain and took far too much troubleshooting. I recognize that integration requires coordinated action by the smart home device vendors and Amazon, but it needs to be much clearer what ""Alexa Enabled"" means. Often the integration is the absolute barest minimum (e.g. voice control to turn something on/off) and nothing more. As an example, my fancy AI security camera can tell me what it is seeing (a person, a car, a herd of buffalo, etc..) - the Echo Show 10 advertises a ""person detection"" announcement feature, but inexplicably when a person IS detected by my AI camera, instead of showing me the camera, it shuts OFF the video feed to display a text message - ""Person detected in driveway cam"" - Huh? And the Echo can't announce the car or anything else that the camera sees. Amazon should be pushing themselves and their ""Alexa Enabled"" partners aggressively towards the new ""Matter"" home automation integration standards to make it far easier to setup and clearer what capabilities you are really getting than at present.

Good luck!",3.0 out of 5 stars
J Schaeffer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024","Overall, I loved this Echo. I have a variety of Echo devices throughout my home, and this was my favorite one, until a little after 2 years old it quit working. I have tried everything recommended in the forums and have asked for the assistance of Amazon (the rep was extremely rude, and absolutely no help.) It will not stay connected to my wifi. I have moved it around (it was already the closest device to the router), shut down most everything in the house, turned it on and off, reset my router, and a host of other things. It will connect, but within 5 minutes, it drops the connection. For the price, it should still be working. I looked at ordering another Echo, but this one has no trade-in value. If this is such a great device, why is it not even listed for trade-in. My guess, they are having a lot of trouble with them and don't want them back.

daveinlaca,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2021","The idea of the Echo Show 10 is such a game changer, I was ready to make it the hub of my music and entertainment center at home. Echo already controls my television remote, my lights, and my spotify. With the Show, I was expecting it to do the same with photos and other features.

Unfortunately, nearly every feature I was excited about underdelivered.

Photo Booth
I was most excited about the idea of telling my show ""Alexa, take a picture"", have it find me and my friends and snap a selfie. What a great addition to parties! And while the camera has improved, the lighting adaptation has not. Most of the photos came out extremely average if the lighting wasn't perfect. The kind of quality I would have expected to post on my MySpace in 2006.

The other great addition was the ability to tell my Show, ""Alexa, take a video"". It did a good job of finding me, but every video has to end with you saying ""Alexa, stop video."" I called customer service, certain that there must be a gesture I could assign, or perhaps a way to set a time and have Alexa take a 10 second video. But no, after exploring all options like ""routines"" and ""IFTT"" every video has to end with you telling Alexa to stop.

There's also no way to get the photos and videos straight to your phone, so you're stuck waiting for it to upload to Amazon Photos, then going into your phone, opening Amazon Photos, finding what you want, then downloading, then editing the end of that video so it doesn't end with your stop command. Clunky and unnecessary when there are so many easy ways they could have programmed all this to work better.

MUSIC
I was excited about the lyrics feature on Amazon Music. They advertised ""Have your own karaoke night!"" But there are almost no karaoke songs on Amazon Music. They are plentiful on Spotify and other music services. A speaker with a screen makes karaoke such an obvious use, that it's shocking there's no way to do it. Either you can bring up the lyrics with the original song and vocals, or you can stream Spotify, but then the lyrics don't come up. Looked for third party solutions, but they were all just a few karaoke songs for small children. Another wasted opportunity.

SOUND
The sound was good. I was expecting it to be more like the Echo Studio with a screen, but the speaker is much smaller. Solid, but nothing that impressive. I ended up buying the Echo Sub to pair to it and that improved the sound greatly. Now my music sounds like a sound system...IF I STREAM FROM A SERVICE.

I write and produce music, so a lot of times I like to play my own music from my phone. To do that you need to pair your phone with your echo, at which point the echo acts just like a bluetooth speaker. That's fine, except now the Echo Sub no longer works, since that connects to your echo through bluetooth as well. So that great bassy sound I get with regular music isn't available for my own music if I play through my phone via iTunes or Soundcloud. Yet another opportunity missed.

YOUTUBE
YouTube...works. You access it through a web browser which is just clunky. The promise of a user friendly youtube playing all your videos and exploring and going down a youtube hole on a Friday night just doesn't work through the browser the way a dedicated app would.

FACES
It may not make sense to complain about a feature that isn't included that was never promised, but with echo having a screen, it seems like a logical step to create skins/faces that mimic what Alexa is saying. i picture a translucent face, like Snow White's mirror, or something cartoony. I'm surprised a third party developer wouldn't have made something like this available, and it would give the Show that much more of a personality.

Overall, I enjoy using the Echo Show 10. There seem to be a lot of kinks and falls short of its potential, but I knew that being an early adopter and purchasing the day it became available. And while most of these things are little frustrations, a big frustration is that only about a month after purchasing, Amazon has dropped the price $40, effectively punishing the early adopters for getting behind their product. That, along with my other issues, dropped my review from the five stars I wanted to give, down to the three I gave it.

Hope this helps others!",3.0 out of 5 stars

Lindsay K.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2024","I got this for my kitchen to display recipes when I cook. I used to use my laptop or ipad but they kept getting dirty and it wasn't a good situation.
I expected to be able to use the silk browser to pull up the recipes but it crashes the entire device. EVERY SINGLE TIME.
I even tried to copy/paste the recipe to a google doc to eliminate all of the background scripting and ads and pictures that could be slowing the browser down.
Nope.
If I had known it was going to be so horribly inept at doing what I bought it for, I never would've gotten it.
I still don't have a good solution for displaying recipes while I'm cooking. So far, I'm just using my ipad again, cleaning it after every time. Poor thing has a permanent coating of flour, oil, and chocolate from me constantly having to touch the screen to scroll and wake it back up.

Other aspects of it:
-Voice recognition is mostly ok. I've had the issue with all of my Alexa devices where it won't always pick up what's being commanded and she just says ""sorry, I don't know that"", which is so frustrating.
-All of the screen based Alex/echo devices show ads. I hate it.
-They also all add on new features all the time. Even ones I've disabled. It's always ad based: items you may be interested in, videos to watch, sports scores, etc. I have to constantly go back into the settings and remove them from the home screen rotation. I was seeing ads and suggestions to buy lingerie! I've bought it on my account before but I don't need my kids seeing it as a suggestion to purchase in my kitchen!
-Sound: it's ok. Nothing mind blowing. Volume is good when you're jamming but really the speaker isn't anything special.
-Rotation: it's a gimmick. Cut and dry. It's stupid. I've turned it off and don't miss it. It was constantly bumping into stuff despite me setting its field of rotation and adjusting it often. It would yell at me from time to time about it, too. Just a total gimmick.

It will try to get you to buy Amazon music but you just say no and it plays the music anyway. If you want it to be a photo album, much trickier. It uploaded all my 1,800+ photos from my phone and also made 4 or 5 small albums. Why? It just didn't give me choices and Alexa won't let me delete or erase photos. I don't know why but there are tons of photos I don't want to see on the screen. While showing a photo, it will let you make it a favorite. Or it won't. It is just as likely to say there is nothing on the screen.

Okay. That's all minor. Sure it will tell you how many miles it is to San Francisco. Blah Blah. But if you have it in your heart to set up a smart home, just shoot yourself now. I bought 4 of the highest rated smart plus - KASA - and I have only succeeded in getting one to work. You have to download the KASA app. Plus the Tipo App. Then it has to connect to bluetooth somehow and then to my wifi, which it has a bunch of trouble doing. Then those 2 apps have to work together somehow and then ""maybe"" link to Alexa. Example, today I managed to get another plug set up but when I ask Alexa to turn it on she says I haven't turned on that skill. WTF? What ""skill?"" So I have one out of four lamps that work with Alexa turn on the lamp. I'm afraid to go further. A Nest doorbell? You're kidding, right?

Okay. Buy it and tear your hair out of your head. Go on. What I really think is we have this tech but we don't really have it sorted yet.

EALong19,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2022","I wanted so bad to love this little machine. I thought it would solve a lot of the problems I’d been having.
First off, don’t get me wrong- a few of the issues were my own fault. But some were hers. Like when she wouldn’t understand me and would just ignore me rather than ask for clarification. (My echo doesn’t do that). Or when I turned the setting to “don’t move the screen unless I tell you to follow me” and it was still shifting. I mean, stop. I have you pointing where I want. Stop moving.

My fault- I thought I could have it show my to do list and calendar on the screen always. Nope- that’s the show 15. I have cognitive difficulties due to medication and I wanted my to do’s right there in my face all the time. But I can’t do that with this. That was my own fault.

The good- I wanted to be able to use this to pop in and see my pets while I was out. Mostly amazing. I only ever used it with the drop in feature so I can’t VERIFY that you can control the screen remotely but with the drop in, the video and audio work both ways (but all I heard was the fur of my cat rubbing against the speakers and then he moved the camera to where I couldn’t see him anymore. I was unable to move the screen back). 😒
Apparently there is another way to view the cameras but I don’t know if it is two way audio/ video at that point.
So if you’re getting it for a pet camera you might want to play with how it works.

The audio was fine and good but I have an echo with a bumpin speaker for the little orb she is so it wasn’t that impressive. It felt heavy and ungainly. The screen always flopping around. (But never where I wanted it).

If I recorded video and wanted something that could follow me, maybe this would be great (I never tested that). Or if I did things where I needed to keep an eye on the screen all the time, this might be great. Unfortunately, it didn’t solve the problems I was hoping it would.
Which was basically a pet camera and an Alexa in one. The pet camera part was fine but the Alexa just seemed to work worse than my echo and if I moved her from room to room (what I wanted to do) it seemed to be a big ordeal. I’m 95% sure she’s going back. I keep trying to make it work though. I’m not sure why. Maybe it’s because I like seeing my pictures on all the time. But a $180 (on sale) picture frame that sulks and ignores you? Idk. I listen to a lot of podcasts so she plays those a lot and controls a lot of routines but my DOT can do that and I got that for $20.",3.0 out of 5 stars
NORCAL_AV8OR,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2024","The power cord from the Gen 1 Echo Show 8 is the same specs in every way as the one for this Echo Show 10. And it was made in black. I upgraded to this Echo Show 10 from a Gen 1 Show 8 so luckily I still have a black power cord.

As for this new Echo, the bezel is huge and looks straight out of the early 2000s. The motion feature is a gimmick, and besides making the device more expensive than it should be, it limits the placement of the device should you choose to use it. I turned it off immediately and have no plans to ever turn it on.

Also the motion feature means you never have a stable platform for the screen. When you are using touch features the screen gives way and wobbles as you touch. They should have made a way to mechanically lock the screen to the base and prevent any rotation at all - but they didn't so now I will have to rig something myself to achieve that.

The sound is much better than previous versions but I cast my music from Echo to an Airplay device connected to my home theater so that is no great upgrade for me.

In all, I would not upgrade to this device again - I would wait for them to reduce the bezel size, and get rid of the motion feature. However if you do not own an Echo Show yet then this is not a bad start as long as you get it with some steep discounts.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Cat Papa,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023","Sometimes this little guy starts looking around the room, trying to figure out where I am, but I have not moved. Also, when it faces me, the angle is a bit askew, so that I am always trying to move to the left to to get myself centered to it, and it keeps on moving over as well like it’s trying to adjust and compensate for me being a skew. It’s like the designers had misaligned the camera or the sensor in there so it’s never truly facing me. It’s facing my shoulder. Maybe it’s not very noticeable at 20 or 30 feet away but since I sit about 2 feet away from it at my desk, it is so very annoying. Also, there are times where the sound will cut out as if there’s no music playing, but with a hooked up to the Amazon subwoofer, the subwoofer is still playing, so I know the stream of music is working, but this thing is cutting out. Also, the way Ward doesn’t always get it to wake up. I’m a very bit disappointed in this and I will be selling it to a friend because I’m gonna go back to my Google Home devices.

Cipher469,"Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2021","Usually, when Amazon introduces a new version of an Echo, there is improvement in existing features along with new ones. NOT SO with the Echo 10 (Gen 3). It's evolution included a new design and the ""follow me."" feature. It's devolution was REMOVING the option to connect an Echo voice remote with the new 10. WHO CAME UP WITH THAT AND WHY!?! There is an Echo remote connected with every Echo in my house, allowing each device to be silently controlled up close or from a distance. With my prior Echo 10 (which I now regret trading in), a Bluetooth connected speaker, and my trusty remote, music could be controlled and enjoyed out on the deck. Not any longer with Gen 3!
If there had been any communication that the remote function had been removed, I would not have traded in my prior version Echo10. Apparently, the tech people didn't know it either, because when I called in about a problem....no remote option in Setting, the rep thought it must be a software glitch. He escalated the issue and advised there would be a response within 3 business days. That didn't happen, so I tried returning the new Echo, but the online system wouldn't allow it, forcing a call to tech support. I called Customer Service, reached a very helpful rep, who did some digging and discovered the truth....the remote feature had been removed. Because there were some other issues with the device I received(At its location on a counter under overhead spotlight bulbs, it would occasionally say it couldn't follow me because there wasn't enough light. Also, getting Alexa's attention often meant my having to shout to get her to wake up.), the very helpful rep set up an exchange for me. All this aside, it was intriguing that a customer rep was able to get an answer regarding the remote feature removal, but a tech rep was unable to do so.
The replacement, so far, has not had the can't follow in the ""dark"" and the holler at Alexa issues.
In trading up, I have gotten an Echo that follows me, BUT I have lost the ability to listen and control the Echo on my deck. I hope this helps potential buyers to be able a more informed decision. If you don't care about using a remote, then go for it.
UPDATE: Alex seems to be getting hard of hearing. On enough occasions to be noticeable, Alexa is either slow to respond or doesn't respond at all to first or even second wake up call, even when there is no background noise. This type event is very rare on all of my other Echo devices. The added ""head"" movement is nice, but it should not be at the expense of features and Alexa response time that we have gotten used to and expect to continue enjoying.
UPDATE 2: I got a replacement for the 1st replacement, and it seemed to be OK. Now, about 2.5 months in, it is ""working"" like the first two. I regret trading in my earlier generation Echo 10. It may not have followed me, but it sure did respond to me.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Shaun,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2021","History -
I've owned a lot of Echos. Starting with the original device, multiple gens of dots, Echo Shows from 5 to 10, and now this device. I'm familiar with the ecosystem, and I generally love what they do. This purchase seemed like an obvious upgrade.

That's why I'm disappointed to say that I regret the purchase. I haven't returned it yet, either because I'm holding out hope for optimization or I'm too lazy to do it.

Positives -
It is a sharp looking device with a good-enough screen. It's not the picture quality you get from top-end phones, tablets, or televisions, but that isn't what this product is supposed to be.

The camera is a significant upgrade from the previous Echo Show , so if you actually use the camera - big win here. It features the physical hardware slider that first appeared on the Echo Show 5 to give you peace of mind when you want that blocked.

It's still got the same Alexa skills/capabilities that make the previous devices great.

Negatives -
This Echo routinely fails to answer when I'm near it, and one of the other devices will respond. Again, I have six Echos in the house, and I'm used to where the ""points of confusion"" normally fall. This is a completely different situation. I'm standing in front of the device, I watch it ""wake"" on Alexa, and then I'm answered by an Echo that's sitting 20+ feet down the hall. I'm genuinely unsure how it's possible. Other times it will not hear the wake word at all, and I'm left wondering if that's due to the new speaker configuration.
*** This is so unlike the behavior of my other Echo devices that I might actually try an exchange to see if there's something wrong with this unit. ***

The device ""loses track"" of me a lot more than I expected. I cleared the view so it has minimal obstructions, but it still makes dumb mistakes like thinking a person on the television 12 feet away is me. This was the single biggest reason I got the device, and it's a real disappointment. When it starts spinning quickly to locate you, there isn't any noise, but it will draw attention. That said, when the motion tracking works, it's as awesome as I hoped it could be.

On a similar line of thought, the flexibility of facing the other way sometimes lead to annoyance that the screen isn't oriented where I'm used to from the kitchen. This is trade-off you have to make, but it's been more noticeable than I expected. Over time I believe it won't be as big a deal.

Minor quibbles -
For a $250 device the charcoal Echo should come with a charcoal cable. This device, in particular, benefits from sitting in an open area. It's unattractive to have a bright white cable running from it.

The rotation does mean you've got to reserve more space for it. You're also going to want to clear anything that would be in the direct line of sight like a plant, or it'll get really confused.

There's supposedly a powerful new processor, but I didn't notice anything being ""snappier"".

Summary -
I thoroughly enjoy Amazon's Echo devices, but this one has been a letdown. I would strongly advise anyone against buying today at $250 until they can try to work some of these quirks out. I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could, but it felt wrong to say 2 stars when most of my challenges are that it fails to live up to expectations.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Cliff Harewood,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2023","I have an Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen, 2021 release). The speaker on it sounds way better than the speaker on my brand new Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) | with premium sound. I guess premium sound doesn't mean premium sound in the Amazon world. So I purchased the new Echo Sub to go with my new Echo Show 10.
In my opinion, what amazon calls premium sound is not very good. The sound quality that I got out of the echo show 8 was much better than what the echo show 10 3rd Gen produces. being armed with that disappointment, I ordered the echo sub. And when paired with the echo show 10, the sound quality was quite good. However we ran into some technical difficulties. Whenever I play music from YouTube on my echo show, my echo sub does not play. And anytime I connect my cell phone to my echo show to play music, again my echo sub does not play any bass. to me this is a big problem period and i placed no less than five calls to amazon support with no resolution. I got everything from no one calling me back to they just couldn't figure it out. And magically my phone line would drop. So I stand quite frustrated and I'm considering returning both devices at this point. Jeff Bezos is one of the richest men in the world. I would think that he could do better then this for support of his products. I have another 30 days to return them and if I can't get a better response from amazon support then I will definitely return them and buy something better.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Kenno,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2024","Bear in mind that at age 82 my interests may not be the same as yours and I don't have a smart home. I do have an Alexa in every room.

I first ordered the Show 5[at half price] but the screen was too small for me to see all the items clearly, so I ordered the Show 10. It is far better than the Show 5, which we moved to the kitchen, on top of the microwave, where it replaced an Echo Dot.

Although I kept the Show 10, I believe it is overpriced, because the sound, is not any better than the Echo globe with premium sound and sells for $98.

The screen content also leaves much to be desired because it is so repetitious. It shows lots of sports info, which I have no interest in, and it has advertised The Trolls every 5 minutes every day since I got it. There should be a way for me to tell Alexa my interests so it could show only things that interest me and not repeat it every 5 minutes. That becomes tiresome.

If I ask it to show my Amazon photos, it does a really good job of scrolling them. If one of them is out of focus or you don't want it to show, Ask Alexa to hide it, and she does immediately.

Therefore it is my judgment that the Show 10, while it does all the Alexa things well, is not quite ready for prime time for the aforementioned reasons.",3.0 out of 5 stars
NathanJayBar,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2022","I've had 4 Echo Dot 2nd gen, 1 Echo 1st gen, I currently use use an Echo dot 3rd gen and an Echo 4th gen, both my cars have Echo Auto devices, I set up a family members Echo Show 10 2nd gen, and I should mention this is my second Echo Show 10 (I returned the first one because it wasn't responding to voice commands and would not update the firmware)... point being I have experience with Amazon Echo devices and how they function. That is in large part why I purchased the Echo Show 10 3rd Generation. Needless to say I'm fairly disappointed and quite frequently let down by it. I think the desire to make a good product is there and that in theory the device is a good idea, a great one as a matter of fact, but the execution is, well... subpar. The device is quite laggy, voice recognition works maybe 75% of the time, it struggles multi tasking (setting a timer while playing music or telling me how much time is left on the timer while a Hulu is playing) and I'm constantly having to unplug the device to give it a break from existing so it can think about all things it tried to do but couldn't because it got overwhelmed. I would say the Echo Show 10 needs at least a 50% boost in processing power just to keep up with what feel like basic requests. I have Amazon devices in other rooms and I can't tell you how many times I'm yelling at the Echo Show 10 and an Echo in the other room will respond because the show decided not to listen, again. I've read other reviews about the camera being off to one side and how it's annoying, I share that frustration. The screen never really faces you, it's always a little off to one side because the AI is trying to center you to the camera, not to the screen. It's annoying.

What it comes down to, is I think I had my expectations a little high for this device. I was hoping it would be quick and responsive, complete the (seemingly) simple tasks I ask of it while integrating into my Amazon ecosystem flawlessly. It plays music (sometimes after 2-3 requests), it follows me around the room, it will show me the weather for the week and it will play movies on Hulu as long as that's the ONLY thing I ask it to do. When the next gen comes out I'll likely jump on it and trade this thing right away, hoping they've made some adjustments to the OS and added some processing power. Don't get me wrong, I like the device and it has great sound packed into such a little package, it's just a bit of a let down. 24K+ reviews on Amazon for this device, I'm sure this will get lost in the mix but hey, at least I spoke my peace.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Carl,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2023","I’ve had this for a little while now, and the sound quality is pretty good. Alexa seems to be a bit confused with this product. I usually have to repeat things several times to accomplish simple tasks. My biggest complaint is that the screen does not follow me; it seems to follow some unseen being. It’s very aggravating because I can’t see the screen most of the time, unless I manually move it. Once I move the screen so I can see it, it decides to move away and follow something else after a short while. I don’t like to move it manually because I’m afraid it will mess up the drive mechanism (more?) I bought the mount for it to place it on the wall so I can see it from bed or the desk. Waste of money since it won’t stay where I can see it most of the time. I would rather it have a remote control to adjust the volume, etc. and just forget about the screen, or have the screen stationary. Very disappointing because the concept is good. Amazon needs to step up their game with Siri now responding to voice commands without having to push a button to enable it. Aesthetically, its fine; I would change the design of the speaker to be more of an oblong than a round shape so it doesn’t stick out so far from the wall. It would be able to track left and right, but once the novelty wears off, it doesn’t need to move at all. The feature costs a lot of money and needs to be fixed. Unfortunately, very disappointing.",3.0 out of 5 stars
JB,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2023","I bought the Amazon Echo Show with high hopes, and while it has some great features, I can't help but feel a bit underwhelmed. Here's my three-star review:

Pros:

Display: The Echo Show's display is crisp and clear, making it convenient for viewing recipes, song lyrics, and even security camera footage. It adds an extra layer of functionality to the typical smart speaker.

Video Calls: The ability to make video calls is a nice touch, especially for keeping in touch with family and friends. The camera quality is decent.

Cons:

Limited App Integration: The Echo Show's selection of apps and skills feels somewhat limited compared to other smart displays. I wish it had broader compatibility with popular services and a more robust app ecosystem.

Voice Assistant: Alexa seems to have forgotten a few things as I find myself growing increasingly frustrated at requests that go unanswered. In what world does an ""upgrade"" from my original Echo fall this flat??

Sound Quality: The audio quality is decent, but not outstanding. While it's suitable for casual music listening, it doesn't quite deliver the immersive experience I was hoping for. External speakers may be necessary for audiophiles.

Privacy Concerns: The camera and microphone raise some privacy concerns. Although Amazon has improved privacy settings, it still feels like an invasion of privacy having a camera in the home. It's essential to stay vigilant with the device's privacy settings.

In conclusion, the Amazon Echo Show is a solid addition to the smart home ecosystem, but it falls short of its full potential. It offers some great features, but the limitations in app integration and audio quality, coupled with privacy concerns, make it a less-than-perfect choice. If you're already invested in the Amazon ecosystem and are primarily looking for a smart display for basic tasks, it's a reasonable choice. However, if you're seeking a more versatile and privacy-conscious device, you might want to explore other options.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Velvet,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2021","For me, this product turned out to be a disappointment. First of all, I thought I could use it in the kitchen, to make cooking videos. The fact that the screen/camera can follow me while moving from the counter to the oven, fridge or shelves for different actions made me look forward to trying this. Guess what? The longest recording possible is 60 seconds, yes! One minute and no more. So, scratch the cooking videos!
At that point, the important radius of free space it requires to move in its circle became mostly a major obstacle on my countertop. Next: I liked the feature of displaying my photos and doggie videos on the screen. That works well, but… the upload and organizing of photos is clumsy and very long! Once that’s done, which in my case, for about 2,500 pics, took until next morning, the displaying went nicely, until it started to get interrupted by Amazon advertisement every 10 minutes or so. What the!?
Did I pay for this device, and therefore I own it, or did Amazon give it to me free of charge, in exchange for unlimited advertising campaigns? That’s annoying and there is no way to stop it.
My other hope was that I would be able to see the titles of the classical music I mostly play. After all, on the screen in my car, I get this display when I listen to a classical radio station, and also any other, of course. Well, no! None, no information whatsoever… just the name of say, 107.3 FM. I might just as well continue with the no-screen Echo! Overall, I also found that the device’s reaction time was a little slaggish at times… it takes apparently lots of bandwidth out of my wireless network.
So, what do I want? NO advertisements on my device! I paid for it, it’s mine. There are no advertisements on my other, previous Echo with no screen. I want a memory chip slot of at least 256 gigs, so that I can buy and use one for video recording, if I want to. There is room for that on the slice of the screen, and most certainly inside the screen casing for the little extra hardware!
And I want this thing to be reprogrammed so that it displays the titles of music played from radio stations.
I don’t think this is unreasonable for a machine of this price level. I heard from Amazon that “Google and Apple also have similar devices, and they also do not have all that”. So what? Go ahead, Amazon, be brave and take the lead! Show them what the Echo Show is made of!
I’m waiting… and until I see that these are implemented, I won’t need the Echo Show. The one I just bought is on its way back to you, Amazon!

Steve,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2021","Update 7.2023- still going strong, used multiple times a day, every day for 2 years and many improvements have been made to the software. Still could be better, still not as good as a fire tablet, but much better than it was. Original review from 2021: I am an early adopter of any technology relevant to my life that I can get ahold of. I would even get the Alexa ring if they made one that fit my finger (I know because I got the sizing kit and it didn't work) but this thing, as cool as it is in concept, is terrible.
CONS:
-Feature-wise it's the most limited Amazon device I've ever owned. For some reason it doesn't work like any fire tablet, you can't download Android apps, you can't download most apps that I can get on my fire TV or on my fire tv cube. Disney Plus? No. Discovery? No.
-YouTube works through a browser, which has to be silk or Firefox, and I figured hey maybe I'll try that but no, can't stream either of those through the browser.
-The operating system is buggy, says it can't connect in the right slide out menu but it will connect to any service you ask for that is installed if you do it verbally. Restarted it a few times, it updated itself, but still has the problem.
- MOST IMPORTANTLY- I could literally buy a fire tablet, glue it to the screen of this thing below the camera, and get everything I wanted. And for the 120 bucks it would cost me to get a fire tablet 8 I might actually do that 🤣🤣
Pro's:
-It follows you which is great, it's usually off by a few degrees, but that's livable. Very handy in the kitchen when moving around the island for cooking or eating or whatever.
-The speaker is phenomenal.

IN SUMMARY- I'm hoping that in 30 60 or 90 days I go back and update this review about all the new amazing features, but if you're adding features, or if it has less features then almost any other device you make, let the people buying it know. This is not your first echo show, and anyone would expect it to be at least as capable as a generic Android tablet. My family congregates in the kitchen, we FaceTime (and would use the Alexa app instead since we bought one for her) with Grandma, we would use your new scale that's linked to this thing, my wife has recipes she would put on it so that she never had to touch a screen or paper while cooking again. In short I could not imagine anybody more suited or closer to your target customer, but this isn't even as good as your normal tablet please tell us why. If it was more expensive I might even bother to return it, but now I'm just going to sit here with it in the corner hoping you give it a good update soon.",3.0 out of 5 stars

It's not just ads for content Amazon thinks you'd like (e.g., watch this latest Disney movie), but also ads Amazon is being paid to deliver to you (e.g., ads from third parties). It seems a bit much after you've paid $250 for the device. You can't use it as an uninterrupted photo frame because Amazon won't let you disable ads. Amazon wants you to think you're putting your grandchildren's pictures in a special place in your living room, because it wants you to bring its billboard to that special place. On a smaller device that sits in a corner of your kicthen counter, this may not be as bad, but do you really want guests to see ads for Metamucille next to your grandchildren's pictures?

Found I can view my spectrum subscription using the Silk browser on it with no problem but changing channels, volume and so forth are tedious since the unit isn’t designed for that kind of use. The preloaded apps don’t interest me and NOT being a fan of Fox News, I’m bothered by the fact that news channel provided by the built in fire tv tuner only has Fox News. Which IS NOT news. Was going to purchase the smaller unit for the kitchen but my iPad mini suits this purpose just fine. Product is not designed to be a portable. Just a sedentary home unit. Suggestion: follow Apple’s lead. They started this way. Limited expansion. Then eventually they had to succumb to allowing the unit such as iPads and iPhones, to run ANY app the consumer wanted.

Mason,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2022","UPDATED: Amazon support helped me factory reset the device. It is working better. It still struggled a bit with some of the commands around motion. For example, I'll say ""Alexa, Stop moving."" and it might slow down the video, or move before recognizing the command.

I am liking the device more and more from my previous review, but I might still suggest giving Amazon some time to figure this one out.

I have a number of Alexa devices (5) and have traded a few in along the way. This is by far the most disappointing one, and I suggest waiting for the next generation to come out. It is very glitchy. The problems I have had:
1. It constantly does not hear us well
2. It takes forever to load or react on any content from Amazon prime or a YouTube video, which can be frustrating when trying to entertain a 2 year old.
3. I constantly get a message about motion not working, but it is working fine
4. It seems quieter than previous devices
5. Finally, when I video call my elderly parents from the device they hear what is described as ""nails on a chalkboard"". I have an Alexa, and gave 1 to them so they can see their grandchild. This is very disappointing, and I will likely need to inquire about a return or trade in if it keeps happening.

Yes. I can call my parents from my other devices, but this one is conveniently placed so they can see us have dinner, or watch him play. The movement was meant so it would allow them to follow him a bit.

To be fair to the device, here are some of the pros:
1. The picture quality is great, and when the device DOES work to call my parents they said the image is great
2. You can put this one at a different tilt, where all the other Alexa devices sit pointing up as is you are standing over them. This one is nice because I can tilt it down a bit so my son can see it
3. When the movement isn't glitchy it is nice to have the follow feature

Amazon4Life,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2022","The novelty of Alexa Echo Show following your face or finding you in the room is interesting (at least once the initial absolute terror and creepiness wears off.) Nevertheless, practically, the face follow is a bit of a mess with video calling. My mother moves her body, in a kind of rocking manner when she speaks and she gesticulates with her hands frequently. Poor Echo Show trying to follow her makes you feel like you are in a new installment of Blair Witch Project. Zoom in, zoom out, move left move right, where are we? It is very distracting. I also find that the camera quality is terrible. Maybe because she's moving so much she never gets time to focus? So although the moving camera is novel, the execution leaves a lot lacking.

Overall, Alexa seems to take triple the time to respond on the new Echo vs the Gen 2 Echo. Really? I don't know why. Same internet, same location. She's slow.... Basically she's quietly saying ""patience young padawan... You MUST learn patience""

Also my mom SWEARS that the screen quality is less than her Gen 2 Echo. But she has dementia and failing eyesight so... I don't think I see any difference.

Pros of the new echo:
Built in privacy shield
Capability to join Zoom
It moves to find your face when you are anywhere in the room
360 speaker
Even more streaming integration options

Cons
Slow to respond, Alexa forgets what she's doing a lot (maybe it's just her company?)
Waves about wildly in video conference unless the speaker initiates ""statue mode"" while speaking
Slightly unstable base (compared to the Gen 2)

Would I buy it again? Part of me wishes I just got the giant TV Alexa but I don't think my mother would have been able to handle that much change at once.

The redeeming quality would be the sound. I was pleasantly surprised by the base and quality of sound for music.

Chels124,"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2022","I bought this for my mom who has dementia as a way to 1) drop in, 2) play music, 3) setup routines, 4) display photos from two family members and 5) display the date/time/temp. Below are my opinions:

1) The drop in calls freeze frequently.
2) The music is a nice feature and I’m glad it is included with prime membership. If this is some sort of free trial I am going to guffaw about it later.
3) The routines are okay, but don’t expect detailed routines out of the box. If you want Alexa to ask the user a question and answer based on response you have to start with blueprints which is a slightly more advanced feature.
4) I am really disappointed with photo sharing! My sister and I linked our Amazon accounts for the soul purpose of sharing and displaying photos from both of our Amazon photo accounts. It isn’t working at all and only displaying photos from one device. When you send a photo to the echo it doesn’t save in a folder or anything, I have no idea where they’re going.
5) 0/5 for the clock display settings. I cannot believe this device is incapable of adjusting the clock display. Im 33 years old and can’t see the date from 10-15 feet away. I thought this thing was designed for the size of a living room?

Overall, I think the device is just okay. It is not designed to have multiple users outside of voice ID. Don’t expect using the app on multiple phones to be easy. This isn’t great for elderly or cognitively impaired people if they don’t understand how to speak to AI well. Honestly, the only reason I feel like this device is so expensive is because of the motion control. We had to turn the motion control off because it constantly rotated around the room.

I'm disappointed in the functionality of the device in regards to running apps and live video/ TV. With live TV streaming apps and basic apps that run on phones, tablets, and smart TVs; this device is unable to process a majority of them.

This device is a little over 2 years old and works just like the 1st Generation Echo Show. It does less than a phone or tablet from 8 years ago. If it weren't for the audio/ music capabilities, I would return this item.

The Alexa feature is awesome in my Fire devices, my car entertainment system, and my Samsung Freestyle. That's what the Echo products should work towards. My family would like to watch live TV on this device and other Echo Shows.

Simple app recognition would be great too. I can listen to my Sirius XM subscription on the device, but the device can not display the artist, song, or music info. It's simple display issues like that which prevent me from rating Echo Shows higher than 3 stars.

Another minor issue is that the screen does not return to it's default position. The screen rotates to an odd angle that displays to no one.

I still have a little hope in the future Echo Show products, but Amazon needs to fix these issues. I've supported Echo for over a decade and have my Echo Loop hanging out on my desk waiting for it's resurgence....",3.0 out of 5 stars
Ct3lle,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2023","This thing is huge, which at first I seems great and then you realize you need a good spot to put it. For me, it adds too much clutter.

Yes the swivel / motion tracking is cool. Ipad pros will do it when FaceTiming but it’s nice this will follow you when looking at it for some time (like when cooking).

All that being said.. this is my first time getting an Echo of any kind and I have to say it is clunky as all get out. The navigation, the fact that any screens always come with example text of how to speak to Alexa (I don’t need tutorial text for the rest of my life), the fact that you can’t use other certain apps like Pinterest (you can ask Alexa to take you there and it just navigates to the web page which proceeds to be TERRIBLE quality photos on your pins), and the laggy screen response are all super disappointing. This honestly still feels like an introductory smart device.

I really wanted to love this and explore more of the features, like having it display my ring cameras, but considering I can do 99% of the same tasks from my phone and will not be tethered to my kitchen anyway, I’ll probably return (and I even got mine for a steal on prime day). They need to focus some of that Amazon R&D on UX/UI.

The guy who raved about this like it was the best thing since sliced bread buys and reviews like it’s his job, so take that into consideration. There are legitimate reasons to love this and many not to as well.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Vonda A.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2023","I got this for Christmas to use in the kitchen for recipes and to have the ability to watch videos/shows while cooking. I thought it would have the same ability as firestick to connect to various streaming apps...it doesn't. It can connect to about 5. I was looking forward to being able to pull up my favorite recipes that I struggle to see on my phone screen currently, but I can't. It is designed to pull up recipes from specific websites only. Ones that it has a relationship with, so you can't find the same recipes that you can with a simple internet search on any other device. Maybe the problem is that the search engine seems to be Bing. I've never had any luck using that as a search engine. If I had realized it was going to be like this, I would have just bought a tablet and tablet stand for my kitchen. What makes it even worse, it doesn't answer my questions, no matter how I reword them. Again, only able to understand certain content and when baffled picks the one word it understands and gives you some unrelated answer that doesn't even come close to what you are asking. My Google Home does a better job! If you just want it to tell you jokes, play music or ask the trivia question of the day, it works great, but not for much else. The rotate function keeps bumping into the wall even after being set up to understand where the turn radius is. One day it actually turned to follow me when I went out the door and faced the wall the whole time I was out of the room. When I returned, we had a hard time getting it to come out of the corner and face the room again. Very disappointed with this purchase.",3.0 out of 5 stars

1) The following/rotation is nice when you're watching or looking at something on the screen and you need to move around the room. (Ours is in a kitchen/breakfast area and it moves with you as you go back & forth.)
2) Being able to use it as a camera when you're not home to check on things. (See dislikes because this has 2 sides.)
3) Seeing photos from the past from our Amazon Photos account.
4) Integrated calendar
5) Music shows lyrics
6) Weather shows on the screen in between photos
7) Controlling smart home devices like lights.
8) Lists & Reminders
9) Good sound. (I'm not an audiophile, just an average guy who likes to listen to music and watch shows so for me it's fine.)

There are other things we like as well but you get the idea.

Dislikes:
1) Alexa is just not that great yet. I can't tell you how many times she says 'I don't know that.' and she can't answer the simplest things from the web. It would be better with Google Search instead. This is true for any Alexa enabled device. She does simple things very well but web based stuff doesn't work. (The Alexa app is also very slow on any phone I've ever used it on.)
2) (More of an annoyance) It can't follow you in low light as the screen doesn't have it's own light source or infrared.
3) The security camera (see 2 under the likes) doesn't have infrared so unless there's a light on it's useless at night which is probably the time you really want to be able to see things in your home when you're not there.
4) The 'Video Home' is limited. Right now it's just Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, tubi, Food Network Kitchen. You can go to YouTube but it opens on Amazon's Silk. Firefox also stopped support so only Silk is available for web browsing. I'm missing services I like such as Disney+, Pluto TV, HBO Max, etc. I'd like to be able to get all of these because then I'd use this device to replace the FireStick/TV combo in my kitchen and cut down on devices in that area. (Or, Amazon could have included an HDMI port to attach a FireStick!)

So, with all of that said I don't regret the purchase. I traded in a 1st gen Echo that I had in the kitchen to upgrade to this and there is a lot to like. It's just not totally where I'd like it to be yet. Alexa needs to get a LOT smarter still and there need to be all of the video options I'd get using a simple FireStick.",3.0 out of 5 stars
damocles,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2023","I hesitated to upgrade to Gen 3 as Gen 2 has amazing sound quality and that's what I usually use this for. I did check the specs and the supposed speaker upgrade. Perhaps its due to where I place this but the sound on Gen 3 is not as good as Gen 2 (and definitely not as loud). It is comparable and why I decided to keep this instead was due to the screen angling, camera and upgraded processor. I don't care for having the screen follow me around so its usually turned off which also houses a little shutter for the camera. I do find the build quality a bit suspect when compared to Gen 2. The buttons are more flimsy and the unit itself lacks heft. I hear some reviewers tell people to ignore the white power cord and that it is not a big deal....but in the kitchen it is a big deal and it seems silly for Amazon to overlook this. Fortunately, my Gen 2 has a black cord with the same specs that works just fine.

Alexa apps, 3rd party apps and Alexa AI are still a mess, no hardware upgrade is going to fix that. Why there is no ability to look for apps by device type is beyond me. I want to see everything that plays video on my show....still no option for that.

I would not spend $220 on this. But with the deal of $160 and a $60 trade in, $100 seems to be an acceptable upgrade.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Mark,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2023","I recently purchased the Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen), and while it offers some notable features, I have mixed feelings about its overall performance. I would rate it 3 out of 5 stars.

The smart display functionality of the Echo Show 10 is a standout feature, allowing for hands-free interaction and motion tracking. However, I found that the smart motion feature is not as intelligent as expected. In situations where there is noise or activity on one side of the kitchen while I'm on the other side, the device sometimes mistakes the noise for a command, interrupting my interaction. This can be frustrating, as it requires speaking louder to override the noise, impacting the user experience.

In terms of responsiveness, the Echo Show 10 fell a bit short of my expectations. While the touchscreen is functional, I was hoping for a more responsive interface, especially considering it is a newer model compared to the Echo Show 5. Unfortunately, the touchscreen responsiveness is similar to the Echo Show 5, which was a bit disappointing.

On a positive note, the sound quality of the Echo Show 10 is good, delivering good audio performance. It provides clear and immersive sound, making it a great option for enjoying music, podcasts, or video content.

In conclusion, the Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) offers some notable features such as smart motion and high-quality sound. However, the smart motion feature can be inconsistent in noisy environments, and the touchscreen responsiveness is not significantly improved compared to older models. If you prioritize audio performance and can work around the limitations mentioned, this smart display could still be a suitable choice for your needs.

Outdoor Indoor Texan,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2022","The first time I saw my sister's Echo Show 10 at her house, I was sold on getting one. I jumped all over the Prime Day sale and was soon setting up my very own Echo Show at our house.

Overall, it's s fun piece of tech that gives off quite the show. You can access streaming video services, recipe videos, weather, news, and all the other fun Echo Show tech of old, but now it sits on a nifty swiveling robot head that follows you around the room.

My biggest gripe is the huge missed opportunity to make Show to Show video calling easier. My sister has the same model Echo Show that we do, but after multiple days of troubleshooting, googling, watching youtube videos, and sending Help e-mails to Amazon, there doesn't seem to be any easy way to say, ""Alexa video call my sister's Echo Show"" and have a family video call. Yes it'll call peoples' phones if you connect your cell service to it, but even that was a herculean task to figure out. The whole interface is just maddingly overly complicated. Why is everything so complicated to set up and access?

Also, the facial recognition for the screen to follow you around the room only half works at times. The Follow function gives up if you take a beat to not move about. Also, if there's multiple people in the room, good luck. Just close the camera shutter or watch the robot have a meltdown trying to figure out who to follow.

All in all, I'm not returning it or hucking it to the trash, but it's been fairly disappointing how short the technology has fallen. I'm hoping the forthcoming updates will address some of the bugs, and make video calling easier to navigate, but at this point it seems like Amazon rushed something out that wasn't quite ready for market.",3.0 out of 5 stars
A B.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2022","This device is a good idea however it doesn’t work most times when using the “drop in” feature. I have it at my Mom’s house to check in on her from a distance. I use the drop-in feature because at this point the device is too complicated for her to use. The problem with the feature is that when I end the connection on the Alexa app to the echo 10 the echo 10 does not hang up. This prevents a new connection next time I try to drop-in. The only solution is to get in my car and drive there to press the screen’s red “end icon”. Once that is done I can then initiate a new “drop in” call. This seems to be an easy fix for the programmers at Amazon. Just have the echo 10 timeout the “drop in” call if there are no activities from the caller. Yes, I chatted with their tech support. About 12 of them. Annoying as hell. You just get passed on from one tech person to another tech etc. with no one knowing what to do. I felt I knew more about the echo 10 then amazon’s tech support. All 12 of them. It’s a shame. And being an engineer I certainly know more about solving problems than all of them. I am going to keep the device because it does save me one daily trip. Drop in, works at lease once a day after my drive there to touch the “end” call icon. However the product truly is not ready for prime time. If 12 Amazon techs and me (engineer), and many hours chatting with them cannot resolve the problem. The echo 10 needs much more bug fixes.",3.0 out of 5 stars

They give you temporary support( meaning they fix the problem, and a couple of days later, it acts up again). The camera sometimes doesn't work. The screen moves when it wants.

Devices in adjacent rooms come to my rescue when they hear me shouting... Why has this latest offering seen a degradation of its primary purpose in life!
The screen following your movements was a cute addition but quickly became confused in my busy kitchen and just starting moving back and forth as if to say, ""No! I give up!'. Further, I found myself pulling it out from against the wall every day as some well-intentioned member of my family insisted on pushing it back against the wall.

R. Garrett,"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2022","I've owned this for 1.5 years now so am comfortable stating what I like and dislike. I upgraded from an Echo Show 2nd Gen and really liked that device. The new tracking feature is what attracted me to upgrade.

The tracking is very good. I have this in the kitchen and get my morning news brief while making a cappuccino and my breakfast. As I walk around the kitchen, it tracks me well so I can glance over at what is on the screen at a great viewing angle at all times.

The downfall of this device is the microphones. I [had] another echo device in the room next to the kitchen. There is one wall and about 20 feet of distance separating them. Many times while standing and looking at the echo for a command, the device in the next room would respond or start playing music. So the microphone on the device 20 feet away is more sensitive than the device 5 feet away. It became so frustrating that I unplugged the other device.
Another issue with the microphone is with general commands. If I'm playing music or news and give it the command ""Alexa stop"", it will sometimes pause briefly and then continue playing as if it doesn't care about what I'm asking. I've tried ""Alexa, home screen"" and it will react the same way with a brief pause as it listens and then just continues on with what it was doing. Repeating the command many times will eventually get it to stop. There have been multiple times I just unplug it to get it to stop though.

To me, this device was a step backwards in voice recognition and/or quality of the microphones. I will have to think if I want to jump on being an early adopter in the future.",3.0 out of 5 stars

For example, when motion is enabled or disabled, when touching the screen, the screen doesn’t stand firm and moves while trying to tap on anything on the screen. Very inconvenient, which means with the rest of the hand you have to hold the screen and with your thumb tap whatever you’re trying to tap on the screen.
Also, this unit doesn’t seem to respond as well to Low volume voice commands. Sometimes you do have to yell. This was way better with the echo show that I used to have.

WilliamR,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2021","This is for the Echo 10.

The ability for Alexa to retrieve answers from the Internet is fantastic, a true assistant. However, the product is bugged by numerous issues.

The rotation is whacky to put it bluntly. Sometimes it turns to face us other times it never moves (we are sitting at the same spot every time and nothing is blocking it from turning). I have to get up and turn it myself which then it will turn OK for a while. Sometimes (again sitting in the same spot we always do) it will turn 180 degrees away from us and give the answer. Once again, we have to get up and turn it manually to correct it. I have run the motion calibration numerous times and it never fixes it. Sometimes during certain skills (e.g. song quiz) it starts turning left and right back and forth repeatedly like it is confused. This is when there are only 2 people playing and we are once again sitting in the same spot we always do and not moving around at all.

HUGE issue is that when you play music from the Echo 10 at about half volume or even less, you cannot speak to Alexa anymore. She will not trigger anymore or recognize our voice. The music seems to drown it out. Even when raising your voice. I have to cup my hands around my mouth, lean in toward Alexa and holler her name to make her hear me.

On the positive the sound quality is FANTASTIC with amazing bass and quality.

Integration with home devices, skills, add ons, etc. is VERY easy and straight forward.

I wish I could use the app to control the Alexa device itself instead of the app acting like a standalone Alexa. This would help the music issue if I could just say to my phone Alexa next song and then have the Echo skip the song (or raise/lower volume, etc.)

While it does have a lot of negatives, this is still a fantastic device with great features and powerful tool to be a home assistant and automate your home or just be the brains in the house to answer your questions. It does need another round of testing/tweaking to be perfect, but still serviceable.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Carlo LaMonica,"Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2021","For years I did not have any Alexa devices, then I received a couple Alexa Echo Dot 3rd Gens for free while ordering some other equipment for my office. The usefulness of Alexa as a virtual assistant was immediately apparent and I was impressed with my Echo Dot's responsiveness and sound given its small formfactor. So after getting used to how Alexa works and it's features, I saw these being advertised. I expected it to be far better Alexa device compared to Echo Dot 3rd Gen. I guess my expectations were a little too high.

First of all, it is less responsive than my Echo Dots. I often find myself having to repeat myself two or three times before it understands me. I almost never have to repeat myself with my Echo Dots.

Second, it is almost as if I have to be looking directly at it for it hear what I am saying. I understand that I should be somewhat directing my voice in its general direction, but again I am used to my Echo Dot 3rd Gens hearing me whether I am looking directly at them or turned completely around. It may be the way the microphones are configured in these new devices that inhibits it's ability to distinguish my voice on the other side of the room.

Also, the Hulu app is not set up for profiles.

I'll be another one to mention that the cord doesn't make sense. It is really short. And a white cord with a black device just aesthetically looks stupid.

We put ours in the Kitchen and it is really great for Watching a show while cooking or cleaning. However, I am in no hurry to upgrade my other Alexa devices with this supposedly next generation version.

Bottom line, I feel as the Echo Dot 3rd Gens are better devices. Sure these have some cool features and the integration of some streaming services (although some the main ones are missing), but it is less responsive, not as user friendly, and in my opinion the sound quality is little subpar. This is another case where instead of making the best next gen device, Amazon went for a quick release of a half-baked product, which I am sure they will fix over time with updates. Until then, this only deserves a 3-Star for now.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Jack Bennett,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2021","I was prepared to love the Echo Show 10. I have a lot of pictures and was thinking of getting a digital picture frame, and when I saw the Echo Show 10 was on sale for $199, I decided that all the other things it did made it worth a little more money. I saw reviews where people complained about ""Alexa for your day"", but I thought the other advantages of the Echo Show 10 would outweigh the annoyance.

I loaded about 1000 pictures to Amazon Photos, and quickly noticed that a small subset kept cycling through on the Home Screen. I counted the number of screens before they recycled, and it is about 35 (including the ""Alexa for your day"" screen). Periodically, new pictures were included in the rotation, but by and large it was the same few.

Telling Alexa to ""Show Photos"" was better, but her response is ""Showing some of your photos"". I still saw some photos frequently, and have never seen others. I don't want some, I want all. Even though there are still a lot of photos that cycle through more quickly than they should its more tolerable.

I have called customer service three times and although everyone UI talked to is very nice I have not been able to find someone who can help me. They tell me they will elevate it, but I have not heard a peep from them. There is an option in the settings to curate your photos, but I have it turned off. I suspected that there was a bug in the software, but since Alexa has been telling me that she will show some of my photos I am beginning to wonder if it is intentional. If it is, just let me know.

I really like the other features, the picture quality is great; being able to watch Amazon Prime Video and Netflix is great; and listening to my Amazon Prime music is great. However, I have to make a decision within the next week about keeping it. I didn't think it would be coming to this.

LowcountryGuy,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","Update: They allowed you to stop all the annoying advertisements and recommendations on the screen. Additionally, they are slowly improving the tracking feature. I have already noticed more then 50% of the time it is properly tracking me.

Like many others I was very excited to receive this echo show 10

The main features we bought it for were to expand our home audio setup, the security camera and the rotating screen.

Indoor camera:
The first major flaw I noticed was when using the echo show 10 as an indoor camera. I’m short, only 5’10” and like most people a comfortable viewing angle of the echo show 10 would have the screen tilted upwards. Well, the camera can not be remotely tilted up or down. So if you want to use the echo show 10 as an indoor camera you have to remember to angle the screen down manually every single time you leave in order to have a good picture of your home. Otherwise all you see is midway up the wall and ceiling of your home. This basically renders the show useless for home monitoring, especially if you want to see your four legged friends.

The motion tracking:

This is off, they have the camera offset and the algorithm to detect and track where you are acts as if the camera is centered. Therefore instead of centering the camera on you it has the screen offset slightly to the left. Amazon could easily fix this with an update.

The audio:

The audio is excellent, not as good as the studio, but better then the echo.

The user interface:
The UI is attractive but not intuitive. There are annoying prompts and tag lines from Alexa that I could do without. In addition the menus appear to be laid out in no particular order. We also use Google homes, and their interface is substantially more user friendly and intuitive. I hope amazon takes not and makes the appropriate changes to make their displays more user friendly. I went through and said to not show certain topics multiple times and it still pushed the same topics to the display.

Although the audio is great, we ended up returning both echo show 10s because the other features were not what we were expecting.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Without optimal lighting, the Show10 Acts like a drunken sailor on shore leave pointing in the wrong room and calling me my wife’s name. Classy. The screen is great but the same old software only allows the same boring clock and endless rotation of pictures or ads. Where is the customization that allows me to arrange a useful split screen such as schedule, weather, formattable clock, current news headlines, grocery list? At the same time I had purchased a set of studio echoes and placed them in my adjoining home theater. While the show 10 misses my words, since it is pointing in the wrong direction, the distant overachiever Echo Studios Will answer, as though to cover for their mentally challenged sibling, the show 10. And then the touchscreen, if you touch it to get the smart screen our options, the screen will half the time say that it has bumped into something and try to move away. My home was lucky and received the invitation only very first echoes a year before they came to market. During that time Amazon listened to us and made the changes that made it work in real-world.

I have no idea what search engine the echo show uses but it never shows the same recipes that show up using a basic google or bing search. So for what I bought this for, it performs mediocre.

***November 2023 Update*** this still performs terribly. It constantly shuts wifi off on its own and can’t performed the same basic smart home tasks that other echo devices have no issue with.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2022","The Echo Show 10 is a fairly attractive device and with a 10.1 inch screen which by no means dominates a room. One of the key benefits of this device is its screen's ability to rotate on its base and follow you based on inputs from the microphone and camera. However, this functionality has some issues. For example, if a fan is operating close to the Echo device, it will rotate to the direction of the fan noise- and not budge regardless of human voice commands. You can tell Alexa to start or stop motion tracking.

It shares the same screen resolution and processor of the Echo Show 8 Second generation and presumably the 8 would be as good during video calls as the 10- sans rotation. The Echo Show 10 has an AZ1 AI processor that is primarily used to support its motion tracking feature and also provide faster voice response. The audio on the Echo 10 can fill a large room with sound and is of reasonable quality.

Voice recognition is good- however it lacks the ability to distinguish people in a household based on voice or facial recognition. Presumably at some point the Echo Show 15 will have a facial recognition feature, as it is supported by its more powerful AZ2 AI processor.

It is reasonable to look at the 10's products overall quality, appearance, future update availability, etc.- not just a set of isolated features. In this respect the Echo 10 is a mixed bag. It is well done- but not exceptional.",3.0 out of 5 stars
BS,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2021","Even though I have several Echo devices from the dot to the previous versions of show and have been happy with them (despite some occasionally disappointing days when she didn't seem to understand anything I was saying). I was excited to get this yesterday, because it addressed one thing that has been missing with the show, the moving screen.
I don't always sit or stand in the same spot when I was asking questions or making calls, so to see the answer on the show, I would run around to the correct side of the screen. So I opened it right away when I got home from work, it setup easy as the devices always do with even with the addition of the movement pattern test. But then I started to use it and it didn't move. I had just had it moving for the test, so I knew it should work and I kept moving around the room...nothing as far as moving the screen goes (the audio responses were always fine.) One time when I was testing it from almost directly in front of it, a little message came up that said movement was impaired because it was too dark (something to that effect). Granted it was dark outside but I had a large screen TV on so it was as light as I usually have it, so I turned on a lamp....no movement....two lamps....no movement and the message came up. Finally turned on the overhead light, in addition to the 2 lamps and the light from the tv...it finally moved. Turned off one of the lamps...no movement. This morning with the sun streaming in the sunroom where I have it positioned, movement works just fine. So apparently to work right, the room has to be lit up like a movie set...which is not a reasonable situation at all times. Desperately hoping this gets fixed with a firmware solution soon...if it can be fixed that way. Otherwise, it isn't worth the extra money and I will remain, very disappointed in this Alexa.",3.0 out of 5 stars
BluePnut,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2021","I'm still on the fence with maybe a bit of buyers remorse right now. I had the original Echo Show. Bought it when it first came out. Pre-ordered actually. Later I got one for each of my elderly parents (80/88). We use them for easy video calls and they excel for that with elderly people. I'm a techie and an early adopter. Two things I don't like about this Echo Show 10 so far are, 1. Low light results in no movement. Normally we have a couple lights on and the 55"" TV in the living room plus several Luminare candles. Its not can't see clearly across the room dark, but it's not lit up like the middle of a retail store bright either. Who sits in their living room at night lit up like that anyway? This is disappointing, as how can this be used as security, or to check on your house, if it needs that much light? That tells me it can only be used for security/home check in the daytime, which is disappointing. 2. It doesn't handle photos seemlessly like my Google Home Hub does. If it's a phone photo, it throws it in the center and puts a blurred stripe on either side or top and bottom. My Google puts more than 1 on the screen to fill it if needed. It uses the whole screen, not a strip of it. Google hub photos are seemless no matter what you took them on. This is only seemless for 35mm photos. Phone photos are small and look odd on the screen. Altho I shoot a lot in 35 when I travel, most use phones as their primary camera these days. If they can make ads and junk show full screen, they should be able to make photos too. My Echo Show is black. My Google Home Hub is white and on my kitchen counter. Take a look at the photos and see for yourself. Both show photos taken on a phone. Big difference on presentation. I might be swapping the new Echo Show back to the kitchen, if I don't return it.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Eric van der Vlugt,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","I really like almost everything about the new show, with one glaring exception, the offset camera. Since the camera is offset to the upper right side of the screen instead of the center, when it tries to track you in calls or watching shows, the camera centers on you instead of the screen. That means the screen is always swiveled and pointing slightly left of where you are actually standing. It is similar to the previous shows in that way, but the previous versions were stationary so you could center yourself to the screen if you wanted to. Now with the tracking feature, you literally can't center yourself in the camera and on the screen in calls unless you turn off the tracking feature. I have looked through all the settings to try and see if there is a way to change that orientation, but so far I have not found anything. Hopefully, Amazon can address that in an update. How this could have made it out of production without addressing that issue is baffling to me. moving the camera to where the microphone is in the center would have solved this so easily. I'll try it for a few more days, but I think it might be just too annoying unless tracking is turned off, in which case this is being returned since that was the main reason I purchased it.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Ehdeen,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2023","I wanted to use this as a smaller version of my echo show 15 for my desk. I love having a consistently displayed self-updating calendar and to do lists that I can edit from anywhere. I wanted to be able to just glance at my calendar or to-do list from my desk, make the occasional video call, and ask Alexa to add reminders. But the single feature I really want is just to be able to glance at my darn calendar! I can do that with the 15, but not the 10.

Why can’t I just have it statically display these things for me? I love the compact size but now it’s a $200 paperweight because it won’t:

1) consistently display a calendar and/or to do list no matter the settings I tried.
2) when asked to display my calendar, it shows only a daily version whereas I would like to see month/week and then I can scroll.
3) despite disabling the myriad of preset home content features/ads I’m still getting the occasional ad splashed across the screen.
4) insult to injury it seems to detect the bookshelf behind me as a person and keeps reorienting the camera to it even after I updated its “at rest” positioning.

I'm going to get a Ring doorbell camera soon though, so maybe this will be the thing that actually makes the Echo show useful to me. When I go on vacations it seems like I'm ALWAYS having issues viewing my home through the echo show camera. Occasionally it needs to be rebooted because it stops working properly.

All the Good Names are taken!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2021","My overall complaint is about the feature that I, and probably many others, purchased the Echo show 10 for in the first place: Tracking.
Extremely poorly implemented! I have wyze cameras (pan tilt) that function (seek/tracking) that outperform the show at fractions of the cost.

Tracking is slow, and inaccurate. Always centered on the camera, and not the screen to the viewer. This is a problem, as the camera is not centered on the screen and it's placement is on the far right corner.
This creates a viewing angle that is uncomfortable (and could have been avoided programmatically or by design). Tilting your head results in further movement to ""correct"" so that the viewing angle is almost always ""off"" by several degrees. This leads to another problem with tracking: head vs face tracking. Turning your head signals a position changes needlessly. Ones head facing does not necessary corelate to ones eyes (viewing). Important distinction. So also is the odd viewing angle. The viewing angle could be resolved by calculating position relative to the center of the screen and not the camera. Tracking the eyes would also help with the very often present ""back and forth"" tracking while you are mostly stationary and trying to view the screen. The result now, is that the screen is ""shaking it's head at you"" while you are trying to view what is on the screen.

These issue are by design, and could be fixed with a software update I wager. Honestly, this should have been noticed in testing and quality control. Feels very much BETA (as so often Alexa devices are presented for sale to the public).

Speakers and screen size and quality are perfectly fine. I enjoy these features. Resolution could be better, but acceptable for reading recipes and so forth. Sound is fine for ""kitchen"" listening as well. No major complaints there.",3.0 out of 5 stars
JDC,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2021","Early on we became an Alexa family. We have about 6 throughout the house, and it has become our family intercom system (as well as the obvious other uses). Having gone through a few earlier Echo Shows, I was excited to have this Echo Show 10 in the kitchen! I was especially excited to have it follow me as I cook.

So... first off... it sounds great, and the normal menu functions are there and working just fine. I've noticed it doesn't seem to 'hear' as well as our other Alexa's (this is the first one that we feel we need to repeat ourselves and or say something slower). But there are a few things in Gen1 here that you'll want to be aware of:

1) It needs extra counter space - the swinging screen is a great idea, just remember that putting that glass on the counter next to it is like standing next to a door that swings open and you're in the way. There will need to be a movement zone on your counter.

2) It kinda looks at you -- the follow function isn't half bad. It works. I just wish it looked at me DIRECTLY. It always seems to lock onto me a consistent 20 degrees off. Makes me feel like it has a droopy eye or something ;-)

3) If you pick it up and move it (say to clean your counter), the slightest turn will mean you'll need to recalibrate how much it swings back and forth. The most innocent move on the counter can end up having your screen bump into the walls or not looking where it needs to.

I feel like some of these real world issues will eventually be resolved. Just know - they aren't yet! I give it a total of 3.5 stars",3.0 out of 5 stars
BN1SIX4,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2021","For how much you have to spend you’d expect it’s main function of listening to your voice when you speak to it to work better than older/previous models. I have been thinking about up grading or switching to google but bc I have several smart plugs and devices that connect to the echos I decided that the new version has to perform better. I was wrong. If you have any background noise it still struggles to pick your voice up. My brother and his wife use the google assistant and their device performs much better it seems like with background noise and you can turn on/off multiple things at once while this one you have to wait for the prompt to do a second device. Picture quality is excellent so I’m not going to completely bash the product. I like that it has Hulu Netflix and Amazon prime I do wish it had the ability to add other video streaming services that may not be their fault entirely. I like the follow feature and it has made communication with my parents that live 2k miles away easier and more convenient since they have the same in their home. It doesn’t activate randomly so far like the echo and the dots did and the sound quality is surprisingly good. For $200 I expect the basic functionality part of something to work much better than its much cheaper counter parts.

To sum up it is just like every other Alexa device with a good sound system and a camera/screen that follows you while you talk which you can turn off. My last complaint is and I hope someone at Amazon reads this and responds with a solution is that when you buy a black device instead of a white one the cords should match. It sticks out when you have a white cord attached to a black device.",3.0 out of 5 stars

K. H.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2021","We are an Alexa household having started with the earliest devices to this one.

This one is really big, it doesn't fit in a niche, it can't be hid, it is very present.

Unboxing it was just plain scary, the screen is attached to the barrel of the device and that barrel rotates, freely, very freely so you are trying to unbox it and it is flopping around, rotating around the axis of the device.

Once you have it unboxed, you have to plug in the power adapter which plugs into the bottom of this freely rotating hunk of electronics with that screen that you don't want to break..............very stressful.

Once you get through the setup, where it displays the very wide arc of motion it is capable of, you realize you have this really big device that needs a lot of room to accommodate its footprint and the arc through which it will move. If it bumps ANYTHING, it complains and demands that you clear the space.

Whenever you use it, like setting a timer, then it will follow you as you move in the room. I have it in the kitchen and when there is a recipe on it, I'll appreciate the movement more because as I move around the kitchen, it will be easy to double check the recipe.

I don't know, we have used Echo devices since their inception. They started as one 'hub' and lots of pucks around the house. Then the pucks started to have screens and then the pucks devolved into spheres and it has led to this device the largest, by far, of the Echo devices.

It does work but the size of it has to be accommodated and that makes it a bulky addition to the Echo family, so far my overall reaction is 'meh'.",3.0 out of 5 stars

After retrying the setup several times without success, I decided to reset it to “factory settings”. I then re-entered all of my account information which wasn’t hard but was time consuming. Once that was done I was able to enable the camera setting. The other problem is that for the size of it’s speaker you would think that it sounded it great, well be prepared to be disappointed as it sounds like a 1990’s bookshelf stereo. I’m sure that the sound is fine to use for a video call, or while viewing a video, which by the way doesn’t look bad at all on it’s large screen. However if you thought that the Echo could be used as a replacement for a good home wireless High Fidelity speaker system, then think again. Other than that it works pretty much as advertised, just keep in mind that it needs a bigger “foot print” than any other Echo Device due to the size of that screen when it swivels around.

When playing multi room music, it would stop and loud static would broadcast for about 30 seconds then continue playing multiroom.

I'm disappointed with the sound quality as it sounds tinny with very little bass for depth even after adjusting EQ curve. Ver 1 just sounds better. Because of the two major issues with sound and sacrificing nice features, I cannot recommend. If this is your first device it may not be a big deal but compared to ver 1, 2 and 3, this would be the least value for sound especially when it constantly injects 30 sec of white noise too many times daily.

Excellent hardware (sound quality/depth, screen resolution, camera quality). Like the form factor as well. Overall features are good, except the goofy and gimmicky motion sensor. However, what makes this an “absolute do not buy” for me is the ad-delivery only trash software. A main use case for me for this product was to use it (by default) as a digital photo frame (which the product detail page clearly states as a supported feature). However, it just does not work. I am not a tech novice and have tried all the options and trouble-shooting. The capability is there, but it just does not execute. The photos stop playing randomly, and lately they don’t show as wallpaper items at all (even though you select it in system preferences).

I could use the camera for a minute. Now it won’t work, drop ins never worked, and It won’t even do the photos for display anymore. It’s basically a dot with a useless screen to me at this point. Have reset device several times, reset router, moved device which actually started close to the router. I have uninstalled, logged out and reset my Alexa app many times as well. My network has the power to do this but the device updated and won’t work as advertised now with no way to uninstall the update. Whenever I reset the update is already on there. If you want five stars or my money fix the bugs. I plan to return it",3.0 out of 5 stars
Tangerinescream,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2022","I'm a die hard Amazon customer and have loved my Show 5 and 8. Both were responsive and lovely, really helped keep my ADHD brain on track. Earlier this year I splurged on this demon of a product. It was beautiful and seductive with the sharp screen and fantastic speakers. I couldn't resists and like a relationship that is doomed from the start, she and I aren't compatible. This Alexa has poor voice recognition, so bad in fact that my Show 8 two rooms away can hear my requests before she does - and often will play something random, instead of my request. Forget about touch responsiveness, this shit is so slow that ofter I just give up. I've updated, restarted to no avail. She just gets worse and worse. Today was the last straw, trying to play music from my laptop - heaven help. Show 8 connects so quickly and this beast just shakes and taunts me with her functionless beauty. What a waste Amazon. Currently researching the google home hub, I would rather convert my home to google and have no headaches than deal with this any longer. A real shame.",3.0 out of 5 stars
JenNifer,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2021","I've had several Alexa's before, but I thought this one's follow feature looked cool so I purchased it. I was surprised and dismayed to find that you have to leave the camera cover open all the time for this feature to work. It would have been nice if Amazon had also added the option to follow your voice (since it IS based on voice activation and technology), instead of the camera needing to see you to be able to move.

I can't imagine that most people would want to keep the camera lens open all the time. What's the point of the camera lens, then? This is a majority security flaw and although the idea is good, the implementation and options of said implementation are fair at best.

Also, I told it per the directions ""Alex, stop moving"" on a Monday night, and on Tuesday when I woke up, Alexa was turned around facing the back. I've since gone to Settings > Motion and toggled off the first option and hopefully, this will permanently fix the issue.

If you already have an Alexa and are thinking about replacing it with this one, save your money. The only thing this does is move left to right and you have to create a security risk by keeping your camera lens open all the time in order to use this feature. I did give it a 3 because despite it's flaws, it still has the largest screen of any Alexa device to-date and still works great like an Alexa does.",3.0 out of 5 stars
rda,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2023","I originally was very happy with my echo 10. Came in handy to check security cameras. After just over a year (no longer in warranty), the echo 10 dropped off the network. Tried to reconnect to my network but it failed after entering password. Did all Amazon's FAQ ideas to reset network and echo. No dice. After about the 6th reset of the device, it no longer found ANY networks - not only mine but all the others of that might have been nearby. It would spin and spin on the screen where it's looking for them. Since everything else was working fine on the device, it appears that the wireless adapter went bad. Called Amazon who said it was out-of-warranty but that they would give me a 15% discount towards a new one. Also, they said I could possibly trade it in as well. Either way, I doubt I'll get a new one. Hardware seems flaky and I'll just stick with my lower-end models of echos. 2 stars all around on this product. :-(",3.0 out of 5 stars
Jeff Davis,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2021","The new Amazon Echo 10 Show is a good design with poor execution. The thing is constantly spinning and maybe too sensitive. When two people are talking it doesn't know what to do so I look over to see when smoke is going to start coming out of its ears because of the stress it looks like it's under. The poor thing.

The other observation is that the camera does a great job at zeroing in on me but since the camera is all the way to the right side and mounted straight on the screen (instead of at a slight angle) the display always faces a little bit to the left of me to let the camera look directly at me. I usually want to tap it to the right but doing so leads to a whole process asking me if anything was in the way that it might have bumped into. I don't want to touch it because I feel so bad for the thing.

Mine is sitting on the counter next to the wall and I play ALOT of music through it. I think it sometimes picks up the music through its microphone that is bouncing off of the wall. The poor little dear sometimes stares at the wall like I put it into timeout.

Matt C,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2021","I have owned just about every Echo device there is. This one is not my favorite. First the PROS: Sound quality is great. I paired it with a echo sub and it sounds awesome. Screen looks good, bright clear images. It is nice to be able to use it as a security camera when away from home to check on dogs while gone. I like that you can speak through it and move the camera with a swipe of your phone. Now the CONS: It does not return to the “idle position” until 10 mins of no movement. So if you talk to it while on one side of the room and then go to the other side of the room when it isn’t following you, then it will stay pointed away from you. Until you call upon it again, then it will swing over to the sound of your voice. There needs to be a timer that you can set until it returns to the “idle position”. It doesn’t follow you if there are two or more people in the room. It will follow the person closest to the screen. The moving screen does work ok if there isn’t anyone else in the room, but since mines in the kitchen, there is always someone else it wants to follow. I like the idea of the moving screen, but it doesn’t work like it should. Debating on wether or not to return it. I’m going to test it out a little more before I make up my mind.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Meanwhile the three other devices in the next rooms are picking it up easily. It has the most issues with Internet connectivity, and it takes the longest to respond to any requests. And when there is music playing from Amazon Music on the connected ""everywhere"" group which involves over 10+ echo devices, it will stop playing a song 15 seconds before the song ends. Every time. The sound output is decent, however a typical new generation Echo Dot paired with the old school Echo subwoofer still sounds way better over it. The display is the same as any other Echo device.

tobor,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2023","I've got 9 Echo devices in my home. I've been using Echos (and upgrading to the latest models) since they were first made available. This Echo Show 10 replaced an Echo Show 8 (1st Generation) in my kitchen. I use it multiple times each day to play Spotify, listen to radio (via TuneIn), set timers, etc. The sound quality is very good and I place it only slightly behind my Echo Studio + Echo Sub pair as it pertains to sound quality.

The screen is, likewise, excellent. I have my Show 10 set to rotate a series of fine art prints I've uploaded to Amazon Photos and the colors really pop and look gorgeous on the screen. I find this feature really enhances the ambiance in my kitchen and every time I glance at the screen and see a piece of art I'm glad I purchased the device. I like the screen being larger than the Show 8, although I don't think I'd recommend an expensive ""upgrade"" merely for the screen size.

I have read that many people dislike the number of ads or stories that the Show 10 displays. You can go into settings and select the content you want to see. I've reduced it to only weather and news--everything else is turned off. I almost never see ads and feel that this type of criticism is unwarranted. My Show 10 (like my Show 8) displays content I've allowed and almost nothing more.

The Echo Show 10 loses a star for voice responsiveness. I have it placed in a corner that is pretty wide and open--it's not obstructed in any way. Unfortunately, about 30% of the time the device doesn't ""hear"" a command when I'm standing 4 feet away. Instead, my Echo Studio--which is in an entirely different room--responds. Sometimes it is even worse with an Echo in my bedroom (which is multiple rooms away) responding to my attempt to set a timer whilst in the kitchen. I find it very odd and frustrating. My first generation Echo (the original) did a far better job in this area than the Echo Show 10. And as far as I can tell there is no way to set the mic sensitivity via the Alexa app. That said, the positives still outweigh this negative, but I'm dropping 1 star from my rating.

I'd also add that the ""follow"" feature in which the device's screen moves to face you is not very compelling for me. I can envision other people finding it useful, but for me it seems more like a gimmick. The device is generally reliable following me, but whenever it reaches the edge of the boundary I set it flashes a giant warning message that I'm out of range. That large pop-up is really annoying and there is no way to turn it off. If it didn't flash that warning literally EVERY time I work in the kitchen I might be able to overlook it--as it is, it's just a reminder that Amazon has failed to improve the device. There should be a way to turn off that notification.

The Echo Show 10 is a decent device, but I'm not so sure of the value proposition. Adding a motor to turn the screen increases complexity and cost yet the benefits of this design are not compelling. And because this is the only device in the Echo lineup to employ this feature, Amazon hasn't really prioritized improving Echo Show 10 functionality. I don't know what is going on with the mic sensitivity, but it's not as good as it should be. The sound quality, however, is solid, and the screen is decent and a great size.",4.0 out of 5 stars
A. Pena,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2021","Full disclosure, I receive gift cards from my place of work from time to time and I used some of that money to pay for half of this unit, though it is not related to Amazon of course so this review is fully of my own opinions.

I own a few of the Amazon Echo show units dating back to the original Gen 1 Echo Show (7 inch). I currently still own that unit and had a place in my kitchen for several years. My wife now working from home needed an Echo in her upstairs office (where it was becoming troublesome to reach her from the other end of the house) so instead of purchasing an all new one, we decided based on her casual usage that we would replace the Gen 1 Echo Show with the latest generation for the kitchen. At the time, I wasnt aware of the new Echo Show 10, but was intrigued to find out there was a new version with a motorized screen display. I am somewhat of an early adopter, but my profession is in computer/electrical engineering and wanted to see if this was worth the substantial increase in costs. The gift card funds just help take that sting out of the purchase that made the decision easier over the costs of the non motorized Show product line.

Unboxing:
Unboxing was straight forward if you are familiar with the Show lineup and not much to say other than that reviews had led me to believe the unit was big, but I was not surprised by what I found. Essentially a large speaker base with what appears to be a tablet stuck to it, not that surprising and what anyone would expect. The cable like many others have mentioned on the charcoal colored unit is a bit annoying that it is white, but not the end of the world. Just would have appreciated more attention to this detail. Packaging looked well capable of protecting the unit as it was a box within a box, within another Amazon box, but this is where I have a small gripe. Did we need 3 boxes for this, Amazon, please work on the overuse of packaging for wastage.

Setup:
Setup was pretty standard if you have ever performed an Echo setup, but a bit elongated to perform the turning radius setup limits which is handy if your Show will have objects nearby or walls to contend with. I have none in this case as it is going at the end of the counter bar that divides the Den area with the Kitchen area. It can turn 360 degrees freely and this was easy to see how to limit or run unhindered. The rest of the setup was just confirming the Amazon account, wireless connection, and home screen details. All within about 3 minutes or less.

First impressions:
My first impressions were the unit is very sleek looking and the weight seemed adequate for the unit to be stable on the bench. The screen was perfectly bright and just the right size to view from a reasonable distance. The speed of the rotation as some have mentioned being too slow I found just fine as I want it to be quiet (which it is in motion - perfectly silent) and yet not aggressive in the movements as to call too much attention to the unit. My family thought it was pretty interesting how it can follow if you interact with it, but normally it stay put unless you ask it a question. In locating the person to point at with the voice trigger, I actually found the unit a little less sensitive to the wake command than any of my other generation units including the latest 8 inch and 5 inch Show units (I own 4 x 8 inch units and 4 x 5 inch units, along with 3 echo dots). In fact I have an upstairs Echo Show 8 (open ceiling through the Den into the movie theater room, that many times ""bongs"" to the wake command sooner than the kitchen one will standing within a few feet of this new unit. This isnt a huge issue once you get used to it, but I hope Amazon tweaks the sensitivity of the wake command to be more in line with other models in the lineup. One of the reason I got this new unit was my impressively fast results with the other latest generation Echo Show 8 units being so fast to work a command over the 1st generation.

After a few weeks of usage:
I have found that the unit motorized feature is a little bit of a novelty, but in daily use it has been a welcome change. For the price difference, I am right on the fence of whether I would pay the difference knowing what I know now and I know that may not help anyone reading this, but it is really right there with I would or wouldnt pay the extra. As the price knowingly will come down over time, this should become easier to make a decision.

Sound Quality:
Sound quality is above par for my expectations, as it is more clear than the preceding model. It has more depth to me and sound dispersion to 360 degrees is far better than the rear/side facing speakers of the past. Potentially largely due to the screen being out of the way which is a bit expected. Louder volumes were reached without distortion compared to previous units and the highs were clear and pronounced without overdoing it. Happy with this as an area speaker, but this wont replace your bookshelf stereo for instance. It can be paired with other devices so you can expand this if necessary.

Motion tracking:
As mentioned from others, this is a bit laggy, but in the ""works well enough"" category. It is not quick to jump around, but can trail someone easily walking around. What I found is that it rarely loses focus of the individual completely even though it will trail the motion. And if the user is continuing to speak, it almost never loses track of the user in my testing. Of note, it of course does not track up and down as the motorized function is swivel only, but the wide angle of the lens makes this mostly unnecessary.

Final verdict:
Would I get this again? In this same scenario, definitely, no regrets. Had I needed to pay the entire amount? At $250 at the time of writing while the 8 inch is $109, this is a hard justification, but when we remember that a year ago the previous 10 inch model was selling for $229, it gets a lot easier to see that the extra $20 delivers quite a bit. Better sound, motorized swivel, a better screen, and a much better tilt/angle/level than the previous unit had out of the box. I think this is a win, if it isnt a solid win over the previous generation. I hope that the mic sensitivity gets better with updates, but I dont have many complaints over what is delivered today from this model.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Char, The (Mostly) Happy Shopper","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2023","Here I am again with yet another echo review. Anyone who follows my reviews knows I have quite a few of these things. I'm always buying a new one and then doing the echo shuffle, placing them in different rooms with every upgrade. I have the echo dot 2nd gen (well, had....we'll get to that in a bit), an echo dot 4th generation, three echo show 5's, an echo show 8 and now, with my latest purchase, an echo show 10. I have them all over our house. I've been watching the 10 and 15 for a while now. Then, one day, I got a notification that the 10 had a deal. I took it and noticed they'd give me more off in I traded in one of my other devices. Out went the 2nd gen because I knew, with the upgrade and shuffling, I wouldn't use it anymore. The sadness washed over me. It was our first echo relationship. So many memories. The good times, the bad times. I will look back at them fondly. I took some time to say goodbye before packaging it up and taking it to the UPS drop-off. They say getting over your first is hard, and they are right, but it was time to move on.....

I purchased the 10 and it arrived the next day. Set up, as always, was a breeze. Took less than 5 minutes thanks to the preset up email. The 10 is about the right size for our kitchen (where it replaced the 8, which got moved elsewhere, hence the shuffle) and I love having the bigger screen to watch the news while I get ready for work in the morning. The sound and picture quality are pretty great. I did get a little stand for it so it sits a bit taller, but other than that, it's just about perfect. Just about you say? Yea, just about. My issue is with the one feature that the others I own don't have. Motion detection. I hate it. Why? Well, first, I don't ever use my echos for phone calls. I know some people do and that's cool. Just not my thing. Second, I placed my echo in a corner. It can't swivel without hitting a wall. So, I turned that feature off. Simple enough. Or so I thought. It did an update recently and I walked into my kitchen, only to find it stuck against the wall. It had reset itself. Bad Alexa, bad. I turned the feature off again. It started to move once more, telling me it was stuck. I gave it a good amount of side eye and double checked the settings. It showed that it was turned off. Hmmm. I did what our IT department always says to do when faced with a tech crisis. I turned it off and back on again. I also closed the camera lens, something I had forgotten to do with this one. It hasn't tried moving since. Let's hope it stays that way.

Since it does come with motion detection, one nice thing about it (yes, there is something positive about it I guess) is that even when disabled, the screen can be swiveled. Now, I do like that. I have had to adjust the screen a little depending on where I am in the room or because of the glare of the lights and it's nice to not have to move the whole device. I do sometimes wish you could lock it into place though. No swiveling at all. If there is such a feature (outside of the motion detection disable), I haven't found it yet.

Aside from that, just as with my other echos, I really like it. It's great for checking our blink cameras, watching news or tv, playing music throughout the house, controlling our lights, creating shopping lists, reminders and the like, or just being entertained by asking silly questions. Me and Alexa can have hours of fun with the last one. She's a crazy gal. There are so many things you can do that I doubt I will stop with the 10. As a matter of fact, I know I won't. As Amazon keeps making them, I will probably keep buying them, eventually having one in every single room in our house. I'm honestly pretty close. What will I do then, you ask? Well, we do have a garage and I have a workout shed, so we shall see.....",4.0 out of 5 stars

PMR,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2023","I bought this mainly to use it as a video call unit (I intend to buy a second one soon, which will be installed at a relative's house). My second use is watching the house when I'm away (via the app on my cell) and seeing a couple of cameras I have installed.

That said, here are my PROS and CONS.

PROS:
- Nice screen of a good format and size. The resolution is really good, too.
- Good sound, equivalent to (if not better than) what my Echo 3rd gen produces.
- Should make a nice video call set (more on that when I install the second unit; I will get back here to update my review).
- The screen follows you (most of the time)!

CONS:
- The screen is way too reflective. That makes it hard to read if there's a window behind you.
- A white power cord for a black unit, really, Amazon?! OK, I understand it saves YOU some bucks, but it's an eyesore at my all-black countertop. A black unit should come with a black cord, period. Good thing I had an Echo 3rd gen. with a black cord I could use (my Echo can keep the white cord since it falls hidden behind a piece of furniture).
- While I'm at that... the power cord has a different adaptor than the Echo Dots. So you can only replace the eyesore white cord like I did if you have an Echo (not the dot, but the taller one, which also uses a different adaptor -- come on, Amazon, standardize that stuff!)
- Somewhat harder to hear you... and I can attest to that since I have five other Echo Dots 3rd gen plus an Echo 3rd gen in the house. You call it, it doesn't hear you, and you need to repeat it louder. It's so annoying that sometimes a Dot in a far-away room will reply to your command instead of this unit, which is right on your face.
- Besides, you can say ""Alexa, do [whatever]"" to an echo dot, while you have to call ""Alexa"" (wait for it to find you) and then ""do [whatever]"" on this thing. Not as fast/responsive as the Echo Dots.
- No infrared vision, so don't expect it to be helpful as a night camera to watch your house.
- It does follow you, but sort of ""crooked."" Its camera is off-center, so it usually doesn't ""look at you"" directly but a little sideways. No, there's no way to fine-tune that either. And sometimes, for no good reason, you can walk in front of it, and it won't follow you... I haven't yet figured out why and when it does follow me, even after telling her to ""follow me"" and activating that mode.

Finally, let's be honest: I love what it does, and many years ago, I was impressed with what this technology promised. But almost a decade later, Alexa isn't becoming smarter. It recognizes my face and my voice. But if I tell her my birthday or some other fact about me, she's still incapable of memorizing it (yes, I can create a note, but that's not the same as this thing really KNOWING when my birthday -- or anyone's birthday -- is).

Today, it also should be smart enough to receive two or more commands at once, like ""turn off my office light, turn on my bedroom light, and play music.""

And even though I have a Fire TV at home, it took way too many commands and internet searches until I got this new unit to control it (it kept replying, ""your Fire TV can't do that"" to every command; I finally got it to work, but definitely not a user-friendly set up as I'd have expected).

So the promise of Artificial Intelligence is still in the air. This thing has good voice recognition, but its features and skills are still not worthy of being called ""intelligence.""",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jason Gaines,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2021","UPDATE 4-17-21: Still working fine, no issues. Only thing I wish, is that I had just waited a month to purchase this as it went on sale super quick for $50 less. What’s the point of being an early adopter if it’s a negative?! I’d rather have just waited; next time I will. ;(

UPDATE 3-30-21: Our Video Apps Crashing issue came back, so I contacted Amazon again and they decided it would be best to replace the unit. A new one will be here in another day, so I can see if that one has any issues. I do like the Show 10, but I'm a little less smitten with it then I thought I would be. Again, the motion part is not as useful as one would like due to it's ability to actually track you properly without getting lost. I do really enjoy having a device to watch something in the kitchen while chilling out or cooking, and playing music on it is actually quite nice. Maybe it just needs to grow on me some more, and absolutely have the video apps stop crashing that is a definite.

So we’ve had this for a month now. It’s been fun to get to use it and see what it can do. That being said, it’s not as useful as I thought it would be. This is much less a tablet and more a media player. You can’t customize it like a Kindle or other tablets and put your own apps on it. It does play music really well and it does okay with smart home stuff. But that is an Alexa issue not Echo Show problem. I was hoping we had more customization with this but the OS is pretty closed loop.

Motion: Hit or Miss. it will follow you when you tell it to, but it will lose you easily, especially if you are too close to the unit or move to rapidly. There is a happy space of probably about 5ft to 8ft where it will follow you well. Too close and it will focus on something else, same thing for too far away. It loses you and once it does it forgets who it was following. Too many people around can confuse it as well. If it’s just you and your cleaning dishes or cooking, you should be okay.

Video: we had an issue with our unit crashing any video app such as Prime Video or Netflix after about 5-8mins of watching something. It would just go back to the home screen and forget what you were watching. If you started the app up again you had to start back from where you began as it would not save your progress. Calling support just recommended a factory reset which was going to be our next step anyways, and so far that has corrected the crashing.

Security: it’s easy enough to view the camera on the Show and move it left or right to see what’s around the area. Just remember you can’t move the screen up or down remotely, so if it tilted too far up it will limit your view. Otherwise it works well, and the screen notifies you when someone is remotely viewing on the screen.

Customization: Meh, it’s okay but will take some time getting used to the OS. It works like a tablet in the fact you tap or swipe to get to stuff, but again you can’t add any apps from an App Store. The OS is locked to what it is, and maybe that’s a good thing so it doesn’t get corrupted by junk we all like to add. Still, it limits the functionality and use of this device.

Overall: It’s a sound bar with a video display that can control smart home apps. The sound is really good, loud and crisp. Video is nice and smooth and if you have issues try a reset of the device. Not as full featured as a full on tablet, but pretty good over all. I gave it a four star rating. Really it’s a 4.5, but not a full 5 so I’m not picking that just because they don’t give us half ratings to use. It’s not cheap at $250 new right now, but it is worth the price if you want a good setup for say the kitchen or other room except for living room.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Andrea D. Wilson,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2023","I recently purchased the Echo Show 10 HD smart display from Amazon, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed. The Echo Show 10 delivers an outstanding audio experience that truly stands out. The sound quality is simply amazing, providing a rich audio experience that elevates your entertainment.

The picture quality on this smart display is top-notch as well. The HD display offers crisp and vibrant visuals, making it a pleasure to watch your favorite movies and shows. Whether you're streaming content or catching up on the news, the Echo Show 10's screen display ensures a fantastic viewing experience.

One of the standout features of the Echo Show 10 is its dynamic motion functionality. The fact that the display moves to follow you as you move around is a game-changer, especially during Alexa calls. This means that the person you're talking to can continue to see you as you go about your daily tasks, whether you're cooking, cleaning, or simply multitasking. It adds a whole new level of convenience and connection to your video calls.

While the dynamic motion feature is impressive, it's not always flawless. There are times when the motion can be a bit off, which can be a minor inconvenience. However, I'm optimistic that with future updates and improvements, this feature will become even better over time.

The Echo Show 10 also offers premium sound quality, allowing you to enjoy your music and content with exceptional clarity and depth. The combination of stunning visuals audio creates an all-encompassing entertainment experience that's truly top tier.

In addition to its audio and visual capabilities, the Echo Show 10 provides a versatile platform for doing more. You can effortlessly watch your favorite movies and shows, stay updated with the latest news, and access a wide range of Alexa skills that enhance your daily life.

Overall, the Echo Show 10 HD smart display is an incredible addition to any smart home setup. It offers outstanding sound and picture quality, and its dynamic motion feature makes it a standout device for video calls. While there's room for improvement in the motion aspect, the overall experience is highly satisfying. This device's premium sound and its ability to do so much more make it a worthwhile asset for anyone looking to enhance their home entertainment. You will not be disappointed.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Colleen,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2023","Okay, I'm having fun with Alexa. This morning I said ""Alexa, goodbye"". She replied, ""Let's make like a volcano and blow this place"". I will greet her when I return, and she often has a witty reply. She wakes me up to music which starts playing low then gets louder and louder until I tell her I'm awake. The sound is amazing for such a little speaker. I can hear the ""thumping"" coming from my room when I walk down the hall. Drawbacks, I know there is so much I can do with her that I haven't learned and have had a hard time finding the features. Most I discover by looking at the screen. I just learned I can play Jeopardy and found out about a podcast. I have had her give me reminders at certain times. Such as, ""Colleen, you better start getting ready, you have company coming in an hour."" She created a playlist of my favorite songs, but when I ask her to show me my favorite playlist, she only shows me the first song I added to it. In the end, I've had it about a week and I love it. I just want to know what else I can do. -- UPDATE -- so I have had this a couple of months. I love almost everything about it, except I know there are a lot of things than can be done and finding information on that is difficult. For instance, it let me make an outgoing call, but I don't know how to assign a contact and when I called the person, I didn't know what number to give them to call back. My phone is crap, so this would be a great alternative when I'm home. The screen will show a feature, but when I want to get more information, it has changed to a different screen, and I don't know how to back up to review what it just showed me. I will ask Alexa to go back to last screen and she's confused, I will ask her to tell me about it, and she's confused. For instance, the screen flashed something about a ""Bot"" for cooking and DYI, I wanted to know more about it and couldn't get it back. Or something will flash, but I don't have time to see what it is and I don't know how to bookmark it. Like I said before, I know there are a lot more options out there to utilize, but it doesn't come with any sort of manual. I've gone to YouTube videos, etc.. but haven't find anything to help. Other than that, I love the product and would buy it again.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jay,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2023","Bought this on amazon prime day a few weeks ago. It is currently placed on a kitchen counter between the kitchen and living room in an open concept style house. Purchased mainly for the rotating feature that uses the camera to track the user as they walk around. This and the large screen have been great for working in the kitchen or asking about the weather from the living room. The downside of this feature is that below a certain level of light the device no longer moves the screen to follow you, displaying a message that says ""light level too low, movement disabled."" So at night if we don't have bright kitchen and dining room lights on, it doesn't move; and we largely keep those lights off when not in active use. In our home at night we noticed that just ambient light on from lamps in the room isn't enough for it to follow us. The device really needs something like an infrared sensor so it can work at night time like what Ring security cameras use for night vision. Adding this hardware would make this a must have product for your kitchen and bump this up to 5 stars. Other than that drawback, the included speaker, screen quality, and snappiness of the processor is better than past Eco Shows I've owned (still have the original echo show, 5 inch, and 8 inch models). As far as voice recognition it's the same as other models, although for the team working on Alexa it never understands the word ""closet."" We placed smart lighting in our closet, and she always replied with ""What device?"" and we'd have to yell ""closet"" a second time and it was hit or miss on the second attempt. Out of frustration we renamed the smart lighting to ""bathroom"" and that works 100% in turning on the lights in the closet, but that's been our only real issue with voice recognition.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Mark E Timperley,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2021","My first real Alexa enabled product, if you don't count my Kindle Fire... but more on that later.

First, I bought two Echo Show 10s, one for our kitchen and one for grandma. They were very easy to setup and have worked well so far (4 days in). I'm definitely impressed with the design and the quality of components, from the touch screen, buttons, motion and sound. All physical aspects are very well done. Do you need a screen that moves on its own? Yes! I can't imagine this product without motion. So far, we use the Echo Show 10 to ""drop in"" on grandma virtually, several times a day and every night for dinner. We love this ability! The Echo Show turns to whoever is speaking and zooms in on them, so she feels like she is right there with us and her grandchildren (not 25 feet away, outside a fish bowl). The best part of this technology is that Grandma didn't have to learn how to answer the ""video phone"", since it just connects when we want. In general, it works all by itself in her apartment (mostly) and we can control much of it remotely if needed. I do set and adjust reminders and alarms for her when needed, but beyond that we just ""drop in"" and say hello, whenever.

So that's the awesome part. We are discovering a few annoyances as we go, so I'll share one that is probably unique to this product: The process of adjusting and setting the range of motion is not well thought out. If you only ever did this once and then set the thing in cement, then maybe. But we set it on a counter and have already found that it must be moved for cleaning, to temporarily get it out of the way, or for use in another position. It takes about 4 minutes to reset... which is about 3.5 minutes too long for me. The other annoyances are all about ""Alexa"" so I'll mention them last.

Also, I've described a somewhat ideal grandma use case, so keep in mind that we only live 10 minutes from grandma and have had to drop by and ""fix Alexa"" (turned off, moved, lost wifi, screen rotated by hand) while she and visitors are getting used to it, so it's definitely not a set and forget type of technology, but I'm not going to reduce my rating because of that.

My rating would have been 5 stars, if it wasn't for Alexa herself and the somewhat puzzling UI design, menus, etc. Did I mention my Kindle Fire? Here's my point. You need one to control this thing and use many of the ""Alexa features"" with any level of certainty. You could also use a smartphone with the Alexa app, and we actually use both, but I find the Fire is a bit easier to use. This probably isn't news to someone who already has an Echo, but in case you are new to Alexa, using voice commands to find and select a book or other media for it to show or read by voice, to set a reminder, or just about anything beyond a few words, can be a terribly frustrating experience. It is amazing what it can do, but hopefully, engineers are still hard at work improving voice recognition and comprehension. Until then, my recommendation is to pair them. Echo Show 10 + Kindle Fire (with Alexa off on your Kindle) makes a great product together!

So Alexa, how do you spell frustrating? Her dutiful answer is ""F R U S T R A T I N G"" but also awesome, all at the same time. She doesn't get the joke yet... but given what she is capable of, why would she think I'm joking?",4.0 out of 5 stars
Roxie Muzic,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2021","Prior to this the household has the Gen 1 & 10"" Gen 2 Echo Shows, frankly I prefer the Gen 2 10"" Echo Show for most rooms over this model, but then...with firmware improvement/updates that opinion may change.

Other than the slight reduction in sound (I could care, I have multiple Sonos speakers) and screen resolution (as others have pointed out), the overriding feature of this iteration of Echo Show is the camera and 360 degree motion.

The camera is outstanding in resolution, very outstanding, worth the reduction in sound and screen resolution.

Motion however, needs work, the hardware used in this device to detect stability and motion needs serious firmware tweaking, way to sensitive, everything is ""unstable"", even the most stable. Understanding the need to be cautious, in that this slues around, to follow or view it's human or humans, however, ratchet the sensitivity down some to avoid the error messages that are unfounded when the device is on a stable, unimpeded full motion area. Currently if it even rocks a millimeter when turning, it throws the ""unstable"" error. I ordered two of these 10"" Gen 3 Echo Shows, both are behaving in this fashion. A little tweaking to the firmware of the device should solve this little sensitivity issue I would hope. This is not a game changer for me, this will be refined as customer feedback is received, or at least I have found that their development team is very responsive to these consumer observations. Kudos to them for that.

Next, that obnoxious, unnecessary screen of ""Alexa For Your Day"", for the love of every customer that you have, get rid of this, please, it is not a selling feature. Or, at least give us the option to have it show or not show in the Home Screen toggle switch section of the settings. It really is a ""bummer dude""...... if it keeps it up, it could be a game changer for me.

I can live with the HUGE time notification on the screen, I am old, but not blind, can we scale it down or have an option to scale it down, please, thank you. Not a game changer, but it is quite large you must admit...

All in all for the kitchen or the main floor/office in houses this is a great device, allows camera viewing 360 degrees, great idea for those who do not have indoor cameras already and as an adjunct for those of us who do. Have not used it for recipes in the kitchen yet, but I suspect that this will be a vast improvement over the Gen 2 10"" Echo Show, in that it will follow me in my meandering attempt to cook (hopefully it will not catch me crying on the kitchen floor over cooking fiascos). Phone calls to other Echo Show owners should be improved as I meander when talking to folks as well... I believe as the feedback rolls in, there will be improvements to screen data that pops up uninvited (please, pretty please), and the motion sensitivity concerns.

I am pleased with this purchase, but most likely will replace the rest of my Gen 1 Echos with Gen 2 10"" Echo Shows, this model has limited placement criteria and may not be the best Echo for every spot in the house. I will purchase one additional 10"" Gen 3 Echo Show for my office, but for bedrooms the Gen 2 10"" Echo Show should be sufficient.

As for the white cord, I can live with that all day long...aesthetics in this area are the least of my worries....",4.0 out of 5 stars
Priscilla,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2023","Love the size and the look; However, compared to its sister products I own it is very hard to navigate. 1) I find myself constantly repeating the commands over and over as ""Alexa"" doesn't know that or a lot of ""Hmmmms"" very frustrating; 2) I primarily purchased this to watch TV in the kitchen - well that doesn't seem to be working well either; for starters I cannot download the apps I have on my firestick so that's annoying (please help if avail in this area); if you do actually get to watch content and want to ""pause"" forget asking her via voice she has no clue how to do this, so, I pause manually (usually with my hands full of dirty gloves which also is a pain) so, now we have it paused for a little bit - the screen goes to screensaver mode and the content goes Into the black hole and I cannot retrieve it again or if I'm lucky to retrieve it it is no longer paused and I have to watch from the beginning!!! Super annoying! This is one of the most costly items in the Amazon line and for that reason alone I wish it would work as it's beloved firestick; firetv or even the echo!!! As I have zero issues with these products.

Coqui,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2022","This is my second review after having about 3 months of use. My first review is included below. Presently I have an Echo first Gen, Echo Plus and the Echo Show 10 ( 3rd Gen ) which is the one I am reviewing now. I now have notice that the response time of the new Echo Show 3rd Gen is much higher then my Echo first Gen and my Echo Plus. This is evident when asking a question or requesting some smart home action. It’s taking the Echo Show 10 much more time to response and sometimes it just doesn’t response at all. This is a bit disturbing when doing “Drop In” since it does take much longer to establish the connection and sometimes it times out without even connecting. If I am near the screen I watch for the horizontal line which appears on the bottom of the screen before speaking and it’s taking too much time to appear. My Echo First Gen and Echo Plus response immediately. I have fiber in ( 1 GB ) to my home network and the Echo Show 10 is the closets to the router ( in the same room ), in clear sight without any structural interference. The Echo first Gen and Echo Plus are located farther away in different rooms yet they have a much quicker response time. Hey Amazon do something about this.
First review:
I purchase this Echo Show 10 ( 3rd Gen ) to replace an Echo Show 8 in order to have a bigger screen, better sound and the ability to rotate around that way I can monitor my home when away. Having the bigger screen is always a positive when viewing at different distance since you now have the ability to move around and the screen will follow you. The image quality is the same as the echo show 8 but it is acceptable. I have adjusted the sound quality to my preference and it is a improvement over the echo show 8, but I was expecting more after reading the reviews. Currently I have a Echo 1st Gen, Echo Plus, and my Echo Show 10 connected to my home network and I find that my new Echo Show 10 is slower in responding and sometimes the follow up mode just doesn’t work. I am connect to fiber, 1 gigabit in and have strong signal throughout my home and the Echo Show 10 is located closest with direct sight to the router then the other Echos, therefore I am at the moment a bit intrigued as to why the slow response. I am very satisfied with the remote viewing operation and do use the Drop In constantly to checkin on family members. In general I am satisfied with my purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Sunhawk,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2022","Simply put, Amazon still struggles with the electronics game. While the idea and potential are great, their development team is satisfied with mediocrity. The most glaring deficiencies are as follows:

Ads: I’m tired of everything interactive from Amazon pushing ads. It’s bad enough with my Kindle, but it’s even worse with this Echo Show 10. People want to personalize their devices. Amazon uses it as a platform for pushing products. The worst part is their idea of what is appropriate. While some people don’t care what their children see, I don’t need a device that we utilize in the kitchen pushing Prime and Netflix shows that we don’t want to watch as adults, let alone expose our children to. If we could determine a rating level for ads that would be decent. But, no. We get whatever indecent show pays you for air time. Let us turn it off!

Suggestions: If I want assistance learning everything this device can do, I’ll do the research. I don’t need to be guided day-in and day-out for the lifespan of this device. I also don’t need to be aware of the 4.8 million rinky-dink, third party apps with which the device can be used. Let us turn it off!

Photos: Awesome! Let me load and see a cycling photo show of all all my fami…. Nope. Interrupted by ads.
Oh good. Back to my phot…. Nope. App suggestion.
Yay! That day we went as a family to the state par….. No! I don’t need to know how Alexa can sync with my garage door! Why have a photo show if I only see a photo 10% of the time?!?!

Camera: Awesome! This thing will follow me as I move about the …. What are you looking at Echo? I’m over here. No. Over here.
For some awful reason, they decided to put the camera in the corner and the microphone in the middle. This results in it perpetually being at the wrong angle. It could be compensated for by adjusting the software. Or they could just swap the camera and the microphone spots. It’s common sense. How did their engineers not think of this? More importantly, how did it get through the test team? Oh, wait. We’re the test team. Three generations of user reviews, and they still can’t get it right.

Ultimately, Amazon, this falls on you. Quit pushing ads. Allow us to disable the help/suggestions. Let us have control of our home screens. That’s what people want out of their electronic devices: the ability to make them function for them. Not as a source of advertising revenue for you. Give us control.

Thomas J. LaCalamita,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2021","So this is a cross comparison review. I purchased the echo show 10 and google home max and our family used them side by side for 2 weeks. Googles nest Max is not as good as the echo show 10 in terms of sound quality, volume and versatility but if you have other google products it's still the best choice. Software on both is very good, as good as it gets, integration with Google apps is good but it all boils down to what video calling apps your friends use.

The issues I had with the Google Nest Max:

- the screen is at a fixed angle and has tremendous glare in our Kitchen. Most kitchens have alot of windows and light. We ended up purchasing the $30 swivel stand which was a must. This stand solved the glare problem. Still not half as good as the 360 degree show, which tilted and swivels, following you if you so chose to do.

-the sound quality stinks and the volume is not linear. I mean, it sounds worse than our tiny 1st gen Google nest mini. In most cases you can't hear it at 10 ft away in a vaulted ceiling kitchen without turning it up past 5 of 10. Most of the time it's on Volume 8 sometimes 9. There is some issue with the software where it decides what the volume should be. Watching news in the morning is an exercise in frustration. We don't have this issue on our Google nest mini, volume was normally 5. Maybe something is wrong with it. Unless your 5 ft away, prepare to change the volume every news story. What can I expect when Google placed the speakers the opposite direction of the screen, so you need to place it by a wall, not on an island. It can't hold a candle to the fidelity of the echo show 10, leagues better.

-no web browser
-no aux output to improve sound quality and Bluetooth only works for an input
-the microphones work well but not well enough, theres no sensitivity adjustment.
-price, it's expensive and not competitive when compared to the echo show 10s glitz and glamor.

The issues I had with the echo show 10:
-video app limitations, I only know 2 people who I regularly call who have Alexa apps so that was a deal breaker for me
-security camera that doesn't work in the dark is useless half the time

In short, the Amazon Echo Show 10 won me over.
But if using a Google Duo is a deal breaker I would have kept the Echo Show 10 because it's better in every way. But convincing my family and friends to use Duo was a failed experiment.",4.0 out of 5 stars
John,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2024","The functionality and the inner connection with other items in my home is exemplary. It is nice to be able to have the shopping list and Reminders that can port to my phone so if I’m out at a store I can just simply contact the echo show 10 and get my shopping lists or reminders. The use of the camera while outside of the home is phenomenal and use of it as a motion detecting security camera and the cloud storage give a piece of mind for home monitoring. The echo show 10/3 generation is built. Well, it has good sound, and the visuals are clear without distortion or refresh rate headaches. The only complaint that I have about it is that the camera is on the left side instead of centrally located and ending motion wants to cant the screen slightly to the right. There should be a calibration for centering the screen on you and not the cameras orientation.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jason B,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","I got this to upgrade my current Show 10 that I have. I thought this one would be cool to have the thing follow you when in the kitchen, etc. As it turns out, it is pretty cool...but not cool enough to justify replacing one that is working perfect right now. There were a few things about it that I did not really care for.

1. As others have mentioned, it comes with a white power cord. Yes I know it's petty, but when the unit is black, the cord should be black. Send the white cord with the white units. Most people purchase a particular color to help blend it into the surroundings, having a bright white cord with a dark black unit seems pretty silly and is an easy fix on Amazon's part.

2. The motion part is pretty cool. It does depend on where you have it sitting. We had ours on the island for a short bit and it followed around pretty good. After moving it more into the corner and readjusting the settings, with the camera offset to the right, it wants to turn more to the left and always feels as if it's not really in your line of sight. You don't look to the top right, you are looking at the middle of the screen so it seems to me that having the camera more centered would make more sense. I quickly disabled the motion setting though and just had it sitting in one place.

3. The Live View check in or whatever it's called is pretty cool...but when you have the piece sitting on the counter, unless you are super short, you have it angled up so that you can see it. So then when you initiate the live view and turn the camera around, it's super cool as long as you want to see the ceiling or at least not see anything under about 5 feet in your house. So it's pretty useless for that in my opinion. The other option is just always remember to put the screen back more at a 90 degree angle to the counter before you leave for the day....because everyone will remember to do that!

All in all, it just was not worth the upgrade so it's going back to Amazon. The looks and sound of the unit are great, it sounds good and it looks cool though and I would for sure get one if I did not already have the older version of it.",4.0 out of 5 stars

E. Chen,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2023","The Echo Show works well enough to check on my ring door bell, serve as a photo frame among other tasks that's enhanced with a screen, but the key value for me was video chatting with my family on their Echo Show 10s. Unfortunately, it did not work at first, and I almost returned it. The video calls suffered from extreme lag/freeze (on very fast internet connections), and even the audio was stuttering. After a lot of my own detective work and assistance from Amazon tech support -- I will spare you the details of testing with my sisters who own different versions of Echo Show & Alexa devices etc. -- it turns out that you need to disable the ""enhanced option"" for Echo Show 10 to Echo Show 10 to avoid this insufferable lag issue. To do this, go to the Alexa app on your phone, select ""more"" (lower right corner), select setting, select communication, disable enhanced.

The video chatting is wonderful once it works! The camera follows you around (horizontal only but you can manually tilt it on the vertical axis) and both video and sound are clear. The ability to just say ""Alexa, call ___"" to initiate a video call is invaluable for my tech-challenged parents.

I believe that group call requires enhanced option, which doesn't seem to be working now. Maybe they'll fix this... it's not a big concern for me, and so I didn't try very hard to make it work.

Observation re: Amazon tech support:

Tech support was not easy to find. To chat with them, you need to go to ""Your Orders"" and find the button next to your product. The first agent took about 10 minutes to reply to each sentence... it was excruciating slow to just get ""re-boot your Echo Show."" The second agent I reached solved the issue right away after I provided the results of all my experimentation.

I should have probably taken 2 stars off for all the pain it took to get this to work properly, but it's so nice once it worked...",4.0 out of 5 stars
CH,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021","Wow looks like I'm going to be the first review on here. I actually got my unit a day before the release, but I still haven't had enough time to thoroughly review. I do have a few first impressions though:

1) Much smaller in person than what I thought. The screen size is the same as the Gen 2, but it appears substantially smaller. I guess the large triangular shaped back of the Gen 2 never really won me over. The Gen 3 motor is much smaller from my visual perspective. But I know those of you who are into specs will assuredly do the side by side comparison.

2) The screen resolution is the same as the Gen 2. I knew that based on reading specs, but I do wish they opted for a higher resolution. Given that the device has a much sleeker look (in my opinion) it does detract from the design.

3) I wish there was a way to utilize the ""turn to wake word"" capability without having the camera. I understand the two work in tandem in order to turn the screen towards the speaker, but if it could simply turn in the general direction of the speaker via the echolocation feature it would be nice. At least as an option. I generally prefer to not have uncovered cameras connected to the web unless I'm actively using them. I know that the whole point of the Gen 3 is all about the camera and it's rotating base, but I think they should have at least given multiple options in the settings to utilize some/all of the technology.

For those wondering about the performance of the rotating base under normal use, it works really well. I think they've fixed some of the bugs that were pointed out in the reviews from your big tech websites because I couldn't duplicate them. The one issue/weak point I found is that if you get really close and move out of view really quick then it may lose your position. Based on the layout of our home we have to walk right up on the device to get to the kitchen and if this is done quickly then the device may not track us all the way into the kitchen. I'm sure this will be fixed in later updates.

I will update this review as I get more hands on time.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Bryan McMillan,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2021","I bought two and have used for a few weeks now. The motion is nice when using the camera to view inside the room. It may be nice when using for calls but I haven't tried this feature. Neither of mine consistently face the right direction when speaking to the echo. That said, I didn't really purchase these for the motion so I didn't take off any stars for that. I only took off a star for the sound which, given the size of the base, I was hoping would be better. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad... just not as good as I hoped. I was hoping for sound at least as good as my Bluetooth HK speakers. Every aspect of movement and display that I wanted to customize is customizable. The only thing I would like is a longer display time for picture cycling. I have it set to the longest setting and it still seems too fast. The picture quality looks good and the auto brightness does a good job adapting to lighting conditions. I was hoping the Ring doorbell could be set to autodisplay when the doorbell is pressed but I couldn't find any setting for that in the Echo or Ring skill settings. It's kind of clunky to have to say Alexa show the front door... look to see who it is and then if desired say... Alexa answer the front door. The Ring cameras are also slower to load on the Echo than they are on my phone with the Rapid Ring App. Not sure if this is an issue with the Ring skill or the Echo itself. The Echo Show in my living room replaced a 1st Gen Echo and the one in my kitchen replaced a 1st Gen Echo Dot so the Show is a big improvement in every way over these but some things were not as good as I expected. Maybe some of the issues (besides sound) will be worked out with future firmware or skill updates. I would still recommend purchasing and only knocked off one star because I think sound quality could be better even at this price point. Oh and these show up as Fire HD 8 tablets instead of Echos on my Orbi RBR852.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Ann,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2021","It's been about 6 months now and I can say that I am feeling better about the performance of my device because it is performing better. I was restarting it almost on a weekly basis because it would randomly freeze. I did relocate it so that it wasn't near (within a foot of) anything, tv, computer, etc but I think the real magic happened when the update was pushed to the device about a month ago. I now feel more comfortable and confident about trying out the more advanced functionality it offers. Beginning to love more than the screen size and display on my device.
Great concept, has potential-2* So far, I am very disappointed in the performance of this device. I was super excited to upgrade from the Echo show 5 to a larger screen, all the other bells and whistles weren't a main part of my decision making. This device is so unresponsive to the simplest voice commands that it's unbelievable. I have to say ""Alexa"" up to 3 times before it acknowledges and everything I ask it to do has way more of a delayed response than my older devices, Dot & Show 5's. I would be fine if it only would have met the standards of the Show 5 device but it can't compete. Even the volume up and down buttons have delayed response. I wasn't caught up in the motion capabilities but even that is way off, randomly moves in an empty room and often has motion error. It also makes a clicking sound, not sure why, it's not loud enough to be disruptive just unexpected. I am seriously considering returning it and downgrading to the Show 8 instead. It's looks snazzy but it's not easy to navigate and touchscreen lags as well and using the Alexa app has an even more slow response than the voice command.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Ronald M. Chavin,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2021","Advice to the user: Using the touch screen, use your fingers to select ""Settings,"" then select ""Home Content,"" then find ""Rotate Continuously,"" then select ""Off"" (the white color) for ""Rotate Continuously."" Unfortunately, this action will only partially solve the irritating problem of your Echo Show 3-10 moving by itself when you don't want it to move at all.

1st Suggestion for the manufacturer: Just as there is a physical shutter on the Echo Show 8 and Echo Show 3-10 to prevent the camera from snooping like a voyeur, we need a physical way to lock the Echo Show 3-10 in a non-moving configuration so that it can never move when the user does not want it to move. Sometimes, the Echo Show 3-10 moves unwantedly by itself, even if not touched. Sometimes, the Echo Show 3-10 moves unwantedly after the user puts his finger on the touch screen to select something.

2nd Suggestion for the manufacturer: Sometimes, the user will want to see only the beautiful nature wallpapers, which keep changing every minute, without ever seeing suggestions or advertisements of any kind. Curremtly, there is no way to force Echo Show 3-10 to stop showing suggestions or advertisements.

3rd Suggestion for the manufacturer: An extremely high percentage of the people won't be able to turn their Echo Show 3-10 ""On"" during the first day. Why? Because the Power Cord needs to be snapped very tightly into the Echo Show 3-10. Most people will just plug it in without snapping it in tightly. When people begin to panic after their Echo Show 3-10 won't ever turn ""On,"" they will look for a phone number to talk to a technician. There are no call-for-help phone numbers in the instruction booklet, no instructions on how to turn their Echo Show 3-10 ""On,"" no Troubleshooting Tips on what to do if their Echo Show 10 never turns ""On,"" but there is a web link for Device Support.

Advice to the user: Using the touch screen, use your fingers to select ""Settings,"" then select ""Sounds,"" then select ""Equalizer."" On my Echo Show 8, I set the Treble at absolute maximum, the Midrange at absolute minimum, and the Bass at absolute minimum. If I did the same for my Echo Show 3-10, the resulting sound would be too thin. As a result, for my Echo Show 3-10, I set the Treble at absolute maximum, the Midrange at 2 notches higher than absolute minimum, and the Bass at 1 notch higher than the absolute minimum.",4.0 out of 5 stars
teenie,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2023","I have a few of the shows , 3 of the first generation and three of the second generation . They all seem to work good , but thought that maybe I might like the follow me .

I unboxed this and got this set up very easy . Then I placed this on my counter to see how this looks and how well it works.

I use mine mostly to watch videos while doing cooking and crafting in my kitchen . I then used the follow me , it worked great until my kitty got up and started to watch the video. When she moved it followed her and not me , I had a hard time getting the cat away from this , I was watching the Flintstones and she goes bonkers to watch them, when she was a baby kitten I would leave them on for her to have sounds while I was gone.

If you have two people in the area , she will follow both and then it becomes interesting to see where she stops . After nearly a month of this I turned off the follow me , it just became a hassle when I wanted it to be centered straight.

The sound is great while listening to music , that’s one nice feature.

I am not sure I would buy a second one as this needs lots of space to set on my counter .

The best thing on this is while streaming prime videos this just keeps going , unlike the other models they stop playing after six episodes. This is very nice and I don’t have to keep it going .

I would recommend this if you have the space needed for it , otherwise I would get the other design.",4.0 out of 5 stars
F. Templeton,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2021","Package arrive in well built containment. Setup was easy. The main reason I bought it was to replace my Show 10"" tablet that we use to watch Comcast TV at the dinner table. But when I tried to setup to Comcast it reported that the browser was not acceptable. I hope there will be an upgrade to fix this. I was able to watch my remote Amazon Cloud cameras without any difficulty. But when it shows the new Blink camera it displays the view for a minute or two then reverts to the default home screen. I have to continuously tell it to show the Blink view.
As for the ability to detect motion, it reports that it doesn't work in low light. Some times it follows me around the room quite well, but other times it seems to get lost and point in the wrong direction. I find I'm constantly turning motion off or on depending on how well it's working. I recommend that Amazon move the camera to the middle of the bezel so the motion will face the screen more accurately instead of always a little to the left. They should also give us better commands to be able to direct the angle to others instead of just the person who is moving or talking. Such as ""Alexa turn the screen 15 degrees to the left"" or ""Alexa turn the screen 45 degrees to the right."" ""Alexa, hold that position until the next voice command"". ""Alexa keep Silk open for XXX minutes"" or ""Alexa keep the current display on until told to change it"". It's so frustrating to be looking at a web page in Silk and having to turn it on again every couple of minutes. AMAZON: GIVE US MORE CONTROLL!!! Or tell me where to find the list of controls that already exist. All I discovered so far is ""Alexa turn right"" and ""Alexa turn left"" and then it turns about 90 degrees.
I have set the Blink up over a dove's nest with good results but it won't keep the view going more than a couple of minutes.

You can look at the Internet
You can look up recipes and save them

G. M.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2022","I really have enjoyed the product. It is very practical and is convenient to have around the household. I really enjoy the feature that it recognizes the users face and it personalizes the media in order to cater to that person. The rotating gymic is honestly helpful especially in places like the kitchen were you are always moving around. But i would really like the product to return to a set position after it goes to sleep, as it remains in the position were it was last used. As all Alexa devices it has lots of features and can be really helpfull when you pair it with other devices. So far i have paired it with several lights and enabled a feature that turns on the lights with every alarm which is super useful.

Some imporvements that could be made:
The software on the app is sometimes dogey, when trying to acces the camera sometimes I dont get any image, sometimes I get an error eventhough its conected to the internet and sometimes I get a wierd distorted image that after a minute reverts back.
It would be usefull to set the device that once you finish using it it reverts to the set position eventhough it is moved around using the hands. As if someone pushes the camera, it would stay in that position and does mot revert back.
When the device is hooked to your spotify account, it would stay in the same song for a while and sometimes it drops the connection and stops playing any song. They should improve the conection between spotify app in phone and the device so that these erros dont persist.

Would definitely recomend to another person, but you should wait for when the product is discounted on a sale.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Miles Vincent Bridges,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2022","I use this on a daily basis to set alarms, play music, listen to podcasts, and do weekly reminders. It works incredibly well and its nice to have a good interface to look at while you're setting anything up. The only bummer about it is sometimes it has a hard time tracking your face and will flip around completely away from you even though you're standing right in front of it. Would love a better version, but this works great as is if you're keeping it stationary and pointed at you in a kitchen or office.

Things to keep in mind if you're buying this:
• If you've seen videos of people putting their own sound to routines, nix it now. They got rid of the feature that allowed you to use your own sounds and now apparently its a painful process to do.
• Its not the be all, end all. You still have to set up routines using the alexa app on a phone and go through all the hardship of learning what its actually capable of doing.
• If you're setting up voice operated routines, they have to be EXACT. So if you set up the routine to activate when you say ""Cheeseburgers and Fries"" it won't understand what you want unless you specifically say ""Cheeseburgers and Fries"". No variation will be accepted for the routine.
• This thing gets what I'm saying to it wrong all the time and I don't even have an accent. I'm from Illinois originally and I annunciate fairly well on what I'm saying about 99% of the time and it still has issues picking up what I'm saying correctly.
•It DOES allow for camera monitoring on multiple systems. I have a blink camera setup around my house / garage / etc.. that I can ask it to display camera 1 etc... to see views on the fly. Works extremely well. Would highly recommend setting it up.
• Splurge and get the monthly amazon music. I can spout off anything, including comedy specials and listen to them whenever I want through voice commands. Extremely nice to have even if it costs a bit.",4.0 out of 5 stars
The Engineer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2021","With almost 16k reviews of this written so far; I gave a lot of thought to what I'm going to cover. It's my hope the developers will use this feedback to improve the ""4th Gen"" version.

Stiction versus Friction
========================================
I've placed the Echo on a surface, that is normally covered with a cloth (see pictures). Now, I'm not sure how the drive mechanism works, as to whether the momentum is imparted from the base to the head, or vice-versa. But over a 1 week period of back and forth motion; the base has a tendency to ""twist"" around enough on the cloth, so that any ""motion stop"" settings are now off. Currently, the only way I've been able to resolve the issue, is to place a tile coaster between the base and the cloth.

Needs Night Vision
========================================
People detection does not work, below a certain light level. I first noticed this, after creating a people detection triggered routine; in which Alexa is supposed to turn on the room light, and yell ""Peekaboo, I see you!"" at 100% volume. The only way I got this to work, was to place a nightlight in the same area. Low light levels also cause the Alexa app to mistakenly think the camera's privacy cover is on. Attempting to ""drop in"" on a darkened room causes the app to declare the privacy cover is being used. Again, the immediate solution is a nightlight.

Parallactic Error -- ""You're too close""
========================================
There seem to be many complaints about camera and display tracking. The root cause, is the camera is mounted off to the side; instead of the center of the display. If you are too close to the Echo, and the camera is looking at you, you will feel that the display is ""pointing the wrong way."" You need to be at least 4 or 5 feet away, to overcome this effect.

Newton's First Law versus Motion Stop
========================================
One of the ""cutest things"" Alexa does with this Echo, is to ""wag her head (or tail?)"" if you thank or compliment her. Unfortunately, if this occurs when the display is already positioned at the end of a motion range setting; the display will overshoot the end stop by a few degrees and hit whatever you were trying to protect, LOL.",4.0 out of 5 stars
B,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2021","While the screen and sound are good, the echo show 10, unlike the echo 8 and echo 5, has significant software issues.

Most notably, Home Content Settings are entirely ignored by the device. Regardless of what options you set to be shown or not shown, the device will display ALL home content. For example, we have turned off all home content besides weather, and disabled rotate continuously. Despite this, the Echo 10 continues to display all content, and rotate through it. News, Sports, Covid Tips, Recipes, etc all display constantly despite being turned off in home content settings.

This has grown more and more irritating for us, and we are likely to return the devices if they are not fixed in the next week or two. We were very excited about the larger screen, better speakers, video calling with family, and other features, but seeing headline after headline, games, never ending covid content, and Amazon's corporate advertising for their products is becoming so frustrating that it's ruining our experience with the echo show 10. The echo show 8 and 5 both properly display only the home content we have turned on.

We have discussed with tech support, rebooted the devices, factory reset them, power cycled, gone through settings with tech support, and more, and had confirmed to us that this is a software issue across the entire echo 10 product line that will require Amazon to release an update to fix their devices.

Please fix this issue Amazon, as if it continues our family will all be returning these.

Edit: As of 8/24/2021 Amazon technical support reached out to let us know they had resolved this issue. We tested our devices and all now appear to show only the content we have enabled. Thank you for fixing this issue Amazon! With this fix, we have updated our review to four stars.

We would consider 5 stars if we could get native YouTube integration (rather than being forced to use the built in web browser to use YouTube), and if the OS for show devices were updated to be more similar to a tablet, at least as far as using apps (such as the Fire tablet line) rather than the extremely stripped down user interface that nearly every app currently is. Amazon should integrate an app store, and allow tablet-like navigation rather than forcing the user to talk to Alexa for most functions. Amazon should also allow for more web browsers than just their own 'silk' browser.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Satisfied Shopper,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2021","The microphone picks up the sound of the fan and turn to it even though I'm talking right in front the unit. So best not to have the unit close to distracting noises.
Four persons in the room and this thing moves constantly from one person to the other even though three are not talking.

I find the display ideal for video conferencing as it's very sharp. As of April 12th 2021 you can use the device for Zoom video conferencing meetings and you are able to and raise your hand. No other reactions available though like clapping etc.
I would love if one of the upgrades would be to show the kindle text while it's reading a book.
To get to the web browser you have to tell her google something otherwise she can't understand open a web browser.
Please add app icons just as you would on the fire tablet to make the interface much easier. It would be good to allow copy and paste features as well.

The camera automatically focuses as you move further away during video conferencing which is cool but the sound quality diminishes so you have to increase the volume to hear properly the further away you go.

The photo booth feature is cool. Just ask Alexa to open the photo booth and you can do videos, funny pics etc. With the tools available.

Loading Facebook albums you're limited to the number of albums you can select at a time for the screen saver, do add more photos in the selected albums if you want a greater quantity of images. Having the photos and other options are nice. It's like a mini photo frame with the usual Amazon newsflash and advertisements at times.
Sound quality is not all the best for this price range.
Ok guys, you can go ahead and buy this device now as the benefits are really cool. Especially with the Zoom meeting update feature. I also like the group calling from Alexa as well as being able to call regular phones in the US and UK.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Dorothy Evans,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2023","I love the concept. The execution of it is clunky and awkward. The follow mode doesn’t work as well as it should. You can set the range of motion and the idle position and it’ll “adjust” it based on what it thinks your movement is. Well, it doesn’t stay in the correct set idle position and only tracks well about 50% of the time.
If you want to watch a movie or YouTube video while you’re cooking or puttering in the room where your show is it is great-until you need to control a light or set a timer. It doesn’t pause your video in YouTube or Netflix. It just plain dumps you out of it. If and when you find it again it doesn’t remember where you were in the video. So if you want to watch something from start to finish make sure no one in earshot says the wake work or you have to start over or just give up.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Christi V,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2023",Relatively easy to use. I’m not a big Alexa user so we don’t really do much with it. I like that it shows my pictures. I like that we can look at and get notifications from the ring camera. Which is the only reason I bought it. She did get stuck in a weird loop of repeating motion at one of the cameras even though the ring app had no new notifications. Even tried deleting the camera from Alexa app and re add and didn’t stop. Then randomly quit and went back to normal.

J TAYLOR,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2022","the product is great, a huge upgrade to a home that's alexa-orientated. It solves some of the common challenges, such as having multiple lists and timers, whose management is impossible using just verbal cues. If anyone has tried to cancel one of 5 alarms they have set, they'll know what I mean.
the visual display to augment the conversation is effective, and for things like adjusting lights, etc, it's handy to have the touch-control.
I also like the ability to watch netflix and other services through the device, again, as an augmentation to the kitchen, having hands-free control over a decent screen is very convenient, though the screen isn't huge, so it's more to watch a distracting show than to enjoy a movie on.
the screen following you around, is one of the major features you pay for with this variant however, and this is not perfect. It does a reasonable job of attempting to track the person talking to it, and as you walk around a kitchen, as someone invariably does, it sometimes keeps you front-and-center. But I can tell you my wife is growing hoarse, telling it to stay still and stop tracking, especially as you have kids walking through line of sight, and talking (not to alexa), it gets a little confused. I've also seen it reset its position when it figures you got board of it while washing the dishes, etc.
Scrolling through all your old pictures is another really nice feature my wife in particular loves, but be aware you need to upload all your assets to amazons photo service, and you'll end up scrolling through a bunch of images you don't really want to see, unless you manage your thousands of photos diligently, which I personally do not.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Jason Eckert,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2022","I received the Echo Show 10 as a gift - and in general love it. It has replaced an older Echo in our kitchen, and we have placed it on an island. It works very well on an island, and is my favorite echo device. The following are some device pros and cons:

Pros:

- Despite what I've read in many reviews - the Echo Show 10 does work with YouTube TV (sort of). You need to log in via the Silk brower. YouTube TV works about as well as YouTube does through Silk. The interface is a little clunky, and has crashed a few times. However - once a program is selected, it plays well.
- Availability of video services such as Netflix and Hulu.
- Movement is fun and works fairly well.
- The sound quality, and bass, is simply outstanding.
- Integration with smart home features.
- It does all Amazon Echo functions very well.

Cons:

- I receive a ""Motion is Temporarily Unavailable"" error - more often than I should. This is unfortunately quite common when watching video.
- Screen motion can get confused. There are five people in our house. When motion is enabled, the screen does not know who to follow (when there are multiple people in the room).
- My Echo Show 10 was shipped with a white power cable. I wish it were black ...
- No native YouTube app. (Although YouTube works pretty well in the Silk browser.)
- The advertisements. I have not found a way to disable them. They interrupt the Amazon photos screensaver we have enabled.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Setup was a breeze as was setup with all my other devices. I did have to do a factory reset on it to get the live view on the camera working ( I almost returned it because of it not functioning). The motion tracking is glitchy. I hope that a few updates will make it track better. Aesthetically, I like it more than the Show 10 G2. I think the sound is a little better. Picture quality is good. The ability to tilt the screen is nice (though it would have been great to tilt it via the app when you use live view). Live view is nice. It lets you know on the screen that someone in your house is watching you and the person at home has the option to disconnect them if they feel it's creepy or intrusive. The screen will scan the area you preset when you set it up but again, the ability to tilt up or down is not there so if your screen is angled high, you'll get great views of your ceiling. Like others have said, it would be great to have more customization over the unit such as the clock and Alexa suggestions and font size and style (especially at this price point). The cord being white on my charcoal unit is a non issue for me as my countertops are a dark marble and my walls and wall plugs are white so it blends in better than a black power brick. I got a $100 gift card from Amazon for opening an Amazon account so for $150, it was a great deal.

Ryan Pringle,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2023","Works great. Love it for the most part. Two things the next gen needs

1. Camera needs to be in the center, not the top right. When it follows you the screen is not quite facing you, the camera is.

2. It needs is a base that can attach to the bottom of the upper cabinets. When on the counter it will turn and bump into things that kids leave too close to it. A mountable base will also increase counter space.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I have never had an incident of erroneous ordering with an echo device until now. The echo ordered a 19.99 movie which I did not interact nor want….thank goodness the amazon staff can check if a movie was watched…the movie was never watched and I responded within a few hours….I was credited the 19.99.

J R,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2022","First of all the sound is excellent, the best from an Echo device (except for the Echo Studio). The screen is clear and bright and it does everything you expect it to do well. The follow mode on the motion works well except for the position of the screen when it is facing you, it isn't pointing directly at you, this is likely due to the camera being on the right side of the device. It always points to the left of your position. and while you can still see the screen just fine, it is annoying. Amazon could easily fix this with a software update so that it automatically compensates for the camera being off-center or they could allow a setting allowing the user to set the 'center' position when it is facing you. There are numerous complaints about this yet is has not been addressed. The only other issue is that they need to allow more content on the home screen, it should have the capabilities like the Show 15. They should also allow 3rd party widgets and some applications from the app store beyond the video apps. Other than the above this is a great device, almost perfect, that I highly recommend.",4.0 out of 5 stars

wvj3ml,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2022","The person in my relationship lives about 6 hours away. A few years ago we discovered the ECHO 5 and our conversations were immediately enhanced with a great picture, audio. It seemed natural to upgrade to ECHO 10's. I got a 10 and she got an 8 (10's were no longer on sale). Then our problems began. We could not stay in sync. Audio was never a problem but video was, at best, a still picture. And if it did return to motion, it was about 2 minutes out of sync.
After struggling with this on a daily basis, I thought that the problem was too much audio/video data trying to be uploaded via my Internet provider. Like most providers, my upload speed barely clears 11 Mbps (download speed is 100 Mbps, although I'm supposed to have 200). So I purchased a ECHO 5 to test my theory.
Yesterday, the call was perfect: her with an 8 and me with a 5.
So my recommendation is, stick with ECHO 5's if video calls are important to you. If this is not the need, and you like the idea of a larger screen, then go with an 8 or a 10. If you are using these devices to play movies, listen to music, you'll have no issues with downloads, even at lower speeds. And the picture and sound quality are brilliant.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Gregory Pennington,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2021","I use this device to video chat with my mom, who has a cognitive impairment and lives in a senior residence. The ""drop in"" feature allows me to connect without her needing to take any action to answer the call, and the rotation feature will generally find her, wherever she is in the room. These two features are absolutely amazing for my use case, and the Show has helped us feel much more connected than we could otherwise.

- There are a few hangups. The biggest is that if it becomes unplugged (which can happen sometimes), the show prompts for a password. My mom can't get past this on her own. I understand the intent behind this security feature, but Amazon should allow users who understand the risk the opportunity to disable it.

- Establishing a video connection appears to require a lot of bandwidth. It can take time and sometimes doesn't work when my phone is on 4G. Amazon should have more graceful fallback to low bandwidth modes, including potentially a voice-only fallback, if the connection cannot support video.

- The off center camera is a really weird decision, but it's not a problem at medium or long distances. There can be occasional tracking issues, where the echo gets lost. Generally though I've found tracking and virtual auto-zoom work pretty well.

- I want it to just show the time and photos, when not connected to a call. But there is some content, like Alexa tips, which cannot be disabled.

- The display can be really laggy sometimes, when bringing up a new screen, like the weather. There are many other bugs, but most are minor.

Overall, this is the best device I know of for staying in touch with someone who is elderly or disabled, and I am grateful to have it. With a bit more software maturity, it can be a five star experience.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Randi Coughlin,"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2022","I wasn't sure how I would like this given some of the reviews, but this device is pretty great. Not only can I look up recipes, keep time, and watch shows while in the kitchen now. But I can also creep in on my cats when I'm away and see what they're up to while I'm away (always on the counter when I'm not here apparently...jerks!). I also love that I can connect this to my personal calendar. I am one of those people who live by my calendar so I love that it tells me what's happening day to day and coming up. I've also never really used routines until i got this device. They're pretty cool when you have a screen to leverage.

The 1 major flaw, which many others have noted in their reviews, is the placement of the camera and how that affects the ""follow my face"" feature. Because the camera is located in the right upper corner it does not seem to ""follow"" very well and constantly bumps into things. I did try to adjust the ""follow"" range, and that did not work very well so I eventually just turned it off to avoid more frustration. In all fairness, it's a cool idea but not at all necessary.",4.0 out of 5 stars

R. Simons,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2021","I want to like this device so severely. Finally, I decided to take the plunge and get the most recent Echo Show 10. Let's start with a bit of background.
I own a first-generation Echo, three first Gen Echo Dots, an echo spot, and a First Gen Echo Show. I've had the second and third-gen Echo Dots (that I gave to my sisters), and I purchased an echo show five and a first-gen echo show for my parents.

Pros:
The movement of the screen is incredible, and it follows pretty well.
The screen is big and clear, easy to understand what is on it.
I love the sound
It responds to commands well when it hears me (more on that below), like all the other echos I've had before.

Cons:
There are times when I call out to it, and it doesn't hear me. I could be 10 feet away from it, and it won't listen to me anymore. We got it, so we didn't have to yell for one of the bedroom echo's to turn on our lights in the living room. Now, we still have to yell at times because it just doesn't hear us. There are other times where it won't listen to us, then we cry, and one of the bedroom echos picks it up, and the Show sits there.
I'm not too fond of the ads and the Alexa for your day, and those are annoying.

Conclusion:
Aside from the annoyances above, it is excellent. We bought a second one for my mother-in-law.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Austin Allen,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2021","Like the insect exhibit at the zoo this Alexa is very buggy. I still want to say the coolness factor and the fact it works about the same as all my other Alexa devices makes it worth it (plus i got it on sale, i would have kinda been disappointed at full price).

The timers will overlap each other on the screen so its just a hodgepodge of numbers in the upper corner.

The follow feature is basically still in beta as it needs lots of help and takes time to figure out who is talking if there are 2 people in the room.

Speakers are very nice, big improvements I have seen from my first gen Alexa to this one. Is it an Apple homepod or Bose? No. But I don't have the same appreciation for audio as others, so to me its pretty much fine if it is clear and clean sounding.

Screen size is nice, i am not sure I am gonna watch hulu or netflix on it, but Its nice for recipes and music, reminders since mine sits near the kitchen/great room area.

Overall i'd wait for a discount to grab one knowing it has bugs needing continued development before its really ready for everyday consumers. I like to grab things a few months after they come out to give time to get the major bugs out, but still accept it might need some updates before its perfect.

4/5 stars for coolness and the fact that it still functions as any other Alexa. If the bugs are fixed then this is an easy 8/5 stars, but they are just kinda rough for the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars
L R,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2022","We purchased this to add to our kitchen. The clubs quality of the speaker is better than expected. We like the larger screen for things like recipes. We like that it moves with us to help with video chat with other rooms in our house or the outside cameras.
Things that I would like to see improved or maybe we haven’t figured out how to work that yet are:
1) our microwave keeps disconnecting so we are unable to use the show to control that, which is one reason we purchased this product
2) some commands such as asking Alexa to play music in our home doesn’t always function properly and must be said multiple times before it works on this product vs our others
3) we would like to be able to pull up favorite recipes we have saved on our phones/iPads onto the echo show screen and so far we have not figured out how to do that without asking Alexa to open Google then manually searching for the specific recipe
4) Alexa stops playing music while I have a recipe open. Cooking without music just doesn’t work. One reason we purchased this was to have one device in our kitchen that does all the work.
Overall we’re satisfied with this product. We will continue to research to try to work out the kinks or hope that Amazon makes some updates to allow this to work to the full potential we would like it to.",4.0 out of 5 stars
TJ,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2021","The Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) works as expected. Both the screen and audio are better than the predecessor, though there is still room for improvement for the price. I will say once you've used the large screen it will be hard to go back, this is a major strength.

Room from improvement:

- The ""follow"" feature which moves the screen: I would have the camera fixed in its home position unless you're:
- On a call
- Dropping in
- Or in guard mode

Yes, you could manually close the shutter but then you need to walk to it and manually open it when you want to answer a call (who wants that). Having the camera move when you're playing music or just walking around can give you the feeling of having your every moved watched by someone on the other end (not exactly a warm and fuzzy).

- Zoom feature, (yes I know its coming) Now that you have a 13 megapixel camera, it would be great to have the echo ID the direction of the person speaking and zoom in (even when there are multiple individuals in the room and zoom in). I understand zoom is coming, it will be interesting to see how Amazon pulls it off. Though the movement is a nice, having a close up of the person speaking to be is more important and would really be a significant enhancement, especially if you're more than 7 or 8 feet away from the camera.

- Audio, though much better than the previous gen, could be tweaked a bit.

Having said all that I like the Echo Show 10 3rd gen and recommend it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Ivan Infante,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2021","Our home is heavily reliant on Amazon devices. Each room has one so I've been a first gen user from the very beginning. The sound is great and better than previous gens. I like the feature that it follows you as you walk around the room so its been great from that aspect as well. The one problem I have constantly is that it doesn't hear me as well as the other's I've had. My wife and I find that we need to repeat ourselves quite often. The other problem which I hope is a feature they include with the next gen is that the screen can also tilt automatically when you use it as a home security camera. A few weeks ago we left on vacation and we thought we forgot something at home. It seemed perfect to open the Alexa app and use the camera to see if we left the item on the kitchen counter. However, the lack of tilt killed the feature since the screen was tilted up and I mostly saw the ceiling and very little kitchen counter. Otherwise, I see it as an improvement from previous generations but I sure hope Amazon takes the tilt into consideration as that will make this just perfect.

The other thing I've noticed is a bug in the software. When you have a timer running and just want to glace at the screen... it overlaps the clock time on the top right hand corner. The overlap makes the timer and clock hard to see. I wish they would change this where logic would say if you have a timer... show clock on top and timers right beneath them.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Ron,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2021","For starters, there is no main menu screen. It just goes through recently done actions or music played and runs ads for different things. I do like the aod with the time and date and weather. The camera does not follow you properly, it doesn’t turn to you correctly more than half the time when you talk to it initially. If you touch the screen too hard it will tell you that it has bumped into something every time. After being bumped it goes limp and decides to just roll until it finds it’s own new settling spot. It’s very confusing to use compared to other echos shows I’ve used. The web browser is very slow even with my wireless speeds over 900mbps. When viewing my camera with this device, it constantly says buffering over and over and has a 10 second delay to real time. On every other device I use to view my cameras, it is in real time and it never buffers. The power cable is white and I have a black device, not a good look at all. The power cable is also far too short. It limits where it can be placed dramatically. I’ve had this since release day and I still have not had any updates other than the 3 it required after unboxing. If it’s not improved by the end of the week I will likely be sending it back. I do not see anything worth a higher price tag for this at the current time. If they get rid of all the bugs and make the software better in an update, THEN MAYBE it will be worth the high price.

Every time I try to watch Hulu, it tells me ""something went wrong."" At times, it seems to even get confused with locating Prime Video. It seems getting movies on Prime and Netflix is hit or miss. I can never get Hulu on the Echo Show 5 or the 10. This has been a hugh disappointment. It continuously tells me NPR is not available. The Food Kitchen recipe feature works great. I can save and view any recipes. That has been a pleasure. I use the Echo 10 every day. If you don't care about Hulu or watching movies, it's great. Otherwise, you would be better off sticking to a less expensive version. I continue to be more than satisfied with my Echo Auto, Echo Dot, and original Echo. I am happy with the Echo Show 5 but I did not have the same expectations with that Show that I did when purchasing the Show 10.

6/18/21 This is an update to my original review. I contacted Echo support and they were able to resolve the problem. James was great and I can now watch Hulu live tv on my Echo Show 10.

Daiwan Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2021","Out of the box: the Echo 10 3 Gen has great build quality and a solid feel. The rotary motor is smooth and moves effortlessly.

Setup: setup was simple requires some software updates on initial load up. Motion setup was ok, be sure to have a device on stable surface. The smallest detection in surface movement will cause the initial motion setup to fail. This can be a bit frustrating, but not a game changer. Hopefully a software update will help reduce surface movement sensitivity.

Sound: music is great on the device and clear has some really great lows with little to no distortion at max volume.

Video call quality: this is an awesome piece of tech I have had several video calls and the human detection and following is eerie but great. Voices and picture comes across clear on the device. Be sure not to accidentally bump the screen while in motion or this will cause the motion to stop. However, saying ""Alexa, Follow me"" will rengage the motion detection.

Be cautious of taking the device to max range, the device does not do a complete 360. Taking the device to max range may cause the camer/screen to bounce back and forth to try and capture the best angle. Make sure you are in a well lit room as the motion detection will remain unusable in low light situations

Overall: I am happy with the product it still retains a lot of the great Alexa features and integrates well with my smarthome setup.

Paul O,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","This is a revised review - I bought a unit the first week it became available which was returned, and recently bought this second replacement unit.
Best to look at Alexa and Zignee features separately -
For Alexa features, the 10 great. Same features as ole units, with the addition of the ability to have the frame track you so you can always see the screen clearly, and the ability to view the camera from the Alexa app and look around the room. If you dont want the tracking motion, it can be turned off in the settings. You can also block remove viewing in the app, and even when enabled, a notice is displayed that someone is using the camera.
For Zigbee features - currently this is OK, but not great. While there are good zigbee contact sensors and motion sensors, you may struggle to find something suitable for things like moisture sensors or garage openers.
There are moisture sensors and garage openers that will work with Alexa, but these often wireless and require a separate account (versus just connecting directly via zigbee), so you may find yourself managing additional accounts associated with these devices.
This is in contrast to something like smartthings (z-wave) which seems to have a lot more options in terms of devices that can connect directly to their hub (i.e. without additional accounts).
Im guessing this is just a relatively new feature for these echo hubs and more devices aside from contact and motion sensors will become available that connect directly via zigbee.
Even with the shortcomings on the zigbee front this is worth taking a look at - i would say 3.5 stars (rounded up to 4).",4.0 out of 5 stars
James Z.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2023","This is probably my favorite type of Echo, and it's great to have on the end of a counter or island in a kitchen or other place where you're moving around a lot. It doubles as a camera since you can drop in and pan the device to look around (unless you have smart motion disabled). It's also a reasonably sized screen if you're watching something casually, but the screen is too small to watch from any distance or if you're really invested in what you're watching.

The downsides are that it seems to struggle with any sort of background noise and won't always hear you correctly as a result. It also has some glitches, like sometimes it will be playing something and you can't make it stop unless you unplug it, and occasionally it stops responding audibly even though it is responding on screen silently and again, there's nothing you can do but unplug it. I still recommend it, but these are annoying issues.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I purchased this for its alleged integration with the blink cameras and Alexa. Well it’s still lacking, I just purchased 2 of the Blink Doorbells in theory when the doorbell is pressed the echo show is supposed to show that camera automatically (once you enable it to do so) well it doesn’t do that or it takes about a minute to show the camera so that is honestly a bit disappointing. I’ve actually did some testing and you can actually check your phone more quickly… considering Alexa, blink, and echo are all owned by Amazon you’d thing their communication and integration would be much more seamless. I hope this is something they are working on. Now I would still recommend the Echo Show 10 (3rd gen) I purchased one for my parents and their home and cameras. Hoping the integration improves…",4.0 out of 5 stars
Stephen White,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","1) Needs Zoom (why does only the Echo Show 8 have zoom? C'mon Amazon. I know you're too busy cranking out new products to care about your current ones but *this is your new product*)

2) The fact that you can't move the camera in a dark room is DUMB. I repeat, you can't move the camera around in a dark room, or a room with blue light, or any darker color. It stops you and says ""motion deactivated because there is not enough light"", whether you're trying to move it in a dark room with your voice or through the app.

3) Calls to my friends' Echo show devices should be easier. But that's less a gripe about this echo device and more about all of them.

4) Using the Alexa app on the iPad and trying to move the camera from left to right is a pain. Because the mute button is below the video stream, it thinks I'm trying to scroll up and down constantly and I keep having to fight to see the entire stream and not just the mute/end stream buttons.

Other than these gripes, this is a pretty cool and innovative device. Nice sound, cool that you can move the device around - if you're going to do it for security while you're away from home, you'll definitely need smart lights that you can turn on and off remotely, too, given how something as simple as the dark renders the Echo Show 10 3rd Gen an overpriced Echo Show 2nd Gen.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Brian Billow,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2023","Let's start with what I love about the Echo Show 10. First off, it's amazing to have my Ring cameras, Hulu and all the other wonderful features Alexa has to offer on one device. The unit is motion activated so it follows me around the kitchen while I'm cooking. I love to have the morning news playing while I'm making my coffee. The camera feature allows me to check in on what's going on in the kitchen when I'm not at home. It's a great little added security feature! Now there are some bugs in the software which makes the Show 10 glitch from time to time. I do love this device though and when the next generation comes out I'll probably upgrade and move this unit into my bathroom. I gave it 4 stars because of the glitch and it can be a little slow some times. Great product Amazon!!",4.0 out of 5 stars

I do wish the touchscreen was smoother and as stated there were NO ads. That’s why I’m only giving this a Fourth star,4.0 out of 5 stars
tony,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2021","*Pros
You can watch TV, Facebook, Utube, Real time cooking menus and shows and it will follow you so you don't miss anything.
Fast set up
Always show interesting subjects educating you how to use it.
Follows you pretty good. You can drop in your house and see whats going on. From your phone or whatever.
It works just like the regular Alexa's but with Big display.
The music shows the words and you can sing along.
Sound is pretty good.

*Con
It is offset a little when its looking at you.

*Summary
If your broke and bitch a lot don't buy this. Also don't buy this if you have slow internet service. I'm sure that is why some people are having problems.
But if your easy to please just buy it you wont be disappointed. Unless you get one that really is defective. This is my 8th Amazon Alexa device and I'm ready to trade in my other ones. I like they give you $25 trade in. Because my trades ins all work good still. Id rather know they are going to a new home than get stuffed in a closet.
I only gave it 4 Stars because I never give anything or anyone 5 Stars. I'm sure the bad reviews on this are from Pro Google Home Users. I have a Google home also. I tell you its great too. Just buy both and be happy!",4.0 out of 5 stars
monty stinson,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2022","I bought this to replace my aging under cabinet tv. I cut off my satellite tv in January, bought a Recast to record network shows. I wanted to get this when I found out I could watch most of the streaming networks and live shows on it thru my Recast.
It took a while to figure out what to say to Alexa to get to live tv (Alexa show channel guide). To change channels you have to say the station call letters, the channel number or “NBC” doesn’t work.
The tracking feature is somewhat useful, we keep if off most of the time.
Audio quality is pretty good, much better than my Echo Dot!
There are numerous other small features that we like, the timer, if you’re listening to music it can show you the lyrics, weather reports.
Overall I’m glad we bought it (on sale). I believe it’s one of those products you if think you’ll you probably will. If you do a little research and find out if it will do what you need it to you’ll be happy with it.
With that in mind I would definitely recommend it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
BornForTech,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2022","So let's look at the model Echo Show 10 itself. Thought it was going to be something like putting a tablet on top of an Apple Home Pod (first gen). Well....it's not. Keep forgetting the Echo Show devices are not tablet user interface devices and the sound quality is not even close to the Home Pod, so just a tad disappointed with that. That said, I do really like the device. I don't have a problem with the Echo UI, in fact i kinda like it better than a tablet. The sound isn't bad, it just isn't what I was hoping for after looking at the design and certainly the price point. The screen and camera quality are really quite good, although when I watch the home screen transition from one picture to another the transition is not super smooth, like maybe the processor is a little under-powered. Not sure about that one tho. The motion feature is nice that it moves to ""look at"" whoever in the room is talking to it (nice feature), the problem is you can turn the motion off, close the camera and still it's gonna move to what ever section of the house has the brightest light. That is so annoying. I might want it to stay looking ""at me"" and not move around so I ask it to play something, turn any motion option OFF and it will eventually move anyway. Drives me up the wall. I think that could probably be addressed in a software OS fix, hopefully soon. Also, when you talk to it, it will move around a lot like it's trying to figure out where you are exaclty. All in all, it isn't a bad device for the living room, picture, sound, camera all nice, just needs the motion adjusted to ""don't move"" means ""don't move"" and they could probably upgrade the processor or maybe adjust the OS a little. If you need an Echo Show and you are only going to purchase one AND don't need it to function as a hub, I'd go with the Echo Show 8 (2021). Otherwise, wait for some changes to this model. Gave it 4 stars for all nice features, but minus one big star for the motion. Does play live video feeds like ABC News really well, that's a plus...and my favorite Sci-Fi (Expanse) looks amazing on it too. If they fix any issues I'll update this review. Hope it helps.
Review Update 9/3/2022: So I moved the Echo 10 into a different room where the lighting was more even and that stopped most of the moving around problems. Then one day it seemed to want to move again and when I was finished a screen popped up that asked if I wanted to change the direction limits. I said yes and it had a great feature I wasn't aware of that let me set the boundaries to the smallest movement possible. With those two changes I have updated my 4 stars to 5. Problems solved and now I don't have to constantly look at the back of the screen. Very happy, really like this product. Thinking about buying another one to replace an Echo 5. The 5 is amazing, but I've gotten to the point where I just want the biggest screen possible, thus the only reason to replace the 5. Good luck, hope this info helps!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Vlad,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021","I was enthusiastic when I ordered my Echo Show 3rd Gen. It was supposed to be a robot but not quite. Awesome speakers, great camera, rotating screen?! I got it out of the box, set it up and although I was a bit thrown off by the white cord sticking out of the black unit like a sore thumb, I really didn’t have major issues. The problem was that after using it for a bit longer bugs started to pop out.
Bugs observed:
- Screen rotates past you.
- Barely touching the screen for an action result in a path is blocked message.
- Can’t rotate at night because if an area is lit dimly will result in motion stopping and an error message
- Some error messages disappear pretty quickly
- During a video call the zooming, orienting of the lenses is not quite right
- Sometimes it won’t respond to the wake up word.
Hardware wise though, this one is better in every regard than its predecessor, which I considered a 5 star product, so the potential is there. So, while I think they would have benefited from a bit more of development time, I think the potential is there. Hopefully, they can do a firmware update to correct the issues. At this point I am not returning it, but if you haven’t bought it, I would wait for a few updates.
UPDATE JAN2022 (Raised one star):
Some of the most annoying bugs have been fixed but not all of them have. However, the improvements are significant enough that I would consider purchasing another one if on sale. If not,the current Gen Show 8 is really good too.
UPDATE JUL2022 (Raised another star)
This is what I expected when I ordered this device. Haven’t had a bug in a while. Screen rotation is significantly better, stopping at the correct spots and following better. Additionally, a friend that ordered a current gen black Echo Show 8, received a black power cord with it; it appears that Amazon is moving in the right direction with the power cords. Given that those were my main issues with the device, I raised it a star.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Matthew,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024","These features blew my mind. It is very big, has a MOTOR to ROTATE! And looks nice. It’s a bit lacking in responsiveness but the amazing features such as head tracking and face recognition made up. Would buy again!",5.0 out of 5 stars
C,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021","The new Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is a big improvement over the previous 2nd Gen version. The Show 10 is now attached to a swivel base that lets the Show 10 constantly rotate to face you as you move around the room. Other changes include: a new speaker configuration, MUCH better camera, better processor, and Amazon Sidewalk support. Here are my thoughts so far:

THE GOOD:

-SETUP – Setup was super easy. The Show came configured to my account, I didn't have to log in or even enter wifi passwords. It connected, downloaded some updates, and then walked me through customizing the range of motion.
-MOTION- This is the most obvious new improvement. The Show 10 will now track your movement and turn to face you as you move around the room. The Show seems to have very good facial tracking, and it will rotate on its horizontal axis to follow you (you can also manually tilt the screen up and down to your desired vertical position.) We tested this while playing movies and while viewing our remote cameras, and it worked perfectly. We also tested with multiple people in the room; and the Show seems to lock onto one face and moves to follow that face, until it can't see that face anymore and will move to another face. Or if someone uses the Wake Word “Alexa,” it will turn toward where that voice was coming from. This also works for video calls, though we noticed that on video calls the Show will rotate to try to keep ALL of our faces in view. Sometimes this might mean it faces in between two people so that the camera can see both of us, and then automatically zooms the camera in or out to adjust. Which brings me to the next big improvement:
-13MP CAMERA – We were very impressed with the quality of the new camera, and with the tracking technology it uses. Not only are images crisp and detailed on video calls, but the camera will actually automatically zoom in and out to adjust to the people in the shot. For example I can back up from my kitchen into the living room, and the camera will zoom in and follow me. When you combine this with the movement and facial tracking, it is almost like having your own camera man follow you around the room on your call. The family members we called said they could see so much more detail. There is also now a physical shutter that you can close to cover the camera if you want to.
-SPEAKERS – The old 2nd Gen Show 10 had dual 2” neodymium drivers, but this new 3rd Gen Show 10 has two 1” tweeters and a 3” woofer. I can definitely tell the difference, although I really don't use the Show for listening to music very often. In testing out a few songs, I noticed that the new 3rd Gen seems louder at max volume, and less muffled. Definitely an improvement, though maybe not quite on the level of the Echo Studio.
-PROCESSOR – The new Show 10 has both an upgraded main processor, and also a second Amazon AZ1 processor. This should result in slightly faster repose times, and better future performance; although I really haven't been able to tell much of a difference so far. AZ1 is supposed to be faster and more efficient, and allow voice commands to be processed locally instead of having to go to the cloud; so we'll see if this is noticeable in the future.
-ZIGBEE/SIDEWALK – The previous version included a Zigbee hub, but this version also includes Amazon Sidewalk compatibility. Sidewalk is a long range connection technology that Amazon plans to use for devices that will be able to reach much further; (the initial announcement estimated up to half a mile). This technology isn't really being used yet, but it is nice to know this future tech is built in.

THE BAD:

-WHITE POWER CORD – Yes, for some reason that same white power cord that ships with the Echo 4th Gen is also included for this Show 10. No matter what color Show you get (I got black), you still get a white power cord. I'm a little surprised that they went with this decision again, but it really doesn't bother me much at all. Just thought I'd mention it in case that matters to you.
-LARGE FOOTPRINT – Since the device rotates, you really have to be careful about where you put it. The Show 10 comes with a footprint guide, that suggests that you make sure you have enough space around the device to avoid the screen knocking over a glass of water, for example. This also wasn't a big deal for me, but keep in mind you will probably need more space than the previous version. The specs recommend a 10” by 15” space, but I think you could get away with less.

*Note – You can disable the movement by saying “Alexa disable Motion,” or by turning it off in the Alexa app on your phone. Also, when you first setup your Show, there is a slider bar that let's you choose how far the screen should rotate in each direction. It seems to go almost 360 degrees maximum, but you can limit the radius so it turns much less. You can also change this in the 'Motion' menu under Settings.

Overall, I am VERY pleased with this new Show 10. The camera clarity is great, and the face tracking technology is so impressive; there's just nothing else like it for video calls to our family. This is a huge upgrade!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Vincent,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","I have owned the last two Generation Echo Shows. The Echo Show 1 & Echo Show Gen 2. The Echo Show 10 solves all the issues that the first two devices had, and adds even more features jam packed into one great device.

Now before I get into the meat and potatoes — let me tell you about the truly magical experience I have had with this device. It arrived in a box almost double the size of the previous model — and this device is BIG! The screen is huge! The speaker is also apparently much more powerful than the last generation — and I can tell, that is most definitely the case.

But the true magic comes when you power on and set up the Echo. The Amazon team really did wonders creating this device. Both the camera and the AI in this thing are crazy good. Assuming you have motion enabled, as soon as you say the wake word, i.e., “Alexa” the device honed in on my direction, rotated towards me, and began listening.

If you walk around the room, this device follows you. You can’t understand how cool this is until you try it out. I would upload a video, but I’m sure you can look it up on YouTube, and there will likely be hundreds of reviews showcasing it here.

There’s something about the tracking technology that Amazon has gotten just right. I called up my Grandma who has my old first gen echo show, and she didn’t even realize we were conversing as I was walking around my room. She thought I was just stationary the whole time. When I pointed it out and showed to her, her jaw dropped.

The way the camera zooms in on you, and the range of video it can show is phenomenal. I can jump onto my bed (my echo is on my nightstand) and the echo will zoom in and focus on me. When I go off the side of my bed, it follows zooming out, and can follow my body all the way as I walk back across the room towards the device.

It all feels so natural. The only thing that is missing would be if the Echo device itself moved! You can now have a conversation with someone when moving around your environment, without having to remain stationary.

In a kitchen, a home gym, or anywhere you’d want to talk with someone actively, this device would be really extraordinary to play with, especially during covid times.

I use my device in my room as an Alarm clock — so previously, my camera would be staring across the room as to not let me look at the screen if needed (for time/alarms, etc). Now, with the camera cover, I feel much more comfortable covering the camera and rotating the device to look towards me at night.

Now, take these into consideration as you decide if you want to purchase:

First, if you want to get the latest and greatest Echo device, the purchase is a no brainer. I am an Amazon loyalist, and can say that even from first impressions, this device blows all other Amazon devices I’ve owned away.

Second, if you’re a user who doesn’t mind the camera being uncovered, then you’ll have no problem with this device. You’ll love it. The motion features will be left on 16/7 for me. I wouldn’t be comfortable allowing having the camera on while I’m sleeping (and staring at me), but for a public area in your home — who cares? I wouldn’t mind, I’d leave it on all day — it following you around is magical.

Third, if you fall into the second issue above, you CAN use the camera cover to disable motion. If you don’t mind sliding the cover open and closed every morning/night, this could work for a nightstand alarm clock, and the hassle/inconvenience would be worth it.

Pros:
- Motion is magical
- Camera is high definition
- Sound is great. Music sounds lively. Lyrics on screen that follow you around the room
- Adaptive screen dimming still works even when camera/motion is blocked/disabled
- You can manually rotate the device when motion is off i.e. I’m going to bed, to point it towards me. I don’t know if that’s safe for the motor — I’ll ask Amazon!

Cons:
- If your room doesn’t have a full range of motion, the Echo might get confused when following you around. Since it is on my nightstand, the echo really only needs to turn about 90° to see in front if itself, and when I go to the left of my room. If I go to exit my room, it might start losing tracking, which could probably fixed in a future OS update (to halt moving at a specific point, which it already does).

Bottom Line: I 100% recommend this as an upgrade to an old device or a new device for any potential Echo owners. If you don’t feel comfortable with the motion controls, turn them off, but you won’t get the full package and what I think is the biggest selling point of this device. Put this in a public room and try it out — you won’t regret it.

EDIT: After seeing more reviews a few points to mention:

1. White power cord. Who cares? You dock a star for this? Don’t listen to normies giving poor reviews who think the color of a power cord which is draped out of sight will have any effect on how the device improves over it’s predecessor
2. Complaints over resolution: if you’re not buying this thing to watch full-fledged movies on, it’s fine. You won’t notice.
3. Complaints over tracking: it won’t track you with the camera in the dark. A future models can probably have an infrared light added (similar to FaceID) to fix that problem.
4. I saw someone complaining about Airplay and multiroom audio. Echo devices support multiroom audio through Amazon’s Ecosystem — not bluetooth. It has never supported that. Why would you expect this to change without notice?

Don’t listen to the haters. People reviewing are acting as if this device isn’t 5x better than the last generation of the Show. Motion is a stellar addition that would bring moving smart devices into the mainstream. No one here knows what a
the Facebook Portal is, because there was never a solid backing behind the product line. Echos are in homes across America, and I’m sure that this will lead to better smart devices from Amazon in the future.

For reference, I have owned an: Echo Show 1, Echo Show 2, Echo Dot, and have coded ~5 Alexa Skills. I know these devices. This gen is great. Give it 1 month and these will be 5/5. These reviews all read so fake. Who purchases a device and returns it same-day due to a different colored power cord? Who returns a device that doesn’t do something they expected when it was never said the device did it?

Low-information consumers and people with too high expectations... there’s a reason why it’s called PRE-ORDERING, because you KNOW you are going to like it and/or take what you get. No one forced you to buy a day 1 device.

TL;DR: Don’t listen to bad reviews. Buy this if you’re in the market.",5.0 out of 5 stars

kenya Garcia,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2024","I recently started using the Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen). Here’s a review focusing on its convenience:
Convenience:

The Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is an incredibly convenient addition to my home. The standout feature is its ability to move and follow me around the room. The smart display’s motorized base means it rotates to keep me in view during video calls or while watching recipes and tutorials. This hands-free feature is fantastic for multitasking—whether I’m cooking, working out, or just moving around the room, the Echo Show 10 stays with me, ensuring I never miss a beat.

1. Smart Movement:

The Echo Show 10’s ability to automatically pivot and track me during video calls or while I’m interacting with it is a game-changer. No more awkward adjustments or missed moments—this device ensures I stay in the frame and can see the screen clearly, regardless of where I move.

2. Crystal-Clear Display:

The HD display is vibrant and sharp, making it perfect for watching videos, browsing photos, or following along with recipes. The 10.1-inch screen size is just right—not too big and not too small—offering an excellent viewing experience without dominating my countertop or desk space.

3. Premium Sound Quality:

The sound quality is top-notch, with rich, clear audio that fills the room. Whether I'm listening to music, catching up on the news, or watching a movie, the Echo Show 10 delivers an immersive audio experience. The built-in speakers are powerful and provide crisp sound, enhancing the overall convenience of the device.

4. Voice-Controlled Smart Home Hub:

Integrated with Alexa, the Echo Show 10 acts as a central hub for my smart home devices. I can control lights, thermostats, and other smart gadgets with simple voice commands. The convenience of managing my smart home from a single device, especially with voice commands, simplifies my daily routines.

5. Video Calling Made Easy:

The Echo Show 10 simplifies video calls with its high-definition camera and auto-framing feature. It’s easy to connect with family and friends, and the camera ensures that everyone in the room is visible and in focus. Plus, the privacy shutter provides peace of mind when not in use.

6. Interactive Features:

The touch screen interface is intuitive and responsive, making it easy to interact with apps, view photos, or check the weather. The device integrates seamlessly with various services, including Amazon services and third-party apps, enhancing its versatility.

7. Home Automation Integration:

The Echo Show 10 works well with other smart home devices, allowing me to automate tasks and create routines. Setting up routines for daily tasks like turning on the lights or adjusting the thermostat is straightforward, making home management more efficient.

Cons:

While the Echo Show 10 excels in convenience, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider:

1. Size and Placement:

The device is relatively large and requires a bit of space. Its size might be a consideration if you have a smaller kitchen or desk area.

2. Price Point:

It is on the higher end of the price spectrum for smart displays. While the features justify the cost, it may not be the most budget-friendly option for everyone.

3. Motion Tracking Sensitivity:

While the motion tracking is a fantastic feature, it can sometimes be overly sensitive. In certain lighting conditions or with rapid movements, the device may have difficulty keeping up.

Final Thoughts:

The Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is a highly convenient and feature-rich smart display. Its ability to move and track users, combined with excellent sound quality and a sharp HD display, makes it a valuable addition to any smart home. Despite a few minor considerations regarding size and price, the Echo Show 10’s functionality and ease of use make it a worthwhile investment for those looking to enhance their smart home experience.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Jace,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2024","This is by far our family’s favorite Amazon product. We started with an echo dot (2nd gen) in 2017, then fire tv sticks, plug ins, fire tablets, echo auto and echo shows. We pretty much have an alexa/echo device in each rooms.
It was very easy to install especially if you already have an amazon account. Also, check out their trade-in program. Take advantage of upgrading your echo devices and experience how amazon develops their products and try their best to give customers great and reliable products.
Now, this Echo Show 10 does a lot of work in our home. I won’t discuss about any technical things about it since I do not speak that language. However I will review this from a Mom’s standpoint.
As a parent of curious kids, you’ll get hundreds of questions a day. Sometimes you’d know the answers and there are times you don’t. The device helps me with that. Sure the other echo dots can do it but having a screen that follows you is more fun and more informative for kids. It makes my kids interested in current events as it shows news articles and photos. It would give some facts and interesting topics for us to discuss further. Of course, my kids will do their own research and it keeps them more interested. From music, history, conversation, spelling, you name it, it would have the answers.
Next is the camera feature, any approved contacts can drop in on this device. It’s amazing since they could pretty much video call other relatives that have alexa app or devices. It makes us feel more connected with our loved ones that can’t operate phones to video call.
So aside from connecting us with humans, it connects us to other non humans; my vacuum cleaner, air purifier, lights, window blinds and so much more. It helps me multi task. As a mom, life gets busy and I forget a lot of things! I rely on this device to remind me about my schedule, chores, shopping lists, recipes, etc. I do have other ways to remind myself about things but it helps that there’s a device that will show me and tell me to do it. It makes me remember more when I see my list and this thing does it for me without all the paper clutter.
Then there’s more features to explore!
It helps me so I wish other moms would have something like this to will help them everyday.",5.0 out of 5 stars

RBrylawski,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2024","We've had one of the early Echo Shows for a few years now and while it was fine, it was starting to show its age, so it got moved to a bedroom and after looking at all the new models I chose the newest Echo Show 10 (3rd generation). It's quite an upgrade in every way.

The screen is bigger and high definition at 10.1"" and it follows you around as you move around, which for a kitchen application is great. I can be using the Echo Show while I'm cooking and moving from counter to counter and the screen stays with me.

One of the biggest advantages of this new Echo Show is the speaker. It's really a big speaker and the moving screen is mounted to the speaker. But the output of the speaker is quite remarkable and music actually sounds terrific on it. The speakers deliver realistic sound which is directional.

Like most of the Echo Shows, once you've set up one through the Alexa app on your iPhone, setup is a breeze. In fact, when you order this 3rd gen Echo Show, you answer some questions about your network at home and out of the box it basically sets itself up. Though, I must admit the first one we received wouldn't connect and Amazon immediately sent a replacement device, which did work.

You can use this for video calls and it even has a 13PM digital camera which you can use to take a selfie. You can integrate as many photos as you want to the display from your cell phone or Amazon Photos collection if you use Amazon Photos to store your pictures (we do, actually). You can open the app and see what's happening in your kitchen or speak to someone in the kitchen from anywhere. If you have a Ring Doorbell, you can just say Alexa, show me my Ring Doorbell. Or ask Alexa to pull up a recipe quickly if you need one. It's all just so easy to use.

The options to integrate things like your car, security system, smart devices, are pretty much endless and super easy to set up as well.

All in all, I couldn't be happier with my decision to move up to the Echo Show 10!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Contacted Amazon who only stated that they will send a new system and they will provide a return label. What they don’t tell you is that you must send the system back and a replacement is not on the way. You must wait until they receive your item and they will see if they can repair or replace it with a possibility it will be a refurbished item. There’s more to this issue that will be too long to explain. Just know you can get numerous representatives telling you different things. Totally disappointed in this awful process.

It was sort of spooky that the screen would always face her if she got up and walked around, but she has finally found that useful.

The sound is great! We had the original Echo in her office area, the one like a Pringles can. It had such a great sound, but it started not recognizing us trying to get it to do commands.

I put one of the hockey puck style Echo's on her desk, and the sound was just ok.

My wife listens to music all day on her Echo, so when I put this in place of the puck one, she was really happy with the sound. You get the full range of music on the Show.

Also, she loves it's like a tablet too that she can ask Alexa to look up things for her.

It's really easy to setup. Also, for multiple users. It knows my wife's voice, and knows when I'm speaking and acknowledges who is talking which is wild.

The 10.1"" HD screen is a game-changer, designed to follow me around, ensuring that video calls, recipes, and shows are always right where I need them. The premium directional sound from the speakers elevates the entire experience, making every interaction immersive and enjoyable.

One standout feature is the 13 MP camera with auto-framing and motion tracking. Whether I'm video calling friends or capturing a quick snapshot, the camera keeps me front and center, ensuring I never miss a moment. The smart home integration is a breeze – I've set up Zigbee and Matter devices effortlessly, and now I can ask Alexa to control lights, show security camera feeds, and adjust thermostats without the need for a separate hub.

The Echo Show 10 has become my ultimate kitchen companion, offering personalized recipes, hands-free cooking with step-by-step instructions, and convenient timers. The ability to turn the home screen into a digital frame using Amazon Photos adds a personal touch to my living space. I appreciate the emphasis on privacy, with features like a mic/camera off button and a built-in camera shutter, giving me full control over when and how my device interacts with me.

There are two devices in my house, one device at my parents' house, and the non-rotating version at my son's house. We can video chat with each other (voice command: drop in.) The video quality is perfect, and we can hear each other without any problems. We watch YouTube videos and play Sirius XM stations all by voice command. We tell it when to start music and when to stop, including playing music for one hour after we leave the house for the pets. The speaker quality is very good and enjoyable. We set timers and reminders and alarms. Alexa suggests videos to watch and tells us jokes. The screen rotates automatically to remain facing my direction as I move about the kitchen, including during video chats where both callers are moving around the kitchen. We ask Alexa questions and she gives us answers from the Internet. I can tell Alexa to call someone in my phone list, she will dial the call, and I have the entire (non-video) phone conversation via the Alexa device and speaker (not my phone.) Alexa is connected to Amazon, so the device keeps me up to date on the status of my orders as soon as they ship, counting down the days to arrival, and letting me know a package has arrived on my doorstep. It gives me weather alerts for my town, and also my son's town. It saves recipes for me. And we probably don't use half of what it can do. It's great.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Troy,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2021","The new Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is a big improvement over the previous 2nd Gen version. The Show 10 is now attached to a swivel base that lets the Show 10 constantly rotate to face you as you move around the room. Other changes include: a new speaker configuration, MUCH better camera, better processor, and Amazon Sidewalk support. Here are my thoughts so far:

THE GOOD:

-SETUP – Setup was super easy. The Show came configured to my account, I didn't have to log in or even enter wifi passwords. It connected, downloaded some updates, and then walked me through customizing the range of motion.
-MOTION- This is the most obvious new improvement. The Show 10 will now track your movement and turn to face you as you move around the room. The Show seems to have very good facial tracking, and it will rotate on its horizontal axis to follow you (you can also manually tilt the screen up and down to your desired vertical position.) We tested this while playing movies and while viewing our remote cameras, and it worked perfectly. We also tested with multiple people in the room; and the Show seems to lock onto one face and moves to follow that face, until it can't see that face anymore and will move to another face. Or if someone uses the Wake Word “Alexa,” it will turn toward where that voice was coming from. This also works for video calls, though we noticed that on video calls the Show will rotate to try to keep ALL of our faces in view. Sometimes this might mean it faces in between two people so that the camera can see both of us, and then automatically zooms the camera in or out to adjust. Which brings me to the next big improvement:
-13MP CAMERA – We were very impressed with the quality of the new camera, and with the tracking technology it uses. Not only are images crisp and detailed on video calls, but the camera will actually automatically zoom in and out to adjust to the people in the shot. For example I can back up from my kitchen into the living room, and the camera will zoom in and follow me. When you combine this with the movement and facial tracking, it is almost like having your own camera man follow you around the room on your call. The family members we called said they could see so much more detail. There is also now a physical shutter that you can close to cover the camera if you want to.

Nonsha,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2021","First of all I love this thing. For what it does, it's pretty amazing. Is it worth $250.00... probably not in my opinion. Integration and usage is really good for house devices is really cool. I love that I can view security CAMs via the screen. I have no issues with the ease of use.

A few issue though... There are a lot of things you ask Alexa and she has no clue or just will not respond. Also... And I know parents allow there kids around this thing, but it should have an Adult Mode that can be toggled on and off. If I ask an adult type question or ask for a joke (as an adult), it should give me an adult type answer, not I don't know that or no answer at all, or some stupid kid joke. That is not the unit's issue I know. It's the software; it's how Amazon designed it to make it family friendly. I get it, but there are some of us who DO NOT have kids, and would like something a little more adult orientated or at least less family orientated. Little issue not a deal breaker. As for skills... Most are worthless. (Tried lots of them, MOST are not good.) They either do not work, want you to pay, or are just flat out stupid. But again that is not 'cause of this unit, it's software in general for all Echos. One other little annoyance. I should be able to turn off any content or suggestions of content that I wish (in the settings) so it does not keep asking me if I want to watch whatever or listen to whatever. I do not need prompts for watching news or TV shows and movies. (That is why I have a TV.) I'll make up my own mind what content I wish to view. And you should be able to turn off or on the lyrics while a song is playing. I do not need to see all the words of a song on Amazon Music. Play the music, do not show the words. If I want to see them then give the option to turn on that feature.

OK other than the above, would I recommend this unit. Yes, because of the screen interface. Makes it better I think. Could you just as easily have an earlier version of the show (cheaper version) without this one. Yes. Is it a nice toy? Yes. Would I buy it again. Yes if the price was cheaper. Maybe if it was about $100.00 less.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I.M. Anamazoner,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2023","If, before the invention of the Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen), I had been tasked with creating the perfect smart display for my split downstairs situation, frankly, I wouldn't have had enough imagination to dream up the design of this device.

Situated between my kitchen-dining area on the one side and my living room on the other, lies a media niche, atop which now rotates my new Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen). It replaces an Echo Show 8 (1st gen) smart display -- another fine device. The Show 10 improves on the Show 8 for me by, of course, rotating toward me when I'm on either side of the media niche, and by allowing me to set the display perpendicular to the ground, not angled like the Show 8, which is better suited for that reason on a lower surface (like a table or counter).

Before buying my Show 10, I read some negative reviews about ad-sponsored pictures that occasionally rotate onto what the Show 10 displays. As a complaint, give me a break. First these unobtrusive pictures appear very infrequently in my experience. Plus they also show up on my other Echo shows (both 8's). And finally, if they help Amazon pay for the conveniences that my Echo devices provide, I have no problem with that!",5.0 out of 5 stars
fullajoy365,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2023","I love this product so much! I am slowly making my home automation a reality and Alexa is a great addition to my home. I have played games on this product; I have it control the lighting in my home and some other things like music. I have this product in my kitchen so I can use it while I cook.

At first, it was a little creepy have the screen follow me around but now I cannot live without this product. It is strange that I even say please when I ask Alexa to do things for me! :)

Set up was really easy and setting up my automation was relatively simple and quick. I am sure that I am not using this product to its fullest capabilities, but I am constantly learning what it can do so I will probably love it more as I learn more.

Highly recommend if you want help with tasks like setting alarms, reminders, adding something to your calendar, or even sending directions to your phone or car. I will probably buy another one for my home office.",5.0 out of 5 stars
John Lee,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2023","So far, I am surprised but I really like this product. I bought it at Amazon prime day and to be honest, I probably would wait for a sale like Amazon prime day, but for the price I picked it up for, I would say I'm definitely happy with it. I do have an echo show 5 from a few years ago, and I don't get too much use out of it, due to the fact that it is too small too see but this echo 10, is a real fun thing to play with. Firstly, I really like the speakers. Played music out of it and I was really impressed. Now, I don't geek out with speakers so I can't compare it with high end speakers but, I will say to me, it sounds very nice. I really like the feature that if you call it ""alexa"", then it'll turn and face you wherever you are ain't the room. It is not a 360 turn though (not sure why) but very close to it. Anyway, very nice and big enough screen. Obviously very responsive. Can be used as a drop in security feature, such as when you're out of the house and want to check in on the dogs, you can. There is a lot of features I tried on this unique device (unique cause calling it, it'll turn to face you) but I really, really like this device and considering buying another one (when it's on sale).",5.0 out of 5 stars

I recently upgraded to the Amazon Echo 10, and I'm blown away by its cutting-edge technology, especially the innovative ""Follow Your Face"" feature. This smart speaker has revolutionized my daily routine and entertainment experience.

Pros:
- Rotating Screen: The Echo Show 10's dynamic screen follows you, offering an immersive experience during video calls and content consumption.
- Powerful Speakers: Crisp audio quality that fills the room, enhancing music playback and voice commands.
- Smart Home Hub: Effortlessly control compatible devices with built-in Zigbee hub, simplifying your smart home setup.
- Responsive Voice Control: Alexa's improved responsiveness and accuracy make daily tasks a breeze.
- High-Quality Camera: Crystal-clear video calls with the 13MP camera and intelligent framing.

Cons:
- Price: Slightly on the higher side, but the features justify the cost.
- Size: The substantial size may be a concern for those with limited space.
- Learning Curve: New users might need time to explore and maximize the device's potential.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I have a variety of Echo devices throughout my home, and this was my favorite one, until a little after 2 years old it quit working. I have tried everything recommended in the forums and have asked for the assistance of Amazon (the rep was extremely rude, and absolutely no help.) It will not stay connected to my wifi. I have moved it around (it was already the closest device to the router), shut down most everything in the house, turned it on and off, reset my router, and a host of other things. It will connect, but within 5 minutes, it drops the connection. For the price, it should still be working. I looked at ordering another Echo, but this one has no trade-in value. If this is such a great device, why is it not even listed for trade-in. My guess, they are having a lot of trouble with them and don't want them back.

However, some of the content itself is quite uninteresting (such as the polls), and the **advertisements** are a major annoyance for me. Lately, the ads have been showing more frequently, turning my Echo Show into a billboard in my kitchen. Despite repeatedly asking to not show certain ads, they persist. What's even more frustrating is that when I approach the screen to interact with the content (to press the unlike button), the ad immediately disappears, jumping to another screen without giving me the chance to dislike it.

I've tried unchecking options in the setup to reduce ads, but nothing seems to work. This issue with the advertisements is the main factor behind my disappointment and lower rating. If you don't mind having a billboard in your home, go for it.",2.0 out of 5 stars

kenya Garcia,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2024","I recently started using the Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen). Here’s a review focusing on its convenience:
Convenience:

The Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is an incredibly convenient addition to my home. The standout feature is its ability to move and follow me around the room. The smart display’s motorized base means it rotates to keep me in view during video calls or while watching recipes and tutorials. This hands-free feature is fantastic for multitasking—whether I’m cooking, working out, or just moving around the room, the Echo Show 10 stays with me, ensuring I never miss a beat.

1. Smart Movement:

The Echo Show 10’s ability to automatically pivot and track me during video calls or while I’m interacting with it is a game-changer. No more awkward adjustments or missed moments—this device ensures I stay in the frame and can see the screen clearly, regardless of where I move.

2. Crystal-Clear Display:

The HD display is vibrant and sharp, making it perfect for watching videos, browsing photos, or following along with recipes. The 10.1-inch screen size is just right—not too big and not too small—offering an excellent viewing experience without dominating my countertop or desk space.

3. Premium Sound Quality:

The sound quality is top-notch, with rich, clear audio that fills the room. Whether I'm listening to music, catching up on the news, or watching a movie, the Echo Show 10 delivers an immersive audio experience. The built-in speakers are powerful and provide crisp sound, enhancing the overall convenience of the device.

4. Voice-Controlled Smart Home Hub:

Integrated with Alexa, the Echo Show 10 acts as a central hub for my smart home devices. I can control lights, thermostats, and other smart gadgets with simple voice commands. The convenience of managing my smart home from a single device, especially with voice commands, simplifies my daily routines.

5. Video Calling Made Easy:

The Echo Show 10 simplifies video calls with its high-definition camera and auto-framing feature. It’s easy to connect with family and friends, and the camera ensures that everyone in the room is visible and in focus. Plus, the privacy shutter provides peace of mind when not in use.

6. Interactive Features:

The touch screen interface is intuitive and responsive, making it easy to interact with apps, view photos, or check the weather. The device integrates seamlessly with various services, including Amazon services and third-party apps, enhancing its versatility.

7. Home Automation Integration:

The Echo Show 10 works well with other smart home devices, allowing me to automate tasks and create routines. Setting up routines for daily tasks like turning on the lights or adjusting the thermostat is straightforward, making home management more efficient.

Cons:

While the Echo Show 10 excels in convenience, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider:

1. Size and Placement:

The device is relatively large and requires a bit of space. Its size might be a consideration if you have a smaller kitchen or desk area.

2. Price Point:

It is on the higher end of the price spectrum for smart displays. While the features justify the cost, it may not be the most budget-friendly option for everyone.

3. Motion Tracking Sensitivity:

While the motion tracking is a fantastic feature, it can sometimes be overly sensitive. In certain lighting conditions or with rapid movements, the device may have difficulty keeping up.

Final Thoughts:

The Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is a highly convenient and feature-rich smart display. Its ability to move and track users, combined with excellent sound quality and a sharp HD display, makes it a valuable addition to any smart home. Despite a few minor considerations regarding size and price, the Echo Show 10’s functionality and ease of use make it a worthwhile investment for those looking to enhance their smart home experience.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Because the price had increased to $250, the device was actually more expensive to purchase the 2nd time even with the discount. I would not pay more for a 2nd device that originally broke on its own.

Even if I considered buying this again, I have no confidence that the device will not break again.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2024","Firstly, the Echo is an ad machine mostly for Amazon products. You cannot turn off ads. If you like a large clock display don't expect it to stay large on your screen all the time because during the all day everyday ads showing the clock display is reduced significantly. Watching movies is another thing you won't do much of unless it's from Prime. Music is a no go unless you pay for a service. Amazon is a pay for everything. I mean, remember 1 day shipping? Yea, you pay more now and there's no guarantee if it will arrive in one day or 10. Video calls are a nuisance due to freezing video/audio issues. The biggest thing is Amazon doesn't listen to customer complaints about the Echo Show products. The lack of improvement or features since 2020 is proof of that.",1.0 out of 5 stars

BornForTech,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2022","So let's look at the model Echo Show 10 itself. Thought it was going to be something like putting a tablet on top of an Apple Home Pod (first gen). Well....it's not. Keep forgetting the Echo Show devices are not tablet user interface devices and the sound quality is not even close to the Home Pod, so just a tad disappointed with that. That said, I do really like the device. I don't have a problem with the Echo UI, in fact i kinda like it better than a tablet. The sound isn't bad, it just isn't what I was hoping for after looking at the design and certainly the price point. The screen and camera quality are really quite good, although when I watch the home screen transition from one picture to another the transition is not super smooth, like maybe the processor is a little under-powered. Not sure about that one tho. The motion feature is nice that it moves to ""look at"" whoever in the room is talking to it (nice feature), the problem is you can turn the motion off, close the camera and still it's gonna move to what ever section of the house has the brightest light. That is so annoying. I might want it to stay looking ""at me"" and not move around so I ask it to play something, turn any motion option OFF and it will eventually move anyway. Drives me up the wall. I think that could probably be addressed in a software OS fix, hopefully soon. Also, when you talk to it, it will move around a lot like it's trying to figure out where you are exaclty. All in all, it isn't a bad device for the living room, picture, sound, camera all nice, just needs the motion adjusted to ""don't move"" means ""don't move"" and they could probably upgrade the processor or maybe adjust the OS a little. If you need an Echo Show and you are only going to purchase one AND don't need it to function as a hub, I'd go with the Echo Show 8 (2021). Otherwise, wait for some changes to this model. Gave it 4 stars for all nice features, but minus one big star for the motion. Does play live video feeds like ABC News really well, that's a plus...and my favorite Sci-Fi (Expanse) looks amazing on it too. If they fix any issues I'll update this review. Hope it helps.
Review Update 9/3/2022: So I moved the Echo 10 into a different room where the lighting was more even and that stopped most of the moving around problems. Then one day it seemed to want to move again and when I was finished a screen popped up that asked if I wanted to change the direction limits. I said yes and it had a great feature I wasn't aware of that let me set the boundaries to the smallest movement possible. With those two changes I have updated my 4 stars to 5. Problems solved and now I don't have to constantly look at the back of the screen. Very happy, really like this product. Thinking about buying another one to replace an Echo 5. The 5 is amazing, but I've gotten to the point where I just want the biggest screen possible, thus the only reason to replace the 5. Good luck, hope this info helps!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Vlad,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021","I was enthusiastic when I ordered my Echo Show 3rd Gen. It was supposed to be a robot but not quite. Awesome speakers, great camera, rotating screen?! I got it out of the box, set it up and although I was a bit thrown off by the white cord sticking out of the black unit like a sore thumb, I really didn’t have major issues. The problem was that after using it for a bit longer bugs started to pop out.
Bugs observed:
- Screen rotates past you.
- Barely touching the screen for an action result in a path is blocked message.
- Can’t rotate at night because if an area is lit dimly will result in motion stopping and an error message
- Some error messages disappear pretty quickly
- During a video call the zooming, orienting of the lenses is not quite right
- Sometimes it won’t respond to the wake up word.
Hardware wise though, this one is better in every regard than its predecessor, which I considered a 5 star product, so the potential is there. So, while I think they would have benefited from a bit more of development time, I think the potential is there. Hopefully, they can do a firmware update to correct the issues. At this point I am not returning it, but if you haven’t bought it, I would wait for a few updates.
UPDATE JAN2022 (Raised one star):
Some of the most annoying bugs have been fixed but not all of them have. However, the improvements are significant enough that I would consider purchasing another one if on sale. If not,the current Gen Show 8 is really good too.
UPDATE JUL2022 (Raised another star)
This is what I expected when I ordered this device. Haven’t had a bug in a while. Screen rotation is significantly better, stopping at the correct spots and following better. Additionally, a friend that ordered a current gen black Echo Show 8, received a black power cord with it; it appears that Amazon is moving in the right direction with the power cords. Given that those were my main issues with the device, I raised it a star.",5.0 out of 5 stars

tobor,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2023","I've got 9 Echo devices in my home. I've been using Echos (and upgrading to the latest models) since they were first made available. This Echo Show 10 replaced an Echo Show 8 (1st Generation) in my kitchen. I use it multiple times each day to play Spotify, listen to radio (via TuneIn), set timers, etc. The sound quality is very good and I place it only slightly behind my Echo Studio + Echo Sub pair as it pertains to sound quality.

The screen is, likewise, excellent. I have my Show 10 set to rotate a series of fine art prints I've uploaded to Amazon Photos and the colors really pop and look gorgeous on the screen. I find this feature really enhances the ambiance in my kitchen and every time I glance at the screen and see a piece of art I'm glad I purchased the device. I like the screen being larger than the Show 8, although I don't think I'd recommend an expensive ""upgrade"" merely for the screen size.

I have read that many people dislike the number of ads or stories that the Show 10 displays. You can go into settings and select the content you want to see. I've reduced it to only weather and news--everything else is turned off. I almost never see ads and feel that this type of criticism is unwarranted. My Show 10 (like my Show 8) displays content I've allowed and almost nothing more.

The Echo Show 10 loses a star for voice responsiveness. I have it placed in a corner that is pretty wide and open--it's not obstructed in any way. Unfortunately, about 30% of the time the device doesn't ""hear"" a command when I'm standing 4 feet away. Instead, my Echo Studio--which is in an entirely different room--responds. Sometimes it is even worse with an Echo in my bedroom (which is multiple rooms away) responding to my attempt to set a timer whilst in the kitchen. I find it very odd and frustrating. My first generation Echo (the original) did a far better job in this area than the Echo Show 10. And as far as I can tell there is no way to set the mic sensitivity via the Alexa app. That said, the positives still outweigh this negative, but I'm dropping 1 star from my rating.

I'd also add that the ""follow"" feature in which the device's screen moves to face you is not very compelling for me. I can envision other people finding it useful, but for me it seems more like a gimmick. The device is generally reliable following me, but whenever it reaches the edge of the boundary I set it flashes a giant warning message that I'm out of range. That large pop-up is really annoying and there is no way to turn it off. If it didn't flash that warning literally EVERY time I work in the kitchen I might be able to overlook it--as it is, it's just a reminder that Amazon has failed to improve the device. There should be a way to turn off that notification.

The Echo Show 10 is a decent device, but I'm not so sure of the value proposition. Adding a motor to turn the screen increases complexity and cost yet the benefits of this design are not compelling. And because this is the only device in the Echo lineup to employ this feature, Amazon hasn't really prioritized improving Echo Show 10 functionality. I don't know what is going on with the mic sensitivity, but it's not as good as it should be. The sound quality, however, is solid, and the screen is decent and a great size.",4.0 out of 5 stars
C,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021","The new Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is a big improvement over the previous 2nd Gen version. The Show 10 is now attached to a swivel base that lets the Show 10 constantly rotate to face you as you move around the room. Other changes include: a new speaker configuration, MUCH better camera, better processor, and Amazon Sidewalk support. Here are my thoughts so far:

THE GOOD:

-SETUP – Setup was super easy. The Show came configured to my account, I didn't have to log in or even enter wifi passwords. It connected, downloaded some updates, and then walked me through customizing the range of motion.
-MOTION- This is the most obvious new improvement. The Show 10 will now track your movement and turn to face you as you move around the room. The Show seems to have very good facial tracking, and it will rotate on its horizontal axis to follow you (you can also manually tilt the screen up and down to your desired vertical position.) We tested this while playing movies and while viewing our remote cameras, and it worked perfectly. We also tested with multiple people in the room; and the Show seems to lock onto one face and moves to follow that face, until it can't see that face anymore and will move to another face. Or if someone uses the Wake Word “Alexa,” it will turn toward where that voice was coming from. This also works for video calls, though we noticed that on video calls the Show will rotate to try to keep ALL of our faces in view. Sometimes this might mean it faces in between two people so that the camera can see both of us, and then automatically zooms the camera in or out to adjust. Which brings me to the next big improvement:
-13MP CAMERA – We were very impressed with the quality of the new camera, and with the tracking technology it uses. Not only are images crisp and detailed on video calls, but the camera will actually automatically zoom in and out to adjust to the people in the shot. For example I can back up from my kitchen into the living room, and the camera will zoom in and follow me. When you combine this with the movement and facial tracking, it is almost like having your own camera man follow you around the room on your call. The family members we called said they could see so much more detail. There is also now a physical shutter that you can close to cover the camera if you want to.
-SPEAKERS – The old 2nd Gen Show 10 had dual 2” neodymium drivers, but this new 3rd Gen Show 10 has two 1” tweeters and a 3” woofer. I can definitely tell the difference, although I really don't use the Show for listening to music very often. In testing out a few songs, I noticed that the new 3rd Gen seems louder at max volume, and less muffled. Definitely an improvement, though maybe not quite on the level of the Echo Studio.
-PROCESSOR – The new Show 10 has both an upgraded main processor, and also a second Amazon AZ1 processor. This should result in slightly faster repose times, and better future performance; although I really haven't been able to tell much of a difference so far. AZ1 is supposed to be faster and more efficient, and allow voice commands to be processed locally instead of having to go to the cloud; so we'll see if this is noticeable in the future.
-ZIGBEE/SIDEWALK – The previous version included a Zigbee hub, but this version also includes Amazon Sidewalk compatibility. Sidewalk is a long range connection technology that Amazon plans to use for devices that will be able to reach much further; (the initial announcement estimated up to half a mile). This technology isn't really being used yet, but it is nice to know this future tech is built in.

THE BAD:

-WHITE POWER CORD – Yes, for some reason that same white power cord that ships with the Echo 4th Gen is also included for this Show 10. No matter what color Show you get (I got black), you still get a white power cord. I'm a little surprised that they went with this decision again, but it really doesn't bother me much at all. Just thought I'd mention it in case that matters to you.
-LARGE FOOTPRINT – Since the device rotates, you really have to be careful about where you put it. The Show 10 comes with a footprint guide, that suggests that you make sure you have enough space around the device to avoid the screen knocking over a glass of water, for example. This also wasn't a big deal for me, but keep in mind you will probably need more space than the previous version. The specs recommend a 10” by 15” space, but I think you could get away with less.

*Note – You can disable the movement by saying “Alexa disable Motion,” or by turning it off in the Alexa app on your phone. Also, when you first setup your Show, there is a slider bar that let's you choose how far the screen should rotate in each direction. It seems to go almost 360 degrees maximum, but you can limit the radius so it turns much less. You can also change this in the 'Motion' menu under Settings.

Overall, I am VERY pleased with this new Show 10. The camera clarity is great, and the face tracking technology is so impressive; there's just nothing else like it for video calls to our family. This is a huge upgrade!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Vincent,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","I have owned the last two Generation Echo Shows. The Echo Show 1 & Echo Show Gen 2. The Echo Show 10 solves all the issues that the first two devices had, and adds even more features jam packed into one great device.

Now before I get into the meat and potatoes — let me tell you about the truly magical experience I have had with this device. It arrived in a box almost double the size of the previous model — and this device is BIG! The screen is huge! The speaker is also apparently much more powerful than the last generation — and I can tell, that is most definitely the case.

But the true magic comes when you power on and set up the Echo. The Amazon team really did wonders creating this device. Both the camera and the AI in this thing are crazy good. Assuming you have motion enabled, as soon as you say the wake word, i.e., “Alexa” the device honed in on my direction, rotated towards me, and began listening.

If you walk around the room, this device follows you. You can’t understand how cool this is until you try it out. I would upload a video, but I’m sure you can look it up on YouTube, and there will likely be hundreds of reviews showcasing it here.

There’s something about the tracking technology that Amazon has gotten just right. I called up my Grandma who has my old first gen echo show, and she didn’t even realize we were conversing as I was walking around my room. She thought I was just stationary the whole time. When I pointed it out and showed to her, her jaw dropped.

The way the camera zooms in on you, and the range of video it can show is phenomenal. I can jump onto my bed (my echo is on my nightstand) and the echo will zoom in and focus on me. When I go off the side of my bed, it follows zooming out, and can follow my body all the way as I walk back across the room towards the device.

It all feels so natural. The only thing that is missing would be if the Echo device itself moved! You can now have a conversation with someone when moving around your environment, without having to remain stationary.

In a kitchen, a home gym, or anywhere you’d want to talk with someone actively, this device would be really extraordinary to play with, especially during covid times.

I use my device in my room as an Alarm clock — so previously, my camera would be staring across the room as to not let me look at the screen if needed (for time/alarms, etc). Now, with the camera cover, I feel much more comfortable covering the camera and rotating the device to look towards me at night.

Now, take these into consideration as you decide if you want to purchase:

First, if you want to get the latest and greatest Echo device, the purchase is a no brainer. I am an Amazon loyalist, and can say that even from first impressions, this device blows all other Amazon devices I’ve owned away.

Second, if you’re a user who doesn’t mind the camera being uncovered, then you’ll have no problem with this device. You’ll love it. The motion features will be left on 16/7 for me. I wouldn’t be comfortable allowing having the camera on while I’m sleeping (and staring at me), but for a public area in your home — who cares? I wouldn’t mind, I’d leave it on all day — it following you around is magical.

Third, if you fall into the second issue above, you CAN use the camera cover to disable motion. If you don’t mind sliding the cover open and closed every morning/night, this could work for a nightstand alarm clock, and the hassle/inconvenience would be worth it.

Pros:
- Motion is magical
- Camera is high definition
- Sound is great. Music sounds lively. Lyrics on screen that follow you around the room
- Adaptive screen dimming still works even when camera/motion is blocked/disabled
- You can manually rotate the device when motion is off i.e. I’m going to bed, to point it towards me. I don’t know if that’s safe for the motor — I’ll ask Amazon!

Cons:
- If your room doesn’t have a full range of motion, the Echo might get confused when following you around. Since it is on my nightstand, the echo really only needs to turn about 90° to see in front if itself, and when I go to the left of my room. If I go to exit my room, it might start losing tracking, which could probably fixed in a future OS update (to halt moving at a specific point, which it already does).

Bottom Line: I 100% recommend this as an upgrade to an old device or a new device for any potential Echo owners. If you don’t feel comfortable with the motion controls, turn them off, but you won’t get the full package and what I think is the biggest selling point of this device. Put this in a public room and try it out — you won’t regret it.

EDIT: After seeing more reviews a few points to mention:

1. White power cord. Who cares? You dock a star for this? Don’t listen to normies giving poor reviews who think the color of a power cord which is draped out of sight will have any effect on how the device improves over it’s predecessor
2. Complaints over resolution: if you’re not buying this thing to watch full-fledged movies on, it’s fine. You won’t notice.
3. Complaints over tracking: it won’t track you with the camera in the dark. A future models can probably have an infrared light added (similar to FaceID) to fix that problem.
4. I saw someone complaining about Airplay and multiroom audio. Echo devices support multiroom audio through Amazon’s Ecosystem — not bluetooth. It has never supported that. Why would you expect this to change without notice?

Don’t listen to the haters. People reviewing are acting as if this device isn’t 5x better than the last generation of the Show. Motion is a stellar addition that would bring moving smart devices into the mainstream. No one here knows what a
the Facebook Portal is, because there was never a solid backing behind the product line. Echos are in homes across America, and I’m sure that this will lead to better smart devices from Amazon in the future.

For reference, I have owned an: Echo Show 1, Echo Show 2, Echo Dot, and have coded ~5 Alexa Skills. I know these devices. This gen is great. Give it 1 month and these will be 5/5. These reviews all read so fake. Who purchases a device and returns it same-day due to a different colored power cord? Who returns a device that doesn’t do something they expected when it was never said the device did it?

Low-information consumers and people with too high expectations... there’s a reason why it’s called PRE-ORDERING, because you KNOW you are going to like it and/or take what you get. No one forced you to buy a day 1 device.

TL;DR: Don’t listen to bad reviews. Buy this if you’re in the market.",5.0 out of 5 stars
RhonRee,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2024","I love the echoshow10. The screen is the perfect size. And the sound is very clear when Alexa speaks…. and my music sounds great.
I love the feature to look up recipes. And Alexa helps me find everything I need.
It also suggests current news clips on the screen and I can watch short clips of current news if I choose.
The tilt screen is way too place where I can see. I love the follow me feature.
I don’t know how I lived without this. I use it A LOT.

kenya Garcia,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2024","I recently started using the Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen). Here’s a review focusing on its convenience:
Convenience:

The Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is an incredibly convenient addition to my home. The standout feature is its ability to move and follow me around the room. The smart display’s motorized base means it rotates to keep me in view during video calls or while watching recipes and tutorials. This hands-free feature is fantastic for multitasking—whether I’m cooking, working out, or just moving around the room, the Echo Show 10 stays with me, ensuring I never miss a beat.

1. Smart Movement:

The Echo Show 10’s ability to automatically pivot and track me during video calls or while I’m interacting with it is a game-changer. No more awkward adjustments or missed moments—this device ensures I stay in the frame and can see the screen clearly, regardless of where I move.

2. Crystal-Clear Display:

The HD display is vibrant and sharp, making it perfect for watching videos, browsing photos, or following along with recipes. The 10.1-inch screen size is just right—not too big and not too small—offering an excellent viewing experience without dominating my countertop or desk space.

3. Premium Sound Quality:

The sound quality is top-notch, with rich, clear audio that fills the room. Whether I'm listening to music, catching up on the news, or watching a movie, the Echo Show 10 delivers an immersive audio experience. The built-in speakers are powerful and provide crisp sound, enhancing the overall convenience of the device.

4. Voice-Controlled Smart Home Hub:

Integrated with Alexa, the Echo Show 10 acts as a central hub for my smart home devices. I can control lights, thermostats, and other smart gadgets with simple voice commands. The convenience of managing my smart home from a single device, especially with voice commands, simplifies my daily routines.

5. Video Calling Made Easy:

The Echo Show 10 simplifies video calls with its high-definition camera and auto-framing feature. It’s easy to connect with family and friends, and the camera ensures that everyone in the room is visible and in focus. Plus, the privacy shutter provides peace of mind when not in use.

6. Interactive Features:

The touch screen interface is intuitive and responsive, making it easy to interact with apps, view photos, or check the weather. The device integrates seamlessly with various services, including Amazon services and third-party apps, enhancing its versatility.

7. Home Automation Integration:

The Echo Show 10 works well with other smart home devices, allowing me to automate tasks and create routines. Setting up routines for daily tasks like turning on the lights or adjusting the thermostat is straightforward, making home management more efficient.

Cons:

While the Echo Show 10 excels in convenience, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider:

1. Size and Placement:

The device is relatively large and requires a bit of space. Its size might be a consideration if you have a smaller kitchen or desk area.

2. Price Point:

It is on the higher end of the price spectrum for smart displays. While the features justify the cost, it may not be the most budget-friendly option for everyone.

3. Motion Tracking Sensitivity:

While the motion tracking is a fantastic feature, it can sometimes be overly sensitive. In certain lighting conditions or with rapid movements, the device may have difficulty keeping up.

Final Thoughts:

The Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is a highly convenient and feature-rich smart display. Its ability to move and track users, combined with excellent sound quality and a sharp HD display, makes it a valuable addition to any smart home. Despite a few minor considerations regarding size and price, the Echo Show 10’s functionality and ease of use make it a worthwhile investment for those looking to enhance their smart home experience.",5.0 out of 5 stars
A. Pena,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2021","Full disclosure, I receive gift cards from my place of work from time to time and I used some of that money to pay for half of this unit, though it is not related to Amazon of course so this review is fully of my own opinions.

I own a few of the Amazon Echo show units dating back to the original Gen 1 Echo Show (7 inch). I currently still own that unit and had a place in my kitchen for several years. My wife now working from home needed an Echo in her upstairs office (where it was becoming troublesome to reach her from the other end of the house) so instead of purchasing an all new one, we decided based on her casual usage that we would replace the Gen 1 Echo Show with the latest generation for the kitchen. At the time, I wasnt aware of the new Echo Show 10, but was intrigued to find out there was a new version with a motorized screen display. I am somewhat of an early adopter, but my profession is in computer/electrical engineering and wanted to see if this was worth the substantial increase in costs. The gift card funds just help take that sting out of the purchase that made the decision easier over the costs of the non motorized Show product line.

Unboxing:
Unboxing was straight forward if you are familiar with the Show lineup and not much to say other than that reviews had led me to believe the unit was big, but I was not surprised by what I found. Essentially a large speaker base with what appears to be a tablet stuck to it, not that surprising and what anyone would expect. The cable like many others have mentioned on the charcoal colored unit is a bit annoying that it is white, but not the end of the world. Just would have appreciated more attention to this detail. Packaging looked well capable of protecting the unit as it was a box within a box, within another Amazon box, but this is where I have a small gripe. Did we need 3 boxes for this, Amazon, please work on the overuse of packaging for wastage.

Setup:
Setup was pretty standard if you have ever performed an Echo setup, but a bit elongated to perform the turning radius setup limits which is handy if your Show will have objects nearby or walls to contend with. I have none in this case as it is going at the end of the counter bar that divides the Den area with the Kitchen area. It can turn 360 degrees freely and this was easy to see how to limit or run unhindered. The rest of the setup was just confirming the Amazon account, wireless connection, and home screen details. All within about 3 minutes or less.

First impressions:
My first impressions were the unit is very sleek looking and the weight seemed adequate for the unit to be stable on the bench. The screen was perfectly bright and just the right size to view from a reasonable distance. The speed of the rotation as some have mentioned being too slow I found just fine as I want it to be quiet (which it is in motion - perfectly silent) and yet not aggressive in the movements as to call too much attention to the unit. My family thought it was pretty interesting how it can follow if you interact with it, but normally it stay put unless you ask it a question. In locating the person to point at with the voice trigger, I actually found the unit a little less sensitive to the wake command than any of my other generation units including the latest 8 inch and 5 inch Show units (I own 4 x 8 inch units and 4 x 5 inch units, along with 3 echo dots). In fact I have an upstairs Echo Show 8 (open ceiling through the Den into the movie theater room, that many times ""bongs"" to the wake command sooner than the kitchen one will standing within a few feet of this new unit. This isnt a huge issue once you get used to it, but I hope Amazon tweaks the sensitivity of the wake command to be more in line with other models in the lineup. One of the reason I got this new unit was my impressively fast results with the other latest generation Echo Show 8 units being so fast to work a command over the 1st generation.

After a few weeks of usage:
I have found that the unit motorized feature is a little bit of a novelty, but in daily use it has been a welcome change. For the price difference, I am right on the fence of whether I would pay the difference knowing what I know now and I know that may not help anyone reading this, but it is really right there with I would or wouldnt pay the extra. As the price knowingly will come down over time, this should become easier to make a decision.

Sound Quality:
Sound quality is above par for my expectations, as it is more clear than the preceding model. It has more depth to me and sound dispersion to 360 degrees is far better than the rear/side facing speakers of the past. Potentially largely due to the screen being out of the way which is a bit expected. Louder volumes were reached without distortion compared to previous units and the highs were clear and pronounced without overdoing it. Happy with this as an area speaker, but this wont replace your bookshelf stereo for instance. It can be paired with other devices so you can expand this if necessary.

Motion tracking:
As mentioned from others, this is a bit laggy, but in the ""works well enough"" category. It is not quick to jump around, but can trail someone easily walking around. What I found is that it rarely loses focus of the individual completely even though it will trail the motion. And if the user is continuing to speak, it almost never loses track of the user in my testing. Of note, it of course does not track up and down as the motorized function is swivel only, but the wide angle of the lens makes this mostly unnecessary.

Final verdict:
Would I get this again? In this same scenario, definitely, no regrets. Had I needed to pay the entire amount? At $250 at the time of writing while the 8 inch is $109, this is a hard justification, but when we remember that a year ago the previous 10 inch model was selling for $229, it gets a lot easier to see that the extra $20 delivers quite a bit. Better sound, motorized swivel, a better screen, and a much better tilt/angle/level than the previous unit had out of the box. I think this is a win, if it isnt a solid win over the previous generation. I hope that the mic sensitivity gets better with updates, but I dont have many complaints over what is delivered today from this model.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Char, The (Mostly) Happy Shopper","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2023","Here I am again with yet another echo review. Anyone who follows my reviews knows I have quite a few of these things. I'm always buying a new one and then doing the echo shuffle, placing them in different rooms with every upgrade. I have the echo dot 2nd gen (well, had....we'll get to that in a bit), an echo dot 4th generation, three echo show 5's, an echo show 8 and now, with my latest purchase, an echo show 10. I have them all over our house. I've been watching the 10 and 15 for a while now. Then, one day, I got a notification that the 10 had a deal. I took it and noticed they'd give me more off in I traded in one of my other devices. Out went the 2nd gen because I knew, with the upgrade and shuffling, I wouldn't use it anymore. The sadness washed over me. It was our first echo relationship. So many memories. The good times, the bad times. I will look back at them fondly. I took some time to say goodbye before packaging it up and taking it to the UPS drop-off. They say getting over your first is hard, and they are right, but it was time to move on.....

I purchased the 10 and it arrived the next day. Set up, as always, was a breeze. Took less than 5 minutes thanks to the preset up email. The 10 is about the right size for our kitchen (where it replaced the 8, which got moved elsewhere, hence the shuffle) and I love having the bigger screen to watch the news while I get ready for work in the morning. The sound and picture quality are pretty great. I did get a little stand for it so it sits a bit taller, but other than that, it's just about perfect. Just about you say? Yea, just about. My issue is with the one feature that the others I own don't have. Motion detection. I hate it. Why? Well, first, I don't ever use my echos for phone calls. I know some people do and that's cool. Just not my thing. Second, I placed my echo in a corner. It can't swivel without hitting a wall. So, I turned that feature off. Simple enough. Or so I thought. It did an update recently and I walked into my kitchen, only to find it stuck against the wall. It had reset itself. Bad Alexa, bad. I turned the feature off again. It started to move once more, telling me it was stuck. I gave it a good amount of side eye and double checked the settings. It showed that it was turned off. Hmmm. I did what our IT department always says to do when faced with a tech crisis. I turned it off and back on again. I also closed the camera lens, something I had forgotten to do with this one. It hasn't tried moving since. Let's hope it stays that way.

Since it does come with motion detection, one nice thing about it (yes, there is something positive about it I guess) is that even when disabled, the screen can be swiveled. Now, I do like that. I have had to adjust the screen a little depending on where I am in the room or because of the glare of the lights and it's nice to not have to move the whole device. I do sometimes wish you could lock it into place though. No swiveling at all. If there is such a feature (outside of the motion detection disable), I haven't found it yet.

Aside from that, just as with my other echos, I really like it. It's great for checking our blink cameras, watching news or tv, playing music throughout the house, controlling our lights, creating shopping lists, reminders and the like, or just being entertained by asking silly questions. Me and Alexa can have hours of fun with the last one. She's a crazy gal. There are so many things you can do that I doubt I will stop with the 10. As a matter of fact, I know I won't. As Amazon keeps making them, I will probably keep buying them, eventually having one in every single room in our house. I'm honestly pretty close. What will I do then, you ask? Well, we do have a garage and I have a workout shed, so we shall see.....",4.0 out of 5 stars

I have it connected to my ring cameras and it alerts if someone's at my door. I also connected my Spotify to it and I can play music on all three of my echo shows at the same time, in multiple rooms.

Also I would heavily like to include that Alexa routines are very lacking and custom routine sucked and I hated that alexa wanted to speak everytime you issued a custom routine I could get her to stop talking no matter what I tried also routines should have if then, elseif then, else then, and the ability to cancel another routine.

J,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023","We're approaching the two year mark with the Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) in our kitchen and as such it has been used heavily. We've tinkered around with just about every bell and whistle that is available on it. Ultimately, we've decided that it is just a poor design across the board and consequently a frustrating user experience.

Honestly, most of these ""bells and whistles"" really aren't something anyone would make use of other than to ""try them out"" once as we've done. The news and sports widgets may interest you, but I feel like we are drowning in those two types of widgets on every screen we encounter these days; phone, watch, PC, work laptop, home laptop, tablet, TV. I feel like I have enough news, weather, and sports widgets to last me a lifetime at this point.

We ended up disabling everything except the rotating photos, so it's nothing more than a glorified digital photo frame for us. It's decent for that, but frankly the majority of digital photo frames out there will do a better job. Just stick an Echo Dot next nearby for Alexa...

As far as the lackluster photo experience, for example, you can't make it default to photo frame mode, or even force it to stay in that mode for an extend period of time. It always ends up back at the home screen after awhile. So, if you set it up to do so, you end up with rotating Amazon Photos photos on the ""home screen"" which you get forced to. The home screen photos are decent but, just like everything else in the Echo Show, still feels buggy and clunky. When you set a 10 second or 30 second photo rotation (or whatever) it definitely doesn't follow that setting. Sometimes it will hang on a photo for several minutes, other times it will rotate in 10 seconds. It feels like that setting is for Photo Frame mode, which (as mentioned) is essentially a useless feature, since it does not stay persistent.

Another drawback while being forced into the home screen for making it a digital photo frame is the clock/date are in the bottom left hand corner, and they are absolutely massive. They cannot be adjusted or disabled, as most everything else on the device... very little customization options. We have like 700 clocks in our kitchen, and would totally be fine with disabling the Echo Show clock... Often it will rotate to a photo and then the focal point of the photo ends up blocked by the huge clock. This happens a lot to us because we end up taking family selfies, and (having the longest arms currently) I normally take them, so I end up in the upper right of the photo, with the wife more towards the left, and then the kids in the bottom left... so, the huge clock cuts the kids out of the picture and most of the time half of my wife gets cut. That clock really does wreck a ton of photos, family selfies or not. Long story short the photo experience is decent, but there are way better options/devices out there, especially since the other options will integrate with other services such as Apple or Google photos, but with the Echo Show you are forced into Amazon Photos which is severely lackluster compared to the ""other two""...

Aside from the photos I have no idea why anyone would like this device, let alone rate it 5 stars. The speaker looks like it should be awesome, but it's also lackluster. The hardware just kinda sucks... it is quite sluggish in terms of performance.

We do have Spotify integration set up and do also use that a bit just because my kids play music on alexa in general a lot... but, if you have read this far, then it's not going to be a shocker when you hear we feel the Echo Spotify app is a clunky, sluggish, and just overall lackluster experience when compared to the Apple, Android, PC, Mac, and Web Spotify apps.

It seems like it could be great for video calls. We did try that some when I was traveling for work and it's just too sluggish and clunky, we always ended up flipping over to our phones. Also forget the ""follow me"" screen rotation mode thing, it sounds cool, but works like garbage. Same with streaming videos in general, just doesn't work well, I'd rather just use a small phone.

All of that said, having a digital alexa photo frame is decent enough... These things aren't too pricey, especially when you catch them during Amazon's big sales...

But.... the two straws which broke the camel's back, and makes me want to go office space this thing, are:

a) Our family loves shopping on Amazon, we spend a disgusting amount on Amazon every year, so take this point for what it is... but in pure slime ball fashion Amazon forces advertisements on the screen which pop up periodically trying to get you to buy random stuff. Sometimes, this stuff may not even be something you'd like advertised to your kids or guests. There is absolutely no way to disable these ads. So they charge you 100 to 300 bucks for something like this, and force their ads on to you. That in and of itself should be a hard stop for anyone considering one of these.

b) I'm not sure how this next point is working behind the scenes over there at Amazon, but it appears that any new or updated feature forces itself to be turned on (even after previously disabling it). This is a regular occurance. Like I said we've literally disabled everything, but things just pop up out of nowhere, or are periodically turned back on, such as news, sports, joke of the day, etc etc. And nope, it's not my kids messing with it, they can't even reach it.

TTLD;, the Echo Show 10 kinda sucks, part due to hardware issues, but bigger part due to software issues, which leads me to believe whatever version comes next will also suck. That said, 45,458 reviews as of this post, and 4.5 stars... so the masses appear to love this big weird clunky rotating wonky crappy weak sauce robot tablet... :D",1.0 out of 5 stars

PMR,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2023","I bought this mainly to use it as a video call unit (I intend to buy a second one soon, which will be installed at a relative's house). My second use is watching the house when I'm away (via the app on my cell) and seeing a couple of cameras I have installed.

That said, here are my PROS and CONS.

PROS:
- Nice screen of a good format and size. The resolution is really good, too.
- Good sound, equivalent to (if not better than) what my Echo 3rd gen produces.
- Should make a nice video call set (more on that when I install the second unit; I will get back here to update my review).
- The screen follows you (most of the time)!

CONS:
- The screen is way too reflective. That makes it hard to read if there's a window behind you.
- A white power cord for a black unit, really, Amazon?! OK, I understand it saves YOU some bucks, but it's an eyesore at my all-black countertop. A black unit should come with a black cord, period. Good thing I had an Echo 3rd gen. with a black cord I could use (my Echo can keep the white cord since it falls hidden behind a piece of furniture).
- While I'm at that... the power cord has a different adaptor than the Echo Dots. So you can only replace the eyesore white cord like I did if you have an Echo (not the dot, but the taller one, which also uses a different adaptor -- come on, Amazon, standardize that stuff!)
- Somewhat harder to hear you... and I can attest to that since I have five other Echo Dots 3rd gen plus an Echo 3rd gen in the house. You call it, it doesn't hear you, and you need to repeat it louder. It's so annoying that sometimes a Dot in a far-away room will reply to your command instead of this unit, which is right on your face.
- Besides, you can say ""Alexa, do [whatever]"" to an echo dot, while you have to call ""Alexa"" (wait for it to find you) and then ""do [whatever]"" on this thing. Not as fast/responsive as the Echo Dots.
- No infrared vision, so don't expect it to be helpful as a night camera to watch your house.
- It does follow you, but sort of ""crooked."" Its camera is off-center, so it usually doesn't ""look at you"" directly but a little sideways. No, there's no way to fine-tune that either. And sometimes, for no good reason, you can walk in front of it, and it won't follow you... I haven't yet figured out why and when it does follow me, even after telling her to ""follow me"" and activating that mode.

Finally, let's be honest: I love what it does, and many years ago, I was impressed with what this technology promised. But almost a decade later, Alexa isn't becoming smarter. It recognizes my face and my voice. But if I tell her my birthday or some other fact about me, she's still incapable of memorizing it (yes, I can create a note, but that's not the same as this thing really KNOWING when my birthday -- or anyone's birthday -- is).

Today, it also should be smart enough to receive two or more commands at once, like ""turn off my office light, turn on my bedroom light, and play music.""

And even though I have a Fire TV at home, it took way too many commands and internet searches until I got this new unit to control it (it kept replying, ""your Fire TV can't do that"" to every command; I finally got it to work, but definitely not a user-friendly set up as I'd have expected).

So the promise of Artificial Intelligence is still in the air. This thing has good voice recognition, but its features and skills are still not worthy of being called ""intelligence.""",4.0 out of 5 stars

Jace,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2024","This is by far our family’s favorite Amazon product. We started with an echo dot (2nd gen) in 2017, then fire tv sticks, plug ins, fire tablets, echo auto and echo shows. We pretty much have an alexa/echo device in each rooms.
It was very easy to install especially if you already have an amazon account. Also, check out their trade-in program. Take advantage of upgrading your echo devices and experience how amazon develops their products and try their best to give customers great and reliable products.
Now, this Echo Show 10 does a lot of work in our home. I won’t discuss about any technical things about it since I do not speak that language. However I will review this from a Mom’s standpoint.
As a parent of curious kids, you’ll get hundreds of questions a day. Sometimes you’d know the answers and there are times you don’t. The device helps me with that. Sure the other echo dots can do it but having a screen that follows you is more fun and more informative for kids. It makes my kids interested in current events as it shows news articles and photos. It would give some facts and interesting topics for us to discuss further. Of course, my kids will do their own research and it keeps them more interested. From music, history, conversation, spelling, you name it, it would have the answers.
Next is the camera feature, any approved contacts can drop in on this device. It’s amazing since they could pretty much video call other relatives that have alexa app or devices. It makes us feel more connected with our loved ones that can’t operate phones to video call.
So aside from connecting us with humans, it connects us to other non humans; my vacuum cleaner, air purifier, lights, window blinds and so much more. It helps me multi task. As a mom, life gets busy and I forget a lot of things! I rely on this device to remind me about my schedule, chores, shopping lists, recipes, etc. I do have other ways to remind myself about things but it helps that there’s a device that will show me and tell me to do it. It makes me remember more when I see my list and this thing does it for me without all the paper clutter.
Then there’s more features to explore!
It helps me so I wish other moms would have something like this to will help them everyday.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Jason Gaines,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2021","UPDATE 4-17-21: Still working fine, no issues. Only thing I wish, is that I had just waited a month to purchase this as it went on sale super quick for $50 less. What’s the point of being an early adopter if it’s a negative?! I’d rather have just waited; next time I will. ;(

UPDATE 3-30-21: Our Video Apps Crashing issue came back, so I contacted Amazon again and they decided it would be best to replace the unit. A new one will be here in another day, so I can see if that one has any issues. I do like the Show 10, but I'm a little less smitten with it then I thought I would be. Again, the motion part is not as useful as one would like due to it's ability to actually track you properly without getting lost. I do really enjoy having a device to watch something in the kitchen while chilling out or cooking, and playing music on it is actually quite nice. Maybe it just needs to grow on me some more, and absolutely have the video apps stop crashing that is a definite.

So we’ve had this for a month now. It’s been fun to get to use it and see what it can do. That being said, it’s not as useful as I thought it would be. This is much less a tablet and more a media player. You can’t customize it like a Kindle or other tablets and put your own apps on it. It does play music really well and it does okay with smart home stuff. But that is an Alexa issue not Echo Show problem. I was hoping we had more customization with this but the OS is pretty closed loop.

Motion: Hit or Miss. it will follow you when you tell it to, but it will lose you easily, especially if you are too close to the unit or move to rapidly. There is a happy space of probably about 5ft to 8ft where it will follow you well. Too close and it will focus on something else, same thing for too far away. It loses you and once it does it forgets who it was following. Too many people around can confuse it as well. If it’s just you and your cleaning dishes or cooking, you should be okay.

Video: we had an issue with our unit crashing any video app such as Prime Video or Netflix after about 5-8mins of watching something. It would just go back to the home screen and forget what you were watching. If you started the app up again you had to start back from where you began as it would not save your progress. Calling support just recommended a factory reset which was going to be our next step anyways, and so far that has corrected the crashing.

Security: it’s easy enough to view the camera on the Show and move it left or right to see what’s around the area. Just remember you can’t move the screen up or down remotely, so if it tilted too far up it will limit your view. Otherwise it works well, and the screen notifies you when someone is remotely viewing on the screen.

Customization: Meh, it’s okay but will take some time getting used to the OS. It works like a tablet in the fact you tap or swipe to get to stuff, but again you can’t add any apps from an App Store. The OS is locked to what it is, and maybe that’s a good thing so it doesn’t get corrupted by junk we all like to add. Still, it limits the functionality and use of this device.

Overall: It’s a sound bar with a video display that can control smart home apps. The sound is really good, loud and crisp. Video is nice and smooth and if you have issues try a reset of the device. Not as full featured as a full on tablet, but pretty good over all. I gave it a four star rating. Really it’s a 4.5, but not a full 5 so I’m not picking that just because they don’t give us half ratings to use. It’s not cheap at $250 new right now, but it is worth the price if you want a good setup for say the kitchen or other room except for living room.",4.0 out of 5 stars

J. Fernandez,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","First the camera is offset, so the screen is always offset when it follow you, that is when it does actually follow you, because more than half of the time it does not, and God forbid you try to touch the monitor, because it will constantly tell you the screen has bumped into something... It has way too many bugs in the software ... I am not at all impressed with this update, because it doesn't seem like a lot of thought went into this model!

BUT ... My biggest gripe has to do with the electrical cord, it is way too short, and plugs into the bottom of the base, which is also insanely difficult to reach without the monitor swinging all around, and good forbid you have to unplug it for any reason, because it will constantly make you put in your password over and over!

I am sorry, but this update is a big fail! It is definitely not ready for consumers! They really should have worked out the bugs before releasing it to the public! This unit truly seems like it should be in beta testing still, because it has way too many issues that need to be addressed!

Update: The advertisement makes it look as if you can use the device to scan one’s surroundings, when not at home, but what only the small print reveals, which most people will miss, that it only does this FOR A PRICE AND with a SUBSCRIPTION to HOME GUARD plus!

At $250, this should have been included, at least for a year, free of charge! I bought this believing I could scan a room, from my mobile device, only to find out ... you can’t, NOT EVEN WHEN YOU ARE AT HOME! Really Amazon, you couldn’t include that at least for a year free! As a prime member, for many years, I find this totally unacceptable, from a billion dollar company, that is charging way too much for this device! Do yourself a favor and wait until Amazon addresses the many issues and bugs this device does have at the present time!

Xtra, And apparently there is no way to pair the Amazon Remote in the software! I have search high and low for a way to pair my remote, but the option is no longer in the settings on the device or app!

After several months of owning this device I can say with all honesty it is the WORST device and echo show I have EVER owned!, along with the new Echo, Amazon has me truly believing it is time to cancel all my Amazon accounts, because the majority of their devices don’t work like they claim! If I have to yell one more command to turn play a show on Hulu and Netflix only to told you cannot play HULU or NETFLIX on this device, I will start looking for devices that actually do …. Amazon really needs to get on the ball, because I am quickly losing faith in all their products and services!",1.0 out of 5 stars
JD,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2023","*Updated 11/23/23* - so it appears that Amazon reintroduced a toggle in the ""Home Screen"" section this month to turn off the highly annoying ""things Alexa can do"" or ""things to try"" interruptions and it seems to be working at this point. I increased my rating to 3 stars.

Original review
Echo Show 10 - in use for 3 months. I have 4 other echo audio-only devices and a variety of other smart home devices - nearly 50 in total. I added the Echo show as a central device in the kitchen/great room where I could monitor selected security cameras and use the numerous other features WHEN I ASK IT TO (see below).

The GOOD News - the Echo Show handles all of the Alexa capabilities and provides basic integration with my smart home environment. The 10"" screen is good quality and adds a number of useful video features like displaying recipes, streaming videos, video calls, video monitoring of security cameras, etc... The sound quality is good - perhaps a tick better than the audio-only Echo balls. Almost certainly you will find something useful in the broad array of capabilities. The feature for the display to ""follow you"" around the room is interesting, but after a while it started feeling creepy so I turned it off - but I can see where that would be useful to some depending on how you are using the device.

The BAD news -
(1) At times I want to use this device to monitor one of my security cameras without interruption - unless I specifically ask the Echo Show 10 to do something else. Although there are a bunch of ""home screen"" settings where you can select whether you want a rotation of content (pictures, recipe ideas, news, ""suggested"" movies, social media drivel, etc.) to appear on the Alexa screen while it is awaiting your next command - in my case I don't want ANY of these things to interrupt my camera feed, so I turned them ALL off. Despite doing so, the device regularly stops the camera feed to display a ""things to try"" or ""things Alexa can do"" screen. REALLY ANNOYING and per my conversation with Amazon yesterday (10/11/23) there is no way to prevent the device from doing that. I find myself having to re-start my camera feed all day long. If you are contemplating using the Echo Show 10 to monitor a baby-cam, security cam, or some other static content display (e.g. bedside clock), just be aware that Amazon have decided that having Alexa tell you what else you should try is always more important than whatever else you have the Echo 10 doing. (At one point, there was a toggle to turn ""things to try"" off, but it didn't really work and that toggle disappeared a few weeks ago)
2) The integration with non-Amazon-branded smart home devices is still pretty weak and while I eventually got everything to a basic level of integration - it was a pain and took far too much troubleshooting. I recognize that integration requires coordinated action by the smart home device vendors and Amazon, but it needs to be much clearer what ""Alexa Enabled"" means. Often the integration is the absolute barest minimum (e.g. voice control to turn something on/off) and nothing more. As an example, my fancy AI security camera can tell me what it is seeing (a person, a car, a herd of buffalo, etc..) - the Echo Show 10 advertises a ""person detection"" announcement feature, but inexplicably when a person IS detected by my AI camera, instead of showing me the camera, it shuts OFF the video feed to display a text message - ""Person detected in driveway cam"" - Huh? And the Echo can't announce the car or anything else that the camera sees. Amazon should be pushing themselves and their ""Alexa Enabled"" partners aggressively towards the new ""Matter"" home automation integration standards to make it far easier to setup and clearer what capabilities you are really getting than at present.

Good luck!",3.0 out of 5 stars

I have a variety of Echo devices throughout my home, and this was my favorite one, until a little after 2 years old it quit working. I have tried everything recommended in the forums and have asked for the assistance of Amazon (the rep was extremely rude, and absolutely no help.) It will not stay connected to my wifi. I have moved it around (it was already the closest device to the router), shut down most everything in the house, turned it on and off, reset my router, and a host of other things. It will connect, but within 5 minutes, it drops the connection. For the price, it should still be working. I looked at ordering another Echo, but this one has no trade-in value. If this is such a great device, why is it not even listed for trade-in. My guess, they are having a lot of trouble with them and don't want them back.

RBrylawski,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2024","We've had one of the early Echo Shows for a few years now and while it was fine, it was starting to show its age, so it got moved to a bedroom and after looking at all the new models I chose the newest Echo Show 10 (3rd generation). It's quite an upgrade in every way.

The screen is bigger and high definition at 10.1"" and it follows you around as you move around, which for a kitchen application is great. I can be using the Echo Show while I'm cooking and moving from counter to counter and the screen stays with me.

One of the biggest advantages of this new Echo Show is the speaker. It's really a big speaker and the moving screen is mounted to the speaker. But the output of the speaker is quite remarkable and music actually sounds terrific on it. The speakers deliver realistic sound which is directional.

Like most of the Echo Shows, once you've set up one through the Alexa app on your iPhone, setup is a breeze. In fact, when you order this 3rd gen Echo Show, you answer some questions about your network at home and out of the box it basically sets itself up. Though, I must admit the first one we received wouldn't connect and Amazon immediately sent a replacement device, which did work.

You can use this for video calls and it even has a 13PM digital camera which you can use to take a selfie. You can integrate as many photos as you want to the display from your cell phone or Amazon Photos collection if you use Amazon Photos to store your pictures (we do, actually). You can open the app and see what's happening in your kitchen or speak to someone in the kitchen from anywhere. If you have a Ring Doorbell, you can just say Alexa, show me my Ring Doorbell. Or ask Alexa to pull up a recipe quickly if you need one. It's all just so easy to use.

The options to integrate things like your car, security system, smart devices, are pretty much endless and super easy to set up as well.

All in all, I couldn't be happier with my decision to move up to the Echo Show 10!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Andrea D. Wilson,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2023","I recently purchased the Echo Show 10 HD smart display from Amazon, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed. The Echo Show 10 delivers an outstanding audio experience that truly stands out. The sound quality is simply amazing, providing a rich audio experience that elevates your entertainment.

The picture quality on this smart display is top-notch as well. The HD display offers crisp and vibrant visuals, making it a pleasure to watch your favorite movies and shows. Whether you're streaming content or catching up on the news, the Echo Show 10's screen display ensures a fantastic viewing experience.

One of the standout features of the Echo Show 10 is its dynamic motion functionality. The fact that the display moves to follow you as you move around is a game-changer, especially during Alexa calls. This means that the person you're talking to can continue to see you as you go about your daily tasks, whether you're cooking, cleaning, or simply multitasking. It adds a whole new level of convenience and connection to your video calls.

While the dynamic motion feature is impressive, it's not always flawless. There are times when the motion can be a bit off, which can be a minor inconvenience. However, I'm optimistic that with future updates and improvements, this feature will become even better over time.

The Echo Show 10 also offers premium sound quality, allowing you to enjoy your music and content with exceptional clarity and depth. The combination of stunning visuals audio creates an all-encompassing entertainment experience that's truly top tier.

In addition to its audio and visual capabilities, the Echo Show 10 provides a versatile platform for doing more. You can effortlessly watch your favorite movies and shows, stay updated with the latest news, and access a wide range of Alexa skills that enhance your daily life.

Overall, the Echo Show 10 HD smart display is an incredible addition to any smart home setup. It offers outstanding sound and picture quality, and its dynamic motion feature makes it a standout device for video calls. While there's room for improvement in the motion aspect, the overall experience is highly satisfying. This device's premium sound and its ability to do so much more make it a worthwhile asset for anyone looking to enhance their home entertainment. You will not be disappointed.",4.0 out of 5 stars
daveinlaca,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2021","The idea of the Echo Show 10 is such a game changer, I was ready to make it the hub of my music and entertainment center at home. Echo already controls my television remote, my lights, and my spotify. With the Show, I was expecting it to do the same with photos and other features.

Unfortunately, nearly every feature I was excited about underdelivered.

Photo Booth
I was most excited about the idea of telling my show ""Alexa, take a picture"", have it find me and my friends and snap a selfie. What a great addition to parties! And while the camera has improved, the lighting adaptation has not. Most of the photos came out extremely average if the lighting wasn't perfect. The kind of quality I would have expected to post on my MySpace in 2006.

The other great addition was the ability to tell my Show, ""Alexa, take a video"". It did a good job of finding me, but every video has to end with you saying ""Alexa, stop video."" I called customer service, certain that there must be a gesture I could assign, or perhaps a way to set a time and have Alexa take a 10 second video. But no, after exploring all options like ""routines"" and ""IFTT"" every video has to end with you telling Alexa to stop.

There's also no way to get the photos and videos straight to your phone, so you're stuck waiting for it to upload to Amazon Photos, then going into your phone, opening Amazon Photos, finding what you want, then downloading, then editing the end of that video so it doesn't end with your stop command. Clunky and unnecessary when there are so many easy ways they could have programmed all this to work better.

MUSIC
I was excited about the lyrics feature on Amazon Music. They advertised ""Have your own karaoke night!"" But there are almost no karaoke songs on Amazon Music. They are plentiful on Spotify and other music services. A speaker with a screen makes karaoke such an obvious use, that it's shocking there's no way to do it. Either you can bring up the lyrics with the original song and vocals, or you can stream Spotify, but then the lyrics don't come up. Looked for third party solutions, but they were all just a few karaoke songs for small children. Another wasted opportunity.

SOUND
The sound was good. I was expecting it to be more like the Echo Studio with a screen, but the speaker is much smaller. Solid, but nothing that impressive. I ended up buying the Echo Sub to pair to it and that improved the sound greatly. Now my music sounds like a sound system...IF I STREAM FROM A SERVICE.

I write and produce music, so a lot of times I like to play my own music from my phone. To do that you need to pair your phone with your echo, at which point the echo acts just like a bluetooth speaker. That's fine, except now the Echo Sub no longer works, since that connects to your echo through bluetooth as well. So that great bassy sound I get with regular music isn't available for my own music if I play through my phone via iTunes or Soundcloud. Yet another opportunity missed.

YOUTUBE
YouTube...works. You access it through a web browser which is just clunky. The promise of a user friendly youtube playing all your videos and exploring and going down a youtube hole on a Friday night just doesn't work through the browser the way a dedicated app would.

FACES
It may not make sense to complain about a feature that isn't included that was never promised, but with echo having a screen, it seems like a logical step to create skins/faces that mimic what Alexa is saying. i picture a translucent face, like Snow White's mirror, or something cartoony. I'm surprised a third party developer wouldn't have made something like this available, and it would give the Show that much more of a personality.

Overall, I enjoy using the Echo Show 10. There seem to be a lot of kinks and falls short of its potential, but I knew that being an early adopter and purchasing the day it became available. And while most of these things are little frustrations, a big frustration is that only about a month after purchasing, Amazon has dropped the price $40, effectively punishing the early adopters for getting behind their product. That, along with my other issues, dropped my review from the five stars I wanted to give, down to the three I gave it.

Hope this helps others!",3.0 out of 5 stars

Contacted Amazon who only stated that they will send a new system and they will provide a return label. What they don’t tell you is that you must send the system back and a replacement is not on the way. You must wait until they receive your item and they will see if they can repair or replace it with a possibility it will be a refurbished item. There’s more to this issue that will be too long to explain. Just know you can get numerous representatives telling you different things. Totally disappointed in this awful process.

Colleen,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2023","Okay, I'm having fun with Alexa. This morning I said ""Alexa, goodbye"". She replied, ""Let's make like a volcano and blow this place"". I will greet her when I return, and she often has a witty reply. She wakes me up to music which starts playing low then gets louder and louder until I tell her I'm awake. The sound is amazing for such a little speaker. I can hear the ""thumping"" coming from my room when I walk down the hall. Drawbacks, I know there is so much I can do with her that I haven't learned and have had a hard time finding the features. Most I discover by looking at the screen. I just learned I can play Jeopardy and found out about a podcast. I have had her give me reminders at certain times. Such as, ""Colleen, you better start getting ready, you have company coming in an hour."" She created a playlist of my favorite songs, but when I ask her to show me my favorite playlist, she only shows me the first song I added to it. In the end, I've had it about a week and I love it. I just want to know what else I can do. -- UPDATE -- so I have had this a couple of months. I love almost everything about it, except I know there are a lot of things than can be done and finding information on that is difficult. For instance, it let me make an outgoing call, but I don't know how to assign a contact and when I called the person, I didn't know what number to give them to call back. My phone is crap, so this would be a great alternative when I'm home. The screen will show a feature, but when I want to get more information, it has changed to a different screen, and I don't know how to back up to review what it just showed me. I will ask Alexa to go back to last screen and she's confused, I will ask her to tell me about it, and she's confused. For instance, the screen flashed something about a ""Bot"" for cooking and DYI, I wanted to know more about it and couldn't get it back. Or something will flash, but I don't have time to see what it is and I don't know how to bookmark it. Like I said before, I know there are a lot more options out there to utilize, but it doesn't come with any sort of manual. I've gone to YouTube videos, etc.. but haven't find anything to help. Other than that, I love the product and would buy it again.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jay,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2023","Bought this on amazon prime day a few weeks ago. It is currently placed on a kitchen counter between the kitchen and living room in an open concept style house. Purchased mainly for the rotating feature that uses the camera to track the user as they walk around. This and the large screen have been great for working in the kitchen or asking about the weather from the living room. The downside of this feature is that below a certain level of light the device no longer moves the screen to follow you, displaying a message that says ""light level too low, movement disabled."" So at night if we don't have bright kitchen and dining room lights on, it doesn't move; and we largely keep those lights off when not in active use. In our home at night we noticed that just ambient light on from lamps in the room isn't enough for it to follow us. The device really needs something like an infrared sensor so it can work at night time like what Ring security cameras use for night vision. Adding this hardware would make this a must have product for your kitchen and bump this up to 5 stars. Other than that drawback, the included speaker, screen quality, and snappiness of the processor is better than past Eco Shows I've owned (still have the original echo show, 5 inch, and 8 inch models). As far as voice recognition it's the same as other models, although for the team working on Alexa it never understands the word ""closet."" We placed smart lighting in our closet, and she always replied with ""What device?"" and we'd have to yell ""closet"" a second time and it was hit or miss on the second attempt. Out of frustration we renamed the smart lighting to ""bathroom"" and that works 100% in turning on the lights in the closet, but that's been our only real issue with voice recognition.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Mark E Timperley,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2021","My first real Alexa enabled product, if you don't count my Kindle Fire... but more on that later.

First, I bought two Echo Show 10s, one for our kitchen and one for grandma. They were very easy to setup and have worked well so far (4 days in). I'm definitely impressed with the design and the quality of components, from the touch screen, buttons, motion and sound. All physical aspects are very well done. Do you need a screen that moves on its own? Yes! I can't imagine this product without motion. So far, we use the Echo Show 10 to ""drop in"" on grandma virtually, several times a day and every night for dinner. We love this ability! The Echo Show turns to whoever is speaking and zooms in on them, so she feels like she is right there with us and her grandchildren (not 25 feet away, outside a fish bowl). The best part of this technology is that Grandma didn't have to learn how to answer the ""video phone"", since it just connects when we want. In general, it works all by itself in her apartment (mostly) and we can control much of it remotely if needed. I do set and adjust reminders and alarms for her when needed, but beyond that we just ""drop in"" and say hello, whenever.

So that's the awesome part. We are discovering a few annoyances as we go, so I'll share one that is probably unique to this product: The process of adjusting and setting the range of motion is not well thought out. If you only ever did this once and then set the thing in cement, then maybe. But we set it on a counter and have already found that it must be moved for cleaning, to temporarily get it out of the way, or for use in another position. It takes about 4 minutes to reset... which is about 3.5 minutes too long for me. The other annoyances are all about ""Alexa"" so I'll mention them last.

Also, I've described a somewhat ideal grandma use case, so keep in mind that we only live 10 minutes from grandma and have had to drop by and ""fix Alexa"" (turned off, moved, lost wifi, screen rotated by hand) while she and visitors are getting used to it, so it's definitely not a set and forget type of technology, but I'm not going to reduce my rating because of that.

My rating would have been 5 stars, if it wasn't for Alexa herself and the somewhat puzzling UI design, menus, etc. Did I mention my Kindle Fire? Here's my point. You need one to control this thing and use many of the ""Alexa features"" with any level of certainty. You could also use a smartphone with the Alexa app, and we actually use both, but I find the Fire is a bit easier to use. This probably isn't news to someone who already has an Echo, but in case you are new to Alexa, using voice commands to find and select a book or other media for it to show or read by voice, to set a reminder, or just about anything beyond a few words, can be a terribly frustrating experience. It is amazing what it can do, but hopefully, engineers are still hard at work improving voice recognition and comprehension. Until then, my recommendation is to pair them. Echo Show 10 + Kindle Fire (with Alexa off on your Kindle) makes a great product together!

So Alexa, how do you spell frustrating? Her dutiful answer is ""F R U S T R A T I N G"" but also awesome, all at the same time. She doesn't get the joke yet... but given what she is capable of, why would she think I'm joking?",4.0 out of 5 stars

Roxie Muzic,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2021","Prior to this the household has the Gen 1 & 10"" Gen 2 Echo Shows, frankly I prefer the Gen 2 10"" Echo Show for most rooms over this model, but then...with firmware improvement/updates that opinion may change.

Other than the slight reduction in sound (I could care, I have multiple Sonos speakers) and screen resolution (as others have pointed out), the overriding feature of this iteration of Echo Show is the camera and 360 degree motion.

The camera is outstanding in resolution, very outstanding, worth the reduction in sound and screen resolution.

Motion however, needs work, the hardware used in this device to detect stability and motion needs serious firmware tweaking, way to sensitive, everything is ""unstable"", even the most stable. Understanding the need to be cautious, in that this slues around, to follow or view it's human or humans, however, ratchet the sensitivity down some to avoid the error messages that are unfounded when the device is on a stable, unimpeded full motion area. Currently if it even rocks a millimeter when turning, it throws the ""unstable"" error. I ordered two of these 10"" Gen 3 Echo Shows, both are behaving in this fashion. A little tweaking to the firmware of the device should solve this little sensitivity issue I would hope. This is not a game changer for me, this will be refined as customer feedback is received, or at least I have found that their development team is very responsive to these consumer observations. Kudos to them for that.

Next, that obnoxious, unnecessary screen of ""Alexa For Your Day"", for the love of every customer that you have, get rid of this, please, it is not a selling feature. Or, at least give us the option to have it show or not show in the Home Screen toggle switch section of the settings. It really is a ""bummer dude""...... if it keeps it up, it could be a game changer for me.

I can live with the HUGE time notification on the screen, I am old, but not blind, can we scale it down or have an option to scale it down, please, thank you. Not a game changer, but it is quite large you must admit...

All in all for the kitchen or the main floor/office in houses this is a great device, allows camera viewing 360 degrees, great idea for those who do not have indoor cameras already and as an adjunct for those of us who do. Have not used it for recipes in the kitchen yet, but I suspect that this will be a vast improvement over the Gen 2 10"" Echo Show, in that it will follow me in my meandering attempt to cook (hopefully it will not catch me crying on the kitchen floor over cooking fiascos). Phone calls to other Echo Show owners should be improved as I meander when talking to folks as well... I believe as the feedback rolls in, there will be improvements to screen data that pops up uninvited (please, pretty please), and the motion sensitivity concerns.

I am pleased with this purchase, but most likely will replace the rest of my Gen 1 Echos with Gen 2 10"" Echo Shows, this model has limited placement criteria and may not be the best Echo for every spot in the house. I will purchase one additional 10"" Gen 3 Echo Show for my office, but for bedrooms the Gen 2 10"" Echo Show should be sufficient.

As for the white cord, I can live with that all day long...aesthetics in this area are the least of my worries....",4.0 out of 5 stars

Peter Susi,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2023","--- UPDATE: (8/1) I received a call claiming to be from Amazon about my review, but the first thing they wanted me to do was confirm my name and account info - MAJOR RED FLAG. I declined, and asked for details and the caller hung up. However, I got a follow-up email from Amazon customer service that mentioned the phone call, and sought to ""help resolve the issues you’ve encountered and gather any additional feedback"". Unfortunately, that email included no information addressing any of the issues below. As far as I can tell the CS agent read neither my review, nor Amazon's public statements warning users not to disclose account information to callers from unknown numbers. -----

***What I wanted:***

A ""third screen"" organizer that could show me a dashboard of calendar entries, weather, to do, etc. Maybe something like THE PICTURES THEY USE TO ADVERTISE IT (See Pic #2 - ""Taylor's Birthday"" displayed next to weather, a podcast, and the time). Also, a screen to play YouTube or Twitch videos as I putter on something else.

***What I got:***

- Home screen is ONLY a rotating set of cards. You have no other options. There is no dashboard style option, no quick launch (you can use ""Tap to Alexa"" as a really mediocre one, kinda). The assumption is that in a world of touchscreens you must only want to shout at your devices.
- The Home screen is not even in your control. You can add pictures, and turn off some things, but Amazon will also randomly add whatever nonsense they think you want. You cannot adjust the rotation speed. Heck, you can't even make the clock overlay bigger.
- You cannot add utility to this home screen. You can't add widgets (they only live on a slide-out panel, and that closes after 10s). You can't adjust how the time and weather are displayed, or set the calendar slide to show things in a useful view. You can't add a big easy ""Open my YouTube Playlist"" button. You get pictures, ads, and gimmicks - end of list.
- That dashboard view (""Taylor's Birthday"") from Amazon's promotional materials - THIS DEVICE DOESN'T DO THAT
- You can technically watch YouTube, eventually. That is until it crashes. Because you need to use Silk, since they didn't include an app for the #2 site on the internet. (Actually, this runs on Android so they REMOVED that stock functionality)
- You can Technically view Twitch, in that the website loads for a few minutes. But you cannot login or use chat because Twitch.tv does not support the Silk browser. Yes, they are both owned by Amazon.
- The screen follows you around the room, or your dog, or any noise, or no noise. It also tries to follow you while you're using the touch screen so you end up chasing it back and forth.
- Interacting with this thing is so SLOOOOOW - How is a new device this underpowered?
- Sure, it does Video calls... which I don't care about because I already have a phone and I spend all day on MS Teams.
- Technically it has Follow-along recipes... No, not the recipes I have on my phone, or the one I found online. There's no way to share a link to this thing, and If I find a video on YouTube, I can't really even watch it.

This isn't even the nitpicky stuff, like when my headphones power off at 2 AM Alexa insists that we all wake up and hear about it, and there's no way to disable it.

Once you get past the gimmick turntable base, this thing is slow, unresponsive, buggy, and very limited in functionality. It is the epitome of ""Technically does what we promised, but not the way you probably want it to, or very well at all"".

Most of the ""Skills"" (Apps) are slower than just taking your phone out of your pocket. ""Is it going to rain?""
Option A: Look at your phone: picture of rain clouds on the weather widget - 2 seconds.
Option B: Ask Alexa - ""Right now in your area it's 64 degrees and partly cloudy with light wind..."" only after slowly describing what can be seen out of any window will she tell you if it's going to rain. And that's *only* if she heard you correctly! There's a good chance you'll get ""Shuffling songs by the Weatherman and similar artists, on Amazon Music"" instead.

Despite being built on an android OS, so much basic functionality has been stripped out of this thing it's infuriating. I can get apps on my WATCH that are easier to use and faster than the barely functional ""Skills"" I can occasionally find from 3rd parties since there is almost no support for this thing. Everything I figure should work out of the box requires sideloading something to connect to IFTTT so I can get another device to do the actual work. Heck, even YouTube - most sites tell you that ""You can make YouTube music work, just Bluetooth connect your phone to the echo!"" because the Echo refuses to run anything that isn't some gimmicky ""Read me my email slowly"" or ""display rotating pictures"" nonsense.

I cannot stress this enough: The best digital experience I can achieve with the Echo Show is by leaning my aging Samsung Tablet against it and launching the stock YouTube app.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Priscilla,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2023","Love the size and the look; However, compared to its sister products I own it is very hard to navigate. 1) I find myself constantly repeating the commands over and over as ""Alexa"" doesn't know that or a lot of ""Hmmmms"" very frustrating; 2) I primarily purchased this to watch TV in the kitchen - well that doesn't seem to be working well either; for starters I cannot download the apps I have on my firestick so that's annoying (please help if avail in this area); if you do actually get to watch content and want to ""pause"" forget asking her via voice she has no clue how to do this, so, I pause manually (usually with my hands full of dirty gloves which also is a pain) so, now we have it paused for a little bit - the screen goes to screensaver mode and the content goes Into the black hole and I cannot retrieve it again or if I'm lucky to retrieve it it is no longer paused and I have to watch from the beginning!!! Super annoying! This is one of the most costly items in the Amazon line and for that reason alone I wish it would work as it's beloved firestick; firetv or even the echo!!! As I have zero issues with these products. I find myself extremely frustrated every time I try to operate this product and it doesn't seem to be getting better after I have watched and tried dozens of ""how to's"" ; it just seems limited, sensitive and honorary to me and my needs - unless I am not using it as it's intended purpose.

nadanix,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","I will give my 5 cents to this device. The unboxing experience is uneventful, however a warning here: You do need a smartphone or tablet to be setup with Alexa or this will not work. That is nowhere mentioned in the advertisement. The Alexa software is by far one of the worst I have seen in years. There is no real menu, you have to scroll through pages and pages of stuff, cluttered with things that are not helpful and confusing. Pictures and advertisement do not belong in a menu. The structure again, horrific.
Neither on the Alexa app or on the device itself is a home screen where you see all your apps.
It’s a cluster of menus, very hard to navigate.
Now, to our device. The first thing I turned off was motion. The screen does a lousy job following you and always seems to be angled off. Even when you turn motion off, every time you hit the screen to use a menu, the screen will bounce around and you need two hands. One to hold the screen and one to use the menu. The touchscreen is very unresponsive and often needs multiple touches to respond. There is a lot of glare coming from the display as well
The sound is good (not great) for a small device and you can pair Apple Music if you don’t want use Amazon Music. Warning: This device is not Airplay compatible, so it will not work in a multi-room setting in the Apple ecosystem. You can stream directly or from your phone via Bluetooth, to a single device. If you have a TuneIn Radio account you can stream from that, but I have not figured out yet how you play your favorites. The Echo will respond to stuff like “play NPR Radio on TuneIn” This device has no way to create or view playlists or use existing playlists in Apple Music.
The amount of consent you have to give to let the Echo read your calendar in your email account is worrisome. I decided against it because exposing your email account to Amazon simply is not my cup of tea. The build in web browser needs work. It is super-slow and will just stop working for no reason. I have the Echo now 2days and had multiple occurrences of freezing screens and the entire Echo going dark. This also happened to me in Food Network.
I turned on the news and when I came back to the kitchen 10 minutes later, the screen is dark. It simply stops, without command. The “try Alexa” feature is a nagging unstoppable insult and can get you mad enough to go the psych ward. No matter what, you cannot turn it off fully.
So after careful consideration and two days of use I decided to keep it a couple more days and wait for a software update. Amazon do you hear me? Add an option to turn off “try Alexa”. Give this thing a real menu. If not, you will get it back before the end of next week.
Edit: Now, on day three, it starts to just turn off. There is no setting to prevent that. Alexa is tired and goes to sleep. I am tired too and today Echo goes home to Amazon.",1.0 out of 5 stars

BornForTech,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2022","So let's look at the model Echo Show 10 itself. Thought it was going to be something like putting a tablet on top of an Apple Home Pod (first gen). Well....it's not. Keep forgetting the Echo Show devices are not tablet user interface devices and the sound quality is not even close to the Home Pod, so just a tad disappointed with that. That said, I do really like the device. I don't have a problem with the Echo UI, in fact i kinda like it better than a tablet. The sound isn't bad, it just isn't what I was hoping for after looking at the design and certainly the price point. The screen and camera quality are really quite good, although when I watch the home screen transition from one picture to another the transition is not super smooth, like maybe the processor is a little under-powered. Not sure about that one tho. The motion feature is nice that it moves to ""look at"" whoever in the room is talking to it (nice feature), the problem is you can turn the motion off, close the camera and still it's gonna move to what ever section of the house has the brightest light. That is so annoying. I might want it to stay looking ""at me"" and not move around so I ask it to play something, turn any motion option OFF and it will eventually move anyway. Drives me up the wall. I think that could probably be addressed in a software OS fix, hopefully soon. Also, when you talk to it, it will move around a lot like it's trying to figure out where you are exaclty. All in all, it isn't a bad device for the living room, picture, sound, camera all nice, just needs the motion adjusted to ""don't move"" means ""don't move"" and they could probably upgrade the processor or maybe adjust the OS a little. If you need an Echo Show and you are only going to purchase one AND don't need it to function as a hub, I'd go with the Echo Show 8 (2021). Otherwise, wait for some changes to this model. Gave it 4 stars for all nice features, but minus one big star for the motion. Does play live video feeds like ABC News really well, that's a plus...and my favorite Sci-Fi (Expanse) looks amazing on it too. If they fix any issues I'll update this review. Hope it helps.
Review Update 9/3/2022: So I moved the Echo 10 into a different room where the lighting was more even and that stopped most of the moving around problems. Then one day it seemed to want to move again and when I was finished a screen popped up that asked if I wanted to change the direction limits. I said yes and it had a great feature I wasn't aware of that let me set the boundaries to the smallest movement possible. With those two changes I have updated my 4 stars to 5. Problems solved and now I don't have to constantly look at the back of the screen. Very happy, really like this product. Thinking about buying another one to replace an Echo 5. The 5 is amazing, but I've gotten to the point where I just want the biggest screen possible, thus the only reason to replace the 5. Good luck, hope this info helps!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Vlad,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021","I was enthusiastic when I ordered my Echo Show 3rd Gen. It was supposed to be a robot but not quite. Awesome speakers, great camera, rotating screen?! I got it out of the box, set it up and although I was a bit thrown off by the white cord sticking out of the black unit like a sore thumb, I really didn’t have major issues. The problem was that after using it for a bit longer bugs started to pop out.
Bugs observed:
- Screen rotates past you.
- Barely touching the screen for an action result in a path is blocked message.
- Can’t rotate at night because if an area is lit dimly will result in motion stopping and an error message
- Some error messages disappear pretty quickly
- During a video call the zooming, orienting of the lenses is not quite right
- Sometimes it won’t respond to the wake up word.
Hardware wise though, this one is better in every regard than its predecessor, which I considered a 5 star product, so the potential is there. So, while I think they would have benefited from a bit more of development time, I think the potential is there. Hopefully, they can do a firmware update to correct the issues. At this point I am not returning it, but if you haven’t bought it, I would wait for a few updates.
UPDATE JAN2022 (Raised one star):
Some of the most annoying bugs have been fixed but not all of them have. However, the improvements are significant enough that I would consider purchasing another one if on sale. If not,the current Gen Show 8 is really good too.
UPDATE JUL2022 (Raised another star)
This is what I expected when I ordered this device. Haven’t had a bug in a while. Screen rotation is significantly better, stopping at the correct spots and following better. Additionally, a friend that ordered a current gen black Echo Show 8, received a black power cord with it; it appears that Amazon is moving in the right direction with the power cords.

tobor,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2023","I've got 9 Echo devices in my home. I've been using Echos (and upgrading to the latest models) since they were first made available. This Echo Show 10 replaced an Echo Show 8 (1st Generation) in my kitchen. I use it multiple times each day to play Spotify, listen to radio (via TuneIn), set timers, etc. The sound quality is very good and I place it only slightly behind my Echo Studio + Echo Sub pair as it pertains to sound quality.

The screen is, likewise, excellent. I have my Show 10 set to rotate a series of fine art prints I've uploaded to Amazon Photos and the colors really pop and look gorgeous on the screen. I find this feature really enhances the ambiance in my kitchen and every time I glance at the screen and see a piece of art I'm glad I purchased the device. I like the screen being larger than the Show 8, although I don't think I'd recommend an expensive ""upgrade"" merely for the screen size.

I have read that many people dislike the number of ads or stories that the Show 10 displays. You can go into settings and select the content you want to see. I've reduced it to only weather and news--everything else is turned off. I almost never see ads and feel that this type of criticism is unwarranted. My Show 10 (like my Show 8) displays content I've allowed and almost nothing more.

The Echo Show 10 loses a star for voice responsiveness. I have it placed in a corner that is pretty wide and open--it's not obstructed in any way. Unfortunately, about 30% of the time the device doesn't ""hear"" a command when I'm standing 4 feet away. Instead, my Echo Studio--which is in an entirely different room--responds. Sometimes it is even worse with an Echo in my bedroom (which is multiple rooms away) responding to my attempt to set a timer whilst in the kitchen. I find it very odd and frustrating. My first generation Echo (the original) did a far better job in this area than the Echo Show 10. And as far as I can tell there is no way to set the mic sensitivity via the Alexa app. That said, the positives still outweigh this negative, but I'm dropping 1 star from my rating.

I'd also add that the ""follow"" feature in which the device's screen moves to face you is not very compelling for me. I can envision other people finding it useful, but for me it seems more like a gimmick. The device is generally reliable following me, but whenever it reaches the edge of the boundary I set it flashes a giant warning message that I'm out of range. That large pop-up is really annoying and there is no way to turn it off. If it didn't flash that warning literally EVERY time I work in the kitchen I might be able to overlook it--as it is, it's just a reminder that Amazon has failed to improve the device. There should be a way to turn off that notification.

The Echo Show 10 is a decent device, but I'm not so sure of the value proposition. Adding a motor to turn the screen increases complexity and cost yet the benefits of this design are not compelling. And because this is the only device in the Echo lineup to employ this feature, Amazon hasn't really prioritized improving Echo Show 10 functionality. I don't know what is going on with the mic sensitivity, but it's not as good as it should be. The sound quality, however, is solid, and the screen is decent and a great size.",4.0 out of 5 stars
C,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021","The new Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is a big improvement over the previous 2nd Gen version. The Show 10 is now attached to a swivel base that lets the Show 10 constantly rotate to face you as you move around the room. Other changes include: a new speaker configuration, MUCH better camera, better processor, and Amazon Sidewalk support. Here are my thoughts so far:

THE GOOD:

-SETUP – Setup was super easy. The Show came configured to my account, I didn't have to log in or even enter wifi passwords. It connected, downloaded some updates, and then walked me through customizing the range of motion.
-MOTION- This is the most obvious new improvement. The Show 10 will now track your movement and turn to face you as you move around the room. The Show seems to have very good facial tracking, and it will rotate on its horizontal axis to follow you (you can also manually tilt the screen up and down to your desired vertical position.) We tested this while playing movies and while viewing our remote cameras, and it worked perfectly. We also tested with multiple people in the room; and the Show seems to lock onto one face and moves to follow that face, until it can't see that face anymore and will move to another face. Or if someone uses the Wake Word “Alexa,” it will turn toward where that voice was coming from. This also works for video calls, though we noticed that on video calls the Show will rotate to try to keep ALL of our faces in view. Sometimes this might mean it faces in between two people so that the camera can see both of us, and then automatically zooms the camera in or out to adjust. Which brings me to the next big improvement:
-13MP CAMERA – We were very impressed with the quality of the new camera, and with the tracking technology it uses. Not only are images crisp and detailed on video calls, but the camera will actually automatically zoom in and out to adjust to the people in the shot. For example I can back up from my kitchen into the living room, and the camera will zoom in and follow me. When you combine this with the movement and facial tracking, it is almost like having your own camera man follow you around the room on your call. The family members we called said they could see so much more detail. There is also now a physical shutter that you can close to cover the camera if you want to.
-SPEAKERS – The old 2nd Gen Show 10 had dual 2” neodymium drivers, but this new 3rd Gen Show 10 has two 1” tweeters and a 3” woofer. I can definitely tell the difference, although I really don't use the Show for listening to music very often. In testing out a few songs, I noticed that the new 3rd Gen seems louder at max volume, and less muffled. Definitely an improvement, though maybe not quite on the level of the Echo Studio.
-PROCESSOR – The new Show 10 has both an upgraded main processor, and also a second Amazon AZ1 processor. This should result in slightly faster repose times, and better future performance; although I really haven't been able to tell much of a difference so far. AZ1 is supposed to be faster and more efficient, and allow voice commands to be processed locally instead of having to go to the cloud; so we'll see if this is noticeable in the future.
-ZIGBEE/SIDEWALK – The previous version included a Zigbee hub, but this version also includes Amazon Sidewalk compatibility. Sidewalk is a long range connection technology that Amazon plans to use for devices that will be able to reach much further; (the initial announcement estimated up to half a mile). This technology isn't really being used yet, but it is nice to know this future tech is built in.

THE BAD:

-WHITE POWER CORD – Yes, for some reason that same white power cord that ships with the Echo 4th Gen is also included for this Show 10. No matter what color Show you get (I got black), you still get a white power cord. I'm a little surprised that they went with this decision again, but it really doesn't bother me much at all. Just thought I'd mention it in case that matters to you.
-LARGE FOOTPRINT – Since the device rotates, you really have to be careful about where you put it. The Show 10 comes with a footprint guide, that suggests that you make sure you have enough space around the device to avoid the screen knocking over a glass of water, for example. This also wasn't a big deal for me, but keep in mind you will probably need more space than the previous version. The specs recommend a 10” by 15” space, but I think you could get away with less.

*Note – You can disable the movement by saying “Alexa disable Motion,” or by turning it off in the Alexa app on your phone. Also, when you first setup your Show, there is a slider bar that let's you choose how far the screen should rotate in each direction. It seems to go almost 360 degrees maximum, but you can limit the radius so it turns much less. You can also change this in the 'Motion' menu under Settings.

Overall, I am VERY pleased with this new Show 10. The camera clarity is great, and the face tracking technology is so impressive; there's just nothing else like it for video calls to our family. This is a huge upgrade!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Vincent,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","I have owned the last two Generation Echo Shows. The Echo Show 1 & Echo Show Gen 2. The Echo Show 10 solves all the issues that the first two devices had, and adds even more features jam packed into one great device.

Now before I get into the meat and potatoes — let me tell you about the truly magical experience I have had with this device. It arrived in a box almost double the size of the previous model — and this device is BIG! The screen is huge! The speaker is also apparently much more powerful than the last generation — and I can tell, that is most definitely the case.

But the true magic comes when you power on and set up the Echo. The Amazon team really did wonders creating this device. Both the camera and the AI in this thing are crazy good. Assuming you have motion enabled, as soon as you say the wake word, i.e., “Alexa” the device honed in on my direction, rotated towards me, and began listening.

If you walk around the room, this device follows you. You can’t understand how cool this is until you try it out. I would upload a video, but I’m sure you can look it up on YouTube, and there will likely be hundreds of reviews showcasing it here.

There’s something about the tracking technology that Amazon has gotten just right. I called up my Grandma who has my old first gen echo show, and she didn’t even realize we were conversing as I was walking around my room. She thought I was just stationary the whole time. When I pointed it out and showed to her, her jaw dropped.

The way the camera zooms in on you, and the range of video it can show is phenomenal. I can jump onto my bed (my echo is on my nightstand) and the echo will zoom in and focus on me. When I go off the side of my bed, it follows zooming out, and can follow my body all the way as I walk back across the room towards the device.

It all feels so natural. The only thing that is missing would be if the Echo device itself moved! You can now have a conversation with someone when moving around your environment, without having to remain stationary.

In a kitchen, a home gym, or anywhere you’d want to talk with someone actively, this device would be really extraordinary to play with, especially during covid times.

I use my device in my room as an Alarm clock — so previously, my camera would be staring across the room as to not let me look at the screen if needed (for time/alarms, etc). Now, with the camera cover, I feel much more comfortable covering the camera and rotating the device to look towards me at night.

Now, take these into consideration as you decide if you want to purchase:

First, if you want to get the latest and greatest Echo device, the purchase is a no brainer. I am an Amazon loyalist, and can say that even from first impressions, this device blows all other Amazon devices I’ve owned away.

Second, if you’re a user who doesn’t mind the camera being uncovered, then you’ll have no problem with this device. You’ll love it. The motion features will be left on 16/7 for me. I wouldn’t be comfortable allowing having the camera on while I’m sleeping (and staring at me), but for a public area in your home — who cares? I wouldn’t mind, I’d leave it on all day — it following you around is magical.

Third, if you fall into the second issue above, you CAN use the camera cover to disable motion. If you don’t mind sliding the cover open and closed every morning/night, this could work for a nightstand alarm clock, and the hassle/inconvenience would be worth it.

Pros:
- Motion is magical
- Camera is high definition
- Sound is great. Music sounds lively. Lyrics on screen that follow you around the room
- Adaptive screen dimming still works even when camera/motion is blocked/disabled
- You can manually rotate the device when motion is off i.e. I’m going to bed, to point it towards me. I don’t know if that’s safe for the motor — I’ll ask Amazon!

Cons:
- If your room doesn’t have a full range of motion, the Echo might get confused when following you around. Since it is on my nightstand, the echo really only needs to turn about 90° to see in front if itself, and when I go to the left of my room. If I go to exit my room, it might start losing tracking, which could probably fixed in a future OS update (to halt moving at a specific point, which it already does).

Bottom Line: I 100% recommend this as an upgrade to an old device or a new device for any potential Echo owners. If you don’t feel comfortable with the motion controls, turn them off, but you won’t get the full package and what I think is the biggest selling point of this device. Put this in a public room and try it out — you won’t regret it.

EDIT: After seeing more reviews a few points to mention:

1. White power cord. Who cares? You dock a star for this? Don’t listen to normies giving poor reviews who think the color of a power cord which is draped out of sight will have any effect on how the device improves over it’s predecessor
2. Complaints over resolution: if you’re not buying this thing to watch full-fledged movies on, it’s fine. You won’t notice.
3. Complaints over tracking: it won’t track you with the camera in the dark. A future models can probably have an infrared light added (similar to FaceID) to fix that problem.
4. I saw someone complaining about Airplay and multiroom audio. Echo devices support multiroom audio through Amazon’s Ecosystem — not bluetooth. It has never supported that. Why would you expect this to change without notice?

Don’t listen to the haters. People reviewing are acting as if this device isn’t 5x better than the last generation of the Show. Motion is a stellar addition that would bring moving smart devices into the mainstream. No one here knows what a
the Facebook Portal is, because there was never a solid backing behind the product line. Echos are in homes across America, and I’m sure that this will lead to better smart devices from Amazon in the future.

For reference, I have owned an: Echo Show 1, Echo Show 2, Echo Dot, and have coded ~5 Alexa Skills. I know these devices. This gen is great. Give it 1 month and these will be 5/5. These reviews all read so fake. Who purchases a device and returns it same-day due to a different colored power cord? Who returns a device that doesn’t do something they expected when it was never said the device did it?

Low-information consumers and people with too high expectations... there’s a reason why it’s called PRE-ORDERING, because you KNOW you are going to like it and/or take what you get. No one forced you to buy a day 1 device.

TL;DR: Don’t listen to bad reviews. Buy this if you’re in the market.",5.0 out of 5 stars

kenya Garcia,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2024","I recently started using the Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen). Here’s a review focusing on its convenience:
Convenience:

The Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is an incredibly convenient addition to my home. The standout feature is its ability to move and follow me around the room. The smart display’s motorized base means it rotates to keep me in view during video calls or while watching recipes and tutorials. This hands-free feature is fantastic for multitasking—whether I’m cooking, working out, or just moving around the room, the Echo Show 10 stays with me, ensuring I never miss a beat.

1. Smart Movement:

The Echo Show 10’s ability to automatically pivot and track me during video calls or while I’m interacting with it is a game-changer. No more awkward adjustments or missed moments—this device ensures I stay in the frame and can see the screen clearly, regardless of where I move.

2. Crystal-Clear Display:

The HD display is vibrant and sharp, making it perfect for watching videos, browsing photos, or following along with recipes. The 10.1-inch screen size is just right—not too big and not too small—offering an excellent viewing experience without dominating my countertop or desk space.

3. Premium Sound Quality:

The sound quality is top-notch, with rich, clear audio that fills the room. Whether I'm listening to music, catching up on the news, or watching a movie, the Echo Show 10 delivers an immersive audio experience. The built-in speakers are powerful and provide crisp sound, enhancing the overall convenience of the device.

4. Voice-Controlled Smart Home Hub:

Integrated with Alexa, the Echo Show 10 acts as a central hub for my smart home devices. I can control lights, thermostats, and other smart gadgets with simple voice commands. The convenience of managing my smart home from a single device, especially with voice commands, simplifies my daily routines.

5. Video Calling Made Easy:

The Echo Show 10 simplifies video calls with its high-definition camera and auto-framing feature. It’s easy to connect with family and friends, and the camera ensures that everyone in the room is visible and in focus. Plus, the privacy shutter provides peace of mind when not in use.

6. Interactive Features:

The touch screen interface is intuitive and responsive, making it easy to interact with apps, view photos, or check the weather. The device integrates seamlessly with various services, including Amazon services and third-party apps, enhancing its versatility.

7. Home Automation Integration:

The Echo Show 10 works well with other smart home devices, allowing me to automate tasks and create routines. Setting up routines for daily tasks like turning on the lights or adjusting the thermostat is straightforward, making home management more efficient.

Cons:

While the Echo Show 10 excels in convenience, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider:

1. Size and Placement:

The device is relatively large and requires a bit of space. Its size might be a consideration if you have a smaller kitchen or desk area.

2. Price Point:

It is on the higher end of the price spectrum for smart displays. While the features justify the cost, it may not be the most budget-friendly option for everyone.

3. Motion Tracking Sensitivity:

While the motion tracking is a fantastic feature, it can sometimes be overly sensitive. In certain lighting conditions or with rapid movements, the device may have difficulty keeping up.

Final Thoughts:

The Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is a highly convenient and feature-rich smart display. Its ability to move and track users, combined with excellent sound quality and a sharp HD display, makes it a valuable addition to any smart home. Despite a few minor considerations regarding size and price, the Echo Show 10’s functionality and ease of use make it a worthwhile investment for those looking to enhance their smart home experience.",5.0 out of 5 stars
A. Pena,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2021","Full disclosure, I receive gift cards from my place of work from time to time and I used some of that money to pay for half of this unit, though it is not related to Amazon of course so this review is fully of my own opinions.

I own a few of the Amazon Echo show units dating back to the original Gen 1 Echo Show (7 inch). I currently still own that unit and had a place in my kitchen for several years. My wife now working from home needed an Echo in her upstairs office (where it was becoming troublesome to reach her from the other end of the house) so instead of purchasing an all new one, we decided based on her casual usage that we would replace the Gen 1 Echo Show with the latest generation for the kitchen. At the time, I wasnt aware of the new Echo Show 10, but was intrigued to find out there was a new version with a motorized screen display. I am somewhat of an early adopter, but my profession is in computer/electrical engineering and wanted to see if this was worth the substantial increase in costs. The gift card funds just help take that sting out of the purchase that made the decision easier over the costs of the non motorized Show product line.

Unboxing:
Unboxing was straight forward if you are familiar with the Show lineup and not much to say other than that reviews had led me to believe the unit was big, but I was not surprised by what I found. Essentially a large speaker base with what appears to be a tablet stuck to it, not that surprising and what anyone would expect. The cable like many others have mentioned on the charcoal colored unit is a bit annoying that it is white, but not the end of the world. Just would have appreciated more attention to this detail. Packaging looked well capable of protecting the unit as it was a box within a box, within another Amazon box, but this is where I have a small gripe. Did we need 3 boxes for this, Amazon, please work on the overuse of packaging for wastage.

Setup:
Setup was pretty standard if you have ever performed an Echo setup, but a bit elongated to perform the turning radius setup limits which is handy if your Show will have objects nearby or walls to contend with. I have none in this case as it is going at the end of the counter bar that divides the Den area with the Kitchen area. It can turn 360 degrees freely and this was easy to see how to limit or run unhindered. The rest of the setup was just confirming the Amazon account, wireless connection, and home screen details. All within about 3 minutes or less.

First impressions:
My first impressions were the unit is very sleek looking and the weight seemed adequate for the unit to be stable on the bench. The screen was perfectly bright and just the right size to view from a reasonable distance. The speed of the rotation as some have mentioned being too slow I found just fine as I want it to be quiet (which it is in motion - perfectly silent) and yet not aggressive in the movements as to call too much attention to the unit. My family thought it was pretty interesting how it can follow if you interact with it, but normally it stay put unless you ask it a question. In locating the person to point at with the voice trigger, I actually found the unit a little less sensitive to the wake command than any of my other generation units including the latest 8 inch and 5 inch Show units (I own 4 x 8 inch units and 4 x 5 inch units, along with 3 echo dots). In fact I have an upstairs Echo Show 8 (open ceiling through the Den into the movie theater room, that many times ""bongs"" to the wake command sooner than the kitchen one will standing within a few feet of this new unit. This isnt a huge issue once you get used to it, but I hope Amazon tweaks the sensitivity of the wake command to be more in line with other models in the lineup. One of the reason I got this new unit was my impressively fast results with the other latest generation Echo Show 8 units being so fast to work a command over the 1st generation.

After a few weeks of usage:
I have found that the unit motorized feature is a little bit of a novelty, but in daily use it has been a welcome change. For the price difference, I am right on the fence of whether I would pay the difference knowing what I know now and I know that may not help anyone reading this, but it is really right there with I would or wouldnt pay the extra. As the price knowingly will come down over time, this should become easier to make a decision.

Sound Quality:
Sound quality is above par for my expectations, as it is more clear than the preceding model. It has more depth to me and sound dispersion to 360 degrees is far better than the rear/side facing speakers of the past. Potentially largely due to the screen being out of the way which is a bit expected. Louder volumes were reached without distortion compared to previous units and the highs were clear and pronounced without overdoing it. Happy with this as an area speaker, but this wont replace your bookshelf stereo for instance. It can be paired with other devices so you can expand this if necessary.

Motion tracking:
As mentioned from others, this is a bit laggy, but in the ""works well enough"" category. It is not quick to jump around, but can trail someone easily walking around. What I found is that it rarely loses focus of the individual completely even though it will trail the motion. And if the user is continuing to speak, it almost never loses track of the user in my testing. Of note, it of course does not track up and down as the motorized function is swivel only, but the wide angle of the lens makes this mostly unnecessary.

Final verdict:
Would I get this again? In this same scenario, definitely, no regrets. Had I needed to pay the entire amount? At $250 at the time of writing while the 8 inch is $109, this is a hard justification, but when we remember that a year ago the previous 10 inch model was selling for $229, it gets a lot easier to see that the extra $20 delivers quite a bit. Better sound, motorized swivel, a better screen, and a much better tilt/angle/level than the previous unit had out of the box. I think this is a win, if it isnt a solid win over the previous generation. I hope that the mic sensitivity gets better with updates, but I dont have many complaints over what is delivered today from this model.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Char, The (Mostly) Happy Shopper","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2023","Here I am again with yet another echo review. Anyone who follows my reviews knows I have quite a few of these things. I'm always buying a new one and then doing the echo shuffle, placing them in different rooms with every upgrade. I have the echo dot 2nd gen (well, had....we'll get to that in a bit), an echo dot 4th generation, three echo show 5's, an echo show 8 and now, with my latest purchase, an echo show 10. I have them all over our house. I've been watching the 10 and 15 for a while now. Then, one day, I got a notification that the 10 had a deal. I took it and noticed they'd give me more off in I traded in one of my other devices. Out went the 2nd gen because I knew, with the upgrade and shuffling, I wouldn't use it anymore. The sadness washed over me. It was our first echo relationship. So many memories. The good times, the bad times. I will look back at them fondly. I took some time to say goodbye before packaging it up and taking it to the UPS drop-off. They say getting over your first is hard, and they are right, but it was time to move on.....

I purchased the 10 and it arrived the next day. Set up, as always, was a breeze. Took less than 5 minutes thanks to the preset up email. The 10 is about the right size for our kitchen (where it replaced the 8, which got moved elsewhere, hence the shuffle) and I love having the bigger screen to watch the news while I get ready for work in the morning. The sound and picture quality are pretty great. I did get a little stand for it so it sits a bit taller, but other than that, it's just about perfect. Just about you say? Yea, just about. My issue is with the one feature that the others I own don't have. Motion detection. I hate it. Why? Well, first, I don't ever use my echos for phone calls. I know some people do and that's cool. Just not my thing. Second, I placed my echo in a corner. It can't swivel without hitting a wall. So, I turned that feature off. Simple enough. Or so I thought. It did an update recently and I walked into my kitchen, only to find it stuck against the wall. It had reset itself. Bad Alexa, bad. I turned the feature off again. It started to move once more, telling me it was stuck. I gave it a good amount of side eye and double checked the settings. It showed that it was turned off. Hmmm. I did what our IT department always says to do when faced with a tech crisis. I turned it off and back on again. I also closed the camera lens, something I had forgotten to do with this one. It hasn't tried moving since. Let's hope it stays that way.

Since it does come with motion detection, one nice thing about it (yes, there is something positive about it I guess) is that even when disabled, the screen can be swiveled. Now, I do like that. I have had to adjust the screen a little depending on where I am in the room or because of the glare of the lights and it's nice to not have to move the whole device. I do sometimes wish you could lock it into place though. No swiveling at all. If there is such a feature (outside of the motion detection disable), I haven't found it yet.

Aside from that, just as with my other echos, I really like it. It's great for checking our blink cameras, watching news or tv, playing music throughout the house, controlling our lights, creating shopping lists, reminders and the like, or just being entertained by asking silly questions. Me and Alexa can have hours of fun with the last one. She's a crazy gal. There are so many things you can do that I doubt I will stop with the 10. As a matter of fact, I know I won't. As Amazon keeps making them, I will probably keep buying them, eventually having one in every single room in our house. I'm honestly pretty close. What will I do then, you ask?

Also I would heavily like to include that Alexa routines are very lacking and custom routine sucked and I hated that alexa wanted to speak everytime you issued a custom routine I could get her to stop talking no matter what I tried also routines should have if then, elseif then, else then, and the ability to cancel another routine. It would be smarter if they did node driven routines.",4.0 out of 5 stars

J,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023","We're approaching the two year mark with the Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) in our kitchen and as such it has been used heavily. We've tinkered around with just about every bell and whistle that is available on it. Ultimately, we've decided that it is just a poor design across the board and consequently a frustrating user experience.

Honestly, most of these ""bells and whistles"" really aren't something anyone would make use of other than to ""try them out"" once as we've done. The news and sports widgets may interest you, but I feel like we are drowning in those two types of widgets on every screen we encounter these days; phone, watch, PC, work laptop, home laptop, tablet, TV. I feel like I have enough news, weather, and sports widgets to last me a lifetime at this point.

We ended up disabling everything except the rotating photos, so it's nothing more than a glorified digital photo frame for us. It's decent for that, but frankly the majority of digital photo frames out there will do a better job. Just stick an Echo Dot next nearby for Alexa...

As far as the lackluster photo experience, for example, you can't make it default to photo frame mode, or even force it to stay in that mode for an extend period of time. It always ends up back at the home screen after awhile. So, if you set it up to do so, you end up with rotating Amazon Photos photos on the ""home screen"" which you get forced to. The home screen photos are decent but, just like everything else in the Echo Show, still feels buggy and clunky. When you set a 10 second or 30 second photo rotation (or whatever) it definitely doesn't follow that setting. Sometimes it will hang on a photo for several minutes, other times it will rotate in 10 seconds. It feels like that setting is for Photo Frame mode, which (as mentioned) is essentially a useless feature, since it does not stay persistent.

Another drawback while being forced into the home screen for making it a digital photo frame is the clock/date are in the bottom left hand corner, and they are absolutely massive. They cannot be adjusted or disabled, as most everything else on the device... very little customization options. We have like 700 clocks in our kitchen, and would totally be fine with disabling the Echo Show clock... Often it will rotate to a photo and then the focal point of the photo ends up blocked by the huge clock. This happens a lot to us because we end up taking family selfies, and (having the longest arms currently) I normally take them, so I end up in the upper right of the photo, with the wife more towards the left, and then the kids in the bottom left... so, the huge clock cuts the kids out of the picture and most of the time half of my wife gets cut. That clock really does wreck a ton of photos, family selfies or not. Long story short the photo experience is decent, but there are way better options/devices out there, especially since the other options will integrate with other services such as Apple or Google photos, but with the Echo Show you are forced into Amazon Photos which is severely lackluster compared to the ""other two""...

Aside from the photos I have no idea why anyone would like this device, let alone rate it 5 stars. The speaker looks like it should be awesome, but it's also lackluster. The hardware just kinda sucks... it is quite sluggish in terms of performance.

We do have Spotify integration set up and do also use that a bit just because my kids play music on alexa in general a lot... but, if you have read this far, then it's not going to be a shocker when you hear we feel the Echo Spotify app is a clunky, sluggish, and just overall lackluster experience when compared to the Apple, Android, PC, Mac, and Web Spotify apps.

It seems like it could be great for video calls. We did try that some when I was traveling for work and it's just too sluggish and clunky, we always ended up flipping over to our phones. Also forget the ""follow me"" screen rotation mode thing, it sounds cool, but works like garbage. Same with streaming videos in general, just doesn't work well, I'd rather just use a small phone.

All of that said, having a digital alexa photo frame is decent enough... These things aren't too pricey, especially when you catch them during Amazon's big sales...

But.... the two straws which broke the camel's back, and makes me want to go office space this thing, are:

a) Our family loves shopping on Amazon, we spend a disgusting amount on Amazon every year, so take this point for what it is... but in pure slime ball fashion Amazon forces advertisements on the screen which pop up periodically trying to get you to buy random stuff. Sometimes, this stuff may not even be something you'd like advertised to your kids or guests. There is absolutely no way to disable these ads. So they charge you 100 to 300 bucks for something like this, and force their ads on to you. That in and of itself should be a hard stop for anyone considering one of these.

b) I'm not sure how this next point is working behind the scenes over there at Amazon, but it appears that any new or updated feature forces itself to be turned on (even after previously disabling it). This is a regular occurance. Like I said we've literally disabled everything, but things just pop up out of nowhere, or are periodically turned back on, such as news, sports, joke of the day, etc etc. And nope, it's not my kids messing with it, they can't even reach it.

TTLD;, the Echo Show 10 kinda sucks, part due to hardware issues, but bigger part due to software issues, which leads me to believe whatever version comes next will also suck. That said, 45,458 reviews as of this post, and 4.5 stars... so the masses appear to love this big weird clunky rotating wonky crappy weak sauce robot tablet... :D",1.0 out of 5 stars

PMR,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2023","I bought this mainly to use it as a video call unit (I intend to buy a second one soon, which will be installed at a relative's house). My second use is watching the house when I'm away (via the app on my cell) and seeing a couple of cameras I have installed.

That said, here are my PROS and CONS.

PROS:
- Nice screen of a good format and size. The resolution is really good, too.
- Good sound, equivalent to (if not better than) what my Echo 3rd gen produces.
- Should make a nice video call set (more on that when I install the second unit; I will get back here to update my review).
- The screen follows you (most of the time)!

CONS:
- The screen is way too reflective. That makes it hard to read if there's a window behind you.
- A white power cord for a black unit, really, Amazon?! OK, I understand it saves YOU some bucks, but it's an eyesore at my all-black countertop. A black unit should come with a black cord, period. Good thing I had an Echo 3rd gen. with a black cord I could use (my Echo can keep the white cord since it falls hidden behind a piece of furniture).
- While I'm at that... the power cord has a different adaptor than the Echo Dots. So you can only replace the eyesore white cord like I did if you have an Echo (not the dot, but the taller one, which also uses a different adaptor -- come on, Amazon, standardize that stuff!)
- Somewhat harder to hear you... and I can attest to that since I have five other Echo Dots 3rd gen plus an Echo 3rd gen in the house. You call it, it doesn't hear you, and you need to repeat it louder. It's so annoying that sometimes a Dot in a far-away room will reply to your command instead of this unit, which is right on your face.
- Besides, you can say ""Alexa, do [whatever]"" to an echo dot, while you have to call ""Alexa"" (wait for it to find you) and then ""do [whatever]"" on this thing. Not as fast/responsive as the Echo Dots.
- No infrared vision, so don't expect it to be helpful as a night camera to watch your house.
- It does follow you, but sort of ""crooked."" Its camera is off-center, so it usually doesn't ""look at you"" directly but a little sideways. No, there's no way to fine-tune that either. And sometimes, for no good reason, you can walk in front of it, and it won't follow you... I haven't yet figured out why and when it does follow me, even after telling her to ""follow me"" and activating that mode.

Finally, let's be honest: I love what it does, and many years ago, I was impressed with what this technology promised. But almost a decade later, Alexa isn't becoming smarter. It recognizes my face and my voice. But if I tell her my birthday or some other fact about me, she's still incapable of memorizing it (yes, I can create a note, but that's not the same as this thing really KNOWING when my birthday -- or anyone's birthday -- is).

Today, it also should be smart enough to receive two or more commands at once, like ""turn off my office light, turn on my bedroom light, and play music.""

And even though I have a Fire TV at home, it took way too many commands and internet searches until I got this new unit to control it (it kept replying, ""your Fire TV can't do that"" to every command; I finally got it to work, but definitely not a user-friendly set up as I'd have expected).

So the promise of Artificial Intelligence is still in the air. This thing has good voice recognition, but its features and skills are still not worthy of being called ""intelligence.""",4.0 out of 5 stars

Jace,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2024","This is by far our family’s favorite Amazon product. We started with an echo dot (2nd gen) in 2017, then fire tv sticks, plug ins, fire tablets, echo auto and echo shows. We pretty much have an alexa/echo device in each rooms.
It was very easy to install especially if you already have an amazon account. Also, check out their trade-in program. Take advantage of upgrading your echo devices and experience how amazon develops their products and try their best to give customers great and reliable products.
Now, this Echo Show 10 does a lot of work in our home. I won’t discuss about any technical things about it since I do not speak that language. However I will review this from a Mom’s standpoint.
As a parent of curious kids, you’ll get hundreds of questions a day. Sometimes you’d know the answers and there are times you don’t. The device helps me with that. Sure the other echo dots can do it but having a screen that follows you is more fun and more informative for kids. It makes my kids interested in current events as it shows news articles and photos. It would give some facts and interesting topics for us to discuss further. Of course, my kids will do their own research and it keeps them more interested. From music, history, conversation, spelling, you name it, it would have the answers.
Next is the camera feature, any approved contacts can drop in on this device. It’s amazing since they could pretty much video call other relatives that have alexa app or devices. It makes us feel more connected with our loved ones that can’t operate phones to video call.
So aside from connecting us with humans, it connects us to other non humans; my vacuum cleaner, air purifier, lights, window blinds and so much more. It helps me multi task. As a mom, life gets busy and I forget a lot of things! I rely on this device to remind me about my schedule, chores, shopping lists, recipes, etc. I do have other ways to remind myself about things but it helps that there’s a device that will show me and tell me to do it. It makes me remember more when I see my list and this thing does it for me without all the paper clutter.
Then there’s more features to explore!
It helps me so I wish other moms would have something like this to will help them everyday.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Jason Gaines,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2021","UPDATE 4-17-21: Still working fine, no issues. Only thing I wish, is that I had just waited a month to purchase this as it went on sale super quick for $50 less. What’s the point of being an early adopter if it’s a negative?! I’d rather have just waited; next time I will. ;(

UPDATE 3-30-21: Our Video Apps Crashing issue came back, so I contacted Amazon again and they decided it would be best to replace the unit. A new one will be here in another day, so I can see if that one has any issues. I do like the Show 10, but I'm a little less smitten with it then I thought I would be. Again, the motion part is not as useful as one would like due to it's ability to actually track you properly without getting lost. I do really enjoy having a device to watch something in the kitchen while chilling out or cooking, and playing music on it is actually quite nice. Maybe it just needs to grow on me some more, and absolutely have the video apps stop crashing that is a definite.

So we’ve had this for a month now. It’s been fun to get to use it and see what it can do. That being said, it’s not as useful as I thought it would be. This is much less a tablet and more a media player. You can’t customize it like a Kindle or other tablets and put your own apps on it. It does play music really well and it does okay with smart home stuff. But that is an Alexa issue not Echo Show problem. I was hoping we had more customization with this but the OS is pretty closed loop.

Motion: Hit or Miss. it will follow you when you tell it to, but it will lose you easily, especially if you are too close to the unit or move to rapidly. There is a happy space of probably about 5ft to 8ft where it will follow you well. Too close and it will focus on something else, same thing for too far away. It loses you and once it does it forgets who it was following. Too many people around can confuse it as well. If it’s just you and your cleaning dishes or cooking, you should be okay.

Video: we had an issue with our unit crashing any video app such as Prime Video or Netflix after about 5-8mins of watching something. It would just go back to the home screen and forget what you were watching. If you started the app up again you had to start back from where you began as it would not save your progress. Calling support just recommended a factory reset which was going to be our next step anyways, and so far that has corrected the crashing.

Security: it’s easy enough to view the camera on the Show and move it left or right to see what’s around the area. Just remember you can’t move the screen up or down remotely, so if it tilted too far up it will limit your view. Otherwise it works well, and the screen notifies you when someone is remotely viewing on the screen.

Customization: Meh, it’s okay but will take some time getting used to the OS. It works like a tablet in the fact you tap or swipe to get to stuff, but again you can’t add any apps from an App Store. The OS is locked to what it is, and maybe that’s a good thing so it doesn’t get corrupted by junk we all like to add. Still, it limits the functionality and use of this device.

Overall: It’s a sound bar with a video display that can control smart home apps. The sound is really good, loud and crisp. Video is nice and smooth and if you have issues try a reset of the device. Not as full featured as a full on tablet, but pretty good over all. I gave it a four star rating. Really it’s a 4.5, but not a full 5 so I’m not picking that just because they don’t give us half ratings to use. It’s not cheap at $250 new right now, but it is worth the price if you want a good setup for say the kitchen or other room except for living room.",4.0 out of 5 stars

J. Fernandez,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","First the camera is offset, so the screen is always offset when it follow you, that is when it does actually follow you, because more than half of the time it does not, and God forbid you try to touch the monitor, because it will constantly tell you the screen has bumped into something... It has way too many bugs in the software ... I am not at all impressed with this update, because it doesn't seem like a lot of thought went into this model!

BUT ... My biggest gripe has to do with the electrical cord, it is way too short, and plugs into the bottom of the base, which is also insanely difficult to reach without the monitor swinging all around, and good forbid you have to unplug it for any reason, because it will constantly make you put in your password over and over!

I am sorry, but this update is a big fail! It is definitely not ready for consumers! They really should have worked out the bugs before releasing it to the public! This unit truly seems like it should be in beta testing still, because it has way too many issues that need to be addressed!

Update: The advertisement makes it look as if you can use the device to scan one’s surroundings, when not at home, but what only the small print reveals, which most people will miss, that it only does this FOR A PRICE AND with a SUBSCRIPTION to HOME GUARD plus!

At $250, this should have been included, at least for a year, free of charge! I bought this believing I could scan a room, from my mobile device, only to find out ... you can’t, NOT EVEN WHEN YOU ARE AT HOME! Really Amazon, you couldn’t include that at least for a year free! As a prime member, for many years, I find this totally unacceptable, from a billion dollar company, that is charging way too much for this device! Do yourself a favor and wait until Amazon addresses the many issues and bugs this device does have at the present time!

Xtra, And apparently there is no way to pair the Amazon Remote in the software! I have search high and low for a way to pair my remote, but the option is no longer in the settings on the device or app!

After several months of owning this device I can say with all honesty it is the WORST device and echo show I have EVER owned!, along with the new Echo, Amazon has me truly believing it is time to cancel all my Amazon accounts, because the majority of their devices don’t work like they claim! If I have to yell one more command to turn play a show on Hulu and Netflix only to told you cannot play HULU or NETFLIX on this device, I will start looking for devices that actually do ….

JD,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2023","*Updated 11/23/23* - so it appears that Amazon reintroduced a toggle in the ""Home Screen"" section this month to turn off the highly annoying ""things Alexa can do"" or ""things to try"" interruptions and it seems to be working at this point. I increased my rating to 3 stars.

Original review
Echo Show 10 - in use for 3 months. I have 4 other echo audio-only devices and a variety of other smart home devices - nearly 50 in total. I added the Echo show as a central device in the kitchen/great room where I could monitor selected security cameras and use the numerous other features WHEN I ASK IT TO (see below).

The GOOD News - the Echo Show handles all of the Alexa capabilities and provides basic integration with my smart home environment. The 10"" screen is good quality and adds a number of useful video features like displaying recipes, streaming videos, video calls, video monitoring of security cameras, etc... The sound quality is good - perhaps a tick better than the audio-only Echo balls. Almost certainly you will find something useful in the broad array of capabilities. The feature for the display to ""follow you"" around the room is interesting, but after a while it started feeling creepy so I turned it off - but I can see where that would be useful to some depending on how you are using the device.

The BAD news -
(1) At times I want to use this device to monitor one of my security cameras without interruption - unless I specifically ask the Echo Show 10 to do something else. Although there are a bunch of ""home screen"" settings where you can select whether you want a rotation of content (pictures, recipe ideas, news, ""suggested"" movies, social media drivel, etc.) to appear on the Alexa screen while it is awaiting your next command - in my case I don't want ANY of these things to interrupt my camera feed, so I turned them ALL off. Despite doing so, the device regularly stops the camera feed to display a ""things to try"" or ""things Alexa can do"" screen. REALLY ANNOYING and per my conversation with Amazon yesterday (10/11/23) there is no way to prevent the device from doing that. I find myself having to re-start my camera feed all day long. If you are contemplating using the Echo Show 10 to monitor a baby-cam, security cam, or some other static content display (e.g. bedside clock), just be aware that Amazon have decided that having Alexa tell you what else you should try is always more important than whatever else you have the Echo 10 doing. (At one point, there was a toggle to turn ""things to try"" off, but it didn't really work and that toggle disappeared a few weeks ago)
2) The integration with non-Amazon-branded smart home devices is still pretty weak and while I eventually got everything to a basic level of integration - it was a pain and took far too much troubleshooting. I recognize that integration requires coordinated action by the smart home device vendors and Amazon, but it needs to be much clearer what ""Alexa Enabled"" means. Often the integration is the absolute barest minimum (e.g. voice control to turn something on/off) and nothing more. As an example, my fancy AI security camera can tell me what it is seeing (a person, a car, a herd of buffalo, etc..) - the Echo Show 10 advertises a ""person detection"" announcement feature, but inexplicably when a person IS detected by my AI camera, instead of showing me the camera, it shuts OFF the video feed to display a text message - ""Person detected in driveway cam"" - Huh? And the Echo can't announce the car or anything else that the camera sees. Amazon should be pushing themselves and their ""Alexa Enabled"" partners aggressively towards the new ""Matter"" home automation integration standards to make it far easier to setup and clearer what capabilities you are really getting than at present.

Good luck!",3.0 out of 5 stars

RBrylawski,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2024","We've had one of the early Echo Shows for a few years now and while it was fine, it was starting to show its age, so it got moved to a bedroom and after looking at all the new models I chose the newest Echo Show 10 (3rd generation). It's quite an upgrade in every way.

The screen is bigger and high definition at 10.1"" and it follows you around as you move around, which for a kitchen application is great. I can be using the Echo Show while I'm cooking and moving from counter to counter and the screen stays with me.

One of the biggest advantages of this new Echo Show is the speaker. It's really a big speaker and the moving screen is mounted to the speaker. But the output of the speaker is quite remarkable and music actually sounds terrific on it. The speakers deliver realistic sound which is directional.

Like most of the Echo Shows, once you've set up one through the Alexa app on your iPhone, setup is a breeze. In fact, when you order this 3rd gen Echo Show, you answer some questions about your network at home and out of the box it basically sets itself up. Though, I must admit the first one we received wouldn't connect and Amazon immediately sent a replacement device, which did work.

You can use this for video calls and it even has a 13PM digital camera which you can use to take a selfie. You can integrate as many photos as you want to the display from your cell phone or Amazon Photos collection if you use Amazon Photos to store your pictures (we do, actually). You can open the app and see what's happening in your kitchen or speak to someone in the kitchen from anywhere. If you have a Ring Doorbell, you can just say Alexa, show me my Ring Doorbell. Or ask Alexa to pull up a recipe quickly if you need one. It's all just so easy to use.

The options to integrate things like your car, security system, smart devices, are pretty much endless and super easy to set up as well.

All in all, I couldn't be happier with my decision to move up to the Echo Show 10!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Andrea D. Wilson,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2023","I recently purchased the Echo Show 10 HD smart display from Amazon, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed. The Echo Show 10 delivers an outstanding audio experience that truly stands out. The sound quality is simply amazing, providing a rich audio experience that elevates your entertainment.

The picture quality on this smart display is top-notch as well. The HD display offers crisp and vibrant visuals, making it a pleasure to watch your favorite movies and shows. Whether you're streaming content or catching up on the news, the Echo Show 10's screen display ensures a fantastic viewing experience.

One of the standout features of the Echo Show 10 is its dynamic motion functionality. The fact that the display moves to follow you as you move around is a game-changer, especially during Alexa calls. This means that the person you're talking to can continue to see you as you go about your daily tasks, whether you're cooking, cleaning, or simply multitasking. It adds a whole new level of convenience and connection to your video calls.

While the dynamic motion feature is impressive, it's not always flawless. There are times when the motion can be a bit off, which can be a minor inconvenience. However, I'm optimistic that with future updates and improvements, this feature will become even better over time.

The Echo Show 10 also offers premium sound quality, allowing you to enjoy your music and content with exceptional clarity and depth. The combination of stunning visuals audio creates an all-encompassing entertainment experience that's truly top tier.

In addition to its audio and visual capabilities, the Echo Show 10 provides a versatile platform for doing more. You can effortlessly watch your favorite movies and shows, stay updated with the latest news, and access a wide range of Alexa skills that enhance your daily life.

Overall, the Echo Show 10 HD smart display is an incredible addition to any smart home setup. It offers outstanding sound and picture quality, and its dynamic motion feature makes it a standout device for video calls. While there's room for improvement in the motion aspect, the overall experience is highly satisfying. This device's premium sound and its ability to do so much more make it a worthwhile asset for anyone looking to enhance their home entertainment. You will not be disappointed.",4.0 out of 5 stars
daveinlaca,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2021","The idea of the Echo Show 10 is such a game changer, I was ready to make it the hub of my music and entertainment center at home. Echo already controls my television remote, my lights, and my spotify. With the Show, I was expecting it to do the same with photos and other features.

Unfortunately, nearly every feature I was excited about underdelivered.

Photo Booth
I was most excited about the idea of telling my show ""Alexa, take a picture"", have it find me and my friends and snap a selfie. What a great addition to parties! And while the camera has improved, the lighting adaptation has not. Most of the photos came out extremely average if the lighting wasn't perfect. The kind of quality I would have expected to post on my MySpace in 2006.

The other great addition was the ability to tell my Show, ""Alexa, take a video"". It did a good job of finding me, but every video has to end with you saying ""Alexa, stop video."" I called customer service, certain that there must be a gesture I could assign, or perhaps a way to set a time and have Alexa take a 10 second video. But no, after exploring all options like ""routines"" and ""IFTT"" every video has to end with you telling Alexa to stop.

There's also no way to get the photos and videos straight to your phone, so you're stuck waiting for it to upload to Amazon Photos, then going into your phone, opening Amazon Photos, finding what you want, then downloading, then editing the end of that video so it doesn't end with your stop command. Clunky and unnecessary when there are so many easy ways they could have programmed all this to work better.

MUSIC
I was excited about the lyrics feature on Amazon Music. They advertised ""Have your own karaoke night!"" But there are almost no karaoke songs on Amazon Music. They are plentiful on Spotify and other music services. A speaker with a screen makes karaoke such an obvious use, that it's shocking there's no way to do it. Either you can bring up the lyrics with the original song and vocals, or you can stream Spotify, but then the lyrics don't come up. Looked for third party solutions, but they were all just a few karaoke songs for small children. Another wasted opportunity.

SOUND
The sound was good. I was expecting it to be more like the Echo Studio with a screen, but the speaker is much smaller. Solid, but nothing that impressive. I ended up buying the Echo Sub to pair to it and that improved the sound greatly. Now my music sounds like a sound system...IF I STREAM FROM A SERVICE.

I write and produce music, so a lot of times I like to play my own music from my phone. To do that you need to pair your phone with your echo, at which point the echo acts just like a bluetooth speaker. That's fine, except now the Echo Sub no longer works, since that connects to your echo through bluetooth as well. So that great bassy sound I get with regular music isn't available for my own music if I play through my phone via iTunes or Soundcloud. Yet another opportunity missed.

YOUTUBE
YouTube...works. You access it through a web browser which is just clunky. The promise of a user friendly youtube playing all your videos and exploring and going down a youtube hole on a Friday night just doesn't work through the browser the way a dedicated app would.

FACES
It may not make sense to complain about a feature that isn't included that was never promised, but with echo having a screen, it seems like a logical step to create skins/faces that mimic what Alexa is saying. i picture a translucent face, like Snow White's mirror, or something cartoony. I'm surprised a third party developer wouldn't have made something like this available, and it would give the Show that much more of a personality.

Overall, I enjoy using the Echo Show 10. There seem to be a lot of kinks and falls short of its potential, but I knew that being an early adopter and purchasing the day it became available. And while most of these things are little frustrations, a big frustration is that only about a month after purchasing, Amazon has dropped the price $40, effectively punishing the early adopters for getting behind their product. That, along with my other issues, dropped my review from the five stars I wanted to give, down to the three I gave it.

Hope this helps others!",3.0 out of 5 stars
Nury Gonzalez,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2024","I have always liked in general all the Amazon brand products, but the electronics draw my attention, but much more in 2022 when I bought my Eco show, and I was happy with my purchase but even more in September 2023, on this date my kitchen stove exploded and the whole kitchen are got on fire, I always liked having my Echo show in the kitchen, I listen to music watch my shows see recipes a number of things while I cook or do the cleaning, that afternoon the firefighters arrived and they did what they do put the Fire off, now remember my Echo show had already received all the heat and on top of that the jet of water; the next day when we saw everything that had burned I remembered my speaker!!, and I thought oh my Echo burn, I cleaned it put it to the side after two days that I was going to put it in the trash, I realized that it didn't look so bad and I decided to plug it in and to my surprise it worked, almost a year after the fire it is still working, and with all this History the only thing I can say is that Echo show is EXCELLENT!!!!

My disappointment was not with the system but with the representatives when there’s an issue for repair even though a warranty was paid for. Contacted Amazon who only stated that they will send a new system and they will provide a return label. What they don’t tell you is that you must send the system back and a replacement is not on the way. You must wait until they receive your item and they will see if they can repair or replace it with a possibility it will be a refurbished item. There’s more to this issue that will be too long to explain. Just know you can get numerous representatives telling you different things. Totally disappointed in this awful process. Also even though you paid for the warranty there may be a $15 additional charge.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Colleen,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2023","Okay, I'm having fun with Alexa. This morning I said ""Alexa, goodbye"". She replied, ""Let's make like a volcano and blow this place"". I will greet her when I return, and she often has a witty reply. She wakes me up to music which starts playing low then gets louder and louder until I tell her I'm awake. The sound is amazing for such a little speaker. I can hear the ""thumping"" coming from my room when I walk down the hall. Drawbacks, I know there is so much I can do with her that I haven't learned and have had a hard time finding the features. Most I discover by looking at the screen. I just learned I can play Jeopardy and found out about a podcast. I have had her give me reminders at certain times. Such as, ""Colleen, you better start getting ready, you have company coming in an hour."" She created a playlist of my favorite songs, but when I ask her to show me my favorite playlist, she only shows me the first song I added to it. In the end, I've had it about a week and I love it. I just want to know what else I can do. -- UPDATE -- so I have had this a couple of months. I love almost everything about it, except I know there are a lot of things than can be done and finding information on that is difficult. For instance, it let me make an outgoing call, but I don't know how to assign a contact and when I called the person, I didn't know what number to give them to call back. My phone is crap, so this would be a great alternative when I'm home. The screen will show a feature, but when I want to get more information, it has changed to a different screen, and I don't know how to back up to review what it just showed me. I will ask Alexa to go back to last screen and she's confused, I will ask her to tell me about it, and she's confused. For instance, the screen flashed something about a ""Bot"" for cooking and DYI, I wanted to know more about it and couldn't get it back. Or something will flash, but I don't have time to see what it is and I don't know how to bookmark it. Like I said before, I know there are a lot more options out there to utilize, but it doesn't come with any sort of manual. I've gone to YouTube videos, etc.. but haven't find anything to help. Other than that, I love the product and would buy it again.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jay,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2023","Bought this on amazon prime day a few weeks ago. It is currently placed on a kitchen counter between the kitchen and living room in an open concept style house. Purchased mainly for the rotating feature that uses the camera to track the user as they walk around. This and the large screen have been great for working in the kitchen or asking about the weather from the living room. The downside of this feature is that below a certain level of light the device no longer moves the screen to follow you, displaying a message that says ""light level too low, movement disabled."" So at night if we don't have bright kitchen and dining room lights on, it doesn't move; and we largely keep those lights off when not in active use. In our home at night we noticed that just ambient light on from lamps in the room isn't enough for it to follow us. The device really needs something like an infrared sensor so it can work at night time like what Ring security cameras use for night vision. Adding this hardware would make this a must have product for your kitchen and bump this up to 5 stars. Other than that drawback, the included speaker, screen quality, and snappiness of the processor is better than past Eco Shows I've owned (still have the original echo show, 5 inch, and 8 inch models). As far as voice recognition it's the same as other models, although for the team working on Alexa it never understands the word ""closet."" We placed smart lighting in our closet, and she always replied with ""What device?"" and we'd have to yell ""closet"" a second time and it was hit or miss on the second attempt. Out of frustration we renamed the smart lighting to ""bathroom"" and that works 100% in turning on the lights in the closet, but that's been our only real issue with voice recognition.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Mark E Timperley,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2021","My first real Alexa enabled product, if you don't count my Kindle Fire... but more on that later.

First, I bought two Echo Show 10s, one for our kitchen and one for grandma. They were very easy to setup and have worked well so far (4 days in). I'm definitely impressed with the design and the quality of components, from the touch screen, buttons, motion and sound. All physical aspects are very well done. Do you need a screen that moves on its own? Yes! I can't imagine this product without motion. So far, we use the Echo Show 10 to ""drop in"" on grandma virtually, several times a day and every night for dinner. We love this ability! The Echo Show turns to whoever is speaking and zooms in on them, so she feels like she is right there with us and her grandchildren (not 25 feet away, outside a fish bowl). The best part of this technology is that Grandma didn't have to learn how to answer the ""video phone"", since it just connects when we want. In general, it works all by itself in her apartment (mostly) and we can control much of it remotely if needed. I do set and adjust reminders and alarms for her when needed, but beyond that we just ""drop in"" and say hello, whenever.

So that's the awesome part. We are discovering a few annoyances as we go, so I'll share one that is probably unique to this product: The process of adjusting and setting the range of motion is not well thought out. If you only ever did this once and then set the thing in cement, then maybe. But we set it on a counter and have already found that it must be moved for cleaning, to temporarily get it out of the way, or for use in another position. It takes about 4 minutes to reset... which is about 3.5 minutes too long for me. The other annoyances are all about ""Alexa"" so I'll mention them last.

Also, I've described a somewhat ideal grandma use case, so keep in mind that we only live 10 minutes from grandma and have had to drop by and ""fix Alexa"" (turned off, moved, lost wifi, screen rotated by hand) while she and visitors are getting used to it, so it's definitely not a set and forget type of technology, but I'm not going to reduce my rating because of that.

My rating would have been 5 stars, if it wasn't for Alexa herself and the somewhat puzzling UI design, menus, etc. Did I mention my Kindle Fire? Here's my point. You need one to control this thing and use many of the ""Alexa features"" with any level of certainty. You could also use a smartphone with the Alexa app, and we actually use both, but I find the Fire is a bit easier to use. This probably isn't news to someone who already has an Echo, but in case you are new to Alexa, using voice commands to find and select a book or other media for it to show or read by voice, to set a reminder, or just about anything beyond a few words, can be a terribly frustrating experience. It is amazing what it can do, but hopefully, engineers are still hard at work improving voice recognition and comprehension. Until then, my recommendation is to pair them. Echo Show 10 + Kindle Fire (with Alexa off on your Kindle) makes a great product together!

So Alexa, how do you spell frustrating? Her dutiful answer is ""F R U S T R A T I N G"" but also awesome, all at the same time. She doesn't get the joke yet... but given what she is capable of, why would she think I'm joking?",4.0 out of 5 stars

Roxie Muzic,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2021","Prior to this the household has the Gen 1 & 10"" Gen 2 Echo Shows, frankly I prefer the Gen 2 10"" Echo Show for most rooms over this model, but then...with firmware improvement/updates that opinion may change.

Other than the slight reduction in sound (I could care, I have multiple Sonos speakers) and screen resolution (as others have pointed out), the overriding feature of this iteration of Echo Show is the camera and 360 degree motion.

The camera is outstanding in resolution, very outstanding, worth the reduction in sound and screen resolution.

Motion however, needs work, the hardware used in this device to detect stability and motion needs serious firmware tweaking, way to sensitive, everything is ""unstable"", even the most stable. Understanding the need to be cautious, in that this slues around, to follow or view it's human or humans, however, ratchet the sensitivity down some to avoid the error messages that are unfounded when the device is on a stable, unimpeded full motion area. Currently if it even rocks a millimeter when turning, it throws the ""unstable"" error. I ordered two of these 10"" Gen 3 Echo Shows, both are behaving in this fashion. A little tweaking to the firmware of the device should solve this little sensitivity issue I would hope. This is not a game changer for me, this will be refined as customer feedback is received, or at least I have found that their development team is very responsive to these consumer observations. Kudos to them for that.

Next, that obnoxious, unnecessary screen of ""Alexa For Your Day"", for the love of every customer that you have, get rid of this, please, it is not a selling feature. Or, at least give us the option to have it show or not show in the Home Screen toggle switch section of the settings. It really is a ""bummer dude""...... if it keeps it up, it could be a game changer for me.

I can live with the HUGE time notification on the screen, I am old, but not blind, can we scale it down or have an option to scale it down, please, thank you. Not a game changer, but it is quite large you must admit...

All in all for the kitchen or the main floor/office in houses this is a great device, allows camera viewing 360 degrees, great idea for those who do not have indoor cameras already and as an adjunct for those of us who do. Have not used it for recipes in the kitchen yet, but I suspect that this will be a vast improvement over the Gen 2 10"" Echo Show, in that it will follow me in my meandering attempt to cook (hopefully it will not catch me crying on the kitchen floor over cooking fiascos). Phone calls to other Echo Show owners should be improved as I meander when talking to folks as well... I believe as the feedback rolls in, there will be improvements to screen data that pops up uninvited (please, pretty please), and the motion sensitivity concerns.

I am pleased with this purchase, but most likely will replace the rest of my Gen 1 Echos with Gen 2 10"" Echo Shows, this model has limited placement criteria and may not be the best Echo for every spot in the house. I will purchase one additional 10"" Gen 3 Echo Show for my office, but for bedrooms the Gen 2 10"" Echo Show should be sufficient.

Peter Susi,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2023","--- UPDATE: (8/1) I received a call claiming to be from Amazon about my review, but the first thing they wanted me to do was confirm my name and account info - MAJOR RED FLAG. I declined, and asked for details and the caller hung up. However, I got a follow-up email from Amazon customer service that mentioned the phone call, and sought to ""help resolve the issues you’ve encountered and gather any additional feedback"". Unfortunately, that email included no information addressing any of the issues below. As far as I can tell the CS agent read neither my review, nor Amazon's public statements warning users not to disclose account information to callers from unknown numbers. -----

***What I wanted:***

A ""third screen"" organizer that could show me a dashboard of calendar entries, weather, to do, etc. Maybe something like THE PICTURES THEY USE TO ADVERTISE IT (See Pic #2 - ""Taylor's Birthday"" displayed next to weather, a podcast, and the time). Also, a screen to play YouTube or Twitch videos as I putter on something else.

***What I got:***

- Home screen is ONLY a rotating set of cards. You have no other options. There is no dashboard style option, no quick launch (you can use ""Tap to Alexa"" as a really mediocre one, kinda). The assumption is that in a world of touchscreens you must only want to shout at your devices.
- The Home screen is not even in your control. You can add pictures, and turn off some things, but Amazon will also randomly add whatever nonsense they think you want. You cannot adjust the rotation speed. Heck, you can't even make the clock overlay bigger.
- You cannot add utility to this home screen. You can't add widgets (they only live on a slide-out panel, and that closes after 10s). You can't adjust how the time and weather are displayed, or set the calendar slide to show things in a useful view. You can't add a big easy ""Open my YouTube Playlist"" button. You get pictures, ads, and gimmicks - end of list.
- That dashboard view (""Taylor's Birthday"") from Amazon's promotional materials - THIS DEVICE DOESN'T DO THAT
- You can technically watch YouTube, eventually. That is until it crashes. Because you need to use Silk, since they didn't include an app for the #2 site on the internet. (Actually, this runs on Android so they REMOVED that stock functionality)
- You can Technically view Twitch, in that the website loads for a few minutes. But you cannot login or use chat because Twitch.tv does not support the Silk browser. Yes, they are both owned by Amazon.
- The screen follows you around the room, or your dog, or any noise, or no noise. It also tries to follow you while you're using the touch screen so you end up chasing it back and forth.
- Interacting with this thing is so SLOOOOOW - How is a new device this underpowered?
- Sure, it does Video calls... which I don't care about because I already have a phone and I spend all day on MS Teams.
- Technically it has Follow-along recipes... No, not the recipes I have on my phone, or the one I found online. There's no way to share a link to this thing, and If I find a video on YouTube, I can't really even watch it.

This isn't even the nitpicky stuff, like when my headphones power off at 2 AM Alexa insists that we all wake up and hear about it, and there's no way to disable it.

Once you get past the gimmick turntable base, this thing is slow, unresponsive, buggy, and very limited in functionality. It is the epitome of ""Technically does what we promised, but not the way you probably want it to, or very well at all"".

Most of the ""Skills"" (Apps) are slower than just taking your phone out of your pocket. ""Is it going to rain?""
Option A: Look at your phone: picture of rain clouds on the weather widget - 2 seconds.
Option B: Ask Alexa - ""Right now in your area it's 64 degrees and partly cloudy with light wind..."" only after slowly describing what can be seen out of any window will she tell you if it's going to rain. And that's *only* if she heard you correctly! There's a good chance you'll get ""Shuffling songs by the Weatherman and similar artists, on Amazon Music"" instead.

Despite being built on an android OS, so much basic functionality has been stripped out of this thing it's infuriating.

Priscilla,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2023","Love the size and the look; However, compared to its sister products I own it is very hard to navigate. 1) I find myself constantly repeating the commands over and over as ""Alexa"" doesn't know that or a lot of ""Hmmmms"" very frustrating; 2) I primarily purchased this to watch TV in the kitchen - well that doesn't seem to be working well either; for starters I cannot download the apps I have on my firestick so that's annoying (please help if avail in this area); if you do actually get to watch content and want to ""pause"" forget asking her via voice she has no clue how to do this, so, I pause manually (usually with my hands full of dirty gloves which also is a pain) so, now we have it paused for a little bit - the screen goes to screensaver mode and the content goes Into the black hole and I cannot retrieve it again or if I'm lucky to retrieve it it is no longer paused and I have to watch from the beginning!!! Super annoying! This is one of the most costly items in the Amazon line and for that reason alone I wish it would work as it's beloved firestick; firetv or even the echo!!! As I have zero issues with these products. I find myself extremely frustrated every time I try to operate this product and it doesn't seem to be getting better after I have watched and tried dozens of ""how to's"" ; it just seems limited, sensitive and honorary to me and my needs - unless I am not using it as it's intended purpose.

nadanix,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","I will give my 5 cents to this device. The unboxing experience is uneventful, however a warning here: You do need a smartphone or tablet to be setup with Alexa or this will not work. That is nowhere mentioned in the advertisement. The Alexa software is by far one of the worst I have seen in years. There is no real menu, you have to scroll through pages and pages of stuff, cluttered with things that are not helpful and confusing. Pictures and advertisement do not belong in a menu. The structure again, horrific.
Neither on the Alexa app or on the device itself is a home screen where you see all your apps.
It’s a cluster of menus, very hard to navigate.
Now, to our device. The first thing I turned off was motion. The screen does a lousy job following you and always seems to be angled off. Even when you turn motion off, every time you hit the screen to use a menu, the screen will bounce around and you need two hands. One to hold the screen and one to use the menu. The touchscreen is very unresponsive and often needs multiple touches to respond. There is a lot of glare coming from the display as well
The sound is good (not great) for a small device and you can pair Apple Music if you don’t want use Amazon Music. Warning: This device is not Airplay compatible, so it will not work in a multi-room setting in the Apple ecosystem. You can stream directly or from your phone via Bluetooth, to a single device. If you have a TuneIn Radio account you can stream from that, but I have not figured out yet how you play your favorites. The Echo will respond to stuff like “play NPR Radio on TuneIn” This device has no way to create or view playlists or use existing playlists in Apple Music.
The amount of consent you have to give to let the Echo read your calendar in your email account is worrisome. I decided against it because exposing your email account to Amazon simply is not my cup of tea. The build in web browser needs work. It is super-slow and will just stop working for no reason. I have the Echo now 2days and had multiple occurrences of freezing screens and the entire Echo going dark. This also happened to me in Food Network.
I turned on the news and when I came back to the kitchen 10 minutes later, the screen is dark. It simply stops, without command. The “try Alexa” feature is a nagging unstoppable insult and can get you mad enough to go the psych ward. No matter what, you cannot turn it off fully.
So after careful consideration and two days of use I decided to keep it a couple more days and wait for a software update. Amazon do you hear me? Add an option to turn off “try Alexa”. Give this thing a real menu. If not, you will get it back before the end of next week.
Edit: Now, on day three, it starts to just turn off. There is no setting to prevent that. Alexa is tired and goes to sleep. I am tired too and today Echo goes home to Amazon.",1.0 out of 5 stars

J,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023","We're approaching the two year mark with the Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) in our kitchen and as such it has been used heavily. We've tinkered around with just about every bell and whistle that is available on it. Ultimately, we've decided that it is just a poor design across the board and consequently a frustrating user experience.

Honestly, most of these ""bells and whistles"" really aren't something anyone would make use of other than to ""try them out"" once as we've done. The news and sports widgets may interest you, but I feel like we are drowning in those two types of widgets on every screen we encounter these days; phone, watch, PC, work laptop, home laptop, tablet, TV. I feel like I have enough news, weather, and sports widgets to last me a lifetime at this point.

We ended up disabling everything except the rotating photos, so it's nothing more than a glorified digital photo frame for us. It's decent for that, but frankly the majority of digital photo frames out there will do a better job. Just stick an Echo Dot next nearby for Alexa...

As far as the lackluster photo experience, for example, you can't make it default to photo frame mode, or even force it to stay in that mode for an extend period of time. It always ends up back at the home screen after awhile. So, if you set it up to do so, you end up with rotating Amazon Photos photos on the ""home screen"" which you get forced to. The home screen photos are decent but, just like everything else in the Echo Show, still feels buggy and clunky. When you set a 10 second or 30 second photo rotation (or whatever) it definitely doesn't follow that setting. Sometimes it will hang on a photo for several minutes, other times it will rotate in 10 seconds. It feels like that setting is for Photo Frame mode, which (as mentioned) is essentially a useless feature, since it does not stay persistent.

Another drawback while being forced into the home screen for making it a digital photo frame is the clock/date are in the bottom left hand corner, and they are absolutely massive. They cannot be adjusted or disabled, as most everything else on the device... very little customization options. We have like 700 clocks in our kitchen, and would totally be fine with disabling the Echo Show clock... Often it will rotate to a photo and then the focal point of the photo ends up blocked by the huge clock. This happens a lot to us because we end up taking family selfies, and (having the longest arms currently) I normally take them, so I end up in the upper right of the photo, with the wife more towards the left, and then the kids in the bottom left... so, the huge clock cuts the kids out of the picture and most of the time half of my wife gets cut. That clock really does wreck a ton of photos, family selfies or not. Long story short the photo experience is decent, but there are way better options/devices out there, especially since the other options will integrate with other services such as Apple or Google photos, but with the Echo Show you are forced into Amazon Photos which is severely lackluster compared to the ""other two""...

Aside from the photos I have no idea why anyone would like this device, let alone rate it 5 stars. The speaker looks like it should be awesome, but it's also lackluster. The hardware just kinda sucks... it is quite sluggish in terms of performance.

We do have Spotify integration set up and do also use that a bit just because my kids play music on alexa in general a lot... but, if you have read this far, then it's not going to be a shocker when you hear we feel the Echo Spotify app is a clunky, sluggish, and just overall lackluster experience when compared to the Apple, Android, PC, Mac, and Web Spotify apps.

It seems like it could be great for video calls. We did try that some when I was traveling for work and it's just too sluggish and clunky, we always ended up flipping over to our phones. Also forget the ""follow me"" screen rotation mode thing, it sounds cool, but works like garbage. Same with streaming videos in general, just doesn't work well, I'd rather just use a small phone.

All of that said, having a digital alexa photo frame is decent enough... These things aren't too pricey, especially when you catch them during Amazon's big sales...

But.... the two straws which broke the camel's back, and makes me want to go office space this thing, are:

a) Our family loves shopping on Amazon, we spend a disgusting amount on Amazon every year, so take this point for what it is... but in pure slime ball fashion Amazon forces advertisements on the screen which pop up periodically trying to get you to buy random stuff. Sometimes, this stuff may not even be something you'd like advertised to your kids or guests. There is absolutely no way to disable these ads. So they charge you 100 to 300 bucks for something like this, and force their ads on to you. That in and of itself should be a hard stop for anyone considering one of these.

b) I'm not sure how this next point is working behind the scenes over there at Amazon, but it appears that any new or updated feature forces itself to be turned on (even after previously disabling it). This is a regular occurance. Like I said we've literally disabled everything, but things just pop up out of nowhere, or are periodically turned back on, such as news, sports, joke of the day, etc etc. And nope, it's not my kids messing with it, they can't even reach it.

TTLD;, the Echo Show 10 kinda sucks, part due to hardware issues, but bigger part due to software issues, which leads me to believe whatever version comes next will also suck. That said, 45,458 reviews as of this post, and 4.5 stars... so the masses appear to love this big weird clunky rotating wonky crappy weak sauce robot tablet... :D",1.0 out of 5 stars
J. Fernandez,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","First the camera is offset, so the screen is always offset when it follow you, that is when it does actually follow you, because more than half of the time it does not, and God forbid you try to touch the monitor, because it will constantly tell you the screen has bumped into something... It has way too many bugs in the software ... I am not at all impressed with this update, because it doesn't seem like a lot of thought went into this model!

BUT ... My biggest gripe has to do with the electrical cord, it is way too short, and plugs into the bottom of the base, which is also insanely difficult to reach without the monitor swinging all around, and good forbid you have to unplug it for any reason, because it will constantly make you put in your password over and over!

I am sorry, but this update is a big fail! It is definitely not ready for consumers! They really should have worked out the bugs before releasing it to the public! This unit truly seems like it should be in beta testing still, because it has way too many issues that need to be addressed!

Update: The advertisement makes it look as if you can use the device to scan one’s surroundings, when not at home, but what only the small print reveals, which most people will miss, that it only does this FOR A PRICE AND with a SUBSCRIPTION to HOME GUARD plus!

At $250, this should have been included, at least for a year, free of charge! I bought this believing I could scan a room, from my mobile device, only to find out ... you can’t, NOT EVEN WHEN YOU ARE AT HOME! Really Amazon, you couldn’t include that at least for a year free! As a prime member, for many years, I find this totally unacceptable, from a billion dollar company, that is charging way too much for this device! Do yourself a favor and wait until Amazon addresses the many issues and bugs this device does have at the present time!

Xtra, And apparently there is no way to pair the Amazon Remote in the software! I have search high and low for a way to pair my remote, but the option is no longer in the settings on the device or app!

After several months of owning this device I can say with all honesty it is the WORST device and echo show I have EVER owned!, along with the new Echo, Amazon has me truly believing it is time to cancel all my Amazon accounts, because the majority of their devices don’t work like they claim! If I have to yell one more command to turn play a show on Hulu and Netflix only to told you cannot play HULU or NETFLIX on this device, I will start looking for devices that actually do ….

Peter Susi,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2023","--- UPDATE: (8/1) I received a call claiming to be from Amazon about my review, but the first thing they wanted me to do was confirm my name and account info - MAJOR RED FLAG. I declined, and asked for details and the caller hung up. However, I got a follow-up email from Amazon customer service that mentioned the phone call, and sought to ""help resolve the issues you’ve encountered and gather any additional feedback"". Unfortunately, that email included no information addressing any of the issues below. As far as I can tell the CS agent read neither my review, nor Amazon's public statements warning users not to disclose account information to callers from unknown numbers. -----

***What I wanted:***

A ""third screen"" organizer that could show me a dashboard of calendar entries, weather, to do, etc. Maybe something like THE PICTURES THEY USE TO ADVERTISE IT (See Pic #2 - ""Taylor's Birthday"" displayed next to weather, a podcast, and the time). Also, a screen to play YouTube or Twitch videos as I putter on something else.

***What I got:***

- Home screen is ONLY a rotating set of cards. You have no other options. There is no dashboard style option, no quick launch (you can use ""Tap to Alexa"" as a really mediocre one, kinda). The assumption is that in a world of touchscreens you must only want to shout at your devices.
- The Home screen is not even in your control. You can add pictures, and turn off some things, but Amazon will also randomly add whatever nonsense they think you want. You cannot adjust the rotation speed. Heck, you can't even make the clock overlay bigger.
- You cannot add utility to this home screen. You can't add widgets (they only live on a slide-out panel, and that closes after 10s). You can't adjust how the time and weather are displayed, or set the calendar slide to show things in a useful view. You can't add a big easy ""Open my YouTube Playlist"" button. You get pictures, ads, and gimmicks - end of list.
- That dashboard view (""Taylor's Birthday"") from Amazon's promotional materials - THIS DEVICE DOESN'T DO THAT
- You can technically watch YouTube, eventually. That is until it crashes. Because you need to use Silk, since they didn't include an app for the #2 site on the internet. (Actually, this runs on Android so they REMOVED that stock functionality)
- You can Technically view Twitch, in that the website loads for a few minutes. But you cannot login or use chat because Twitch.tv does not support the Silk browser. Yes, they are both owned by Amazon.
- The screen follows you around the room, or your dog, or any noise, or no noise. It also tries to follow you while you're using the touch screen so you end up chasing it back and forth.
- Interacting with this thing is so SLOOOOOW - How is a new device this underpowered?
- Sure, it does Video calls... which I don't care about because I already have a phone and I spend all day on MS Teams.
- Technically it has Follow-along recipes... No, not the recipes I have on my phone, or the one I found online. There's no way to share a link to this thing, and If I find a video on YouTube, I can't really even watch it.

This isn't even the nitpicky stuff, like when my headphones power off at 2 AM Alexa insists that we all wake up and hear about it, and there's no way to disable it.

Once you get past the gimmick turntable base, this thing is slow, unresponsive, buggy, and very limited in functionality. It is the epitome of ""Technically does what we promised, but not the way you probably want it to, or very well at all"".

Most of the ""Skills"" (Apps) are slower than just taking your phone out of your pocket. ""Is it going to rain?""
Option A: Look at your phone: picture of rain clouds on the weather widget - 2 seconds.
Option B: Ask Alexa - ""Right now in your area it's 64 degrees and partly cloudy with light wind..."" only after slowly describing what can be seen out of any window will she tell you if it's going to rain. And that's *only* if she heard you correctly! There's a good chance you'll get ""Shuffling songs by the Weatherman and similar artists, on Amazon Music"" instead.

Despite being built on an android OS, so much basic functionality has been stripped out of this thing it's infuriating. I can get apps on my WATCH that are easier to use and faster than the barely functional ""Skills"" I can occasionally find from 3rd parties since there is almost no support for this thing. Everything I figure should work out of the box requires sideloading something to connect to IFTTT so I can get another device to do the actual work. Heck, even YouTube - most sites tell you that ""You can make YouTube music work, just Bluetooth connect your phone to the echo!"" because the Echo refuses to run anything that isn't some gimmicky ""Read me my email slowly"" or ""display rotating pictures"" nonsense.

JButters,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2022","I've owned a few of these through the generations of them, starting with the first Echo Show. The concept was great, I could do cool quirky things no one would think to do and in general I've been an amazon fan boy so Ive owned a bit of the tech.
I've owned the Echo Show 10 for about a year now so I'll start with the pros.
It has a nice screen, you can watch TV from it which is cool so it acts like a mini TV for me and my primary use for the screen has always been a nice digital photo display (amazon photos) with the forecast and weather alerts. The first few generations of the show line of products did those very well. Sound was great and when they made it to where you could sync your devices for a music party it was awesome.
This device has good sound to it and the video is nice for two way viewing.
The motion on it is a little wonky in my opinion and I've kept it off most of the time. It usually goes to far for the motion in either direction and is a pain sometimes to get it to center back. Easy fix because I personally dont need it to follow me so I turned the motion off and just stuck it in a particular direction. Its voice detection is ok at best. Sometimes it does well, others not so much.

Now for the cons (which is why I am writing this review).
Just about every month amazon adds a new feature to these devices and by default turns it on. I walk by one day and its giving me some display about how my day can go. Cant turn that feature off, but most others I have to go in and find out to turn it off. Walk by another month, its giving me suggesting recipes. Walk by a month later, its telling me things I should by. Walk by another month, its telling me people in my area have covid. What is absolutely annoying is I have to go in and turn each of these off every month and when they include it they turn it on by default.
I want something simple - to display my photos, display the forecast and my calendar and for voice control of smart devices. That is it. With all of these features I find less photos are more junk.
What is about to set me over the edge for these devices completely are the ads. Now these devices show me ads for movies - of which from what I have read (and I cant find it myself) you cannot turn off. Some might say - its just a few ads get over it. But I see them every few minutes - and here's the problem: I pay for the service (amazon prime and all that jazz) and I paid 250 for the device. Why would I be seeing ads??? Pay for the service and the device and they still give ads. That and to me its in my house - thats already an area that is supposed to be sacred where we allow what comes in and out of our house. We give up a lot letting these things in as it is. I didnt pay 250 and for prime for a device to show me ads.

Amazon needs to change their model quick or a number of people are going to dump these. Im already thinking of going back to the echo dots. Having a screen at this point isnt worth it if I cant control whats on it.

UPDATE Dec 2022
Amazon reached out based on 1 star feedback with general PR emails (nothing really accomplished beyond pretending to care). Not only do the ads still continue, but they have doubled down with adding sponsored content. This content allows you to hide a particular sponsored piece or submit feedback (like clicking the hide this ad on youtube or facebook). Two minutes later you see a different sponsored content.
If youve ever seen Futurama where everyone got a chip with ads getting sent to them - Amazon is bridging that gap. They truly have capitalized on ad content to bring it inside your home. I also get to see it on my FireTV which I ignore and doesnt bug me as much, but seriously its getting bad.
Im downsizing my Amazon device list on anything that has a screen at this point. I have a few Echo Shows and I am getting rid of some. I will no longer buy an Amazon device with a screen until they stop bringing ad content into the home - which by not having them I will probably never know when that will be. Ive already removed devices I was planning to purchase off of my list.

I can see why the Amazon device department is failing and I doubt it will improve anytime soon.",1.0 out of 5 stars
JAM,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2024","I was very excited to get this unboxed and set up. After running though the startup process and a 10 minute update, everything was ready to go. That’s when the screen just started flipping though ads for Amazon products. I went into settings and turned off nearly every feature (other than the weather report) and basically made it into an overpriced digital frame and I’m still getting ads! I went online and it’s a common complaint. There’s no way to get rid of all the ads. Amazon should be paying us to be putting an Amazon billboard in our homes instead of charging us.

Update: After hours, and I mean HOURS of my life spent on the phone with Amazon customer service reps trying to get rid of the ads - none of whom seemed to have received the same training, because I got a different story every time - I was shipped a replacement Show on the grounds that the ads must be the result of a hardware failure. I know what you’re thinking and no, that didn’t make sense to me either.

The replacement was malfunctioning right out of the box, but with determined stubbornness, I was able to get it up and running. Turns out, the ads were still showing up so I called customer service again. At this point I politely asked if it were possible to speak with anyone who actually knows how these devices work, so as to save everyone’s time. I was told that all the agents are trained on how the devices work. When I presented my case to the contrary, I was again told that all agents know how the devices work and that in any event, there is no way to get rid of the ads.

At this point, I took a deep breath and politely explained how nice it would have been if that had been communicated on the product page or, at the very least, by ANY of the many reps I had spoken with prior. She apologized and said she’d pass along my feedback. Most assuredly, Mr. Bezos had a hard time getting to sleep that night after reading the notes from my call.

The final chapter in this trial of errors is that I ended up having to pay for the return of one of the two Shows. Good joke, jerks.",1.0 out of 5 stars
BeccaM,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2021","Editing May 2024: The device just keeps getting worse and worse. I just wanted a simple static display showing a single photo, the clock and weather. Instead, every 10 seconds or so, the screen keeps refreshing, meaning there's no way I can keep this thing on my desk anymore because it's a constantly shifting and infuriating distraction. I have everything turned off in the homescreen settings, but it makes no difference. In essence, Amazon took a product that mostly worked and now it's nothing but an eye-distracting advertising spam generator. A shame, because warts aside, if it didn't do these things (ads, constantly refreshing), I'd consider it a useful device, warts and all.

Editing June 2023, and dropping from 3 star recommendation to 1 star: About 8mo ago, Amazon decided to turn Echo Show devices into a non-stop advertising platform. Even when you tell it to hide a particular ad, a month later it will be back. Or if you have multiple Show units, it'll appear on one of them. Even when you say an ad is personally offensive, it won't hide it from view. I didn't sign up for this. We have five Show devices in our house and at any given time, one of them will be pushing an ad for Jeopardy or a 3rd party skill or some Prime movie we don't want to see. There is no way to disable the ads, and believe me, we have tried. I can no longer recommend this product.

Stick with an Alexa-enabled smart-speaker if you want Alexa services if you don't want to be bothered with annoying ads.

Editing in mid-December 2021 for further details, six months later: I really wanted to like the Echo Show 10 smart display with motion, but I finally gave up and went back to the earlier gen Echo Show 10 (Gen 2) I owned for one important reason: The newer Echo Show simply could not hear me properly. Over and over and over, I would ask it to turn on the lights in my office using a routine, and it would insist on trying to present me with various Skills it had identified or just play some random piece of music. The older Echo Show? Never got my commands wrong. Never mis-heard me. At first, I thought it was because I like having a floor fan running during hotter months, but here we are in the winter, no fan, and I still could not just the newer Echo to hear me right. ""Echo, turn on evening lights."" ""Hmm... here are some skills I've identified..."" ""No! Turn on evening lights!"" ""Hmm... here are some skills I've identified..."" ""TURN ON EVENING LIGHTS!"" ""Here's 'Friday Night Lights,' on Amazon Prime video.""

Anyway, I hope they fix this, because other than as a display, this newer model is useless.

Previous review: Like many, many reviewers here, my top #1 complaint about the new Echo Show 10 w/Motion is the fact we cannot disable ""Alexa For Your Day"" and even setting a background image not to rotate doesn't stop the home screen from shifting and changing constantly.

I keep my Echo device on my home office work desk, and what in Gen 2 was a nice, always there display has become an irritating corner-of-my-eye distraction.

Yes, the screen is very nice. Yes, the sound is quite good (although Gen 2 sound was also pretty decent). I like the motion feature—it's really quite neat. I like that they've put a physical camera shutter control on this new model. I like that the onscreen clock seems most of the time now to default to a larger clock in the lower left corner of the display.

But I absolutely loathe the Alexa For Your Day feature. It does not tell me anything I don't already know about Echo devices or Alexa's capabilities. If I'd known there not only was no way to turn it off, but that months later, nothing will have been done about it, I probably would've stuck with my Gen 2 Echo Show 10...and frankly, might go ahead and swap it back, at least on my desk. (Unless a software update is going to ruin that, too?) Maybe put this new one somewhere where it isn't a constant irritating distraction, unless or until Amazon decided to listen to us and let us disable the feature or limit it severely to how often it's allowed to show.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Raoul Duke online shopper,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2021","Update: second one that has stopped working. This last one only worked 7 months then stopped connecting to internet. I have two echo shows now that won't connect to wifi so they can't complete any tasks. None of my other amazon or smart devices have any issues with my wifi

I have been waiting for the release of this device for since Amazon started advertising it over the summer. I had an echo show 8 in my living room. I was drawn to the fact that I could use it remotely to view the rooms in my house. So I ordered it adding it to my 5 other devices. I moved the echo show 8 to basement and put this new echo show in living room. I placed it in a location where it would swivel and be able to veiw the living room, dining room and kitchen.

Remote viewing: When remote viewing it defaults to a smaller image in the portrait mode of the app. You have to click an icon in corner to get it do landscape and show a larger image. You then swipe to move the screen/cam around to view areas. The problem is you have to swipe, not continuous drag. So it only moves about 30 degrees at a time and goes all blurry when it moves. You cannot just pan in a continuous motion with a clear vision of the surrounding areas. Also your options for angling the screen are straight forward slightly upward or upwards. No way to point it a little lower. The worst part is while remote viewing there is a message displayed on the screen that states something similar to "" a member of your family is remote viewing"" with a stop button to turn it off. So if a burglar is in your house while you are away and you are trying to use remote viewing to see what is happening (major selling feature of device) the burglar can just push the stop button on the screen and turn off your remote viewing. Also I have 1000 mbps internet (not a lot of bandwith being used) and it takes a good 20 seconds for the image to load when remote viewing with this echo show.

Motion: I have it set up to follow me all the time through all activities. With the location I am walking around it in multiple directions from multiple distances. It only picks you up and follows you on random occasions. During set up you determine the range of motion and idle position for camera. The problem is once it stops following you or you stop remote viewing it does not return to the idle position, it just stays where it last was. I have not found a button or command to get it to return to the home or idle position. This if probably one of the most annoying issues, it just stopping facing random directions.

Sound: the sound is pretty decent, the same as it would be with an echo. Better than the previous models of echo show with the smaller speakers. I am satisfied with the sound.

Screen: the screen has a nice image. But it constantly transitions between background scenes (you get to choose limited options), advertisements, weather, etc. But when it transitions, it goes dark for about 1-2 seconds. Definitely seems like a slower transition than my other echo shows leaving more blank screen time.

Cord: yes it comes with a white cord which is lame, probably to save cost on production. honestly I am not that annoyed with that compared to other issues.

Overall I have been anxiously anticipating purchasing this for months since they started advertising it over the summer. It is my sixth echo device, so I am an amazon loyal customer and fan of devices. My main purpose of purchasing this (since I already had to show 8 devices) was to be able to remote view and keep an eye on my house when gone. With the glitchy issues stated above I am more that disappointed and considering returning it.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Darshana,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","As an IT professional with over 14 years of experience, I am well-versed in using various devices and maximizing their utility. Additionally, I am a smart home owner with multiple smart devices connected primarily through Alexa. Allow me to share my background before diving into my product review.

My experience with this particular device has been incredibly frustrating. As a fan of Alexa devices, I own several of them and have even recommended them to others. However, this specific device, the Alexa Echo 10, has left me disappointed. Since 2021, it has failed to deliver much beyond its large screen.

The device does serve some purposes, such as displaying photo slideshows, weather alerts, time, and calendars. Its impressive speaker quality produces pleasant sounds. However, the lack of support from the internet community and Alexa’s official channels is concerning. Perhaps the limited user base or its cost contributes to this lack of attention.

Recently, the device stopped working with Bluetooth. After updating to its latest Fire OS version (7.5.6.2), none of my devices could connect. I attempted pairing with various models of Apple iPhones, MacBook Pros, Windows 13th generation laptops, and older devices, but none were discoverable. Interestingly, the Echo 10 could detect Samsung TVs, yet connecting to them remained impossible. Neither voice commands nor manual settings via Bluetooth or the mobile app resolved the issue.

Another limitation is its inability to connect to 2.5GHz Wi-Fi networks. It only communicates with 5GHz networks. While I’m uncertain if this is specific to my router, my other Alexa devices have no trouble connecting to 2.5GHz networks.

I reached out to Alexa product support, but unfortunately, they were clueless about this error. When I inquired about rolling back to a previous Fire OS version, they informed me that it was not possible. In contrast, my Echo Show 5, running Fire OS 6.xx, has no connectivity issues and works seamlessly with both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

In summary, the Echo 10’s problems likely stem from device drivers. Fire OS 7.5.6.2 appears to lack proper firmware updates to fully support its hardware. Despite its larger screen, the Echo 10 offers little beyond what the Echo Show 5 provides. If you’re considering purchasing this device, be aware of its limitations. It’s essential to weigh its features against its drawbacks before making a decision.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Rachel N.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2024","I know I had previously written a review for this, but it appears to be gone. Curiously, after writing the review complaining about how many ads were on it, all ads on my device disappeared for several months. Unfortunately, they're now back with a vengeance.

This device is otherwise neat. It has a good quality speaker that's large, and I like that it has the screen for watching news stories and recipes. I might use it to watch streaming videos from my kitchen too, except I already have a small TV in my kitchen for that purpose.

One other reason I bought this was so that I could check in on my dog while away, with the Echo's camera. Unfortunately, that doesn't work if your phone isn't connected to wifi. The phone looks like it is talking to the echo, and the echo will say someone is watching, but no video plays on the phone, it's just black. I have good unlimited 5G cell service, and there's no setting on the echo or in my Alexa app to tell it I am fine streaming video without wifi. If I tether my phone to my husband's phone, so my phone thinks it's on Wi-Fi, only then can I see video from my Echo. Clearly, if the idea is to check in on your home while you're out, not being able to do it over cellar data makes it nearly pointless.

But it's the barrage of ads all day long in my living room that makes me dislike this thing. Every few minutes, it's an ad, and there's no way to opt out of them, not even for a fee. I will never buy another Echo Show again, because of the intrusive ads.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Mountain Man,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2022","Play Video
Update video below as now it’s multiple sponsored adds in a row with only a picture or two from my photos once in awhile.

These devices had great potential but Amazon is missing the opportunity by forcing ads onto the users. I recently got two sponsored ads back to back in the rotation of the options that I have enabled. I’ve basically removed/unticked most of the options this device can provide in hopes to lower the number of forced “cards” or sponsored ads. Obviously this didn’t work but it decreases the usability of the device. After spending 30 minutes talking to the tech support they informed me they will continue with the sponsored adds and “cards” (Alexa for your day) for the foreseeable future. Since this is being forced upon the customer after they have paid for the device AND there is no mention or disclosure of this in the sales page I can see a class action or the Consumer Protection Agency getting involved at some point. As far as the forced sponsored add I see major problems with them as one of mine was about a movie called “Puss in Boots”. Who puts a cat into boots. That’s terribly embarrassing and even offensive. Not really but I’m sure you can see my point. What Amazon deems passable to display on an individual’s screen without their consent is setting themselves up for problems down the road.

The device performs poorly in dimly lit rooms in that it won’t rotate. It has a hard time connecting to and it will not stay connected to the Blink or Eufy security cameras even with a strong WiFi signal. The two Blink cameras I have are stored in a junk drawer as a result. Thanks Amazon for selling us junk. The screen on all these devices flicker with a burst of light to get my attention making me think there’s something wrong with it but as soon as I look at it there’s a sponsored ad. It’s time to unplug these devices and put them up for sale.

The tech department has gone downhill and fast and I even read reports that they are reducing the number of staff that they do have. That’s unfortunate for us as a consumer but hey as long as Amazon makes it’s $ right?
A couple of days ago I asked Alexa to send one of two Roombas on a cleaning mission. “Alexa, tell the upstairs Roomba to vacuum everywhere”. It sends the downstairs Roomba on a mission two times in a row. I change their names to Roomba one and Roomba two hoping this would solve the problem but it didn’t work. Back to the app to initiate the cleaning cycles.
When Alexa hears me it responds in a different room even when I’m sitting right next to the device I prefer the response from.
If I were the paranoid type I’d think somebody in the tech department was just doing these things to have something to do or to poke fun.
It’s time to start digging deeper into finding a better voice assistant. I just wish amazon would revamp this system as I’ve invested a ton of money and time into my smart home over the years.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Quin,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023","I had hopes of adding this Hiseeu camera with an Echo Show for security purposes but both devices are totally disappointing. Unfortunately, these devices require a 2.4Ghz WiFi configuration. I could normally accept that condition, but I discovered that these devices also have a limited password vocabulary and cannot use any special characters in the password for their WiFi connection! So here I am trying to increase our security, but these devices crush that idea by supporting only simple password strings. I had to change my 2.4Ghz router password to meet their limitations. After setting up the camera and mounting above our front door, we discovered that the video to the Echo is consistently 5 seconds or more delayed. That won’t be very effective when an intruder is standing at your front door. They could smash the door open before they would even show up on the Echo Show display. In addition, the video shown on the Echo Show says “buffering” every 2 or 3 seconds! We have high speed internet here with typical down load speeds over 300Mbs connected to a high speed router. Most 2.4Ghz WiFi signals can support up to 600Mbs. The camera interface says it is only using about 18Kbs, so I have to assume the video delay is due to the terrible EseeCloud turn-around for the video. It is ridiculous to require a camera configuration go through some company’s servers, but then EseeCloud would like you to pay for their cloud supported playback and storage which I have absolutely no interest in getting another monthly charge for simple security camera setup.
I have installed a MicroSD card in the camera for storage but cannot find out how to delete the videos it stores there. If you go to the camera manufacturer’s website and search for my camera, you get this: “Home / Search: 0 results found for 5523-3W-Q"".
I also attempted to contact support via the app itself, but once again I get these ridiculous results: The support link gives you: “There is currently no customer service online, please submit a message. When you click on leave a message you get this:
“The network is not strong, please click to try again.” Clicking “try again” does nothing and I am literally 7 feet away from my router! Until these manufacturers can provide some devices designed with common sense, I would strongly advise against a purchase with them. After months of setting up both devices over and over I am giving up. The camera says it is on line. I can see the camera on the EseeCloud app. The Echo Show is on the same 2.4GHz wifi as the camera and can get to internet pages but if I ask it to show the Front Door Camera it says, ""hmmm, the camera is not responding"". They are making millions off of equipment that DOES NOT DO what they say.",1.0 out of 5 stars
C. May,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2024","Unlike Facebook the Echo 10 is not a free product. Nor are any of its variants. I had to pay hundreds of dollars for each of them to be scattered throughout my home. Yet, despite setting my Echos 10 and 8 to refuse advertising, to refuse reminders to buy more of previous purchases on Amazon, to refuse to grant Alexa permission to announce to the world what is in my Amazon shopping cart, and all news about blankety blank Sportsball, the Echos persist. So I double then triple, then quadruple check my settings. All set to off. Obviously Amazon doesn’t give a flying squirrel what I want from this object I paid for.

“Don’t want advertising…? Surely you want to hear the “theme” music about this here Lexus that we are displaying…. And the theme to Alicia Keys Soulcare Makeup products… And the theme to the latest Kung Fu Panda movie…
“What size of these men’s sneakers do you want Alexa to put in your Amazon shopping cart…?”
“Introducing Lee cargo jeans in which comfort meets style.”
“Hey, roomful of people! This user has a case of vaginal lubricant in her shopping cart!”
“Take this unrelenting stream of sports quizzes that you have no interest in.”

If these Echo Shows were free I could hardly complain. But they’re not. And as often as not the wrong one responds to the command.

Harry L. Monk,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2023","I ordered this device on June 1st of this year, and I was furious with Amazon and their customer service for the very poor job of handling this expensive defective item. I have finally calmed down enough to write this review. I received this echo show 10 and had problems trying to set it up right out of the box. When I got to the part in the instructions to ask alexa a question, it replied "" I am having a problem right now and to contact customer support. I contacted customer support and we went thru the steps again to set up the echo show 10 with the same negative results. I unplugged this device as instructed and then plugged it back in with no change. I reset it as instructed with no change. I reset it back to factory as instructed with no change. I powered off my router and powered it back on with no change. This echo show 10 was defective and I spent a lot of time trying to get it to work properly. I called customer service the following day to return this device. I explained to the person that I and customer service did everything we could and this echo show 10 would not work. I was sent a return label and took the echo show 10 to UPS. I find out later that I did not receive my full refund. I called customer service numerous times to get the rest of my money back and they told me there was nothing they could do because the customer service person who created the return label checked a box stating item no longer required. I called customer service for assistance again with zero help. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told the supervisor would not change it either. I was put in hold for a while and then was told here was no supervisor there. I asked to speak with someone from the United States and was informed there is not a person from the United States that I could speak with. Poor service from Amazon and their customer service personnel located everywhere but the United States. I want my $5.99 returned to me. I told customer service they should have checked with the other customer service personnel I spoke with in the past to see the problems I had with the echo show 10.

So I wanted to just plain as possible I hooked up Pandora and all the sudden as it's sitting next to me it starts showing me things that I should be interested in hey buy some vitamins hey how about this hey how about that I have gone through every single setting through my online account for my app on my phone through the machine itself and turned everything off that I could possibly turn off. Still getting suggestions and ads so I contact Amazon and they put me on hold and they look and they have me do the typical turn it off and turn it back on which still doesn't work cuz then I got to sign back in and by the time I sign back in and do all that the original person that I'm talking to is gone so the next person has no clue what I'm not talking about so by the time they get back to me because they need to read through all whatever then like they said could you turn it back off and turn it back on no we're not going to do that again. can you help me remove the ads no that's not something we can do they say. Okay great well that's not going to work for what I need My 94-year-old father will not understand those and will not be able to swipe them away every time I ask Alexa to stop showing me suggested content she showed me more.

Matthew Ricci,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2024","The screen interaction is awful, recognition of your touch is janky, inconsistent, and delayed. Screen navigation is not intuitive.
Alexa app integration is horrendous. The Alexa app itself is the worst and also not intuitive. Trying to setup groups and organize rooms and commands is a nightmare. Not simple b/c there's all these backdoor setups that you also need to toggle in place in the App that are not clearly presented and difficult to navigate.
The echo here also constantly falls out of sync with any other echo devices I have around here grouped with it.
Navigating between apps on the Echo Show is bad. Controlling Netflix, Hulu, and Pandora is a joke. Trying to type in my login credentials to Hulu, the Echo Show suddenly gives up and decides to take me back to the home screen. Trying again to login, using voice command, the Amazon Alexa brain is seriously unsophisticated compared to Apple Siri. It can't even type an email address. It thinks ""@"" is spelled as ""at"" when speaking into an email address input field. Alexa is so stupid, like a Wish version of Siri.
I like how the screen does follow you by pivoting around as you move about the house. Like HAL 9000's eye.
On the Echo Show and Dots, even when I set Alexa to limit talking back, I still state simple command and when it does choose to comply (sometimes it errors out and does nothing in response) it continues to talk at me saying a bunch of unrelated stuff and making recommendations, droning on and on. Just do what was asked, when asked, and then shut up. If Alexa echo show was as slick as Amazon thinks it is, then I might value the offerings it babbles on about, but it's not slick at all.

Ryan,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2022","Pretty much a useless overpriced piece of junk. What's the point of installing a tablet on an echo device if it doesn't do anything a touchscreen device from even 15 years ago could. Pretty lame. It has almost zero app support or usability. Even if you manage to get it to go to Amazon Prime or Netflix you can't properly navigate through it.
How are they going to pretend you can use Netflix, Amazon Prime or other streaming services simply by talking to it but not being able to actually visually navigate through it in a reasonable manner?
I use YouTube music, the only way to use it on the echo Show is to use it through the internet and it is so slow, laggy and glitchy it's not even worth using, it truly is that bad. Even if you use Amazon music you can't click on an album and see all the tracks it's virtually useless how am I going to look through my music by talking to it? There's no reason it can't allow you to navigate through your music by using the touch screen, it's absolutely terrible.
This would be the equivalent of only being able to speak to your tablet then your tablet giving you very limited information based on what you asked, the whole point of the echo show is that you're supposed to also have touch screen and interface usability beyond just speaking to it.
In Amazon's defense the only thing I can say is they did call it the Echo Show.
There's no excuse it can't support any app or function as a tablet except they have gone completely out of their way engineering it not to. You installed a tablet on the device, it should work as one but it doesn't so I see no point in its existence. I don't need a display to kind of show me what I asked with the least information given.
Even the most mundane of tasks asking it the weather the best you get is the temperature as it shows the temperature on screen with zero other information or even something to click on to give you more, nothing. What do I need that for??
I could look at my thermometer outside my window for that. What an absolute joke.
It's just a $250 display that sits on my counter now. Great, thanks Amazon for manufacturing a useless device!!
Another huge thing is for the amount of space there is for a speaker in the device it has subpar sound at best.
I have speakers half the size of this that sound better with fuller sound and dynamic range.

Douglas Draeger,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2022","I bought this so I could see who was at the front door with the ring doorbell. It will connect and show the camera when it rings, but only for about 5 seconds. If you’re not in the same room, it’ll be gone before you get there. So, pretty worthless for that. The time it’s displayed cannot be adjusted. Almost all ring doorbell features are unsupported for Alexa routines. I was able to have it display the camera when motion is detected through a routine: “Alexa, show the front door and turn off the speaker” since I don’t want to hear everything whenever someone walks by walking their dog. The camera will stay on for about 10 minutes and half the time Alexa will NOT mute the speaker and Alexa ALWAYS says “OKAY” from routines so I’m constantly being annoyed by it. The “Brief Mode” setting does NOT stop Alexa from saying OKAY. (Even after toggling on/off and restarting) It also freezes up about once a day on the camera, showing a still image until you unplug it. I set up a second routine activated by motion with a timer and “Alexa, stop” so now I got the camera to turn off after 2 minutes and the alexa show doesn’t freeze up as often. I set up a third routine to mute the speaker after a 5 second wait activated by motion, to attempt to get it to consistently mute the speaker. As you can see, getting the Alexa show to do simple things is overly complicated and it won’t stop saying OKAY.

Alexa is designed to be constantly talked to and talk back to you. If you don’t want to talk to it, they did make a poor attempt to integrate shortcuts of commands that can be painstakingly entered by keyboard (but not adjusted, you have to delete and start a new one) There are no apps to touch on the screen, the shortcuts can kind of work get it to play music, or show the front door camera (but it’ll be a small picture-in-picture) - If you just want to walk up to it and touch buttons or touch things on a screen THIS IS NOT THE DEVICE TO GET.

The device has updated itself with additional content on the Home Screen that are turned on by default.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2023","Bought this so my wife could watch cooking shows in the kitchen and not have to keep going back to the living room to follow a recipe. Since I am a Prime member and use Fire TV that the Echo Show would have similar functionality to the video services I already use through Amazon. Oh, what a fool I was. One of my wife's favorite shows is ""America's Test Kitchen"" and she generally watches it on Tubi. Well the Echo Show offers a Tubi that is just a random collection of stuff and offers maybe only a 1/4 of what Tubi normally offers.

To add insult to injury, any time you ask Alexa to play any episode of ""America's Test Kitchen"" even ones we own and can access (albeit only manually) through the Echo Show it brings up an episode of ""America's Test Kitchen: The Next Generation"" on the Amazon owned FreeVee instead. That show is a cooking competition, it has really nothing to do with ""America's Test Kitchen"" beyond branding. It's like if I said ""Alexa show me the recipe for Gordon Ramsey's Amazing Hot Dog Tower"" and it showed me an episode of ""Hell's Kitchen"" instead.

So at the end of the day, I use this expensive paper weight to listen to the radio. Which by the way, I listen to the same station literally every day and Alexa gets it right about 60% of the time, I'm not a person with a thick accent or speech impediment so I'm not sure what the issue is there, but also you'd think that maybe just maybe that if I ask for the same station every day at 6:30 AM that I'm not asking for something that doesn't even sound like what I said.

Also, I use it to listen to Spotify, which I guess means that instead of buying this monstrosity, I could've just signed up for a supermarket credit card, gotten a free blue tooth speaker and called it a day.

Another fun fact is when you say ""Alexa turn off screen"" so you don't have to see the parade of Amazon ads, it will usually take another 3 or 4 times of saying that before Alexa hears and complies with that. On several occasions, I've just unplugged the thing instead.

J. M. Grant,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2021","Update 8/29/2022:
Have had it since release and regret buying it. Very invested in Amazon ecosystem but this one isn’t good.

Audio (music) cuts out regularly. The so is sitting a foot away works fine all the time.
Still can’t make the display useful.
Worst of all - I need to reboot it every few days for it to keep working, or it will stop responding fully to commands.

Original review:

I've been using Echo devices since the pre-order days of the original and have a dozen connected. Amazon's decision to increase the amount of information that you cannot turn off is causing me to look at switching all of them out for a competitor.

Before I dive deeper, understand that I've gone through every menu and disabled everything I can - if you don't do that, the device is a non stop Amazon commercial. But even so, there's too much you can't disable for a product you had to pay to own, on top of the annual Prime membership.

The Echo Show line, in particular, usually displays things I do not want. While you can select some options, there are other settings that you simply can't turn off. I know how to use the thing and don't need half the screen on a Show 5 wasted by telling me I can look at Recipes while in my office.

The older Show devices let you control this but this new one seems to tighten quite a few things down in a way that you cannot simply have the device display a background photo and the weather/time and leave it at that. It's not possible. Sooner or later an ad or useless suggestion will pop up.

While playing music, it always suggests other things, often blocking part of the lyrics or preventing you from seeing the Artist + Song Name.

Ads for Prime Videos and other Amazon services are fine if the device was low cost or free. But I paid $250 for something and did not even have the option (as with the Kindle) to purchase an ad-free experience.

And others that are linked to ads. Want warnings about dangerous weather? OK but they'll also randomly (including 3am) sound a chime to tell you we have some products you might want to buy. Can't have one without the other.

As far as the latest hardware- Audio is fantastic, tremendously better than the earlier Show devices. The screen movement is somewhat gimmicky but does work well if one person is in the room. If there are two, it's wobbles between them and like most compromise, leaves it so nobody gets what they want. The main issue I have with the hardware is the glare on the screen. It's pretty hilarious to have to move your head so the glare doesn't block the screen, only to have the screen move to continue to face you... thus putting the glare back. Amazon should use a matte screen for these, it would make a world of difference.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Zerauskire,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2024","My son’s name is Aidan. I named the echo in his room “Aidan’s Room”. When I say “Alexa, drop in Aidan’s Room” the echo hears “Alexa, drop in Aiden’s Room”. It only interprets Aidan to be spelled Aiden with an “E”. Because of this, it will not drop in his room without asking every single time if I mean “Aidan’s Room” because it interprets what I said as “Aiden’s Room” with an “E” instead of the “A”. So it’s really annoying that I have to confirm this every single time when this should be a very simple fix.

I have just dealt with it and I have been reporting this issue since 2018. 6 years I have been reporting this issue and still no fix. I refused to change my son’s name in the settings to be spelled wrong because I shouldn’t have to. But recently I got tired of wasting 6 years of reporting this when it’s obvious that no one on Amazon’s side is listening. No one over there cares to fix this extremely simple-to-fix issue. I did what I put off for this long and just changed his name in the app which I shouldn’t have to. I should not have to spell my son’s name wrong just to make this work. I could understand if he had some crazy spelling for his name but it’s such a basic name. It’s crazy to me that it can’t understand that when I say “Alexa, drop in Aidan’s Room” that I’m referring to the device literally named “Aidan’s Room”. It can’t figure out that it’s not spelled with an “E”. How ridiculous is that? As smart as this thing is and it can’t figure that out.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Dr-Phone,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2023","I'm totally blind. I had a very very hard time to get the device setup! But I did do it on my own. Like I said, not easy at all. You cannot do it through the Alexa App on your phone like you can with normal Echo's. That would have been sweet if that was doable. It would have probably taken me a few minutes and not over 1 hour. Even then; There was a spot in the process, the things just stopped on one screen and wouldn't go past it with the built in screen reader. So if you are totally blind and want to get this to set it up on your own because you live by yourself! Be ware!

Looks like you cannot set any type of automation to tell you when the camera switch is on or off. If you initially don't know what way to slide the switch you will never know. Down side for me. Changing some setting in the Alexa App the setting wouldn't apply and the Show is online and responding to commands. Looks like you really need to do most things through the touch screen to get settings to take.

No USB port on the Show 10 so if you have trouble with the touch screen, you cannot use a normal keyboard to enter information for like user names and passwords.

The voice volume is lower in volume then the Start of request tone. I was hoping this would souind close to the Echo 4th generation with premium sound and Zigbee hub! But the sound isn't the same. The over all volume is lower. The speakers for the Show 10 are in the back stand for the unit.

It does look like it works for announcements that I have setup for Automation routines. So that is good.

At this point, I don't know if I'll keep it or not. At this point, I cannot tell someone who is totally blind and wants to do it on their-own to get one.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Eduardo Herrera,"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2023","To start I'll say that this is a very interesting device executed very poorly. Setting it up is very straightforward but when it comes to daily use is lacking in pretty much all aspects.
The echo show 10 3rd gen is very slow and takes more time to process the same smart prompts than other echo devices, all my echo dots are way faster than this at processing normal prompts like turn lights on/off.
Answering the Ring doorbell with this is useless as it would take about a minute just to bring the camera feed up.
I purchased the Echo show 10 as a smart hub for my kitchen area which turned out to be a terrible idea (even though is marketed as being great for kitchens) since the microphone is awful, I had to change the wake up word from this device because when saying alexa in the kitchen this device wouldn't respond but my echo dot all the way in the living room would.
Now I really have to shout for this device to start listening.
The screen is ok but the following feature doesn't work most of the times and when it does is not centered to the eyesight so it feels awkward to look at, many times it moves by itself or doesn't move accurately when I move around my kitchen counter.
Connectivity seems fine now but this is my second unit as the first one lost wifi connectivity for some reason after a few months of owning it, it could have been a dud but dealing with Amazon customer service about this device and its issues has been a very frustrating experience.
Now I can't even trade it in to upgrade to a better device because according to customer services this device in inelegible for trade in even though there's a picture of it in the trade in page on the Amazon site.

I would recommend anyone to steer clear from the amazon echo show 10 3rd gen.

Several of these speakers do not work in a group.

The Echo Show specifically will not play music in a group. It will tell me its playing music and do nothing. This device has shown me ads and doesnt understand my commands a lot of the time. Doesn't turn on my lights about half the time I ask.

I have more things I could say about the app, software, customer service and expenses even just to play white noise. But those have less to do to with this specific device.

I am dumbfounded, the quality of these devices and software are leagues below what I normally would expect out of any Amazon product. I love Amazon and their brand of products but the programing on these is disgusting.

Ed,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","UPDATE: I have had it for over 3 months Home Screen still isn't fixed screen goes black after showing a few of your photos. DO NOT BUY THIS ONE IF YOU WANT A SHOW BUY THE PREVIOUS VERSION WHERE THE HOME SCREEN WORKS! I have communicated for 3 months with support and I have given up it being fixed ever! Very disappointed from a user that has 2 older versions of show, several echo dots and other echo's which are great. Makes me afraid to buy any new Amazon products since this one has definitely disappointed!

I have had the other Alexa Show's so I am familiar with the settings etc. But in the new Show the option of having your photos going to the screen continually gets interrupted by an ANNOYING Amazon screen that says at the top ""Alexa for your day"" it seems there is no way to shut this off and no one would want to continually see this. Also after showing home screen pictures for a little while the screen goes black and stays that way until you ask Alexa something. My other Amazon shows (I have two) work great with these features. Why the software functioning was changed in this unit is bizarre. They need to go back to the programming of the home screen that they successfully used in the previous show models!

Also the movement of the unit is continually confused by the tv being on in the room making that feature almost useless. Also became confused when our dog barked. Surely the unit needs to refined and a human does not sound like a dog. The setting where it should only move when video calling and drop in doesn't work always moves when asking even temperature or any other simple request. Also it is supposed to go back to a home position and it never does. Have not seen any improvement in software problems.

Francesca,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2023","Amazon has proven, after years of ignoring (and making it more and more difficult to give) feedback, that they care more about sales than customer needs. They simply do not respect customer needs/privacy.

It’s like playing whack a mole to turn off new “features” that are mainly advertisements. And then come the actual advertisements that pop up in our kitchen, when all we’ve authorized are our pictures and deliveries.

Forcing ads on people does not build loyalty! It builds resentment. And it’s unethical. We paid a lot for these devices and we pay for content separately. Amazon has NO RIGHT to invade our home with ads.

Even after a lengthy chat rabbit hole about turning off ad preferences. The fact that it’s that complicated to get ONLY what we want on this screen says a lot about Amazons increasing entitlement and arrogance.

THIS IS AN ACCESSIBILITY ISSUE.
As a neurodiverse family, we struggle to keep distractions out of our home. Alexa has officially made that impossible. Overstimulation and constant distraction are unhealthy.

All of this unauthorized crap popping constantly up is bad for our family. And trying to make it stop has become a source of stress.

After more than a decade and four Amazon devices, we’ve had to switch to google hub.

Wake up and change course, Amazon. Use your powers for good.

Break away from this, the latest in the disturbing wave of corporatecentric, (not customer centric) business practices, which are seriously eroding Consumer Rights.

Yes, Relentless is a better name for the company. And not relentlessly customer centric as was supposedly the initial idea.

Amazon is now relentlessly profit-centric, sinking further and further into aggressive, coercive sales tactics. There is no concern for customer comfort or boundaries, and therefore absolutely no regard for customer loyalty. We are finding alternatives to Amazon.

John C.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2021","Here is my first impression right from the start. The motion detection does NOT work very well even with good lighting. It must be very bright surrounding the unit for this thing to follow me. I paid a lot of money for this one feature and even with every light on in my kitchen and den I still get the “low light detected, motion not available.” Essentially the motion detection will not work after sundown in my house. It’s upsetting when you pay a lot of money for something that doesn’t stand up to what it claims to do. Very disappointed. And a white power cord for my black Echo?? Really Amazon?? Plus, the cord is about 12” shorter than the previous Show’s. My first gen model I could run the cord along the floor to the outlet but this one is draped across my wall and the bright white stands out like a sore thumb. Poorly executed. Amazon should send black longer cords to every person that ordered a black unit.

Set up took about 20 min because it made me go through the entire setup just to reach the point where it had to do mandatory updates/reboot and basically reset itself to a point where I had to literally go through the same set up process twice. Here’s an idea Amazon, why don’t you have me do the set up after the updates take place.

Finally, I will say I love the bigger screen and the sound quality is far better that the my original (first generation) Show. Not sure if these two attributes are worth keeping it for the $250 price tag. One more thing since I pre-ordered the device as soon as it became available, I paid $250 and the option to add a Blink camera for $5 was not available at the time. So, I basically got penalized for pre-ordering this thing early and missed out on the $5 camera add-on. Never again will I pre-order anything from Amazon.

I feel this unit isn’t worth the hype and the extra cost if you already own an Echo Show. Wait for the price drops to get one or skip this and wait for an improved motion detection system. Amazon, you’re slipping.
I will post updates in the future.

Update: as of March 22, 2021. I am returned this unit. I don’t know if it was a lemon
or just the way the echo show 10 is but in my opinion it is not worth $250. The other night it lost network connection for no reason and I could not get it to connect to my network. I tried resetting, restarting and even going back to factory default settings and still it would not connect to my Wi-Fi.

I called in to troubleshoot and after no luck, agreed to receive a replacement, which did not work either. I could not initiate a return for the new (exchanged) Echo show.

I received the emailed label and took it to my UPS store where I was forced to purchase packaging at my own expense (Are you kidding me????!!!!)

The movement of the screen is sketchy at best. During setup, it seems great, since I'm literally sitting right in front of it. But walking near it, camera image was off center constantly. the motorized is only left and right, it doesn't go up and down so depending on the screen tilt, your always off screen. Seems pointless to have all this mechanical tech and no PTZ. (Pan Tilt Zoom).
Basic features, like other show units (the 5, 8 and 10 Gen 2) function as expected EXCEPT:
this is a gen 3 and as such, they've screwed with the unit OS. I have security cameras which stream to a high end security server. I have not had a problem displaying any camera on any Alexa in years. Now, I can't show any camera on this unit, it just doesn't work - but only on this device.
In attempts to workaround the failure, I've installed a gateway to resolve a well known SSL problem, disabled audio - but still no camera on this device - and it seems Amazon is not helping anyone - they point the finger at everything but themselves.
Would I purchase this again? No.
Get the 8 or 10 (hard to find) and be done with it - or better yet - use a DIY Alexa device running on a Raspberry PI and get more features than you can imagine! Thats what I'm doing :)

A. Savage,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2021","Update - March 2024: still slow after resets. Spotify connection has become iffy at best. Ads on weather display. Ads ads ads.

Update - June 2023: this is officially the last Alexa product I’ll ever buy. The assistant has become almost useless, they add new ads to the home screen all the time, the follow on questions are infuriating, and it needs to be restarted frequently due to sluggishness. Touch screen hasn’t been snappy in a long, long time. Navigating the settings is a chore. I think Amazon is killing it on purpose as Alexa operates at a major loss. Again: this is a decent Bluetooth speaker and mediocre kitchen timer (that now ignores you on “stop” commands half the time). Not much else. Definitely do not buy at full price, Prime Day only.

Original: This has a much weaker microphone array than the Dots or other Echo products. Doesn’t always hear you well, and you need to be extra crisp to ensure accuracy.

Speaker quality is excellent. Nice, balanced, room-filling. Good equalizer settings.

Touch screen response is pretty good, not an iPad, but rarely wholly frustrating. Not super fast though.

Infuriating follow on questions from Alexa, enough to almost push me away from the ecosystem. I don’t remember it being this bad in the past few years, and the control settings have been reduced as well. Needs a concise mode. I don’t think I’ve ever been happy or helped by unprompted info/questions from Alexa.

Home Screen customization is pretty weak too. Loves pushing Amazon stuff on you, but this can be changed. Have a rotating home screen of photos, with a small weather card.

Top use case is with Spotify, and it doesn’t really run a Spotify app, more than stream from another source. You pretty much will only control the music from phone/computer. Can’t speak to other music services.

Haven’t used the rotation function all that much either, but I’m not a big video chatter. It does track well, if a little abruptly.

Overall, it’s an excellent solo home speaker with solid Alexa functions. Nicely positioned in the kitchen; we have ours on the bar that connects the kitchen to the dining area. Far from perfect, but overall worth buying at discount.

Updated: slowly became terrible. Slow screen, awful interaction, advertising added. I needed to de-register it for some reason, and getting it back online has been a nightmare.

After spending nearly an hour on the line with Amazon technical support I was told that in order to use the device for video calls I would need to purchase a smartphone (or a recent model tablet) and install the Alexa App to be able to input my home telephone number that Alexa would then us to place the call. There is NO PLACE in the Echo Show settings to input the number; it can only be done through the Alexa app.

This is quite frankly monumentally stupid. There should be a section of the ""Settings"" on the device to allow the input of the telephone number that should be used to enable the calling feature of the device, but instead I am being told that I have to purchase an additional device, that I do not want, just so that I can use a device that I just purchased.

I have been an Amazon customer since 1999 and I have, until now, never been disappointed in a product that I have purchased. That Amazon would market a device that is so incompetently designed is almost beyond comprehension. I do not believe for one minute that it is technologically impossible to design the ""Settings"" subsystem to allow the input of such a crucial piece of information as a telephone number.

To make the experience more infuriating, there is no information on the Echo Show product page that indicates that one MUST have a smartphone or recent generation tablet in order to use the Echo show.

UPDATED 12-NOV-2023
Ok, I PAID for this device, and I keep PAYING for Amazon Prime. So why is this thing displaying ads ALL the time? I didn’t BUY a smart speaker/screen so Amazon could push sponsored content into my home! And you cannot turn this off either on the device or in the Alexa smartphone app. This stinks!!

Further, Amazon keeps changing my Home Screen settings in order to push more of their desired content. Again, I didn’t PAY for this device so Amazon can push THEIR content into my home. Yes, there are device settings to turn this off, but I expect Amazon to honor my settings and not keep turning undesired content on AGAIN to my Home Screen. Seriously, Amazon changes YOUR settings so they can shove whatever THEY want down your throat.

I’ve had nearly every Echo smart speaker, and recent models listen very well to my spoken input. But not this model!! I am constantly having to repeat myself or completely restate instructions to this device, when the others in my home work just fine. Even other SHOW devices work normally. It’s only with this device.

Boasts great features, but they’re poorly executed. Mostly software flaws I’ve not observed on my numerous non-screen Echo devices. This thing even puts itself into do-not-disturb mode despite this feature (and schedule) being disabled. And the opposite is true: scheduling do not disturb mostly has no effect. And even when DND is active, it still lets Amazon updates through. Just constant bugs.

Numerous other design problems. Such as the camera being offset, so the screen never quite follows you; it’s always a little offset. When it actually follows you. More often than not, it doesn’t follow at all. And it never resets to my set default position.

I keep hoping Amazon will make software improvements, but I think shoppers are better off with a regular Echo smart speaker until Amazon can figure out this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
John C.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2023","Updated review:

My echo show 10 has started showing “person detected” at the top of the screen every single day, it actually blocks stuff and doesn’t go away until I unplug it. Occasionally it swaps it out for “guard is using your camera”.

—

The Echo Show 10 is a decent device with some notable strengths and weaknesses. One significant strength is the addition of motorization, which allows the screen to follow you as you move around the room. However, there are some issues that need to be addressed.

One significant problem is the ""Person Detected"" banner, which cannot be disabled without unplugging and replugging the device. I currently have an open ticket with support about this issue and hope it can be fixed soon. Additionally, motion detection can be finicky, and the camera cannot detect motion in low light.

The integration with Ring could also be improved. Live view only works in the Alexa app, not in the Ring app, and defining which cameras can be used can be confusing when setting up which cameras are used during different Alarm modes. For example, by default, Motion recording is turned on when the Ring Alarm is disarmed, which can be inconvenient for privacy.

Furthermore, Amazon's trade-in program has become more frustrating. Previously, you could set up a trade-in and immediately take advantage of the 25% off discount. Now, it appears that you don't receive any discount until the device has been received and appraised, which can be inconvenient if you want to make a purchase at the same time you do the trade-in.

Despite these issues, the Echo Show 10 is a solid device, especially if purchased on promotion. The motorization feature is a significant improvement over previous models, and the sound quality is good. However, it could benefit from further refinement and attention to detail, particularly with regards to the issues discussed above. Overall, the Echo Show 10 is a good purchase, but it's not without its flaws.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Joe A,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2022","In my original review (see below) I complained that we couldn't get this Echo Show to work with our Ring cameras.

Amazon responded to my review and said that function exists and works just fine. Our experience was that we could not get all of the cameras to just passively be on the screen. Maybe there is a difference for different types of cameras? We have 3 different types of Ring cameras - the doorbell cam, an indoor cam, and 2 outdoor wired floodlight cams. I tried for a couple hours, then my girlfriend tried for a couple hours. We couldn't get it to do what we wanted.

So I'll change my review to say that while Amazon claims this functionality exists we were unable to make it do this despite hours of trying.

===============
My original review:
We purchased this to use with our Ring alarm system, so that we could have a monitor on the kitchen counter to see the Ring cameras. We figured since Echo and Ring are both part of the Amazon family that they would have really nice integration.

Oh so wrong we were!

You can get a full-featured app for the ring alarm on an android or an apple tablet. Weirdly there is no skill for this on Echo, and super weirdly there isn't even one on Fire Tablets. (You have to use a backdoor to install the android app store and then you can download it). It does do some basic things with Ring doorbell, but that's it.

I had expected to be able to do other things - video conferencing (nope, not with any normal service like Zoom or Google Meet) or watch directTV (nope).

I thought I had a defective one, but when I googled it I found out what the problem is. The camera is located on the top right of the tablet instead of the center. So when it tracks you, it centers you in the camera frame, but the camera is not centered on the tablet. This might not seem like a big deal, however it literally prevents the display from facing directly at you. Instead it faces as if it's pointing towards someone standing beside you. The further away you are the less it points away from you, but it's so dumb when you come close to it so you can see, and it literally turns away from you.
Second of all, you set up users and you can tell it to ""follow me"" while your cooking. So even with me logged in as the active user, and an active command to ""follow me"", if anyone walks through the kitchen it locks onto them, follows them out of the room, then stays facing the opposite direction. If you have anyone other than yourself in your house, then this device is useless cause you have to end up turning off the motion tracking features anyways. I'm glad I didn't buy the robot version of this awful product.

Craig,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2023","Update - I lowered this from 2 stars to 1 star because when it's showing ads and you ask it to show your photos it does so, but then slides down a quarter-screen sized ADVERTISEMENT to order prints of your photos.
If you are considering this for an elderly person as a means of checking in on them I recommend non screen echo devices. We already use two echo dots in other rooms of mom's house. We are considering replacing the show 10 with another dot and a ring stickup camera with pan/tilt. We're also considering an omni fire tv as (so far) there are no advertisements on the ""ambient"" screen which can be set to your photos slide show or several other still or moving images.
-------
Sponsored content can not be removed from the home screen. Customer service said to turn off all the home content switches. They said go to to amazon.com/adprefs and select do not show me interest-based ads provided by Amazon. After two days and several chat sessions they said this can not be removed. That was the only honest thing they said about it. At this point they said but it's only when it's idle. This was also disingenuous. Even swiping the screen often shows two to four more ads before getting back to your slide show.

I bought this for my mother who is in her nineties. We pay extra for Alexa Together for elderly, but still can not remove these ads. A shaky hand can easily make a ""touch"" instead of a ""swipe"" and this opens the advertised product.

Everything else about this device and the Alexa Together service are excellent and Five Star quality.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Trevor Cherry,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2023","The echo worked great for about 2 weeks and suddenly stopped running. Would not turn on at all. I tried the factory reset and several different outlets. I called customer service and they gave me 2 options: send in the one I have and they would fix it and send it back to me or pay $40 and receive a new one. I did not want to spend another $40 when I just spent a lot of money on the original product. I sent off my echo and 3 weeks later I received it back. IT STILL WONT TURN ON!! They didn’t do anything to fix it. Just put it in a new box and sent it back to me. Now the customer service girl won’t send me a new one or fix the one I have. She didn’t even want to give me a refund!! After arguing with her for 30 minutes she finally said she could refund me. Not happy at all with this product, customer service, or Amazon. Absolutely horrible experience.

Update: When I send it back the first time, they told me not to send the power cord with it. I ordered a new power cord and that fixed it. Not sure why they didn’t check that as well. Now the second cord has gone out. 2 cords in 10 months. It never gets unplugged and the cord never gets messed with. Seems like the cord is designed to self destruct so you have to keep buying new ones.

Also, you would think that Amazon would continue to improve Alexa but I swear she is regressing every week. She understands less and less, wants me to pay for music all the time, and never plays from the device I am talking to.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2024","Firstly, the Echo is an ad machine mostly for Amazon products. You cannot turn off ads. If you like a large clock display don't expect it to stay large on your screen all the time because during the all day everyday ads showing the clock display is reduced significantly. Watching movies is another thing you won't do much of unless it's from Prime. Music is a no go unless you pay for a service. Amazon is a pay for everything. I mean, remember 1 day shipping? Yea, you pay more now and there's no guarantee if it will arrive in one day or 10. Video calls are a nuisance due to freezing video/audio issues.

Justin Vicknair,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2024","I’d recommend getting Google devices. I have smart switches and outlets everywhere in my house after I renovated. The echo show is constantly going offline. The newest issue issue of many is that the microphones are very poor. Microphones are supposed to have compression in them to drown out background noise to receive the correct signals. You’d have to turn off your TV or anything else running for the device to understand your commands. Often times I have to yell to the point that the Alexa device in the other room fulfills the command. I’ve reported the issue but just as you expect Amazon doesn’t do anything. Some low level tech person who has minimal training will just tell you to factory reset it and set it up from scratch…which is both a pain and an ineffective waste of your time. I have a Google puck in the same room right by the TV now and it can hear me all the time while the closer Alexa device does not. Now that my experiment is complete I urge you to avoid Amazon devices. I’ve had to return an echo before and now that the expensive ones messed up I’m over it. I think they make the microphones ineffective intentionally so that you feel inclined to buy more of their devices so you can be heard, when you should only need a few in a small home.",1.0 out of 5 stars

It will show the weather once and then a commercial, and then it will show my calendar, and then a commercial it repeats commercials constantly. I did go to the settings on privacy to un block the third-party settings, but it did not work. I called Amazon and spoke to a technician who helped me go through the process again, including on the Alexa app. I uninstalled it and started all over signing in and setting up all options I wanted displayed but again one commercial after another.
I do not understand why Amazon is allowing this. I know they own the device as their product but I did not purchase it to have to see constant commercials.

I also tried, literally not showing anything on my screen, but the weather and deleting everything else but again it will show me the weather and three commercials. When I delete the commercials and say I’m not interested, it says it will not be shown on this device again, but that’s just not true and it shown multiple times after that. .

Shopper,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2021","It doesn’t do zoom calls. I was hoping it could be a dedicated zoom call / radio / small entertainment device in my office. It does none of these things well.

What hot garbage. (First posted on 9/18/2022)

Follow up (11/28/2021)
I don’t think there is piece of technology that has ever generated more fury to me than piece of crap Alexa Echo Show.

First when I posted my review a couple of months ago, within minutes (!) Amazon called me and asked me if they could help me with the echo show. It was kinda creepy but also kind nice. After 35 minutes futzing and downloading and redoing settings on the device and the phone it STILL couldn’t do zoom calls, even though the agent thought with the latest update it should. It was like a glimmer of hope and then nothing. I was just as frustrated as when I first realized this was a waste of money. However it was enough for me leave the thing plugged in and not actually throw it in the trash. Even though it did nothing.

A couple of months later. I have found *one* very awkward use for the device. If I set up an Alexa to Alexa call on my phone and the show, I can use the Show screen, and my phones camera to give me a view of myself while weightlifting. It’s cumbersome to setup and neither device can do anything else but at least it’s *one* use.

The show is screen, a speaker, a camera, and a computer. It does all of these jobs hilariously badly. The screen can’t cast and streams very few services. The speaker can’t multi task. The camera struggles with video calls. And the computer, good god they have done everything possible to make it only usable in the very idiotic way they want you to use it.

It’s the most egregiously Company-centric, gather-your-data device I could have imagined. The “customer first” motto and was definitely missing from the design and implantation of this device. I really hope the teams involved read this.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Axl,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2022","Beware if you got as a gift. This device has been nothing but constant issues and when trying to get any kind of support you’re met with an insane lack of accountability. If you’re someone who was lucky enough to get one that works, I’m sure you’ll love it. For anyone else good luck, or if you got this as a gift, they won’t help you troubleshoot and won’t even help when they attach it to someone else’s account.

The “Alexa for your day” is on for most of the screen time. There’s nothing you can do about it. Same with the ads they’ll have for new movies or shows. They’ll stay in the screen 10 times longer than any image or sometimes just stay all day. I have had the issue of suggestions, Covid tips and more popping up even when I have them toggled off. Then it started just being a blue screen and not even the nature pictures I had set as the Home Screen images before rotating a bunch of Amazon ads or these suggestions I had tuned off. Looking at some of the reviews I can see that others have reported the same glitches I have but have been told “the device is operating as intended” even when sending video and pictures of the device clearly not working or connecting to my account.

I was sent a replacement and it’s been literally days where it won’t even turn on to be set up because the one sent to me was associated to the person who purchased the original one as a gift. I spent over 4 hours on the phone where they hung up instead of escalating and I’ve sent multiple emails that have gone without response.

Litag8r,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2023","I got an Echo Show 10 primarily as a speaker for my laptop in my office with the obvious side benefits. Don't do this! First, the bluetooth sound is unacceptably HORRIBLE. Constant stuttering, clicks, pops, and other sound artifacts. Sounds like a $10 speaker from the Dollar Store. Second, the volume is a problem. The laptop and Echo volume are not synced. So at normal Echo volume, I could not hear the bluetooth sound at all. I had to turn the Echo to 8 to hear anything. That is when I noticed the horrible sound quality noted above. This means that Alexa will scream at me for everything except the sound that I asked to hear which is barely audible. I chatted with tech support to check. NATURALLY, they had me restart the device then factory reset...because that is always the first step. And when you factory reset, you have to do everything all over again--wifi, password, Amazon account, password, etc. Be warned, as part of the setup, it will AUTOMATICALLY start uploading all the photos on your phone to Amazon. Read carefully and uncheck the box if you don't want that. If you don't have small fingers, you might also be signed up for Amazon Music.

Bruce O,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2022","Super sluggish, doesnt respond quickly to taps and when dropping in from other devices the show takes a long time to get in focus if it ever does. Also even when it focus it hunts around which is super annoying when you are talking to 2 deaf poeple trying to sign. The unit is right next to the Wifi so the signal is max.

If I'm on my Galaxy S22 and dropping in the video when I'm in portrait orientation is in landscape so it is hard to see the deaf people signing. Then if I turn to landscape the video stays in the portrait orientation. There is a rotation button but it only rotates my video from portrait to landscape not the people I am signing with. There is literally no way the UI designers use this app for video communication it is super bad. Even when I start the drop in it selects the mic source as a watch located in another room instead of defaulting to the handset.

The interface is not intuitive the whole alexa/echo ecosystem software ui is a convoluted mess.

Almost never focused on calls if it does connect and the device is always moving and zooming seemingly randomly. If you use the alexa app to drop in for a video conference the landscape video of the echo will only show in portrait so it's a small video with black bars top and bottom of course if you rotate the phone it stays in portrait. If you hit the rotate button it will rotate your little selfie camera but not the main video which remains unintuitively in portrait. It will also just connect the studio to another device like a watch in another room instead of the obvious default of speaker. This has been going on for at least 6 months with not a bug fixed. No way anyone designing this actually uses it and pretty sure no one uses it much or else there would be so many bug reports for this functional disaster.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Pedro Freitas,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2021","Mic and Alexa wake command:
The new 3rd Generation Show is by far the worst Echo device I've had to pick up the voice Alexa wake command. I have to yell Alexa for it to wake when the Show is playing content at any volume. My old original Show wakes up more than 15 feet away while the 3rd Gen Show does not wake when I'm standing right in from of it.
This happens mostly when the 3rd Gen Show is playing content like music or video. Maybe the larger speaker is overwhelming the mic, or the mic in the 3rd Gen Show is worse than previous Echo devices.
This is bad enough that I'm considering returning the device. The original Show works much better in this scenario and the new Show almost does not work at all.

Motion display:
The display moves away from you then you put your hand on it to adjust the volume buttons. The proximity of the hand seems to confuse the motion sensor. I have to use both hands and hold the display from moving to adjust the volume.

Bugs canceling timers:
I got the 3rd Gen Show stuck several times. Canceling a timer right when the timer expires puts the Show in a loop and the timer alarm cannot easily be dismissed.
Canceling multiple timers using the touch screen sometimes does not work. Swiping to cancel failed and the timers stayed active. I had to use voice to cancel each timer, but calling each timer by the original duration (e.g. cancel 20 minute timer) does not work. It failed to recognize the timer by duration and tells me have multiple timers. I had to ask for ""cancel timer"" and wait for it to ask which, and only then say ""20 minute timer.""

The new Show seems buggy. I hope software updates will improve things over time like the motion of the display and the timer bugs.
I'm not sure the poor mic issue is solvable by software. It could be related to a hardware issue or choice that may not be addressed until a future product refresh.

If you have a choice, I suggest choosing another Echo device for now and skipping the 3rd generation Show until it has been improved. You'll need the patience of an early adopter to put up with its current buggy state. Its is disappointing for a 3rd generation device.",1.0 out of 5 stars
DB,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2023","I have an Echo Show 8 in the kitchen and an Ecobee thermostat with Alexa support in the hallway, about 50 feet away. The Ecobee almost always intercepts our Alexa requests, even when we are standing right next to the Echo Show 8.
Because of this, we disabled the microphone on the Ecobee, but the Echo Show 8 is still terrible at listening to commands. Whereas the Ecobee picks up commands (from a room away) about 95% of the time, I have to raise my voice at the Echo Show 8 nearly every time. It regularly hears something very different than what I said, and notably I have a ""standard"" U.S. Western news reporter accent and have given talks at scientific and computing conferences, without any complaint about the clarity of my speech.
Alexa is moderately useful for setting alarms, reminders, converting units, and other simple tasks, but even with those I need to say, ""Alexa, STOP!"" multiple times to get it to shut the hell up. On several occasions, when it repeatly alarmed or went on and on reading an irrelevant Wikipedia article to me, I just unplugged it. ANYTHING to get it to stop talking!

One task that it is particularly useless at, ironically, is ordering from Amazon. Last time I tried, it happily ordered a product that would not ship for several weeks, even though there was an identical product available immediately.

Apell98,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2022","We've had Echo devices all over our house for the past two years (Flex, Dot and new dome-shaped Dot), which all work pretty much the way they're supposed to. The Echo Show 10 behaves almost as if it's made by a different company. It can't hear me half the time, often another device much farther away answers instead of this one, it misunderstands me most of the time when it does hear me, and it also tends to respond differently when it finally does understand me, telling me it can't do a certain thing I'm asking or trying to use a 'skill' when one of the other devices would just fulfill the request directly. It gets to the point where, if I'm close enough to an Echo, I'll just lean in that direction and try to aim my voice that way, hoping it will answer instead of the Show 10. Actually considered disabling the mic or just putting it away somewhere, and the only reason I haven't is because it cost so much (!!), so I'm still trying to work with it. I regularly go into the 'voice history' settings and provide feedback when it misunderstands me, but that hasn't improved its performance.

It's also been having a lot of trouble tracking/rotating to follow my voice, a problem that's gotten worse the longer we've had it. Restarting it sometimes helps, but we currently have the rotation turned off because it just doesn't work often enough, which defeats the purpose of the feature (not to mention the price we paid).

The screen is fine, and I'd rate the sound quality a B/B+, but that really doesn't matter when the whole point is that you control it with your voice, and the voice recognition is so incredibly poor.

Night Mode is now a gray screen with white date and time, it lights up the whole room and here is no option to change the colors. You cannot change it back to the old Night Mode which was a black screen with red font, which was fainter at night and easier on the eyes. You have to dim it down so much you can't see the display when you call it from sleep mode. You can't see your Ring Camera when it's activated if you have it dimmed, annd it doesn't ""wake up"" and brighten then screen as it should when called. They should have made an option for the screen to light up when called or not to if not wanted like the prompt sound. Also, I could not get the Ring display go away when telling it to dismiss the camera. No command worked.

The alarm with music still comes on at the last volume setting instead of slowly asending like the buzzers do. And you still can't set the alarm to run selected routines unless that is the only trigger you give a particular routine. It says it has an option to run a selected routine from a list it attempts to populate, but is alway ""Unable to fetch routines, try back later.""

txmom,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2023","I traded in a perfectly good echo show 8 for the echo show 10. The only 2 things that I like about the echo show 10 is the size of the screen and the quality of the speaker when playing music. Besides that it doesn’t operate correctly. we have the motion turned off because it doesn’t follow people correctly. Here’s an example of the kind of irritation that we deal with daily: I installed the Santa skill so that my grandson could call Santa. Half the time when he asks her to call Santa she calls Santa the other half the time she says she can’t call Santa because he is not in my contacts list.
When I ask you to open up my playlists, half the time it opens up my playlist and the other half the time it just starts playing one of my playlist randomly. if I tell it to turn on my living room light, it gets it correct about 70% of the time. Sometimes it doesn’t respond at all and other times it tells me that it can’t find it. This is how this thing operates all day long. It can’t get anything right 100% of the time. it’s extremely frustrating. I unplugged it and reset it multiple times and it doesn’t help. I absolutely hate it and miss my echo show 8.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Alexa can't give me any recipes, due to my location and time settings or something. I asked her today what time is sunset, and she didn't know. My Google Assistant was able to answer with no problem. It seems like Alexa used to be more useful, but she is not as smart as she used to be. Maybe one in five questions that I asked her are actually answered satisfactorily.

Having said that, this device is particularly frustrating. Having such a big screen, with a very poor software is a bad combination: There is no youtube app, it is IMPOSSIBLE the see a PDF or DOCX or Text file on it. Forget about following your recipes during cooking. The home screen configuration is pretty much inexistent, options VERY limited. I keep getting notifications like ""Check your zodiac for today"" which I find borderline offensive. The sound.... is crap, total crap.

C.Ciavolella,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2021","I've lived with this thing for over a year now, but I've been holding off on my review in the hopes that maybe just maybe software or app updates would make it actually function correctly. Sadly, no. So after all this time, it gets one star, and I really should have just returned it on day one.
We purchased this, as well as one for each of the grandparents, so our kids could easily connect with them and see them (we all live very far away from each other and rarely see each other). When asking Alexa to make a call, it will state, ""calling grammy on Alexa device"" but then literally not do anything, no matter how long we wait. Sometimes Alexa won't even finish that sentence, it'll just cut off. Repeating the request gets similar results.
Asking ""Alexa, why are you broken"" sends her in to a ""Every thing seems to be functioning normally"" loop where she repeats this phrase over and over never finishing the word ""normally"".
We also have a few Echo Dots (mostly received for free with other purchases). And occasionally, asking the show to call grammy will trigger an echo dot in the other room to make the call, for some unknown and absolutely terrible design reason.
And the app, dear god. How a multi-billion dollar company can fail so hard at basic app design is astonishing. Amazon should have waited for someone else to produce this item, then just bought the rights, like they did with Wyze, which actually has a decent app. God help you in your attempts to set up any Echo device, it's going to take you a few tries, I hope you have the patience of a saint.

St5500,"Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2023","Let me start by saying I’ve owned almost every Echo home device since 2015 and I’ve been an adopter ever since - getting the first Show, then the first Show 10, and now this one and I can tell you that the ecosystem Alex has slowly become unhelpful and more of a hinderance to a peaceful life to the point where half of the time I end up so fed up that I just unplug the device. There are moments when I asked Alexa to do very blatant clear commands that I’ve used on all the other devices in My Home and I get the response,” I’m having trouble hearing you” which is so upsetting because I’m standing right in front of the device. And let’s not forget the 7 out of 10 times (yes I said 7) I try to use the device to complete a 1-action item like “Alexa, make it colder inside” to which I get “I didn’t get that” or it may just hear the request, but does absolutely nothing nor responds - these instances I check the log in the app and it lists what I said verbatim with no reason for just plain ignoring me.

Michael Buczek,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2022","This device is practically unusable. It fails in the fundamentals - to hear you, and it fails in it’s unique feature - to rotate towards you.

When I ask this device to do something, Echo devices in two (!) adjacent rooms respond before this one does - even if I stand just a few feet away. Its microphones seem very sensitive to other noise in its surroundings, so god forbid you use it in your kitchen when the fan is on or water is running.

If you ask it to play the headlines, it just shows random videos, so to get any content you have to walk up to it and touch the screen. That in turn makes the screen rotate away from you, unless you actually touch the content displayed in the middle.

If you try to control the lights, since its “hearing” is so bad, it will respond “I can’t do that” at least 50% of the time. Luckily the Echo I have in another room frequently hears me instead, and sets my light to the desired setting.

Whenever you speak to it, it’s supposed to turn towards you, and it does - if you tell it to rotate towards you two or three times.

Using the drop-in feature to connect to another Alexa device in the house takes about a minute, so I end up broadcasting messages to all the devices in the house instead.

The overall user experience is just incredibly bad, at least in my case where we have several other Echo devices and rarely are closer than 5 feet from the device. The only thing it does reasonably well is play music - if it hears what you ask for. Because what it plays may often be a total surprise.",1.0 out of 5 stars
L. R. Martin,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2024","I have used these products as assistive technology after a brain injury. I purchased this product to help me in my kitchen. Let's just say it is anything but helpful. All of the constant ads ~ the last thing I need are recommendations. The continual screen changing does not help with assistive issues I need. I need the recipe to stay up more thank 5 minutes. I need my calendar and messages to remain on screen.

Barbottawa,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2024","Very disappointed. This thing does not work. It is not user-friendly. I have eight different Alexa products and this one is the worst. Bought it in order to monitor my three doorbells. No instructions on how to do it. Phoned Amazon three times and nobody could tell me how to do it as they didn’t know. Seriously!

Finally, figured it out myself. However, I got it to show the front door, but even with a “wait for 30 seconds”, command followed by a “stop” command it will not turn itself off. Therefore, any time the doorbell is activated the screen stays on at the full volume. Very annoying especially if you’ve been gone and come back and it’s still on so we turned it off.

Further, you have to talk extremely fast for it to not interrupt and answer with something else that you didn’t ask about (Even if you keep your question short). Trying to get it to play some music is ridiculous if you’re trying to say the album and the name of the artist.

If you want an expensive screensaver, that’s very basic and not user-friendly that’s all you really get. Would definitely not recommend to anyone. It’s a waste of money.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Toney,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2021","I used to be in love with Alexa. The more time passes the worse our relationship has become. And, it’s getting worse every day. I purchased these new devices thinking that the issues we were having would be resolved and that we could rekindle the relationship. Sadly that has not been the case. The devices are frequently unresponsive and mostly respond inaccurately when they do. The follow feature is clunky and does not work at all in dimmed light. Time spend with support is wasted time I’ll never get back and resolved nothing. I absolutely hate this purchase and will be seeking a return. The echo devices are getting dumber, not smarter.

So… I returned these following Amazon’s guidelines immediately following a call from them when this review posted. I tracked the shipping and called on the day they received it. I was told that the refund would be issued and that it could take 3 to 5 days for it to post. Now, it is day 11 and I have not yet received my refund. I called and was told that the refund had not been released, for some reason, but that it was now and that I should expect it within 3 to 5 days. WTF!

Update: so recently my “smart” devices (all Amazon Echos) have started asking “Sorry, what device?” every time any of us make a request. Repeating it exactly the same gets the job done. So I spent a great deal of time chatting with someone who told me that I would have to delete/rename all of my groups and then hard reset all my devices. This is not the first time I’ve run into this. Only before the echo devices simply didn’t recognize the group and did nothing. Now at least it gets it on the second que. Clearly there is something going on with updates. If you marry into the Amazon “smart” world be prepared for a lifetime of wedded grief and frustration.",1.0 out of 5 stars
DPerry,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2021","I preface my review with this information. I have been an avid echo device user since they were released and I've owned and setup dozens of these devices including the 1st, 2nd, and now 3rd gen 10 show. This new device has been so annoying and unsatisfying that we have contemplated ""gifting"" this thing to someone we don't like.

To the review...we have this device setup in the kitchen, replacing the Echo Show 10 2nd gen.

Pros: The screen is large and the speaker sound is good. This is where the pros end.

Cons: I'll list a few of the cons but won't bore you with all.
1. Despite numerous setup wizards and responding to feedback regarding the screen bumping into the wall, the screen continuously bumps into a wall that hasn't moved in the months since I purchased the device.
2. Unlike previous models, this echo show doesn't listen very well. My family has to raise their voices so loud to get the attention of this device that other echo devices in the house respond instead of this one. You either raise your voice beyond what should be expected or you have to repeat commands each time you try to access the device.
3. The camera follow feature is now more entertainment than usable function. The family enjoys watching the screen turn to the opposite of the room when we try to get the show's attention.
4. The Live View camera connection to the Alexa App for iphone\ipad works only occasionally. For comparison, my Wyze cameras respond and can be viewed every time, in the Alexa app. You would think Amazon could get that right with their own app and hardware.

Final words...If you have money to waste and are happy to be a beta tester for a product that isn't ready for production release, this is the device for you.",1.0 out of 5 stars
G M Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2023","The idea was great .. 10"" screen Echo with motor drive that causes screen to follow you around the room to keep you in frame. GREAT idea, but after 3 motor driving follow started being a bit jerky, and then it would no longer work with WIFI. It could download stuff or advertisements, or push marketing from Amazon, but ask it a question and it would simply respond "" Check your wifi settings, cannot connect""
I rebooted, but no good.. So I went to Amazon (For the first time for a repair), and although it indicated it may be possible to replace a defective unit, there was no link or instructions on how to do so. Search Amazon help, went to all links, but nothing that would allow to send back for repair. While I like Amazon, this may be the last Amazon Product I ever buy. A $250 plus product worthless. Very sad way for a company I use for business and home to do business. We purchase over 50 K a year between individual and business accounts. My recommendation is BUYER beware.

J.B.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2023","My heart is broken. I just bought this item last week, during a prime day. The echo 10 is absolutely gorgeous - I love its size - that it doesn't use up that much surface space, that it follows you, the screen size, its image quality which, to me is awesome, its sound is fantastic. I bought it to control the few smart items I have at home, which I already do with my ancient little dots, but also got it super excited hoping to stream all the apps that I currently enjoy with my smart tv like Max, Peacock, Pluto, Disney, in addition to Hulu and Netflix. Unfortunately, with this echo you only have access to Hulu and Netflix. This is so, so, so disappointing. For the amount you pay, you should be able to download and watch all the apps you can currently enjoy with your fire-stick. If you mostly want to use it to make calls and control your home's smart stuff, which you can already do with your phone, it's nice, but I wanted it not only to control my Nest and show me who's at my door, I really wanted it to watch stuff. :-( I hope it's upgraded to include more streaming services.

There are so many great, helpful skills that she claims to be able to do. Once I properly added the skill and then asked her to use it, she routinely would give me some nonsense answer or half complete it. For example, when I wanted to see the babies nursery camera you have to say, ""Alexa, use your Nanit Skill to show me inside ___'s crib"". She would respond, ""hmm.. your search for Books to Read about Cribs brought up this search result"". It's this kind fo stuff endlessly.
It's maddening. She is helpful for listening to my audible book. However, unless I explicitly say ""Alexa pause my audible book"" she gets insane. If you accidentally say, ""Alexa off"". She responds with ""Hm I can't do that right now. Make sure your tv is properly set up to your fireTV account.""

After pausing audible, it only plays thru the sub woofer for several seconds making audio unlistenable, pressed the rewind button on show10 which caused several seconds of lag then it opened the last book I listened to on a different device. Seems like they’ve throttled its capabilities to push their vision of it being some sorta assistant. Can’t do things that generic tablets can. Syncing with other devices usually takes multiple attempts. Frustrating amount of time spent turning off notifications that I don’t care about so it won’t interrupt my music and things I’m doing.

Jake Evanston,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2023","This was fine until Amazon added Sponsored Ads that you cannot remove.

Previously we had Google Nest Hub Max, however, we use Ring and Amazon owns Ring, so we switched to this device for the built-in Ring functionality. Everything was fine until recently Amazon now shows nothing but Sponsored Ads all day long that you CANNOT turn off or remove.

We removed all the junk content that rotates on the screen by default as soon as we set up the devices (Settings > Home Content). However, with this new Sponsored Ads crap – that you cannot opt out of – or remove – we are considering getting rid of all Amazon devices.

Amazon also has begun annoying notification messages that say, “You purchased something from this author before, they have a new book out now, would you like me to buy it now?” This is highly annoying as well. I don’t want notifications to buy crap, nor do I want to see ads on a very expensive device. This device makes me want to unfollow everything on Amazon and never buy anything again on Amazon with all the ads that you cannot stop/remove.

I've purchased and upgraded a dozen times since Gen 1, sent each of my kids one as they moved out. The SHOW 10 is by far the least intelligent AI I've purchased. Devices that work with other Echos around the house do not work with the SHOW 10. It is VERY slow to respond, much slower than the DOTs or other SHOWS that I own... sometimes I query the SHOW 10, then have to go to another room to get an answer while the SHOW 10 is still thinking. Often, it thinks for a long period, then goes back to showing ads and pictures like it was never invoked. Constant ""The internet is not working"" from this one, so I go ask another fully functioning ECHO device.

Want to get your SHOW 10 to go blank for 5 minutes, then ignore you for 10 or even shut down? Ask it for the Latest News. You'll be lucky to get a weather report.

Jason,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2021","And now we are down to one star.

I've came to the conclusion that echo show is just an overpriced ad machine. I'm convinced deep in the bowels of Amazon labs (or whatever they call it) scientists are coming up new annoying ways to shoehorn even more advertising into this thing on a daily basis. I honestly keep hoping for this overpriced thing to die so I can justify tossing it in the trash.

Original review below.

So Alexa for your day has completely soured me on the echo show. There is no way to disable it and turning off continuous rotation in the options (what amazon suggests to remove/reduce it) just makes it appear more. It's been going strong for the last 20 minutes as i add this update.

Look I get that Alexa can do all kinds of stuff I don't need a dedicated slide telling me to ask different things. I won't be recommending or buying another echo show until something is done about it.

Original, original review below

I'd say this echo show is just okay for the price. It is nice to have the 10"" screen in our kitchen to replace the previous 5"" show.

I don't like how the screen feels unstable when you touch it or how the motion feature will place the screen off center because of the camera placement. I turned the feature off the first day I had it.

Why is there a full screen slide called ""Alexa for your day"" that you can't turn off? It's like Amazon wanted a more annoying option than the ""try"" banner they put at the bottom of every slide. Ironically it's the only slide that doesn't include the ""try"" banner.

Overall all I'm happy with the purchase but annoyed by the bloat especially at this price point.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Ron in Florida,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2021","With great hopes & expectations, I packaged up my old Show and shipped it to a family member. A most important feature, for me, was the ability of the new Echo Show 10 to remotely access its camera and get a live view of the inside of our home. Tirelessly, I’ve opened my phone app, selected Devices, chose Cameras, and then selected my brand new Echo Show 10. The accompanying photo shows what it’s response. This happens every time, without exception! I could live with its intermittent following, but this failure is inexcusable. My plans to subscribe to Amazon’s Guard Plus are out the window. If it’s not going to let me view the interior of my home, there’s surely no reason to waste additional money.
Update (Same Day): Upon posting my review, I received an email regarding my problem. A call was apparently attempted but the phone only rang once & then my answering was not acknowledged. Nonetheless, I was given enough info to enable me to ultimately solve my problem. Better information, on the part of Amazon, could have enabled me to accomplish my goal without registering a negative review to begin with.
I upped my rating from 1 star to 4. It’s definitely a good product, but far better instructions and help info would have prevented the frustration to begin with, and a 5 star rating might have occurred.
Update: 8/29/21 My wife, who seldom listens to what I say, obviously hears better than Alexa. Song or videos begin when a command to turn a light on is giver, or she’ll ignore the amount of time stated when told to start a ten minute timer. It’s getting worse and worse, every day. If didn’t have 13 echoes in the house, I’d be switching to their chief competitor.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Pat Kelly,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2023","I purchased the Alexa 10 Show along with the matching sub wolfer. My objective with this purchase was to have a kitchen computer and stereo that would do Alexa type things but most specifically show recipes and play music. I thought the screen tracking feature would be cool as the screen would move left to right tracking my wife in the kitchen displaying her recipes as she cooked dinner. Also as the kitchen tend to be the primary place in the house for gathering, I wanted a good sound system to play music.
The Show 10 tracking feature isn't great and it often rests itself in a direction that can't be seen. So it tracks but when it looses the person its tracking it doesn't return to center. In my case it tends to stop at all the way left or all the way right, which is typically where someone steps far enough out of sight from
the device. When it does this it impairs your ability to view the screen from a distance and is annoying. I quickly found myself turning this feature off. So this no longer was a selling point of the product.
Next were recipes and the display. So by default Amazon loads this product up with setting that ensure the greatest amount advertisements. At initial setup you have a device that is following you around the room tracking your position displaying ads. Amazon NO ONE WANTS THIS!!! I didn't purchase this device to force feed me ads! To turn this feature off you need to Google it, find the others who thought this was annoying and follow their instruction to change these setting as it isn't straight forward.
OK, now you can upload photos, display some weather and have it display some fun and useful things, on to recipes. My wife likes to find recipes on the web or share recipes with friends. We'll out of the box this product isn't good for that scenario as it doesn't by default have a web browser loaded on it. That's right, again I had to go to the web to figure this one out. You have to go into settings to enable a web browser. OK, did that now back to recipes. By default Alexa wants you to use the recipes from their app. The process is ""Alexa show me oatmeal raisin cookie recipes"" and it brings up their app and gives you some selection. This is fine for many but my wife has specific recipes she likes. To get your personal recipe onto the display you need to download another app, configure it and load your recipes into that app. After this your good to go.
After all this we determined simply moving our laptop into the kitchen for this would have been easier. Even an android or apple tablet would have been easier and more useful. Had we simply purchased a new Android tablet we could have loaded Alexa onto it had we wanted. So as a computer screen, it is sub-par.
Next is the sound system. By itself the Alexa Show 10 has mediocre sound, no bass. We'll thankfully we also purchased the Alexa subwoofer as paired on Amazon Prime. Unfortunately after a couple hours on the phone with Amazon tech support we were never able to get the sub to pair with the Show due to 5GHZ WIFI settings. That's right, the sub doesn't pair via Bluetooth. It has to pair across your WIFI and because we have 5G we were told by Amazon it wouldn't work. So as a kitchen stereo it was inadequate.
So in the end the tracking feature works but not well, the screen works but a tablet or laptop is better and easier. The default configurations don't enable you to do much more then see advertisements and the sound system isn't all that good. I spent many hours setting it up to get it close to what we thought it would be out-of-the-box and turned off features I thought initially were selling points. Additionally not getting the sound system to work properly due to my WIFI network was super frustrating and disappointing. For my family and what we needed this product to do for us, it failed.",2.0 out of 5 stars
LegoDude,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021","I grabbed this out of curiosity, not need. I had the 2nd gen 10"" show in my great room where this is now sitting, and I also have an 8 and 5"" 2nd gen Show in my bedroom and at the office, so I'm used to all of these. My first gen Show went to my mom's.

Still can't set up with a phone? I had to manually type everything into the screen, wifi, my account, etc. Then it went and found updates, updated itself, and then I had to REDO the same info for my account and such. Very annoying in the age of easy confirmation on my phone for any Amazon activities. They ought to simplify setup so all you have to do is give an email address at the most on the screen, then get a confirmation via your phone or email that you want it to run.

Once that was done, you set up the rotation. You can limit it how far you want it to move in each direction..

Fortunately you can tell it to only rotate for certain activities, since I found far too often it hears something while I'm trying to ask something, and it pivots away from me. It does a decent job of pivoting to where you are if you're talking, but I think other than video calls or video playback, I wanted to leave it stationary. It often doesn't quite center itself back to the ""default"" location anyway, which means I don't see it well from the couch.

And, of course, this setting to ONLY move during video calls or video playback, doesn't work at all. I have that enabled, not the always option, and it still moves all over when people are talking to it for anything else like smart home commands...

Video calls worked well though, and it did a good job of tracking my movement as I walked around the room.

The sound is disappointing though. One of the big hopes I had for this was the base, with NO screen in front of it, may do better sounds out the front, where you would be sitting, rather than relying on reflecting sound off walls and such with the rear facing speakers. But nope, the sound is *NOT* at all improved. To me, music sounds a bit worse actually, not as full sounding, not as good a low end (though the Echo Show 2nd generation wasn't by any means an audiophile's dream). So the fact that this did not improve sound at all is a disappointment at this price point.

Screen is crisp and clear though, and the camera works well. It also has the privacy switch now for people who do NOT want the camera available even if they've disabled things like drop in.

Functionally it's all you'd expect it to be for most functions. Hopefully they tweak the location algorithms so it doesn't seem to hunt for who is speaking with the same jumps it has now.

But for a first attempt of theirs at this tracking option, it's a half pass for their score.

But ultimately I returned it since I was tired of it seeming to ignore my ""default"" angle, and it always ended up tilted off to a side somewhere, so we couldn't see it easily without talking to it and getting it to try to rotate back towards us constantly. Far more annoying than useful.",2.0 out of 5 stars

1. No trae aplicación nativas, no puedo abrir Spotify solo reproducir música, solo le puedes decir Alexa reproduce xxxx canción, pero no ves la aplicación de Spotify
2. Netflix si reproduce como app pero me costo muchísimo saber como ejecutarla, es lenta
3. Todas las demás apps Streamig son por Web no tiene app
4. Si ves Netflix y pones un temporizador tendrás un problema cuando termine, se congela y no funciona, deberás desconectar el alexa y reiniciar
5. Es un aparato super lento, se congela, la he desconectado 4 veces en una semana, porque se congela
6. No es muy funcionable, no pudes poner gadget en pantalla así como listas o un calendario
7. Su pantalla móvil si te sigue es cierto, pero muchas veces se pierde o queda perdida, no es muy funcional
8. La calidad de pantalla no es muy buena es como que tengas una tablet de las primeras que salieron
9. Esperaba un sonido mejor, claro tiene mejor calidad de sonido que sus anteriores alexas, pero esperaba más
10. No tiene botón de volver a inicio, esto es útil porque a cada rato se congela
11. Las aplicaciones son muy pero muy básicas, prácticamente no puedes hacer nada en sus aplicaciones

Lo bueno
1. Se ve bonita estéticamente
2. su sonido es decente, pero no es ultra bueno, lo catalogo 4/10

Si quiere algo funcional para ver TV o escuchar musica, comprate una tablet de buena calidad con un soporte y parlantes Bluetooth, yo tenia eso y estaba mejor

Si quieres algo estético para que se vea bonito y decorar compra Alexa

Es muy caro para lo que ofrece, no lo volvería a comprar ya que mi objetivo es ver videos en dicho aparato

FTB,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021","The new echo show 10 is pretty cool at first. It does exactly what it says it does. There are things it does well, and a few things that are in my opinion, unforgivable flaws.

Pros:
- A physical camera shutter that blocks the lens for privacy
- Motion swivel allows you to glance at more information from anywhere in the room (weather, security cam etc.)
- Allows custom photos for the background
- Electronic mic disconnect for privacy
- Can turn to face you when asking questions (what's the weather?)

Cons
- White power cord with black device? This is just bad design/no attention to detail.
- The camera shutter/blocker on the black device is white, making it look like a cheap sticker on the black bezel.
- Glitchy UI... most aspects of the user interface is responsive, except it takes multiple taps to go back a page.
- For those who are planning to use this as a smart photo frame, this is implemented poorly. There are no settings for how long to display each photo. No custom captions for each photo.
- Regardless of what you set the background to (nature photos, travel photos, custom photos), it rotates through photos but every other photo it rotates through, you are greeted with a page ""Alexa for Your Days"". The page is just full of ""things to try to ask Alexa"". This page is entirely unnecessary, obtrusive, and impossible to disable within the settings.
- The motion swivel feature works by tracking a person with the front facing camera. However, the camera is offset to the right side of the display...so relative to the camera frame, you appear to be farther left than you are if you get close. This results in the display turning too far left any time you want to touch the screen. This is a very bad design overlook (attached photo shows how far left the display turns when you get close to it). The easy solution is to put the front facing camera in the direct middle, where the microphone is. If you put to camera module to the right side of the display, it will swivel relative to your position facing the camera, not the display. I have no idea why they didn’t catch this problem before release. It’s like the hardware department and software department never even talked to each other in development of this product.

The last two cons are what made me take off 2 stars. Most of this device is really well thought out, except for two very annoying and obnoxious flaws that should have been thought of when this product went under testing by developers. Similarly to almost all Amazon devices, unnecessary information is thrust upon you in its user interface in the worst way possible.

Echo dot/speakers - If you ask Alexa a question, she'll sometimes follow up with unwanted suggestions on things to try asking it. No way to disable this.

Fire TV - Permanent Ads in the user interface/home that break up all your App rows. The ads are obnoxiously inserted in between all your applications, clutters the home menu and slows down the device as it tries to load 1 billion ads as you scroll. Again, no way to disable this... or even pay to remove ads.

Echo Show series - Every Echo show product has a variation of ""Things to try"" permanently plastered on its homepage. In the previous generation Echo Show 10, it was a tiny line on the bottom of your photos that was not removable. In this new generation Echo Show 10, it has now become an entire rotating constant page of unnecessary and unwanted advice to try Alexa skills or commands. The theme here is Amazon apparently thinks that people like unwanted information obnoxiously inserted in between personal/customized apps, Home Screen, and UI. This is bad design language and anti user-friendly. Makes everything a cluttered mess.

With the ""Alexa for Your Day/Things to try"" page constantly on rotation, it makes the Echo Show 10 feel like a store display model. We get it, we bought it, no need to advertise its abilities on the home screen for all of eternity.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Bryan,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2022","I bought this through the trade-in program. I am sending my Echo Show 8 back to Amazon for a credit toward the cost of this one. I thought I was upgrading, and I am, kind of. Buckle up for this review, it's a roller coaster of emotion.

The screen quality itself is great. It's like a swiveling iPad mini with a pretty amazing speaker attached. From there, though, the ""upgrade"" part is a misnomer.

After about a year of decent connectivity, my Echo Show 8 began giving me issues with video quality while on a drop-in or video call. I assumed that it was possible the hardware was showing its age. The best Amazon support had to offer is to reboot every last thing in the house, perform a blood sacrifice to the WiFi Gods, and say a prayer to St. Bezos for redemption. None of these things worked. At first I thought it was that the feral cat I sacrificed didn't please the WiFi Gods, so I tried using my neighbor's dog. That didn't work either. Rebooting my router, changing the WiFi channel, dancing in my living room naked wearing nothing but a lei, nothing worked. The video has been consistently laggy and pixellated. In addition, the audio began giving me issues as well. Enter new and improved Echo Show 10!

Or not.

I was super excited to get this, now I had something that would follow my face around the kitchen while I made futile attempts at cooking something gourmet. I could use this to make video calls and talk to my long-distance girlfriend and not worry about tying my hands up with my pesky iPhone. I was free to have great quality video AND have my hands free for Xbox sessions!

As soon as I plugged it in I could see the screen quality was much better than the previous 8"" screen I had grown accustomed to, the touch features just felt smoother. Then the first red flag. It dropped wifi 3 times trying to download the initial updates. It was 4 feet from my router. It finally rebooted from the update and...froze on the ""Echo"" screen. I restarted it and crossed my fingers and all 11 of my toes. Finally it booted and I could finish setting it up. But wait, why does this alert say it couldn't connect to the network? How is it shuffling beautiful 1080p images curated from the Amazon photo collection? Odd, but, it works.

So I tried a quick video call to check the quality and say ""Hi"" to the girlfriend. I waved and smiled and then dropped my hand. Then I counted to 5 and watched my visage on the screen finally do the same. Her reply made her look like she was dancing the robot, only I didn't hear any techno music in the background.

I am running a Nighthawk router that gives all of my other devices pure, unadulterated high-speed inter webs. I can stream 4k at 120hz to my television, I can play Xbox without lag and single digit pings. I can download entire movies in mere minutes. Why can't I make a video call with my Echo Show without it looking like an episode of Max Headroom? Why does Amazon refuse to address this wide-spread issue in their support topics and instead insist that somehow everyone on the planet just has a bad internet connection? As much as I like the convenience, I am seriously considering switching my smart home over to Google. At least they don't hide the fact that they are using us as a data mine to accelerate their plans of galactic conquest.",2.0 out of 5 stars
BW,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2024","I'm pretty tech savvy, and when it comes to tech, I typically like the latest and greatest because last years tech can easily be far less advanced.

When this device came out, I figured this would be the perfect companion for my kitchen. It's on the floor where I spend most of my time and due to it's size, my other smaller echo devices do better in bedrooms, bathrooms, etc. This floor is also an open concept design, so no other room is closed off to the kitchen.

At first, I was relatively happy with it. It did all the basic things an echo should do and it had a nice big screen to see the widgets and whatever skill you wanted to use. Over time, I've found that 99% of the time I'm using it to control the other smart devices in my home. The suggestions it makes are pretty useless, and I've found that it is more or less frustrating to use when trying to display a recipe or whatnot.

Also over time, it has become increasingly unresponsive when I tell it to do anything. It'll either not hear me and I end up having to yell from 20 feet away, or it'll wake but it will just think about what I've said and not understand or basically ignore what I've said. I've done a number of factory resets, retrained it to my voice, etc. This really doesn't seem to help at all. So, now... It's just taking up counter space in my kitchen and it does (sometimes) the same basic commands an echo dot would do.

I've really come to expect more from Amazons tech here. In today's day and age, this thing seems super basic and outdated compared to what new AI technology can do and Amazon should be a frontrunner to deploy something better than this piece of junk. They better come up with something fast, because Samsung and Google like to work together and if Samsung starts deploying a home assistant with Samsung tech and Google as it's assistant, Amazon doesn't have a chance.",2.0 out of 5 stars
FGSouza,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2024","I purchased the Echo Show and have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, I appreciate the sound and image quality, and its integration with other Alexa speakers is seamless. It's functional for audio, recipes, weather, and news.

However, some of the content itself is quite uninteresting (such as the polls), and the **advertisements** are a major annoyance for me. Lately, the ads have been showing more frequently, turning my Echo Show into a billboard in my kitchen. Despite repeatedly asking to not show certain ads, they persist. What's even more frustrating is that when I approach the screen to interact with the content (to press the unlike button), the ad immediately disappears, jumping to another screen without giving me the chance to dislike it.

I've tried unchecking options in the setup to reduce ads, but nothing seems to work. This issue with the advertisements is the main factor behind my disappointment and lower rating. If you don't mind having a billboard in your home, go for it.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Mark Masaki,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2023","New update, this turning Echo Show device suddenly lost its ability to connect to the WiFi. I tried everything and it still says out of range, but the other 20 smart devices in our home work fine. Unfortunately the tech support was of no help either. New technology can be interesting. While it worked for (for about half a year) the thing could turn its screen around and follow your every movement. Sounds Orwellian, but I figured whomever wants to waste their time to spy on me has to be crazy; Nothing to see here anyway, lol. I set mine to face the screen at me only when I say the waking word. It has issues following you in low light conditions and will tell you so when it does, which can be irritating from time to time. If I want privacy I can use the camera lens blocker, which is basically a thin plastic panel that shifts to cover the camera lens. I don’t think the audible privacy is a possibility but if I cared about that, I wouldn’t have a cell phone either. For the microphone issues, my other Echo devices sometimes answer for this Echo Show instead, and that can be annoying when you are asking to see or watch something in particular. Most annoying is when Alexa is telling you from a regular Echo that she does not have the capability to do “that” on this device. Nothing like a smart home device giving you a “Duh” moment. Positioning for acoustics while maintaining view ability can be quite challenging given the limited power cord and Wifi limitations in the average household, mine included. The sound though, was amazing; I could feel the power in the vibrations it exudes, as well as hear the crisp sound quality from the somewhat heavy cylindrical base that the screen rotates around. The touchscreen is kind of like a tablet, just not nearly as quick in reacting to tapping or swiping. In conclusion, I think this will improve with time, and for the money I spent on it, that was forgivable (at one third the cost of my iPad Air, this refurbished unit was a steal, at the time, though currently it is a paper weight). I don’t watch TV in my household and we don’t have to pay for cable service, so this was really the only thing we had besides our cell phones for viewing entertainment and getting the news, so for what it is worth, my family appreciated what it had to offer while it lasted. I cannot give this more than 2 stars due to the fact that no device I have ever possessed had “forgot” how to connect to WiFi.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Chas Brightly,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2023","This amazing device can have the volume turned to zero... for 2 seconds. Every time someone says Alexa (here or on in a Zoom call from across the country) the device swivels to look for them AND turns the volume up, creating instant feedback if using this as a second camera (which I do) from the main screen. I have to create routines replacing every action with one to do the action and then change volume to 0 on the device 5 seconds later. And it forgets to do this about 60% of the time. The rest of the time it works, and then resets the volume to 3.

Yes, it has been muted. Yes, it happens when I mute the device via phone app or the buttons or the on-screen controls. Yes, I did a factory reset. Yes I Googled. This is my third Show, the problem is in the software and is specific to this device. Whenever it needs to beep (the beeps are turned off!) the volume turns up at level 3 and stays there. No matter what. The minus volume button actually won't take it below 3 at all. In the app it's kind of amazing, you can turn it down and watch the bar actually slip back up to volume 3 regardless of how many times you pull it to 0.

The Echo Show 8 this replaced worked perfectly. This device, when told to connect to a Zoom meeting says ""try this on a zoom compatible device."" Nice. You have to tell it to ""open zoom"" instead. The Show 8 could actually join a meeting with a meeting code directly by voice command. We're moving backwards.

In case you think the fix to this is not talking to is, the device also turns the volume up randomly when making awful suggestions for what things I should buy WHILE I'm in the call, covering half the screen with a ""buy pasta now?"" popup. The only way to close it is to walk up to the screen and close it out, which also turns up the volume. Nice.

I also have a routine to turn off ""by the way"" suggestions daily, but this device doesn't care that I've specifically ordered it to NOT do that.

If you don't want to ever mute your device and just want a cool screen that follows you around, and you could get this under $99, there might be a use-case for you. Otherwise, get an Echo Show 1 from Woot for $25 to view your doorbell or view recipes. It takes up less room and can be forced into silence.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Caleb Evenson,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2022","The idea is very cool. My wife is an amazing cook and is always using her phone to follow her recipes/notes. I thought it would be great for her to be able to have recipes displayed for her on a large screen and scroll automatically without touching it with her flour covered fingers. Not to mention, we’re big sports fans so being able to watch a game while she was cooking meant she wouldn’t miss all the big plays. Or, listen to music while cooking.
The reality of how the Echo Show 10 operates is a completely different story.
The first thing my wife did was ask it to show recipes for “chili”. It pulled up TWO recipes. That’s it. We realized very quickly that the only recipes it will scroll and read out loud are VERY limited. And NOT from Pinterest. Yes, you can find other recipes from Food Network and a couple other places, but only using those respective apps. And it won’t read them or auto scroll.

Ok, we’ll figure out how to just use the Pinterest app.
And then it kept freezing. Wouldn’t scroll when looking through Pinterest. And the motion kept freezing and resetting. Then it forced closed the Pinterest app. Then it said “motion offline. Reset the device.”. Over and over.

Can’t watch a game unless it’s streaming on Prime. YouTube app works, but can’t use YouTube TV.
ESPN radio works, but can’t watch games.
“Silk”, Amazon’s version of a “browser”, is very limited.

While using the Pinterest app to follow a recipe, my wife asked the Show to play music. It closed the Pinterest app and opened music and she had to completely reload Pinterest and go find the recipe she was using. There is no switching between two functions, let alone finding a game to watch and switching back and forth. If we could even watch a game in the first place. Which we can’t.

The CONSTANT stupid ads is unbearable. And no way to shut them off.

Asking it to show us a security camera was cool, but it took FOREVER to load the picture. And we have the best internet available and the best modem/router on the market. So it’s not that.

I’m sure this thing is fine as a novelty…watch some YouTube videos, drop in on friends/family that have a Show as well.
But all the other functions can be done on a Dot. Ie: set a timer, add an item to your shopping list, play music, etc…
For what we wanted it for, it isn’t worth it.

We have an extra iPad. Going to get a stand for it and have it semi-permanent in the kitchen.
It will do everything we wanted in the first place, and more, and better.
Except follow you. And who cares. You can have that.

DaytonaDan,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2023","I have owned a lot of Echo devices over the years and this one is definitly the worst of the bunch. The worst setup experience of any Amazon device I have ever owned.
It was a mess straight out of the box, despite the whole ""online setup"" thing, which would be a good idea if it worked. It did not, at least not very well. After attempting to update on startup, which took forever, it crashed, or said it did. Blaming a ""network error."" Which I knew was BS (I have an Amazon eero mesh wifi 6 system) . I told it to continue and then went into my alexa app on my phone and saw it was listed. Once I clicked on it there, it magically completed its update and came up but still had major issues.
The biggest was its refusal to play any music. Just a long silence followed by ""I am having trouble connecting to Amazon music..."" All my other echo devices were working fine. I spent several days attempting to fix this with reboots and option changes, with no success.
I finally resorted to a factory reset. That resulted in yet another slow boot and update and forced me to manually enter wifi network and account info.... but it finally came up And music finally worked for unknown reasons. The new speaker arrangement on this device , another supposed major improvement, was OK but nothing special in my view.
As for the ""smart motion"" thing, the major new gimmick with this model... it's a waste of time too in my view. Loses track of you if you are too close and move to quickly, like when sitting down in a chair next the Echo 10. then it is facing the wrong way and you manually have to turn the screen to face you. Sort of defeats the purpose. So best just to turn it off.
If I had not bought this on sale when it was heavily discounted, I almost certainly would have returned it right away. But will give it a little more time in hopes I will find something to like about it.
Still, I would advise everyone else to save yourself some grief (and a ton of money) and go with the 8 inch model, which is far more solid. I have several of those and have never had any problem with them.",2.0 out of 5 stars
a_yu,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024","The wifi stopped working on the device 3 years after purchase. Amazon said the device was outside of the 1 year warranty and offered a 15% discount on purchase of a new one.

Because the price had increased to $250, the device was actually more expensive to purchase the 2nd time even with the discount. I would not pay more for a 2nd device that originally broke on its own.

Even if I considered buying this again, I have no confidence that the device will not break again.

With my experience on this device, I'm not buying anymore Echo devices (I think a simple kitchen timer is sufficient and will last longer).

BigBurton1,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2024",This is literally the first Amazon Alexa device that I have owned. I originally owned Google home and switched to the Alexa because everyone I knew claimed that it was so much better and that she was much better at listening and following directions. I have had nothing but constant issues with Alexa for the past 3 months of ownership. There are three people in the household and no matter who asks her to play Spotify or Pandora she will not play. Today I asked her to play songs nine times in a row and not once did anything turn on and play. We have had to unplug and master reset this device multiple times. We have had to install an uninstall Amazon Alexa on our cell phones. I'm not necessarily sure what the point of owning the device is because it doesn't do half of what I ask it to do. I'm frustrated to the point where I would like to throw this thing in the middle of the street and drive over it with my car 10 or 15 times?!! Basically I think it's only achievement is listening to everything that happens in the house and storing all of that information for the government to review. Because I can't even get this thing to play the radio. I'm about tired of it I hate it to be honest,2.0 out of 5 stars
Andrew,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2024","Sound quality isn’t near as loud as I would expect from the size of this Amazon Echo device. Connectivity to other applications is nearly impossible and very difficult to get it to play a specific playlist. It always seems to display ads and you can’t seem to get it to only roll through your pictures. The Alexa app is not very intuitive, even for me (I work in cybersecurity) I use tech all day long. The way it swivels is interesting but I feel it’s unnecessary. Default setting lets you know when your deliveries are arriving. Not so great when ordering gifts for children.

Sally,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2021","Still in the “bugs” stage. One great bonus I’d like to report is that Amazon tech assistance program is EXCELLENT. Informed & responsive, not to forget to mention , empathetic!

Now down to review of Alexas skills!

‘Motion was erratic’ & did not sync with my locations. Even a factory reset with tech did not fix. Finally just turned that skill off! Too maddening to have to continue to instruct Alexa to follow me, as the screen wandered around its orbit, seemingly at will. Commands to Alexa were followed erroneously. Grrrrhh!

Another skill needing tweaking was in the movie watching. Movies came with ads. After the break for an ad, the movie would not resume, although a blurb said ‘movie will resume after the ad’. Yep another call to tech. They said ‘Now it should be fixed’. No idea what ‘solution’ they intended to employ. Having already gotten the erroneous info from ‘motion tech’ that the motion prob was fixed, when in fact it was not, I requested the ‘ad, resume movie’ tech to stay in the line while I did a check run. Twice! No fix. So, you guessed it, no ability to watch a movie from start to finish. I spent hours trying to fast forward the movie past the ad, then came another pesky ad. And another case of ‘no movie resume’. Hmmmm. I finally quit trying to watch movies.

Last identified bug so far was dear Alexa, if I asked for the weather, she would say. “Hmmm, I don’t know that”. If I asked for a certain track She had just played, she would say “I don’t know that. Here’s a selection you might enjoy.”. More times than I care to report, she was lost in space!

Oh yes. Then there was the the surprise that the ‘relaxation sounds’ tracks ran for about 45 Sec. They would not loop! Alexa kindly offered to let me have a free trial of a PAID SERVICE REQUIRED to get a 10 hour loop!

What is free? What skills operate as required & requested?

When volume was high, I had to yell to Alexa to get her to hear me. My Alexa on my Bose Soundbar system has enough sensitive microphones built in that she can hear you and responds to commands at very high volume. Spoiled by a skill that works!

I’m weary of reporting bugs. I actually speak to Alexa in an unfriendly tone, cause I am crazy enough to think she can do better if she’d just focus. Lol!

In fact what I bought Alexa for, does not function to a degree that it’s useable. I have only 30 days to return it. I don’t WANT to return it, but it’s a long way from having bugs fixed! I’m not sure an update WILL fix these serious bugs. At least not in 30 days.

I have read many a reviewer’s lament (not about Alexa or Echo Show 10 3rd Gen) that they are now stuck with unsatisfactorily working techie toys they knew had bugs. I think I won’t join that crowd.

Get crankin Amazon! Give us a long return window on newly offered bells& whistles, to HELP YOU fix the issues they have. I’m doing the work of isolating bugs & reporting them to your technical department! Cut me some slack!

Thanks! I have great faith in Amazon products. I intellectually know they bugs fixes are coming, but I emotionally do not want to ‘hang in there’ for an unknown period of time.

I think I’ll take this up with the technical department., which I repeat is EXCELLENT! !",2.0 out of 5 stars
Ben,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","Short version:

It's a minimal viable product that's trying to do too many things, most of which it does not do well and are of no value to Echo users. The few things you want it to do e.g. pictures and display the music you are playing through a Sonos device, it does a very mediocre job at best.

Long version:

I've been excited about the Echo Show 10 since Amazon announced it last Fall. I grew concerned that they delayed launch until after Christmas, making me think they didn't have the kinks worked out. Overall, it's a nice looking device from Amazon, but far from earth-shattering. It's beyond annoying how basic it is. Let's face it, it's a more focused UI on a Fire tablet, glued to an Echo. I feel a lot of people giving reviews here have very low expectations and/or never saw other comparable devices before.

Pros:
- The screen is nice... it's the first thing you notice
- The security camera function is a plus
- Seems sturdy

Cons:
- Amazon forces you to view an ""Alexa for Your Day"" screen (not being able to turn this off is enough for me to not buy another Echo Show 10... It is beyond ridiculous that Amazon would force their loyal customers to have this bloatware on their devices). All I wanted this device for is to show me the weather and photos of my family!!! That's it!
- The main thing people likely buy the device for (display photos) Amazon relies heavily on the user for how they look. In other words, you have to crop them to horizontal view or else Amazon throws up a funky looking buffer on both sides. Probably more annoying is that it feels like the pictures are random. It's the same order (my experience linking to an album with over 550 pictures). And, the pictures are random on how long they stay on the screen. I'd like to think Amazon can put together a better photo software program for Shows than whatever this is. Most of us use them to see pictures of our family, and easily share with our parents (our kids' grandparents). Hence, why it would be great to have better control of the device for showing said pictures.
- The Show 10 doesn't display what's playing for music when it's playing through my Sonos device/other speakers.
- The screen goes dark whenever the room goes dark and from what I can tell there's not way to change that. It would be nice to have the Show 10 show pictures when I watch TV or a movie, which 80% of the time is at night when the room is dark (for effect). If it's in a dim room the device goes dark after awhile if it's quiet. Again, no way to change that from what I can tell.

I'm really hoping for a Software Update soon that gives users more control. It's so disheartening to see the same tired ""Alexa for Your Day"" suggestions come up constantly like I'm in Groundhog's Day. Again, I just want this to feature photos of my family, the weather, and communicate to my elderly parents who want the same. Overtime I could see myself adding News and Stocks. I would also love to have my security cameras part of the Show 10's rotation.",2.0 out of 5 stars

PAPA.AMG,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2023","I have owned Alexa devices for years now. With this most recent purchase I wanted to put it through it's paces for a several months - now 8 months, before leaving a review.

To sum it up, Alexa as a whole is a huge letdown. Very basic questions cannot be answered as Alexa does not know. Yet, with Google or SRI, they can. How is it Amazon has not made any customer facing improvements? It is just a basic search engine, nothing more.

It is slow connecting to cameras, loses internet from time to time, even though with over 50 devices in the house, this is the only one to drop connection.

Then, it suppose to move to your voice, perhaps 70% accurate at best, or put another way, 30% or more not accurate.

Then, it does not pick up my voice at times and I have to raise my voice, unlike other Alexa devices that do pickup my voice.

It just does not help my everyday life, more a gimmick. My Samsung S23 Ultra and Iphone 15 Pro, those help me throughout the day. They actually bring value to my life, making it easier, finding answers. Alexa, nope.

The basic infrastructure of Alexa is so behind, no AI whatsoever, no 'assistant' features. This is why I canceled my Astro order, it provides me nothing of real tangible value.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Ed Evans,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2024","As a basic Echo device, it works fine. The screen is nice enough as is the sound. The poblems, however, outweigh the positives on this device.

1. Camera connectivity - I wanted to use this to check in on my house while I was away for a few days. Well, sometimes it worked and other times it didn't. I had someone reboot the device for me and it seemed to work for a short while. It's just not reliable as a camera. Conversely, some of the inexpensive dedicated security cameras I bought at the same time worked flawlessly. When the camera did work, it was SUPER laggy when I would rotate it using the Alexa app.

2. Screen content - Geez, I didn't buy this device so that you could try to sell me more stuff. The type of content that shows up on the screen should be 100% customizable and I shouldn't have to put up with ads. Maybe there's an option that I haven't found yet. But, please hear this Amazon, you are not nearly as customer obsessed as you say you are if you don't give us 100% control over the content.

3. Performance - The device just seems underpowered. Any kind of network call / commands don't work as well as they should.

Overall, this feels like a fairly polished prototype - not a product that was ready to deliver to customers.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Kevin S McKee,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2023","My wife wanted this as a device to use in the kitchen for recipes and watching videos. As we have used it over the months, I have turned off more and more features until it is now functioning like an Echo Dot.

- Rotation - You need a flat space at least 2ftx2ft where NO ONE will set anything else. Otherwise, the Show will stop at an odd angle with an error that it bumped into something, waiting for you to reset it. Motion is now turned off.

- Screensaver content - It will default to screensaver content that will feel invasive. I selected the folders of pictures that I wanted to show. But it also will show pictures ""on this day"". These may be anything: pictures of checks, drivers licenses, screenshots, medical procedures. I had to search through the menus, and then reset the Show to turn this feature off.

- Video - The only native options are Prime, Hulu, and Netflix. We use a lot of Youtube TV, HBOMax, and Apple TV. These only work through the Silk browser which requires using the touch screen. The Show is much less responsive than a Fire tablet, and because the screen rotates you need to hold it still while you try to get the touchscreen to respond. And the Silk browser kinda sucks. So, we do not watch videos.

-Recipes - This is a mixed bag. The biggest problem is that Alexa can't understand us while the kitchen fan is going. It's not that loud, but we need to turn it off to get her to respond. And when we ask for a recipe, the results are very inconsistent. We end up using the Silk browser, which as I stated before, sucks.

So, it's a pretty good Echo and we use it for setting timers and playing music. But I find it infuriating as a Show, and would not recommend.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Nathan B. Mohr,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2023","Overall, it’s nice. Great screen and audio, and motion is cool (although I’m not sure if it as cool as I was hoping). There has been some bugs where I turn motion off and it still moves working in the kitchen. Sadly, it doesn’t allow you to stream on several platforms, e.g., HBO, Vudu, Paramount. The home screen is not the most user-friendly or intuitive. I bought this on sale but noooo way I would buy this at MSRP.

Update: returned this immediately. When I was FaceTime in with family, the stream was quite poor, compared to my FaceTime. And then it had the audacity to throw up an advertisement during my FaceTime. I was very disappointed in the user interface. You cannot download mini apps and it restricts what you can do. There are some things you can’t change without voice to Alexa. It repeatedly tried to find ways to shut off my setting to send data to their company even though I had it turned off. There was probably 50 settings for home content that I had to turn off, many of which were ads and/or funneling you to buy more things on Amazon. To me, it seems more like an ad machine and I would recommend this. Could’ve been a great device and they missed the mark.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Michael B,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2021","I bought 4 of these for my family so we could video call each other. They do not come with instructions so that is a big frustration. None of us feel the product is worth the money and the we expected more. I would say this is the dumbest of all our Alexa devides (and I have 5 echo dots and 1 Echo show). Perhaps it's video aspect of the echo show that slows it down -- but she has difficulty matching the prowess of the echo dot. The screen is great and the ability to have the Echo Show display uploaded pictures is fabulous. So many good memories scroll by. That said, it's wretched at filming us during video calls. It moves in weird ways and does not capture us well. We often move to sit in front of it -- and that defeats the purpose of the Echo Show which is supposed to follow us as we speak. It does follow but it generally zooms out so we're very small in the video call. We cannot figure out how to get the Echo Show to zoom in on us -- and responds saying she cannot zoom when we ask her to do it. That said, we watch the Echo show zoom in and out on us as it tries to figure out how to best film us -- so it ""can"" zoom in and out. This goes back to the lack of documentation on what the Echo Show can do. All 4 families have agreed it is not worth the money but returning all 4 would be difficult because they're spread out across the continental US. So... while I've decided to not return them, yesterday my daughter called me via Google Duo on her smart phone -- and we used an iPad. That's sad and unfortunate. My hope is that Amazon updates the Echo Show's software and we get a better product as a result. Until then, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend the Echo Show 10 as something someone should buy. Also, my wife is frustrated that the Echo Show does not have a battery that allows it to be somewhere without an AC adapter. Without a battery, it cannot be moved without having to reboot -- so it's not something you can just move around.

Lastly, Amazon allowed us to pre-buy the Echo Show and gave us a $100 discount if I bought a second one. It would not give me a discount however, if I bought 4 -- so I had to have my wife buy 2 and I bought 2. Why make me do that Amazon? Just give me $100 of for every two I buy -- whether it's 2, 4, 6, or 8.

Anna C.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2023","I’d give a one star but the only good thing is the sound quality. We’ve had the Alexa Echo Show for 5 months exactly. The first month or two it was really good, we loved it. It took me awhile to get used to it because it absolutely does not have the better qualities of the Google home. After that it started “glitching.” We’d have to ask it multiple times to do a task, it would just show the blue line at the bottom and say that it didn’t hear us or it couldn’t process the request, even if we were standing right it front of it yelling (you all know what we’re talking about). We listen to music a lot on the device and now maybe 85% of the time we ask and it says it’s going to play but then nothing happens. We have unplug it and troubleshoot at least 1-3 times per day. If we ask it a question it rarely even pulls up an answer or says “hm, I can’t help with that.” It’s horrible. For the amount of money you have to spend on this, you’d think that it would be far more superior that the Google hub that is almost half the price. Honestly what the point of spending the amount on this product. It’s the same with the Echo dots. We spent $400 on all these devices and it has done nothing but give us headaches. The only maybe good thing is that when it does decide to play music, the sound quality is good.

What I love:
- video at my fingertips (don’t use tho)
- still working

What I don’t like (and kills the whole thing while often making me angry too)
- ads on the screen that often get stuck into repeating ads instead of switching back to the picture frame I have as default
- wayy too often and not configurable amount of times they occur weather alerts (one can turn them off entirely or suffer)
- settings don’t persist - at least the ones that reduce Amazon’s annoying ads (don’t they get money *anywhere else?!

I find it so astounding that
I never heard one interrupting commercial from the non video echo, but as soon as I paid a premium for the extra ability of video, amazon thought it necesssry to ruin the entire experience with ads…a lot of them!!!! I can’t fathom it.

awesomity,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2021","The rotating hardware is fun. It only makes sense if you plan to place this device on an island. The screen quality is fine. Sound quality is good. The user experience is poor. This is my first Alexa device. I am so underwhelmed by the user experience. My kids keep complaining my did I get this dumb device. They have the Google assistant in their rooms.

User experience:
- Poor voice recognition. If room is slightly noisy, Alexa just will hear made up things.
- Alexa does not understand, guesses what the user wants and provides annoying user experience. Something simple like ""stop music"", can randomly result with some Netflix movie.
- Alexa assumes shopping intent for too often and for ridiculous commands. Feels like a pushy salesman. Shopping experience is mediocre. I order dog food once. You get a few options but Alexa failed to specify two weeks shipping. Dog could not wait.
- Alexa handle poorly doing two things at once. If it's playing music and I ask a general knowledge question. The UI will flash the answer for a split second. The voice answer somethings works.
- Alexa has a hard time switching context. If a game is playing Alexa can't do much else.
- Alexa gets stuck in an experience. It's difficult to exit it. It took awhile to learn to say ""home screen"" to exit. Sometime there is a glitch that the screen freezes, you can still see the previous experience but Alexa doesn't know about it.
- Poor smart home integration (might not be Alexa's fault), for example Waze doorbell shows a rotated video.
- Non-existing integration with popular services, like zoom conferencing, chat apps and photo services.

What works?
- Very very simple things and very specific features.
- Play music usually works, though somethings ends up in Netflix.
- Take photo is fun. Though can't delete photo. A real pain to find out to delete it using a computer.
- Drop-in works and respects video privacy.
- Used as a remote security. Very basic user experience. Could have need much better.
- Remind me ____. Works well.
- Alarm works, and time works as expected.
- News is OK.
- A few games are nice.

Joshua R Moore,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2021","To start with, anyone with any sort of vision problems might want to stay away. The first thing they did was shrink all of the fonts so everything is extra tiny on this one. So what if it covers my damn pictures. It’s not meant as a photo frame. Even with photos off the text is ultra tiny and only on outer edges of the screen. Anyone who complained about text on the echo show covering their pictures need to buy an Amazon photo frame or something
Second, they’ve got this annoying hyperactive adaptive brightness feature that can be a pain to turn off that if you just look away for one second, turn the brightness down all the way.
Third the adaptive color. Yuck.
I have used the echo show line since it came out and I’ve been very happy with it the previous models the font size has been perfect. This one however, they decided that all people are going to sit on top of it so we can shrink the font down. Amazon that isn’t the case I know at least for me I like to sit a little bit across the room from it I don’t sit on top of it which brings me to the next failure. The motorized screen is very nice and it does a nice job of following. But it is overly overly codependent on asking you if it moved correctly for you but the problem with this is? It asks You in an on screen prompt that slides in from the side that you have to walk over to the device and click on it and it’s in a very small font and it covers up what you’re trying to do very annoying. It be nice if Alexa would just ask you she hashe had done what you wanted her to do, Like she does on other things. Nope they have this annoying slide over panel in a small font that you have to walk over to it and click to get it dismiss it off the screen how wonderful Amazon and you had how long to designe the software?. Is designing software that difficult from home? ( no, it isn’t )
I can’t help but be disappointed after spending $250 on what I was sure was going to be another slam dunk excellent Amazon device when it just seems like it was half baked. Small fonts, hyperactive adaptive brightness, on-screen prompts from Alexa asking you if she had move the way you wanted her to that you have to dismiss with a finger click.

Nerd_iNC,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2021","We have an echo dot and it has been useful for playing music, setting alarms and finding out quick information. So When I saw the echo show and watched the reviews I was thrilled to get one.
All the reviews I watched were false, Echo show is worse than echo dot. Hard to believe?

Lets me start with the good part,
-The screen is great. Picture quality is really good.
-The sound quality is really really good and loud.
-The follow feature is pretty nice. I used it when making breakfast and was trying to watch a Netflix show.
-And did you know you can also attend WebEx and zoom calls? Those are really good features.

That's where the good stuff ends.
-The follow feature is slow to react and it never faces me. The camera was always pointing at my left shoulder.
-Alexa does understand simple voice commands but not anything complex. For simple commands Alexa works great, but when you ask something like ""Are blue berries safe for dogs"", she does a bing search and never really answers the question. I have to look at the screen for the search results. I could have just googled myself, which I did and google gave me the answer and I didn't have to look at the screen or the results.

-Echo Show is also slow to respond and misunderstand some commands;
""Alexa play newsy""; ""Playing Music from your amazon playlist""
-When watching a news channel, ""Alexa Stop"" ""Alexa pause"" ""Alexa close"" ""Alexa shutdown"" don't work, I found that ""Alexa cancel"" works. I am not sure why I need to cancel the news feed, but ok.

If you try something like play ABC or CNN those work immediately, maybe its a preference or I guess selective hearing? The above test was done after the news channels were added to the Alexa app and I had customized the settings.

-Another thing it does, is when I am watching a video like news or Netflix, Echo show will either freeze or just stop the video and switch to the home screen.

It has become so frustrating using Echo show that I just stopped using it for the past few days and use my phone to do everything else. Its is so bad that I would prefer just using a simple android tablet that costs less than half and it will do everything I need and more.

Lyn,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2022","I have a couple Echo devices, and was really excited to add a Show to the mix. The drop-in calling is great, full stop. I can chat remotely with my wife while she cooks dinner, and it keeps her in frame. No more staring at the ceiling and wondering where she went.

That's about where ""great"" ends and the problems start stacking up. Let me be clear: I have owned this thing for 3 days and already have a list of dealbreakers. It's hard to believe I'm this disappointed so soon.

1. Live view doesn't work. I was under the impression I was getting a bonus indoor security camera of sorts, but no. The Alexa app appears to connect, sound plays -- I can even MOVE THE CAMERA -- but the video feed is black. Like I said above, the video feed in the ""drop-in"" feature works... so what's the deal? People have been complaining about this issue for a YEAR now, with no resolution.

2. You know what would be cool? Is if you could listen to music while following a recipe in the kitchen. Unfortunately music closes the browser, and the browser turns off the music. There's no workaround. Thanks, Amazon.

3. You know what would be cooler than cool? If the recipe you were following (while not listening to music) stayed open while your hands were full of food and you were busy following said recipe. But it doesn't. The browser times out and kicks back to the home screen after 5-10 minutes (I haven't timed this yet, just cursed at it). People have also been complaining about this for a year, since release. Why would you market this as a kitchen assistant and then make it incompetent at holding a RECIPE?

I really, really love the follow-cam for drop-in. But that's, like... that's it. Just typing this out feels so ridiculous -- these features you'd just assume would work are completely borked. Given that Amazon hasn't fixed them for a YEAR after release doesn't give me much faith that they ever will.

At $250, I'm returning this thing and will be on the hunt for a better solution. Such a bummer.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Mr. Apodaca,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2022","I bought the echo 10 because it intrigued me! I really liked Alexa’s along with the smart plugs etc. but I have noticed this year that they have slowed down and are dumber than the previous years! I have to ask Alexa either 2 or 3 times to turn on the lights or the plugs. Either it doesn’t understand or it just sits there thinking. Frustrating!

Now I possibly return the echo 10 since they haven’t fixed the issue with the iPhone 13 models. As I have uploaded the pictures. When I log in into the Alexa app it doesn’t shows me my devices. Nor does it let me see my security cameras. I have reseted my iPhone hoping it would fix the problem and nothing. I tried using only WiFi and login in the Alexa app but nothing, I have even used my Mobil data to see if it would make a difference but it was un successful. I have informed Amazon about this problem and one of the reps was helping me said that they knew about the problem and I lost connection with him/her, so I decided to try it again the same day and I had a different person and we chatted but i didn’t get no where. In conclusion he told me that the problem was fixed and that he would close the chat.

Well there’s the proof they haven’t fixed the problem with the app. Pictures don’t lie.

Although I can log in onto Alexa app on my android device just fine when I’m at home but it’s annoying that I can’t access the security cameras at the touch of my fingers when I’m away. Also it’s not just the security cameras that I can’t access, it’s also the echo 10 camera (just as it shows on the picture)",2.0 out of 5 stars
Dwight Schrute,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2021","I bought the new Echo Show to put in a bedroom to essentially be a nursery camera and echo device in one, replacing a second generation Echo dot. The screen on this bad boy is no joke.. it is large and impressive. This device is also very heavy if you are like me and read the specs but it doesn’t translate to what the device will actually look like IRL:). Now, seeing how this device isn’t touched by any hands, I have 2 huge problems with it. First, it keeps appearing in “do not disturb” mode. How can this be? There’s no scheduled DND time in the Alexa app, and the room’s occupant can’t talk or reach. Similarly, the motion in the camera is turned “off,” as per the motion icon in the upper right corner with a slash through it. I don’t want it to “follow” anyone - I want to be able to drop in on it from other shows or the app and see the room. Yet half the time, the device has rotated (on its own) to the screen being facing the rear against the wall. Which brings me to another point - why is there such a wide rotating radius on this device? How would one go about using it anywhere except on a counter or tabletop where this would be beneficial? I’ve tried adjusting the base so that it can’t rotate to view the wall, but motion is definitely OFF and yet it keeps moving. Similarly, back to the DND issue, this is the first and only Echo device we’ve ever had where you turn DND off in the app, only for it to turn back on when you then close the app. Finally, this is definitely not a security camera replacement and you cannot just monitor the room without a drop-in. I have yet to see anywhere that I could pano or scan the room, either, which is shown in the video and is misleading. Another reviewer suggests that’s an additional service. While I haven’t verified that aspect, I can say that there’s a camera feature in the app that won’t load the room - but drop in works just fine. All in all, this device has loads of potential. The sound is great. The screen is bright. It’s just not ready for primetime and I’d say it doesn’t work as advertised. Major bummer!",2.0 out of 5 stars
BJC,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2023","While this product does work with many smart home devices, and is probably more diverse in its ecosystem compared to some of its competitors, it fails in so many other ways. one way it feels is definitely in its search capabilities. Compared to one of its popular competitors. It fails miserably. When I search for a particular recipe that seems to be fairly straightforward it often shows me recipes that are not even close to what I requested. As far as the motion capabilities of this device, it needs some work. One particularly annoying thing that I found was that it didn’t seem to center on me when I was speaking to it. It seemed to be a little off-center. And quite frequently I had to call it over to me in order to see the display. Finally, the interface is pretty challenging. While eventually, I could find all of the things that I wanted to find, it wasn’t as intuitive as I would have preferred. I found too often. The screen showed things that I preferred not to see. I just wanted to see the time and the date and a nice wallpaper. Unfortunately, too often it showed news articles and suggestions and other things that I wasn’t at all interested in. While the concept seems like a good one overall, there needs to be a major overhaul on this device before it can compare to its closest competitor.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Alexa itself does seem to work really well. But you can get that form a small Echo Dot that costs a fraction and doesn't spam you 24/7 with advertisements.

Amazon could at least offer a way to stop the advertisements. Even if that is through a paywall.

But, as a writer, I quickly learned that recently, distraction has now become the norm with Echo Show. Pop-Up Ads show up every 5-10 seconds, disrupting my photo collection and my train of thought. And then to integrate Avatar items into responses is annoying as can be! No, I don't want to play all those games you are showing continuously. I've contacted Amazon and was told that they are paid ads and I cannot remove them or refuse them. Does it show your choice of photos all the time? No, more often than not, I get a Blue screen. So, I am no longer a fan because you see, I also have Google Nest in my home, and truth be told, they show my photo collection much sharper, the sound is better when playing music and I have found, much smarter when in need of information, and the best part... NO ADS! NO INTERRUPTIONS! NO TRYING TO SELL YOU ANYTHING. So you make your own choices, but Google also has a sense of humor. I am done with Echo Show.

rp,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2021","For the high price tag I spent on this device, I’m pretty disappointed in its performance. For some reason this Alexa Show really has a much more difficult time hearing us (while we work here in the kitchen), and doesn’t even follow us very well. I also noticed the engineers who designed it got the CALIBRATION wrong - if you allow it to follow you to train the rotation it will be slightly off center at an angle vs flat perpendicular to your body and view. My other Echo Shows work MUCH better than this expensive one. I thought this would be an improvement in addition to being able to rotate the screen. However while the internal speakers are nice, for whatever reason this one just seems a lot less “smart”? The main thing that bugs me the most is it’s a lack of ability to hear us. It also can’t figure out which Alexa we’re talking to and it will trade off between the Alexa in the kitchen and in the family room. When I had my other echo shows in the same exact location, on top of the counter, this never occurred before I got this rotating, expensive echo. My other Echo Shows work better than this expensive one, and my husband also finds the rotation annoying. They should create a facial recognition feature that will allow Alexa users, to program in whether or not they wish to be followed. That way she does not need to follow him as he walks around the kitchen, but will follow myself or anyone else in the household that we don’t exclude that feature from within the Alexa app (again, not a feature I’ve heard of in the works, but a suggestion for consideration.). Most importantly is to get the sound recognition dialed in and also work out the programming bugs - so you don’t have things like two different Alexis alternating their participation to answering a single question. When this happens I try to correct her or even just inquire, asking her, “why are you speaking on the wrong Echo (or Alexa)?”. She always says, “I don’t know that one.”! 😂",2.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2024","Had the echo for almost a year. There are times I want to take a hammer to it….

My understanding is that AI is advancing, but there’s been a noticeable reduction in Alexa’s voice recognition over the past several months. She doesn’t listen, but rather rambles on. As a computer, she should be capable of listening and talking at the same time to know when to stop.

I have also tried a few games and she is waaaaay too slow. I’m glad I never paid for any because it would be a complete waste due to Alexa.

MB,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2023","Nearly constant ads from Amazon display, which is annoying. After searching for solutions online to stop the ads, I’ve tried unchecking all options on what to display except our photos uploaded to Amazon Photos and it didn’t reduce the amount or length of ads. Even if you ask Alexa to show photo frame, it will display your photos for a short time; but if you ask Alexa any other command (music, turn on / off a smart device, set a timer…), it immediately reverts to showing ads. I would buy more of these Shows to use as digital photo frames (with the additional benefit of another smart speaker) around the house if it weren’t for the constant ads.

Otherwise, the speaker is good; nearly as good as an Echo Plus. And the screen resolution is reasonable. And showing photos is nice—but you pretty much have to ask for it to show photos every time you want to see photos instead of it just shuffling through them, because of the persistent and constant ads.",2.0 out of 5 stars

The Real Reviewer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2023","Bought this a year ago. This is my 5th echo. Unfortunately, not much has changed since the original echo. As more and more features are getting added, existing ones seem to be breaking. The Alexa app itself is so bloated that it's difficult to find what you really need. Routines and integrations work for a few days, but then stop working without any warning because the SSO token needs to be refreshed.
Coming to the device itself - it's completely hard of hearing. Beyond the initial ""Alexa"" command, it fails to comprehend unless someone speaks ONE WORD AT A TIME or moves within a feet of the device and screams at it. Further, it just can't seem to do anything well beyond shopping lists and set reminders. Every few days we have a ""chicken coop"" timer or ""rice poop"" or ""exorcise"" timer. Weather is so wrong most of the time that it's hilarious! It was 102F here and it said 20% possibility of rain. It probably expected me to make a fool of or burn myself.
In addition, It's beyond comprehension why a ""smart"" device improves only with addition of software features. Why can't reminders and timers be smart enough that they recognize how people live? Don't sell smart devices if all you're using their data is to sell them recipes and advertisements.

Seraphine Flores,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","08/24/2021 Updating Review and changing rating to 2 stars: I’m extremely disappointed in this version of the Echo Show. I also have the Echo Show 5 & 8. The reason I’m so disappointed has to do with Alexa’s ability to hear me, especially when music is playing. I literally have to shout out her name….yelling, which strains my voice and is very frustrating, in order for her to hear me. One might think it’s because of the music, but the other echos have no problem hearing me with music playing even at very high volumes. In any case, I will be moving this out of my main area and putting my Echo Show 8 in its place, since it is more consistent, in every way.

I love the picture quality on this new Echo Show. I also love the fact that the clock has a much bigger font than my old Echo Show 8. However, I’m not impressed with the rotation feature. I thought that the Echo Show rotated based on the sound of your voice. But as it turns out, you have to have the camera on as well, in order for it to rotate, which I don’t like because I’m a private person. (The only time I would really want the camera on, is if I’m doing a video call. Otherwise, I want my privacy, so the camera would need to be off. And this means, I would not be able to to use this feature most of the time.) Also when I was trying to use the rotation feature, much of the time it would start to rotate, but then, when I would get to the other side of my kitchen island, it would stop midway, and never make the complete turn to face me.

All in all, I do like it. But again, the rotation feature, is either beyond my comprehension in getting it to work correctly. Or it just has too many bugs as of yet, for me to be able to use it right now. Still, I plan on keeping it because the rotation feature was not the main selling point for me. The screen size and picture quality were the reasons I wanted it. And they are beautiful.",2.0 out of 5 stars
NEGuy,"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2021","I was really excited to get this my Echo Show 10 (3rd generation), but I'm not so excited anymore. It looks great and it sounds great, but it's a pain in the a**. I've had Echo Dots in every room for years and for the most part they have been issue free and the sound is excellent for such small speakers. I also have Alexa enabled smart bulbs in every room except my kitchen so you can imagine that I'm used to how these things work. I have multiple routines set up and I absolutely love it.

Then comes this shiny new Echo.

Now my music playback is problematic and it's affecting all of my devices, but primarily the Echo Show.
The screen goes blank all the time. Sometimes the music stops for a minute or two on one or all devices or it just stops completely. If I tell Alexa that I like a song that's playing she tells me there's no music playing. None of this happened before I had the new device.
If I'm watching a Youtube video and I give it command such as turning on the AC it stops the video playback and just wont go back to Youtube. I either have to go to another room to give the command or I have to start all over again. Ugh.
sometimes I have to tell it multiple times to do something. It responds with ""OK"" but does nothing, whereas my other devices don't have that problem. The other night my bathroom lights were on all night because she didn't listen and I didn't notice (I guess that's on me).

Mostly it's the music playback and to daily dark screen that get's to me.

And before you ask: Yes I have checked and rechecked my wifi and internet connection. My friend owns an IT company with clients on both coasts and he can't find an issue with my wifi or internet.

Comienzo con la interfaz gráfica que es poco intuitiva, muchas veces paro en espacios en los que no se encuentra como salir, es decir entras al calendario y no hay una opción como una X para cerrarlo, o pongo una configuración (por ejemplo cambiar el fondo de pantalla por imágenes de la naturaleza)
y simplemente no pasa nada lo cual es bastante frustrante, tanto en la app como en el dispositivo echo show 10.

En cuanto a los servicios básicamente deja únicamente vincular amazon prime video y amazon music, aun cuando en mi país hay muchos servicios digitales como Netflix, HBO-MAX, Apple Music, Apple TV+ y otros más en la app no hay forma de agregarlos, al menos me he pasado un par de horas en medio de frustraciones y simplemente ha sido imposible de agregar de una forma intuitiva, vincular cuentas de servicios en la TV o en otros dispositivos inteligentes es algo que no toma más de 5 minutos pero en el echo show no es así.

Dennis F. Cwik,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022","The 3rd generation Echo Show 10 is worse at picking up voice commands, has worse audio, but the screen can be completely vertical which helps for video calling. Overall, I'm not happy upgrading from the 2nd gen to the 3rd gen.

This version of the echo show 10 is objectively worse than the 2nd generation Echo Show 10 at picking up voice commands. This manifests itself in either doing nothing, hanging (taking 15 seconds or so for the blue ""listening"" stripe to disappear, where you can't interrupt it), or asking to repeat your command. It was so bad, I finally decided to return it, but realized I'm outside of the return window. Hence, this review instead.

The sounds quality is also worse than the 2nd generation Echo Show 10. Specifically, voices in audio are just harder to hear from a few yards away compared to the 2nd generation. It feels like the audible spectrum gets distorted quite easily, even at lower volumes. Turning the volume up just gets cluttered and noisy.

I bought this device for the sake of making video calling easier. The fact that the screen can be tilted and get completely vertical is great, as the last generation pointed upwards about about 10 degrees. When making calls with our kid, we'd have to prop up the back end of the 2nd gen Echo Show, and this devices solves that problem. It does this very well.

I have been using Echo devices since they came out, and have built an infrastructure in my home of about 10 various devices, with this as the crown jewel in the kitchen/dining room area.

The swivel feature is unnecessary and creepy, but kind of fun at times. I had purchased this for what I thought was just a much larger base speaker that doubled as supporting the larger screen, unaware it would want to spin around.

The big issue I am having is Alexa understanding what I want. The algorithm seems to have peaked about a year ago. I was listening to whatever music I wanted throughout my house, setting reminders and adding items to my shopping list with ease.

For the last 3-4 months, Alexa has been getting dumber and dumber. She frequently misunderstands what I am asking for. Plays the wrong songs. Adds the wrong items to lists. Completely ignores requests. Appears to be processing a request and then stops. Maybe its my Wifi...even though I have an extender network? Maybe its the number of devices I have, even though I have several muted so they only serve as speakers? I'm not sure, but Alexa is really making me annoyed, and if I didn't have about a thousand dollars worth of devices spread out throughout my home, I would give up and get rid of them.

I try reporting issues when they happen, but she no longer seems to understand that as well. Yes I have already reset, regrouped and reconnected the devices. It doesn't seem to impact the quality of understanding and performance anymore.

I want the device to display only the time and date, weather, and photos, so I turned the home content settings all off except for weather alerts. I found it annoying but tolerable that new content choices were frequently added and enabled by default, which I had to turn off on each device.
Lately, however, ads have been popping up on my devices. I searched the menus for ""sponsored content"", looking for a way to turn these off, but could find nothing. Whenever I saw an ad, I tapped info and hid the content, but this did nothing to prevent different ads from appearing later. I've found nothing in device or account settings that seems to block ads on my devices, not even paying extra to remove ads. Searches for help yielded nothing but similar complaints. I'm hoping other people are complaining and Amazon hears us and turns this infuriating and intrusive feature off, which will restore my initially favorable opinion of this device.

Integrity Reviews,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2021","So disappointing.

Maybe Amazon over-hyped this but I was expecting a significant upgrade from the Echo Show 8. Sadly that was not the case.

Setup: While straightforward, took a long time. I think there were two updates it immediately applied during setup because it forgot almost everything after the first one and I had to re-enter everything.

The on-screen keyboard is split in two like a physical ergonomic keyboard with a huge space between the left and right halves. This might make sense if the display were removable and you were holding the screen in both hands and using thumbs to type. But on a fixed pedestal it's just clumsy.

The display has a ""blend into background"" mode. It can be disabled but it's on by default. All it did was turn white text a tan or light brown color. If it was just text that would be one thing, but it also applied this to photos which turned a pretty picture into something gross.

The display has huge black borders under the glass so I'm not sure how reliable the 10.1"" screen measurement is.

Sound was the biggest disappointment. While the highs were a bit clearer (due to the addition of two tweeters), the midrange and bass are worse. The Echo Show 8 has a nice warm sound that is completely missing with the Echo Show 10. (This isn't a Hi-Fi system so I expect something clear, pleasant and comfortable to listen to rather than sonic fidelity.)

I never could figure out how to disable the ""How to use Alexa"" screen that stayed in the home screen rotation. It's also that brown background with tan text.

At this point I think the rotating display is more gimmick that useful. It's touchy and overly sensitive.

And seriously, a white power cord/adapter with a charcoal unit?

We just redid our kitchen and now have a big island between our kitchen and dining room so I thought it would be great to have the Echo Show 10 in the corner in a way it could face us if we were in the dining room side or face us on the kitchen side. It does that, it follows us around when we move between the two rooms, the picture is good and the sound is great (again just had dots before this so it's markedly better, both louder and clearer).

Now here's my gripe - We haven't had Echo Shows before, so maybe this is just their M.O. but the screen software is terrible! I have to unplug it and plug it back in every couple of days or it just starts going slow and ignoring our touches, if I'm watching something on Netflix or Hulu and then utter a command like ""Alexa turn on the kitchen lights"" it takes me all the way out of Netflix/Hulu to show me the smart home dashboard and I have to start all over again (""Alexa open Hulu""...wait 30 seconds...click on the show I was watching, because Hulu doesn't respond to voice commands). Also none...like literally none of the apps are optimized for a screen and touch. This makes sense for apps that are developed primarily for voice commands, but all the video players are terrible when it comes to navigation, and other apps that have smartphone/tablet apps, are still cut out at the knees because they only want you to use voice (I'm looking at you Spotify).

When I got the Show, I expected something more like a kindle fire hooked up to a speaker, but instead, I got a speaker with a rarely useful screen.

Again, hardware, all works pretty well, 95% of my complaints are software so hopefully, it's something Amazon will fix down the road.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Jeremy C.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2023","Let’s start off with cosmetic issues. I got the black one as a gift. The camera lens cover is white. Why? Is it that hard to make it match the device color? The power cord and and plug are white. Again, why is it not the color of the device? The screen face follow never is straight, it’s always off to the left. I finally just shut the dumb thing off because it doesn’t work properly. I got this strictly for kitchen use. I use Pinterest for cooking every single day. It was great you can ask Alexa to open Pinterest. But it’s really clunky. It’s not the same look as the Pinterest app or website. You have to click on a button within the recipe that says “make it” then it takes you to some web browser that is horrible. And if you’re playing music and ask Alexa to open Pinterest it stops the music. Then you ask her to play music again and it closes Pinterest. So you can do both at the same time. The menu and settings for the device is really slow. You swipe down or left and there a several second delay to the menu opening. Lame. It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because the speaker sound is decent. Thankfully there’s free returns.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I was hoping this would be a great way play music, look for recipes, play videos, display photos, and generally integrate several technologies into one object. It does most of those things but just okay. What it does do very, very well is advertisements for things on Amazon on sale. Now don't get me wrong, we basically live on Amazon and shop A LOT for just about everything on the site... but for every 6 second view of a photo, there's 15 minutes of advertising.

The speaker is fine. It can play fairly loudly and the quality is ... fine. We use Apple Music and I have set all the defaults in the app accordingly, but for whatever reason, when I ask Alex to play a song, it randomly picks a song in Amazon music that may not be the same song, unless I specifically say ""in Apple Music.""

This is the Echo Show 10. I hoped it would be a massive upgrade over the Echo Show 8 1st Gen and it's not really. Same screen resolution, sluggish UI and very suspect voice recognition that plagues this device. I know what a great Alexa device is with good audio recognition. Fire TV Cube is one such device, with a massive microphone array that's excellent, with good CPU performance. Another is the recent gen Echo and Echo dots with the newer CPUs.

Supposedly this device has a faster CPU, but I couldn't tell. It is definitely capable of a quick response time, but it's simply too erratic. Much like Amazon's past screen based Echo devices honestly.

We're also many years removed from Google pulling Youtube from Echo devices, and it's yet to return. My patience is over at this point, and if Amazon can't work out a deal with Google, I have to move on. My kids use Youtube for everything, and I use it for plenty of things. We also sometimes have Youtube TV for watching live shows.

Caitlin,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2024",I am a long time echo and smart home user and I traded in my echo show 8 for this model around the holidays. But we are severely disappointed.

glisle,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2022","Edit:
I finally got the camera to work. But I traded one working feature to lose two others. I now have to stand directly in front of the device for it to answer me most of the time. The worst thing is it now randomly plays music from a type of music I have never asked to be played on my Amazon music account. I doubt I was hacked, I have a firewall and a VPN. Not to say it couldn't happen but I have enough smart devices in my house that I don't see them only messing with music on one device.

This is basically a Kindle Fire on a swivel mount. It works it functions just like other Echo devices. The main reason I chose this model is so I could use the smart camera feature when I have to travel for work.

Unfortunately that is the one function that never worked.

If they get that to work I would think about changing my review.

Edit: I will up this review by one star. Amazon never fixed the issue but I guess they kinda tried.

It was amazing how quickly I received a call from Amazon Tech Support about my issue. Within minutes. Support had me go through and reset the device and all of the usual stuff they do. Nothing worked. I was told I would get a call back and never heard from them.",2.0 out of 5 stars
deffensp,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2021","I have just about every variety of Amazon echo that has been released. If I had bought this new one first, I would have never purchased another one. It is absolutely awful and it's all because of the mics. This thing can't understand anything we say, even from 2 feet away. There was an echo show 5 sitting in the exact same spot until this one arrived and it had zero issues understanding us. Now, from 8 feet away, my son asked about black bears. We got a report on the African American population in the U.S., a picture of blackberries, and several other nonsensical responses. I can deal with the offset camera making the screen follow oddly at times. I like the sound quality, and, the follow feature--though probably not all that practical--really does add to the immersive experience of feeling like Alexa is listening and present. Except that experience is then completely destroyed by having to repeat everything 3 times and hoping that the response will be at all relevant. Until Amazon fixes the mics, this is going to be a frustrating experience, especially if you use the device to control a smart home. I would avoid this product for the time being. We are most likely going to return ours.

Update 08/2022 - We still have this and it is still awful. Sitting two feet away from this, the echo 2 rooms over picks up before this one does. This constantly gets our requests wrong. It can't distinguish between ""turn off"" and ""turn on"". Planning on trading in for something else this fall. We gave it a chance to get the bugs worked out through software updates. It is still, by far, the worst model Echo we own.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I have contacted support five different times each time getting a different answer on the problem, so now they have agreed to send a third unit claiming that the others had technical issues. I guess I will find out when the other unit arrives.

I have mine on the counter in the kitchen and set it up immediately upon arrival. Setup was easy, although be prepared, you may have to do the steps twice. Once is updates it forgets what you inputted and you have to do it all over - language and all that stuff. Not that big of a deal.

I set the motion on the screen where I want it and that was pretty easy. Your will have to play around and find your sweet spot for the device. I guess I need to continue to work on that part as mine is prone to random movements and doesn't follow me at all unless I call out to Alexa. If you put something in its range of motion it will let you know.

I find the sound better than my old one since the speakers are better and not buried in the back. The screen quality is not something I would rate as superior. I actually like my old one better. This one appears ""faded"" and not as vibrant as my old Echo.

As stated, maybe I expected too much at that price point of $249.00. I preordered mine months ago and maybe if there had been a preorder discount I would be more satisfied, but at what I paid I see nothing to shout about.

For whatever reason now, the screen on them goes black for no reason. No clock, no sleep mode enabled, they just turn black. Even in the middle of the day with plenty of light or even playing music. This is stupid.
When selecting a photo album for a background, the pictures used to play oldest to newest. Then after an update a year ago they started playing newest to oldest. Now, they just play in some random order, sometimes repeating the same picture several times. Why can't you give us an option to let us choose the order we want our pictures to show in? This is also stupid. And speaking of stupid, how many times now do I have to say the wake word (Echo in my case) for the damn things to respond? They used to respond every time! Honestly, I used to love these devices, but I will not be buying another one. Since the HomePod has been killed off and more people are shying away from the Google home devices for whatever reason, Amazon and its Echo programmers have been on a vacation.

First off, there's the voice recognition, which seems to be far less accurate than the standard Alexa unit this was meant to replace.

Secondly, there's the screen quality. I had wanted this to function essentially as a TV for our kitchen, but the screen is too dark, easily washes out in daylight, and lacks settings to adjust the picture.

Thirdly, the motion following is extremely wonky. Sometimes it works kinda, other times it doesn't work at all. Even when it does work, it seems to be off a few degrees and points the screen just off of where it would be helpful.

Finally, the unit, at least for our family, lacks a natural or intuitive interface. We wanted to use this for TV watching, but watching anything but Prime seems to be a no-go. There may be ways to load other apps, but it's not intuitive.

Every device has been satisfactory for the price paid until this device. The main purpose for this device was to be located in our kitchen as a screen and paired with our Echo Studio in the adjacent living room to get a fuller sound in there. No, I definitely didn't expect it to have the sound quality that the Studio does but it's lacking much more than imagined. Even playing with the EQ it still sounded thin, lacking bottom end, and doesn't sound any better than the Echo Show 8 which is a much cheaper device.

The other complaint is the amount of movement when touching the screen. Even though it's in no movement mode there's a lot of play in it when touching the screen while going through the settings menu and though we don't touch our other Shows that much, this one was intended for things like recipes and such where you would be touching it.

Pretty much what I upgraded for. However, the screen does not move back to the idle position when you stop interacting with it. Well, it will when it sleeps, but it only sleeps when nobody is in view of the camera. People are in my kitchen most of the day in my set up, so it is stuck at whatever angle someone last interacted with it until you interact with it again.

I spent 3 hours with tech support and 4 unplugs, 3 resets, 5 times recalibrating the motion and checking for updates numerous times to find this out. Really poor support for this device. My initial question seemed simple: ""when does the device go back to the idle position?"" To be clear, following you is not the same as turning toward you when you say Alexa. The former has preferences, the latter is either on (turns towards you when you say the wake word) or off completely.

Anyways, i hope the development team is listening and they add a command to put the show back to idle position or even better, implements a time out when not in follow mode and the wake word hasn't been spoken. Maybe even move it back to idle position when the camera slider is closed.

I'll give it a couple weeks to see if any of this updated before I return the 2 I bought.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Kendra,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2021","I was super excited to upgrade to the new Alexa Show that moved when I spoke to it but to be honest it does a better job following the kids than it does me and I'm the one cooking trying to get it to turn to my voice 🙄 I also paid for one of the premium voices and it worked for like a week and then completely quit, telling my my device was too old! 🤬 I had to do a bunch of stuff to ""try and fix it"" and in the end wound up asking for my money back because none of the techs could figure out why it wouldn't work.

I have several routines setup that I've used for years with my old Alexa's both dot's and show's. This one wants to show me pictures or internet articles rather than follow the routine process I've setup.

It's great that I can turn the camera while watching from my phone but I can't tilt up or down and the lighting at night is worthless, she needs night vision. This one also only syncs to one camera of the 3 that I have, no matter what I name them or how I ask, she will not show another camera than my dining room.

I have had more issues where the only solution is to unplug. I find that ridiculous how often I have to do this. I wish I could go back to the old one.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Super* Review,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2024","We use Alexa for smart home things -- lights and climate controls. The Echo Show adds absolutely nothing to that experience. Getting to smart home controls is always clicks away, and it doesn't even include some functions that are available in the app (e.g. thermostat control). So rather than have an always-on visualization of most-used smart home controls, it's just a big clock. That shows full-screen ads.

It feels like a not-very-mature product, and the part that is mature is... ads.",2.0 out of 5 stars

It suddenly doesn’t listen, no longer shows the song or lyrics as they play, I rarely see my own pictures on it, it bombards me with stuff I have no interest in, for example football, and there’s no command that will make it stop doing that. I know that Amazon’s Echo department isn’t performing well, bit ruining the experience for people who already own the devices is NOT helping! Just let me see and hear what I CHOOSE!

JD,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2023","*Updated 11/23/23* - so it appears that Amazon reintroduced a toggle in the ""Home Screen"" section this month to turn off the highly annoying ""things Alexa can do"" or ""things to try"" interruptions and it seems to be working at this point. I increased my rating to 3 stars.

Original review
Echo Show 10 - in use for 3 months. I have 4 other echo audio-only devices and a variety of other smart home devices - nearly 50 in total. I added the Echo show as a central device in the kitchen/great room where I could monitor selected security cameras and use the numerous other features WHEN I ASK IT TO (see below).

The GOOD News - the Echo Show handles all of the Alexa capabilities and provides basic integration with my smart home environment. The 10"" screen is good quality and adds a number of useful video features like displaying recipes, streaming videos, video calls, video monitoring of security cameras, etc... The sound quality is good - perhaps a tick better than the audio-only Echo balls. Almost certainly you will find something useful in the broad array of capabilities. The feature for the display to ""follow you"" around the room is interesting, but after a while it started feeling creepy so I turned it off - but I can see where that would be useful to some depending on how you are using the device.

The BAD news -
(1) At times I want to use this device to monitor one of my security cameras without interruption - unless I specifically ask the Echo Show 10 to do something else. Although there are a bunch of ""home screen"" settings where you can select whether you want a rotation of content (pictures, recipe ideas, news, ""suggested"" movies, social media drivel, etc.) to appear on the Alexa screen while it is awaiting your next command - in my case I don't want ANY of these things to interrupt my camera feed, so I turned them ALL off. Despite doing so, the device regularly stops the camera feed to display a ""things to try"" or ""things Alexa can do"" screen. REALLY ANNOYING and per my conversation with Amazon yesterday (10/11/23) there is no way to prevent the device from doing that. I find myself having to re-start my camera feed all day long. If you are contemplating using the Echo Show 10 to monitor a baby-cam, security cam, or some other static content display (e.g. bedside clock), just be aware that Amazon have decided that having Alexa tell you what else you should try is always more important than whatever else you have the Echo 10 doing. (At one point, there was a toggle to turn ""things to try"" off, but it didn't really work and that toggle disappeared a few weeks ago)
2) The integration with non-Amazon-branded smart home devices is still pretty weak and while I eventually got everything to a basic level of integration - it was a pain and took far too much troubleshooting. I recognize that integration requires coordinated action by the smart home device vendors and Amazon, but it needs to be much clearer what ""Alexa Enabled"" means. Often the integration is the absolute barest minimum (e.g. voice control to turn something on/off) and nothing more. As an example, my fancy AI security camera can tell me what it is seeing (a person, a car, a herd of buffalo, etc..) - the Echo Show 10 advertises a ""person detection"" announcement feature, but inexplicably when a person IS detected by my AI camera, instead of showing me the camera, it shuts OFF the video feed to display a text message - ""Person detected in driveway cam"" - Huh? And the Echo can't announce the car or anything else that the camera sees. Amazon should be pushing themselves and their ""Alexa Enabled"" partners aggressively towards the new ""Matter"" home automation integration standards to make it far easier to setup and clearer what capabilities you are really getting than at present.

Good luck!",3.0 out of 5 stars
J Schaeffer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024","Overall, I loved this Echo. I have a variety of Echo devices throughout my home, and this was my favorite one, until a little after 2 years old it quit working. I have tried everything recommended in the forums and have asked for the assistance of Amazon (the rep was extremely rude, and absolutely no help.) It will not stay connected to my wifi. I have moved it around (it was already the closest device to the router), shut down most everything in the house, turned it on and off, reset my router, and a host of other things. It will connect, but within 5 minutes, it drops the connection. For the price, it should still be working. I looked at ordering another Echo, but this one has no trade-in value. If this is such a great device, why is it not even listed for trade-in. My guess, they are having a lot of trouble with them and don't want them back. I have had Amazon Kindles and Echos since the Kindle was first released, but I may be done with Amazon's devices.",3.0 out of 5 stars
daveinlaca,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2021","The idea of the Echo Show 10 is such a game changer, I was ready to make it the hub of my music and entertainment center at home. Echo already controls my television remote, my lights, and my spotify. With the Show, I was expecting it to do the same with photos and other features.

Unfortunately, nearly every feature I was excited about underdelivered.

Photo Booth
I was most excited about the idea of telling my show ""Alexa, take a picture"", have it find me and my friends and snap a selfie. What a great addition to parties! And while the camera has improved, the lighting adaptation has not. Most of the photos came out extremely average if the lighting wasn't perfect. The kind of quality I would have expected to post on my MySpace in 2006.

The other great addition was the ability to tell my Show, ""Alexa, take a video"". It did a good job of finding me, but every video has to end with you saying ""Alexa, stop video."" I called customer service, certain that there must be a gesture I could assign, or perhaps a way to set a time and have Alexa take a 10 second video. But no, after exploring all options like ""routines"" and ""IFTT"" every video has to end with you telling Alexa to stop.

There's also no way to get the photos and videos straight to your phone, so you're stuck waiting for it to upload to Amazon Photos, then going into your phone, opening Amazon Photos, finding what you want, then downloading, then editing the end of that video so it doesn't end with your stop command. Clunky and unnecessary when there are so many easy ways they could have programmed all this to work better.

MUSIC
I was excited about the lyrics feature on Amazon Music. They advertised ""Have your own karaoke night!"" But there are almost no karaoke songs on Amazon Music. They are plentiful on Spotify and other music services. A speaker with a screen makes karaoke such an obvious use, that it's shocking there's no way to do it. Either you can bring up the lyrics with the original song and vocals, or you can stream Spotify, but then the lyrics don't come up. Looked for third party solutions, but they were all just a few karaoke songs for small children. Another wasted opportunity.

SOUND
The sound was good. I was expecting it to be more like the Echo Studio with a screen, but the speaker is much smaller. Solid, but nothing that impressive. I ended up buying the Echo Sub to pair to it and that improved the sound greatly. Now my music sounds like a sound system...IF I STREAM FROM A SERVICE.

I write and produce music, so a lot of times I like to play my own music from my phone. To do that you need to pair your phone with your echo, at which point the echo acts just like a bluetooth speaker. That's fine, except now the Echo Sub no longer works, since that connects to your echo through bluetooth as well. So that great bassy sound I get with regular music isn't available for my own music if I play through my phone via iTunes or Soundcloud. Yet another opportunity missed.

YOUTUBE
YouTube...works. You access it through a web browser which is just clunky. The promise of a user friendly youtube playing all your videos and exploring and going down a youtube hole on a Friday night just doesn't work through the browser the way a dedicated app would.

FACES
It may not make sense to complain about a feature that isn't included that was never promised, but with echo having a screen, it seems like a logical step to create skins/faces that mimic what Alexa is saying. i picture a translucent face, like Snow White's mirror, or something cartoony. I'm surprised a third party developer wouldn't have made something like this available, and it would give the Show that much more of a personality.

Overall, I enjoy using the Echo Show 10. There seem to be a lot of kinks and falls short of its potential, but I knew that being an early adopter and purchasing the day it became available. And while most of these things are little frustrations, a big frustration is that only about a month after purchasing, Amazon has dropped the price $40, effectively punishing the early adopters for getting behind their product. That, along with my other issues, dropped my review from the five stars I wanted to give, down to the three I gave it.

Hope this helps others!",3.0 out of 5 stars

Lindsay K.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2024","I got this for my kitchen to display recipes when I cook. I used to use my laptop or ipad but they kept getting dirty and it wasn't a good situation.
I expected to be able to use the silk browser to pull up the recipes but it crashes the entire device. EVERY SINGLE TIME.
I even tried to copy/paste the recipe to a google doc to eliminate all of the background scripting and ads and pictures that could be slowing the browser down.
Nope.
If I had known it was going to be so horribly inept at doing what I bought it for, I never would've gotten it.
I still don't have a good solution for displaying recipes while I'm cooking. So far, I'm just using my ipad again, cleaning it after every time. Poor thing has a permanent coating of flour, oil, and chocolate from me constantly having to touch the screen to scroll and wake it back up.

Other aspects of it:
-Voice recognition is mostly ok. I've had the issue with all of my Alexa devices where it won't always pick up what's being commanded and she just says ""sorry, I don't know that"", which is so frustrating.
-All of the screen based Alex/echo devices show ads. I hate it.
-They also all add on new features all the time. Even ones I've disabled. It's always ad based: items you may be interested in, videos to watch, sports scores, etc. I have to constantly go back into the settings and remove them from the home screen rotation. I was seeing ads and suggestions to buy lingerie! I've bought it on my account before but I don't need my kids seeing it as a suggestion to purchase in my kitchen!
-Sound: it's ok. Nothing mind blowing. Volume is good when you're jamming but really the speaker isn't anything special.
-Rotation: it's a gimmick. Cut and dry. It's stupid. I've turned it off and don't miss it. It was constantly bumping into stuff despite me setting its field of rotation and adjusting it often. It would yell at me from time to time about it, too. Just a total gimmick.

It will try to get you to buy Amazon music but you just say no and it plays the music anyway. If you want it to be a photo album, much trickier. It uploaded all my 1,800+ photos from my phone and also made 4 or 5 small albums. Why? It just didn't give me choices and Alexa won't let me delete or erase photos. I don't know why but there are tons of photos I don't want to see on the screen. While showing a photo, it will let you make it a favorite. Or it won't. It is just as likely to say there is nothing on the screen.

Okay. That's all minor. Sure it will tell you how many miles it is to San Francisco. Blah Blah. But if you have it in your heart to set up a smart home, just shoot yourself now. I bought 4 of the highest rated smart plus - KASA - and I have only succeeded in getting one to work. You have to download the KASA app. Plus the Tipo App. Then it has to connect to bluetooth somehow and then to my wifi, which it has a bunch of trouble doing. Then those 2 apps have to work together somehow and then ""maybe"" link to Alexa. Example, today I managed to get another plug set up but when I ask Alexa to turn it on she says I haven't turned on that skill. WTF? What ""skill?"" So I have one out of four lamps that work with Alexa turn on the lamp. I'm afraid to go further. A Nest doorbell? You're kidding, right?

Okay. Buy it and tear your hair out of your head. Go on. What I really think is we have this tech but we don't really have it sorted yet.

EALong19,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2022","I wanted so bad to love this little machine. I thought it would solve a lot of the problems I’d been having.
First off, don’t get me wrong- a few of the issues were my own fault. But some were hers. Like when she wouldn’t understand me and would just ignore me rather than ask for clarification. (My echo doesn’t do that). Or when I turned the setting to “don’t move the screen unless I tell you to follow me” and it was still shifting. I mean, stop. I have you pointing where I want. Stop moving.

My fault- I thought I could have it show my to do list and calendar on the screen always. Nope- that’s the show 15. I have cognitive difficulties due to medication and I wanted my to do’s right there in my face all the time. But I can’t do that with this. That was my own fault.

The good- I wanted to be able to use this to pop in and see my pets while I was out. Mostly amazing. I only ever used it with the drop in feature so I can’t VERIFY that you can control the screen remotely but with the drop in, the video and audio work both ways (but all I heard was the fur of my cat rubbing against the speakers and then he moved the camera to where I couldn’t see him anymore. I was unable to move the screen back). 😒
Apparently there is another way to view the cameras but I don’t know if it is two way audio/ video at that point.
So if you’re getting it for a pet camera you might want to play with how it works.

The audio was fine and good but I have an echo with a bumpin speaker for the little orb she is so it wasn’t that impressive. It felt heavy and ungainly. The screen always flopping around. (But never where I wanted it).

If I recorded video and wanted something that could follow me, maybe this would be great (I never tested that). Or if I did things where I needed to keep an eye on the screen all the time, this might be great. Unfortunately, it didn’t solve the problems I was hoping it would.
Which was basically a pet camera and an Alexa in one. The pet camera part was fine but the Alexa just seemed to work worse than my echo and if I moved her from room to room (what I wanted to do) it seemed to be a big ordeal. I’m 95% sure she’s going back. I keep trying to make it work though. I’m not sure why. Maybe it’s because I like seeing my pictures on all the time. But a $180 (on sale) picture frame that sulks and ignores you? Idk. I listen to a lot of podcasts so she plays those a lot and controls a lot of routines but my DOT can do that and I got that for $20.",3.0 out of 5 stars
NORCAL_AV8OR,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2024","The power cord from the Gen 1 Echo Show 8 is the same specs in every way as the one for this Echo Show 10. And it was made in black. I upgraded to this Echo Show 10 from a Gen 1 Show 8 so luckily I still have a black power cord.

As for this new Echo, the bezel is huge and looks straight out of the early 2000s. The motion feature is a gimmick, and besides making the device more expensive than it should be, it limits the placement of the device should you choose to use it. I turned it off immediately and have no plans to ever turn it on.

Also the motion feature means you never have a stable platform for the screen. When you are using touch features the screen gives way and wobbles as you touch. They should have made a way to mechanically lock the screen to the base and prevent any rotation at all - but they didn't so now I will have to rig something myself to achieve that.

The sound is much better than previous versions but I cast my music from Echo to an Airplay device connected to my home theater so that is no great upgrade for me.

In all, I would not upgrade to this device again - I would wait for them to reduce the bezel size, and get rid of the motion feature. However if you do not own an Echo Show yet then this is not a bad start as long as you get it with some steep discounts.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Cat Papa,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023","Sometimes this little guy starts looking around the room, trying to figure out where I am, but I have not moved. Also, when it faces me, the angle is a bit askew, so that I am always trying to move to the left to to get myself centered to it, and it keeps on moving over as well like it’s trying to adjust and compensate for me being a skew. It’s like the designers had misaligned the camera or the sensor in there so it’s never truly facing me. It’s facing my shoulder. Maybe it’s not very noticeable at 20 or 30 feet away but since I sit about 2 feet away from it at my desk, it is so very annoying. Also, there are times where the sound will cut out as if there’s no music playing, but with a hooked up to the Amazon subwoofer, the subwoofer is still playing, so I know the stream of music is working, but this thing is cutting out. Also, the way Ward doesn’t always get it to wake up. I’m a very bit disappointed in this and I will be selling it to a friend because I’m gonna go back to my Google Home devices. There’s a lot less advertising on the screens for the Google devices. These Amazon devices are all about advertisements all the time. Every screen I look at suddenly changes to an advertisement.

Cipher469,"Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2021","Usually, when Amazon introduces a new version of an Echo, there is improvement in existing features along with new ones. NOT SO with the Echo 10 (Gen 3). It's evolution included a new design and the ""follow me."" feature. It's devolution was REMOVING the option to connect an Echo voice remote with the new 10. WHO CAME UP WITH THAT AND WHY!?! There is an Echo remote connected with every Echo in my house, allowing each device to be silently controlled up close or from a distance. With my prior Echo 10 (which I now regret trading in), a Bluetooth connected speaker, and my trusty remote, music could be controlled and enjoyed out on the deck. Not any longer with Gen 3!
If there had been any communication that the remote function had been removed, I would not have traded in my prior version Echo10. Apparently, the tech people didn't know it either, because when I called in about a problem....no remote option in Setting, the rep thought it must be a software glitch. He escalated the issue and advised there would be a response within 3 business days. That didn't happen, so I tried returning the new Echo, but the online system wouldn't allow it, forcing a call to tech support. I called Customer Service, reached a very helpful rep, who did some digging and discovered the truth....the remote feature had been removed. Because there were some other issues with the device I received(At its location on a counter under overhead spotlight bulbs, it would occasionally say it couldn't follow me because there wasn't enough light. Also, getting Alexa's attention often meant my having to shout to get her to wake up.), the very helpful rep set up an exchange for me. All this aside, it was intriguing that a customer rep was able to get an answer regarding the remote feature removal, but a tech rep was unable to do so.
The replacement, so far, has not had the can't follow in the ""dark"" and the holler at Alexa issues.
In trading up, I have gotten an Echo that follows me, BUT I have lost the ability to listen and control the Echo on my deck. I hope this helps potential buyers to be able a more informed decision. If you don't care about using a remote, then go for it.
UPDATE: Alex seems to be getting hard of hearing. On enough occasions to be noticeable, Alexa is either slow to respond or doesn't respond at all to first or even second wake up call, even when there is no background noise. This type event is very rare on all of my other Echo devices. The added ""head"" movement is nice, but it should not be at the expense of features and Alexa response time that we have gotten used to and expect to continue enjoying.
UPDATE 2: I got a replacement for the 1st replacement, and it seemed to be OK. Now, about 2.5 months in, it is ""working"" like the first two. I regret trading in my earlier generation Echo 10. It may not have followed me, but it sure did respond to me.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Shaun,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2021","History -
I've owned a lot of Echos. Starting with the original device, multiple gens of dots, Echo Shows from 5 to 10, and now this device. I'm familiar with the ecosystem, and I generally love what they do. This purchase seemed like an obvious upgrade.

That's why I'm disappointed to say that I regret the purchase. I haven't returned it yet, either because I'm holding out hope for optimization or I'm too lazy to do it.

Positives -
It is a sharp looking device with a good-enough screen. It's not the picture quality you get from top-end phones, tablets, or televisions, but that isn't what this product is supposed to be.

The camera is a significant upgrade from the previous Echo Show , so if you actually use the camera - big win here. It features the physical hardware slider that first appeared on the Echo Show 5 to give you peace of mind when you want that blocked.

It's still got the same Alexa skills/capabilities that make the previous devices great.

Negatives -
This Echo routinely fails to answer when I'm near it, and one of the other devices will respond. Again, I have six Echos in the house, and I'm used to where the ""points of confusion"" normally fall. This is a completely different situation. I'm standing in front of the device, I watch it ""wake"" on Alexa, and then I'm answered by an Echo that's sitting 20+ feet down the hall. I'm genuinely unsure how it's possible. Other times it will not hear the wake word at all, and I'm left wondering if that's due to the new speaker configuration.
*** This is so unlike the behavior of my other Echo devices that I might actually try an exchange to see if there's something wrong with this unit. ***

The device ""loses track"" of me a lot more than I expected. I cleared the view so it has minimal obstructions, but it still makes dumb mistakes like thinking a person on the television 12 feet away is me. This was the single biggest reason I got the device, and it's a real disappointment. When it starts spinning quickly to locate you, there isn't any noise, but it will draw attention. That said, when the motion tracking works, it's as awesome as I hoped it could be.

On a similar line of thought, the flexibility of facing the other way sometimes lead to annoyance that the screen isn't oriented where I'm used to from the kitchen. This is trade-off you have to make, but it's been more noticeable than I expected. Over time I believe it won't be as big a deal.

Minor quibbles -
For a $250 device the charcoal Echo should come with a charcoal cable. This device, in particular, benefits from sitting in an open area. It's unattractive to have a bright white cable running from it.

The rotation does mean you've got to reserve more space for it. You're also going to want to clear anything that would be in the direct line of sight like a plant, or it'll get really confused.

There's supposedly a powerful new processor, but I didn't notice anything being ""snappier"".

Summary -
I thoroughly enjoy Amazon's Echo devices, but this one has been a letdown. I would strongly advise anyone against buying today at $250 until they can try to work some of these quirks out. I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could, but it felt wrong to say 2 stars when most of my challenges are that it fails to live up to expectations.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Cliff Harewood,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2023","I have an Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen, 2021 release). The speaker on it sounds way better than the speaker on my brand new Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) | with premium sound. I guess premium sound doesn't mean premium sound in the Amazon world. So I purchased the new Echo Sub to go with my new Echo Show 10.
In my opinion, what amazon calls premium sound is not very good. The sound quality that I got out of the echo show 8 was much better than what the echo show 10 3rd Gen produces. being armed with that disappointment, I ordered the echo sub. And when paired with the echo show 10, the sound quality was quite good. However we ran into some technical difficulties. Whenever I play music from YouTube on my echo show, my echo sub does not play. And anytime I connect my cell phone to my echo show to play music, again my echo sub does not play any bass. to me this is a big problem period and i placed no less than five calls to amazon support with no resolution. I got everything from no one calling me back to they just couldn't figure it out. And magically my phone line would drop. So I stand quite frustrated and I'm considering returning both devices at this point. Jeff Bezos is one of the richest men in the world. I would think that he could do better then this for support of his products. I have another 30 days to return them and if I can't get a better response from amazon support then I will definitely return them and buy something better.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Kenno,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2024","Bear in mind that at age 82 my interests may not be the same as yours and I don't have a smart home. I do have an Alexa in every room.

I first ordered the Show 5[at half price] but the screen was too small for me to see all the items clearly, so I ordered the Show 10. It is far better than the Show 5, which we moved to the kitchen, on top of the microwave, where it replaced an Echo Dot.

Although I kept the Show 10, I believe it is overpriced, because the sound, is not any better than the Echo globe with premium sound and sells for $98.

The screen content also leaves much to be desired because it is so repetitious. It shows lots of sports info, which I have no interest in, and it has advertised The Trolls every 5 minutes every day since I got it. There should be a way for me to tell Alexa my interests so it could show only things that interest me and not repeat it every 5 minutes. That becomes tiresome.

If I ask it to show my Amazon photos, it does a really good job of scrolling them. If one of them is out of focus or you don't want it to show, Ask Alexa to hide it, and she does immediately.

Therefore it is my judgment that the Show 10, while it does all the Alexa things well, is not quite ready for prime time for the aforementioned reasons.",3.0 out of 5 stars
NathanJayBar,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2022","I've had 4 Echo Dot 2nd gen, 1 Echo 1st gen, I currently use use an Echo dot 3rd gen and an Echo 4th gen, both my cars have Echo Auto devices, I set up a family members Echo Show 10 2nd gen, and I should mention this is my second Echo Show 10 (I returned the first one because it wasn't responding to voice commands and would not update the firmware)... point being I have experience with Amazon Echo devices and how they function. That is in large part why I purchased the Echo Show 10 3rd Generation. Needless to say I'm fairly disappointed and quite frequently let down by it. I think the desire to make a good product is there and that in theory the device is a good idea, a great one as a matter of fact, but the execution is, well... subpar. The device is quite laggy, voice recognition works maybe 75% of the time, it struggles multi tasking (setting a timer while playing music or telling me how much time is left on the timer while a Hulu is playing) and I'm constantly having to unplug the device to give it a break from existing so it can think about all things it tried to do but couldn't because it got overwhelmed. I would say the Echo Show 10 needs at least a 50% boost in processing power just to keep up with what feel like basic requests. I have Amazon devices in other rooms and I can't tell you how many times I'm yelling at the Echo Show 10 and an Echo in the other room will respond because the show decided not to listen, again. I've read other reviews about the camera being off to one side and how it's annoying, I share that frustration. The screen never really faces you, it's always a little off to one side because the AI is trying to center you to the camera, not to the screen. It's annoying.

What it comes down to, is I think I had my expectations a little high for this device. I was hoping it would be quick and responsive, complete the (seemingly) simple tasks I ask of it while integrating into my Amazon ecosystem flawlessly. It plays music (sometimes after 2-3 requests), it follows me around the room, it will show me the weather for the week and it will play movies on Hulu as long as that's the ONLY thing I ask it to do. When the next gen comes out I'll likely jump on it and trade this thing right away, hoping they've made some adjustments to the OS and added some processing power. Don't get me wrong, I like the device and it has great sound packed into such a little package, it's just a bit of a let down. 24K+ reviews on Amazon for this device, I'm sure this will get lost in the mix but hey, at least I spoke my peace.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Carl,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2023","I’ve had this for a little while now, and the sound quality is pretty good. Alexa seems to be a bit confused with this product. I usually have to repeat things several times to accomplish simple tasks. My biggest complaint is that the screen does not follow me; it seems to follow some unseen being. It’s very aggravating because I can’t see the screen most of the time, unless I manually move it. Once I move the screen so I can see it, it decides to move away and follow something else after a short while. I don’t like to move it manually because I’m afraid it will mess up the drive mechanism (more?) I bought the mount for it to place it on the wall so I can see it from bed or the desk. Waste of money since it won’t stay where I can see it most of the time. I would rather it have a remote control to adjust the volume, etc. and just forget about the screen, or have the screen stationary. Very disappointing because the concept is good. Amazon needs to step up their game with Siri now responding to voice commands without having to push a button to enable it. Aesthetically, its fine; I would change the design of the speaker to be more of an oblong than a round shape so it doesn’t stick out so far from the wall. It would be able to track left and right, but once the novelty wears off, it doesn’t need to move at all. The feature costs a lot of money and needs to be fixed. Unfortunately, very disappointing.",3.0 out of 5 stars
JB,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2023","I bought the Amazon Echo Show with high hopes, and while it has some great features, I can't help but feel a bit underwhelmed. Here's my three-star review:

Pros:

Display: The Echo Show's display is crisp and clear, making it convenient for viewing recipes, song lyrics, and even security camera footage. It adds an extra layer of functionality to the typical smart speaker.

Video Calls: The ability to make video calls is a nice touch, especially for keeping in touch with family and friends. The camera quality is decent.

Cons:

Limited App Integration: The Echo Show's selection of apps and skills feels somewhat limited compared to other smart displays. I wish it had broader compatibility with popular services and a more robust app ecosystem.

Voice Assistant: Alexa seems to have forgotten a few things as I find myself growing increasingly frustrated at requests that go unanswered. In what world does an ""upgrade"" from my original Echo fall this flat??

Sound Quality: The audio quality is decent, but not outstanding. While it's suitable for casual music listening, it doesn't quite deliver the immersive experience I was hoping for. External speakers may be necessary for audiophiles.

Privacy Concerns: The camera and microphone raise some privacy concerns. Although Amazon has improved privacy settings, it still feels like an invasion of privacy having a camera in the home. It's essential to stay vigilant with the device's privacy settings.

In conclusion, the Amazon Echo Show is a solid addition to the smart home ecosystem, but it falls short of its full potential. It offers some great features, but the limitations in app integration and audio quality, coupled with privacy concerns, make it a less-than-perfect choice. If you're already invested in the Amazon ecosystem and are primarily looking for a smart display for basic tasks, it's a reasonable choice. However, if you're seeking a more versatile and privacy-conscious device, you might want to explore other options.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Velvet,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2021","For me, this product turned out to be a disappointment. First of all, I thought I could use it in the kitchen, to make cooking videos. The fact that the screen/camera can follow me while moving from the counter to the oven, fridge or shelves for different actions made me look forward to trying this. Guess what? The longest recording possible is 60 seconds, yes! One minute and no more. So, scratch the cooking videos!
At that point, the important radius of free space it requires to move in its circle became mostly a major obstacle on my countertop. Next: I liked the feature of displaying my photos and doggie videos on the screen. That works well, but… the upload and organizing of photos is clumsy and very long! Once that’s done, which in my case, for about 2,500 pics, took until next morning, the displaying went nicely, until it started to get interrupted by Amazon advertisement every 10 minutes or so. What the!?
Did I pay for this device, and therefore I own it, or did Amazon give it to me free of charge, in exchange for unlimited advertising campaigns? That’s annoying and there is no way to stop it.
My other hope was that I would be able to see the titles of the classical music I mostly play. After all, on the screen in my car, I get this display when I listen to a classical radio station, and also any other, of course. Well, no! None, no information whatsoever… just the name of say, 107.3 FM. I might just as well continue with the no-screen Echo! Overall, I also found that the device’s reaction time was a little slaggish at times… it takes apparently lots of bandwidth out of my wireless network.
So, what do I want? NO advertisements on my device! I paid for it, it’s mine. There are no advertisements on my other, previous Echo with no screen. I want a memory chip slot of at least 256 gigs, so that I can buy and use one for video recording, if I want to. There is room for that on the slice of the screen, and most certainly inside the screen casing for the little extra hardware!
And I want this thing to be reprogrammed so that it displays the titles of music played from radio stations.
I don’t think this is unreasonable for a machine of this price level. I heard from Amazon that “Google and Apple also have similar devices, and they also do not have all that”. So what? Go ahead, Amazon, be brave and take the lead! Show them what the Echo Show is made of!
I’m waiting… and until I see that these are implemented, I won’t need the Echo Show. The one I just bought is on its way back to you, Amazon!

Steve,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2021","Update 7.2023- still going strong, used multiple times a day, every day for 2 years and many improvements have been made to the software. Still could be better, still not as good as a fire tablet, but much better than it was. Original review from 2021: I am an early adopter of any technology relevant to my life that I can get ahold of. I would even get the Alexa ring if they made one that fit my finger (I know because I got the sizing kit and it didn't work) but this thing, as cool as it is in concept, is terrible.
CONS:
-Feature-wise it's the most limited Amazon device I've ever owned. For some reason it doesn't work like any fire tablet, you can't download Android apps, you can't download most apps that I can get on my fire TV or on my fire tv cube. Disney Plus? No. Discovery? No.
-YouTube works through a browser, which has to be silk or Firefox, and I figured hey maybe I'll try that but no, can't stream either of those through the browser.
-The operating system is buggy, says it can't connect in the right slide out menu but it will connect to any service you ask for that is installed if you do it verbally. Restarted it a few times, it updated itself, but still has the problem.
- MOST IMPORTANTLY- I could literally buy a fire tablet, glue it to the screen of this thing below the camera, and get everything I wanted. And for the 120 bucks it would cost me to get a fire tablet 8 I might actually do that 🤣🤣
Pro's:
-It follows you which is great, it's usually off by a few degrees, but that's livable. Very handy in the kitchen when moving around the island for cooking or eating or whatever.
-The speaker is phenomenal.

IN SUMMARY- I'm hoping that in 30 60 or 90 days I go back and update this review about all the new amazing features, but if you're adding features, or if it has less features then almost any other device you make, let the people buying it know. This is not your first echo show, and anyone would expect it to be at least as capable as a generic Android tablet. My family congregates in the kitchen, we FaceTime (and would use the Alexa app instead since we bought one for her) with Grandma, we would use your new scale that's linked to this thing, my wife has recipes she would put on it so that she never had to touch a screen or paper while cooking again. In short I could not imagine anybody more suited or closer to your target customer, but this isn't even as good as your normal tablet please tell us why. If it was more expensive I might even bother to return it, but now I'm just going to sit here with it in the corner hoping you give it a good update soon.",3.0 out of 5 stars

JoseAntonio,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2024","This thing looks nice and the speaker is better than other Echos, but there's something slimy about Amazon using the screen to serve you random ads any time it wants. It's not just ads for content Amazon thinks you'd like (e.g., watch this latest Disney movie), but also ads Amazon is being paid to deliver to you (e.g., ads from third parties). It seems a bit much after you've paid $250 for the device. You can't use it as an uninterrupted photo frame because Amazon won't let you disable ads. Amazon wants you to think you're putting your grandchildren's pictures in a special place in your living room, because it wants you to bring its billboard to that special place. On a smaller device that sits in a corner of your kicthen counter, this may not be as bad, but do you really want guests to see ads for Metamucille next to your grandchildren's pictures?

Darko,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023","Like that it’s an attempt at being a one device info center. Sound quality is great. What I don’t like is that it doesn’t hear as well as my Bose 500 which comes with 6-8 microphones and is always in the ready. But with the echo, it doesn’t respond as quickly. Price was right. Found I can view my spectrum subscription using the Silk browser on it with no problem but changing channels, volume and so forth are tedious since the unit isn’t designed for that kind of use. The preloaded apps don’t interest me and NOT being a fan of Fox News, I’m bothered by the fact that news channel provided by the built in fire tv tuner only has Fox News. Which IS NOT news. Was going to purchase the smaller unit for the kitchen but my iPad mini suits this purpose just fine. Product is not designed to be a portable. Just a sedentary home unit. Suggestion: follow Apple’s lead. They started this way. Limited expansion. Then eventually they had to succumb to allowing the unit such as iPads and iPhones, to run ANY app the consumer wanted. Not the ones Apple or Amazon want to push on you. And please, Alexa is most useful as a hands free option so PLEASE add more microphones so it can hear me.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Mason,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2022","UPDATED: Amazon support helped me factory reset the device. It is working better. It still struggled a bit with some of the commands around motion. For example, I'll say ""Alexa, Stop moving."" and it might slow down the video, or move before recognizing the command.

I am liking the device more and more from my previous review, but I might still suggest giving Amazon some time to figure this one out.

I have a number of Alexa devices (5) and have traded a few in along the way. This is by far the most disappointing one, and I suggest waiting for the next generation to come out. It is very glitchy. The problems I have had:
1. It constantly does not hear us well
2. It takes forever to load or react on any content from Amazon prime or a YouTube video, which can be frustrating when trying to entertain a 2 year old.
3. I constantly get a message about motion not working, but it is working fine
4. It seems quieter than previous devices
5. Finally, when I video call my elderly parents from the device they hear what is described as ""nails on a chalkboard"". I have an Alexa, and gave 1 to them so they can see their grandchild. This is very disappointing, and I will likely need to inquire about a return or trade in if it keeps happening.

Yes. I can call my parents from my other devices, but this one is conveniently placed so they can see us have dinner, or watch him play. The movement was meant so it would allow them to follow him a bit.

To be fair to the device, here are some of the pros:
1. The picture quality is great, and when the device DOES work to call my parents they said the image is great
2. You can put this one at a different tilt, where all the other Alexa devices sit pointing up as is you are standing over them. This one is nice because I can tilt it down a bit so my son can see it
3. When the movement isn't glitchy it is nice to have the follow feature
4. The sound is nice, but I do need to turn it up louder than my other ones to hear it.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon4Life,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2022","The novelty of Alexa Echo Show following your face or finding you in the room is interesting (at least once the initial absolute terror and creepiness wears off.) Nevertheless, practically, the face follow is a bit of a mess with video calling. My mother moves her body, in a kind of rocking manner when she speaks and she gesticulates with her hands frequently. Poor Echo Show trying to follow her makes you feel like you are in a new installment of Blair Witch Project. Zoom in, zoom out, move left move right, where are we? It is very distracting. I also find that the camera quality is terrible. Maybe because she's moving so much she never gets time to focus? So although the moving camera is novel, the execution leaves a lot lacking.

Overall, Alexa seems to take triple the time to respond on the new Echo vs the Gen 2 Echo. Really? I don't know why. Same internet, same location. She's slow.... Basically she's quietly saying ""patience young padawan... You MUST learn patience""

Also my mom SWEARS that the screen quality is less than her Gen 2 Echo. But she has dementia and failing eyesight so... I don't think I see any difference.

Pros of the new echo:
Built in privacy shield
Capability to join Zoom
It moves to find your face when you are anywhere in the room
360 speaker
Even more streaming integration options

Cons
Slow to respond, Alexa forgets what she's doing a lot (maybe it's just her company?)
Waves about wildly in video conference unless the speaker initiates ""statue mode"" while speaking
Slightly unstable base (compared to the Gen 2)

Would I buy it again? Part of me wishes I just got the giant TV Alexa but I don't think my mother would have been able to handle that much change at once. Overall, it's not annoying enough to return it or try to get my Gen 2 Echo back, but at the same time, there's lots of ""meh"" feelings going around.

The redeeming quality would be the sound. I was pleasantly surprised by the base and quality of sound for music. You can't download many popular streaming apps on this device which is inconvenient if you want to watch something you have downloaded on another app. This device also struggles with the ""bridge"" feature when trying to connect other smart home feature devices from other brands.

1) The drop in calls freeze frequently.
2) The music is a nice feature and I’m glad it is included with prime membership. If this is some sort of free trial I am going to guffaw about it later.
3) The routines are okay, but don’t expect detailed routines out of the box. If you want Alexa to ask the user a question and answer based on response you have to start with blueprints which is a slightly more advanced feature.
4) I am really disappointed with photo sharing! My sister and I linked our Amazon accounts for the soul purpose of sharing and displaying photos from both of our Amazon photo accounts. It isn’t working at all and only displaying photos from one device. When you send a photo to the echo it doesn’t save in a folder or anything, I have no idea where they’re going.
5) 0/5 for the clock display settings. I cannot believe this device is incapable of adjusting the clock display. Im 33 years old and can’t see the date from 10-15 feet away. I thought this thing was designed for the size of a living room?

Overall, I think the device is just okay. It is not designed to have multiple users outside of voice ID. Don’t expect using the app on multiple phones to be easy. This isn’t great for elderly or cognitively impaired people if they don’t understand how to speak to AI well. Honestly, the only reason I feel like this device is so expensive is because of the motion control. We had to turn the motion control off because it constantly rotated around the room.

Mark D,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2023","Nothing new or exciting about this Echo Show. It does all the same stuff as the previous Echo Shows. The screen/ camera swivels around a speaker base, which is nice. The sound from the speaker has a decent tone and volume.

I'm disappointed in the functionality of the device in regards to running apps and live video/ TV. With live TV streaming apps and basic apps that run on phones, tablets, and smart TVs; this device is unable to process a majority of them.

This device is a little over 2 years old and works just like the 1st Generation Echo Show. It does less than a phone or tablet from 8 years ago. If it weren't for the audio/ music capabilities, I would return this item.

The Alexa feature is awesome in my Fire devices, my car entertainment system, and my Samsung Freestyle. That's what the Echo products should work towards. My family would like to watch live TV on this device and other Echo Shows.

Simple app recognition would be great too. I can listen to my Sirius XM subscription on the device, but the device can not display the artist, song, or music info. It's simple display issues like that which prevent me from rating Echo Shows higher than 3 stars.

Another minor issue is that the screen does not return to it's default position. The screen rotates to an odd angle that displays to no one.

Ct3lle,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2023","This thing is huge, which at first I seems great and then you realize you need a good spot to put it. For me, it adds too much clutter.

Yes the swivel / motion tracking is cool. Ipad pros will do it when FaceTiming but it’s nice this will follow you when looking at it for some time (like when cooking).

All that being said.. this is my first time getting an Echo of any kind and I have to say it is clunky as all get out. The navigation, the fact that any screens always come with example text of how to speak to Alexa (I don’t need tutorial text for the rest of my life), the fact that you can’t use other certain apps like Pinterest (you can ask Alexa to take you there and it just navigates to the web page which proceeds to be TERRIBLE quality photos on your pins), and the laggy screen response are all super disappointing. This honestly still feels like an introductory smart device.

I really wanted to love this and explore more of the features, like having it display my ring cameras, but considering I can do 99% of the same tasks from my phone and will not be tethered to my kitchen anyway, I’ll probably return (and I even got mine for a steal on prime day).

I thought it would have the same ability as firestick to connect to various streaming apps...it doesn't. It can connect to about 5. I was looking forward to being able to pull up my favorite recipes that I struggle to see on my phone screen currently, but I can't. It is designed to pull up recipes from specific websites only. Ones that it has a relationship with, so you can't find the same recipes that you can with a simple internet search on any other device. Maybe the problem is that the search engine seems to be Bing. I've never had any luck using that as a search engine. If I had realized it was going to be like this, I would have just bought a tablet and tablet stand for my kitchen. What makes it even worse, it doesn't answer my questions, no matter how I reword them. Again, only able to understand certain content and when baffled picks the one word it understands and gives you some unrelated answer that doesn't even come close to what you are asking. My Google Home does a better job! If you just want it to tell you jokes, play music or ask the trivia question of the day, it works great, but not for much else. The rotate function keeps bumping into the wall even after being set up to understand where the turn radius is.

1) The following/rotation is nice when you're watching or looking at something on the screen and you need to move around the room. (Ours is in a kitchen/breakfast area and it moves with you as you go back & forth.)
2) Being able to use it as a camera when you're not home to check on things. (See dislikes because this has 2 sides.)
3) Seeing photos from the past from our Amazon Photos account.
4) Integrated calendar
5) Music shows lyrics
6) Weather shows on the screen in between photos
7) Controlling smart home devices like lights.
8) Lists & Reminders
9) Good sound. (I'm not an audiophile, just an average guy who likes to listen to music and watch shows so for me it's fine.)

There are other things we like as well but you get the idea.

Dislikes:
1) Alexa is just not that great yet. I can't tell you how many times she says 'I don't know that.' and she can't answer the simplest things from the web. It would be better with Google Search instead. This is true for any Alexa enabled device. She does simple things very well but web based stuff doesn't work. (The Alexa app is also very slow on any phone I've ever used it on.)
2) (More of an annoyance) It can't follow you in low light as the screen doesn't have it's own light source or infrared.
3) The security camera (see 2 under the likes) doesn't have infrared so unless there's a light on it's useless at night which is probably the time you really want to be able to see things in your home when you're not there.
4) The 'Video Home' is limited. Right now it's just Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, tubi, Food Network Kitchen. You can go to YouTube but it opens on Amazon's Silk. Firefox also stopped support so only Silk is available for web browsing. I'm missing services I like such as Disney+, Pluto TV, HBO Max, etc. I'd like to be able to get all of these because then I'd use this device to replace the FireStick/TV combo in my kitchen and cut down on devices in that area. (Or, Amazon could have included an HDMI port to attach a FireStick!)

So, with all of that said I don't regret the purchase. I traded in a 1st gen Echo that I had in the kitchen to upgrade to this and there is a lot to like. It's just not totally where I'd like it to be yet. Alexa needs to get a LOT smarter still and there need to be all of the video options I'd get using a simple FireStick.",3.0 out of 5 stars
damocles,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2023","I hesitated to upgrade to Gen 3 as Gen 2 has amazing sound quality and that's what I usually use this for. I did check the specs and the supposed speaker upgrade. Perhaps its due to where I place this but the sound on Gen 3 is not as good as Gen 2 (and definitely not as loud). It is comparable and why I decided to keep this instead was due to the screen angling, camera and upgraded processor. I don't care for having the screen follow me around so its usually turned off which also houses a little shutter for the camera. I do find the build quality a bit suspect when compared to Gen 2. The buttons are more flimsy and the unit itself lacks heft. I hear some reviewers tell people to ignore the white power cord and that it is not a big deal....but in the kitchen it is a big deal and it seems silly for Amazon to overlook this. Fortunately, my Gen 2 has a black cord with the same specs that works just fine.

Alexa apps, 3rd party apps and Alexa AI are still a mess, no hardware upgrade is going to fix that. Why there is no ability to look for apps by device type is beyond me. I want to see everything that plays video on my show....still no option for that.

I would not spend $220 on this. But with the deal of $160 and a $60 trade in, $100 seems to be an acceptable upgrade.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Mark,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2023","I recently purchased the Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen), and while it offers some notable features, I have mixed feelings about its overall performance. I would rate it 3 out of 5 stars.

The smart display functionality of the Echo Show 10 is a standout feature, allowing for hands-free interaction and motion tracking. However, I found that the smart motion feature is not as intelligent as expected. In situations where there is noise or activity on one side of the kitchen while I'm on the other side, the device sometimes mistakes the noise for a command, interrupting my interaction. This can be frustrating, as it requires speaking louder to override the noise, impacting the user experience.

In terms of responsiveness, the Echo Show 10 fell a bit short of my expectations. While the touchscreen is functional, I was hoping for a more responsive interface, especially considering it is a newer model compared to the Echo Show 5. Unfortunately, the touchscreen responsiveness is similar to the Echo Show 5, which was a bit disappointing.

On a positive note, the sound quality of the Echo Show 10 is good, delivering good audio performance. It provides clear and immersive sound, making it a great option for enjoying music, podcasts, or video content.

In conclusion, the Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) offers some notable features such as smart motion and high-quality sound. However, the smart motion feature can be inconsistent in noisy environments, and the touchscreen responsiveness is not significantly improved compared to older models. If you prioritize audio performance and can work around the limitations mentioned, this smart display could still be a suitable choice for your needs.

Outdoor Indoor Texan,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2022","The first time I saw my sister's Echo Show 10 at her house, I was sold on getting one. I jumped all over the Prime Day sale and was soon setting up my very own Echo Show at our house.

Overall, it's s fun piece of tech that gives off quite the show. You can access streaming video services, recipe videos, weather, news, and all the other fun Echo Show tech of old, but now it sits on a nifty swiveling robot head that follows you around the room.

My biggest gripe is the huge missed opportunity to make Show to Show video calling easier. My sister has the same model Echo Show that we do, but after multiple days of troubleshooting, googling, watching youtube videos, and sending Help e-mails to Amazon, there doesn't seem to be any easy way to say, ""Alexa video call my sister's Echo Show"" and have a family video call. Yes it'll call peoples' phones if you connect your cell service to it, but even that was a herculean task to figure out. The whole interface is just maddingly overly complicated. Why is everything so complicated to set up and access?

Also, the facial recognition for the screen to follow you around the room only half works at times. The Follow function gives up if you take a beat to not move about. Also, if there's multiple people in the room, good luck. Just close the camera shutter or watch the robot have a meltdown trying to figure out who to follow.

All in all, I'm not returning it or hucking it to the trash, but it's been fairly disappointing how short the technology has fallen. I'm hoping the forthcoming updates will address some of the bugs, and make video calling easier to navigate, but at this point it seems like Amazon rushed something out that wasn't quite ready for market.",3.0 out of 5 stars
A B.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2022","This device is a good idea however it doesn’t work most times when using the “drop in” feature. I have it at my Mom’s house to check in on her from a distance. I use the drop-in feature because at this point the device is too complicated for her to use. The problem with the feature is that when I end the connection on the Alexa app to the echo 10 the echo 10 does not hang up. This prevents a new connection next time I try to drop-in. The only solution is to get in my car and drive there to press the screen’s red “end icon”. Once that is done I can then initiate a new “drop in” call. This seems to be an easy fix for the programmers at Amazon. Just have the echo 10 timeout the “drop in” call if there are no activities from the caller. Yes, I chatted with their tech support. About 12 of them. Annoying as hell. You just get passed on from one tech person to another tech etc. with no one knowing what to do. I felt I knew more about the echo 10 then amazon’s tech support. All 12 of them. It’s a shame. And being an engineer I certainly know more about solving problems than all of them. I am going to keep the device because it does save me one daily trip. Drop in, works at lease once a day after my drive there to touch the “end” call icon. However the product truly is not ready for prime time. If 12 Amazon techs and me (engineer), and many hours chatting with them cannot resolve the problem. The echo 10 needs much more bug fixes.",3.0 out of 5 stars

When I opened it up, I was like, ""wow"". Good. After my first payment, this device started acting weird. Called up tech support. They give you temporary support( meaning they fix the problem, and a couple of days later, it acts up again). The camera sometimes doesn't work. The screen moves when it wants. And there's always some technical issues going on. Sometimes alexa seems to act as if it doesn't understand any of the commands. But here's the kicker, when it does work, it sounds good.

Darren Moore,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2023","I've progressively upgraded my collection of Alexa devices throughout the home and wanted so badly to enjoy this latest offering. Unfortunately it's turned out to be a dud with a hearing problem. It simply has a hard time responding to it's standard wake word and, well, isn't that the whole point? Devices in adjacent rooms come to my rescue when they hear me shouting... Why has this latest offering seen a degradation of its primary purpose in life!
The screen following your movements was a cute addition but quickly became confused in my busy kitchen and just starting moving back and forth as if to say, ""No! I give up!'. Further, I found myself pulling it out from against the wall every day as some well-intentioned member of my family insisted on pushing it back against the wall. Probably to clean the countertops... darn kids. When it's pushed against the wall it makes a feeble attempt to follow you until smacking itself into the backsplash.

R. Garrett,"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2022","I've owned this for 1.5 years now so am comfortable stating what I like and dislike. I upgraded from an Echo Show 2nd Gen and really liked that device. The new tracking feature is what attracted me to upgrade.

The tracking is very good. I have this in the kitchen and get my morning news brief while making a cappuccino and my breakfast. As I walk around the kitchen, it tracks me well so I can glance over at what is on the screen at a great viewing angle at all times.

The downfall of this device is the microphones. I [had] another echo device in the room next to the kitchen. There is one wall and about 20 feet of distance separating them. Many times while standing and looking at the echo for a command, the device in the next room would respond or start playing music. So the microphone on the device 20 feet away is more sensitive than the device 5 feet away. It became so frustrating that I unplugged the other device.
Another issue with the microphone is with general commands. If I'm playing music or news and give it the command ""Alexa stop"", it will sometimes pause briefly and then continue playing as if it doesn't care about what I'm asking. I've tried ""Alexa, home screen"" and it will react the same way with a brief pause as it listens and then just continues on with what it was doing. Repeating the command many times will eventually get it to stop. There have been multiple times I just unplug it to get it to stop though.

To me, this device was a step backwards in voice recognition and/or quality of the microphones. I will have to think if I want to jump on being an early adopter in the future.",3.0 out of 5 stars
LC,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2024","I think that overall the echo is great, but it needs some improvement in some areas.
For example, when motion is enabled or disabled, when touching the screen, the screen doesn’t stand firm and moves while trying to tap on anything on the screen. Very inconvenient, which means with the rest of the hand you have to hold the screen and with your thumb tap whatever you’re trying to tap on the screen.
Also, this unit doesn’t seem to respond as well to Low volume voice commands. Sometimes you do have to yell. This was way better with the echo show that I used to have.
And the last issue I would have is that the camera still needs too much light in order to properly track your face.",3.0 out of 5 stars

WilliamR,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2021","This is for the Echo 10.

The ability for Alexa to retrieve answers from the Internet is fantastic, a true assistant. However, the product is bugged by numerous issues.

The rotation is whacky to put it bluntly. Sometimes it turns to face us other times it never moves (we are sitting at the same spot every time and nothing is blocking it from turning). I have to get up and turn it myself which then it will turn OK for a while. Sometimes (again sitting in the same spot we always do) it will turn 180 degrees away from us and give the answer. Once again, we have to get up and turn it manually to correct it. I have run the motion calibration numerous times and it never fixes it. Sometimes during certain skills (e.g. song quiz) it starts turning left and right back and forth repeatedly like it is confused. This is when there are only 2 people playing and we are once again sitting in the same spot we always do and not moving around at all.

HUGE issue is that when you play music from the Echo 10 at about half volume or even less, you cannot speak to Alexa anymore. She will not trigger anymore or recognize our voice. The music seems to drown it out. Even when raising your voice. I have to cup my hands around my mouth, lean in toward Alexa and holler her name to make her hear me.

On the positive the sound quality is FANTASTIC with amazing bass and quality.

Integration with home devices, skills, add ons, etc. is VERY easy and straight forward.

I wish I could use the app to control the Alexa device itself instead of the app acting like a standalone Alexa. This would help the music issue if I could just say to my phone Alexa next song and then have the Echo skip the song (or raise/lower volume, etc.)

While it does have a lot of negatives, this is still a fantastic device with great features and powerful tool to be a home assistant and automate your home or just be the brains in the house to answer your questions. It does need another round of testing/tweaking to be perfect, but still serviceable.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Carlo LaMonica,"Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2021","For years I did not have any Alexa devices, then I received a couple Alexa Echo Dot 3rd Gens for free while ordering some other equipment for my office. The usefulness of Alexa as a virtual assistant was immediately apparent and I was impressed with my Echo Dot's responsiveness and sound given its small formfactor. So after getting used to how Alexa works and it's features, I saw these being advertised. I expected it to be far better Alexa device compared to Echo Dot 3rd Gen. I guess my expectations were a little too high.

First of all, it is less responsive than my Echo Dots. I often find myself having to repeat myself two or three times before it understands me. I almost never have to repeat myself with my Echo Dots.

Second, it is almost as if I have to be looking directly at it for it hear what I am saying. I understand that I should be somewhat directing my voice in its general direction, but again I am used to my Echo Dot 3rd Gens hearing me whether I am looking directly at them or turned completely around. It may be the way the microphones are configured in these new devices that inhibits it's ability to distinguish my voice on the other side of the room.

Also, the Hulu app is not set up for profiles.

I'll be another one to mention that the cord doesn't make sense. It is really short. And a white cord with a black device just aesthetically looks stupid.

We put ours in the Kitchen and it is really great for Watching a show while cooking or cleaning. However, I am in no hurry to upgrade my other Alexa devices with this supposedly next generation version.

Bottom line, I feel as the Echo Dot 3rd Gens are better devices. Sure these have some cool features and the integration of some streaming services (although some the main ones are missing), but it is less responsive, not as user friendly, and in my opinion the sound quality is little subpar. This is another case where instead of making the best next gen device, Amazon went for a quick release of a half-baked product, which I am sure they will fix over time with updates. Until then, this only deserves a 3-Star for now.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Jack Bennett,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2021","I was prepared to love the Echo Show 10. I have a lot of pictures and was thinking of getting a digital picture frame, and when I saw the Echo Show 10 was on sale for $199, I decided that all the other things it did made it worth a little more money. I saw reviews where people complained about ""Alexa for your day"", but I thought the other advantages of the Echo Show 10 would outweigh the annoyance.

I loaded about 1000 pictures to Amazon Photos, and quickly noticed that a small subset kept cycling through on the Home Screen. I counted the number of screens before they recycled, and it is about 35 (including the ""Alexa for your day"" screen). Periodically, new pictures were included in the rotation, but by and large it was the same few.

Telling Alexa to ""Show Photos"" was better, but her response is ""Showing some of your photos"". I still saw some photos frequently, and have never seen others. I don't want some, I want all. Even though there are still a lot of photos that cycle through more quickly than they should its more tolerable.

I have called customer service three times and although everyone UI talked to is very nice I have not been able to find someone who can help me. They tell me they will elevate it, but I have not heard a peep from them. There is an option in the settings to curate your photos, but I have it turned off. I suspected that there was a bug in the software, but since Alexa has been telling me that she will show some of my photos I am beginning to wonder if it is intentional. If it is, just let me know.

I really like the other features, the picture quality is great; being able to watch Amazon Prime Video and Netflix is great; and listening to my Amazon Prime music is great. However, I have to make a decision within the next week about keeping it. I didn't think it would be coming to this.

LowcountryGuy,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","Update: They allowed you to stop all the annoying advertisements and recommendations on the screen. Additionally, they are slowly improving the tracking feature. I have already noticed more then 50% of the time it is properly tracking me.

Like many others I was very excited to receive this echo show 10

The main features we bought it for were to expand our home audio setup, the security camera and the rotating screen.

Indoor camera:
The first major flaw I noticed was when using the echo show 10 as an indoor camera. I’m short, only 5’10” and like most people a comfortable viewing angle of the echo show 10 would have the screen tilted upwards. Well, the camera can not be remotely tilted up or down. So if you want to use the echo show 10 as an indoor camera you have to remember to angle the screen down manually every single time you leave in order to have a good picture of your home. Otherwise all you see is midway up the wall and ceiling of your home. This basically renders the show useless for home monitoring, especially if you want to see your four legged friends.

The motion tracking:

This is off, they have the camera offset and the algorithm to detect and track where you are acts as if the camera is centered. Therefore instead of centering the camera on you it has the screen offset slightly to the left. Amazon could easily fix this with an update.

The audio:

The audio is excellent, not as good as the studio, but better then the echo.

The user interface:
The UI is attractive but not intuitive. There are annoying prompts and tag lines from Alexa that I could do without. In addition the menus appear to be laid out in no particular order. We also use Google homes, and their interface is substantially more user friendly and intuitive. I hope amazon takes not and makes the appropriate changes to make their displays more user friendly. I went through and said to not show certain topics multiple times and it still pushed the same topics to the display.

Although the audio is great, we ended up returning both echo show 10s because the other features were not what we were expecting.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Without optimal lighting, the Show10 Acts like a drunken sailor on shore leave pointing in the wrong room and calling me my wife’s name. Classy. The screen is great but the same old software only allows the same boring clock and endless rotation of pictures or ads. Where is the customization that allows me to arrange a useful split screen such as schedule, weather, formattable clock, current news headlines, grocery list? At the same time I had purchased a set of studio echoes and placed them in my adjoining home theater. While the show 10 misses my words, since it is pointing in the wrong direction, the distant overachiever Echo Studios Will answer, as though to cover for their mentally challenged sibling, the show 10. And then the touchscreen, if you touch it to get the smart screen our options, the screen will half the time say that it has bumped into something and try to move away. My home was lucky and received the invitation only very first echoes a year before they came to market. During that time Amazon listened to us and made the changes that made it work in real-world.

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2022","The Echo Show 10 is a fairly attractive device and with a 10.1 inch screen which by no means dominates a room. One of the key benefits of this device is its screen's ability to rotate on its base and follow you based on inputs from the microphone and camera. However, this functionality has some issues. For example, if a fan is operating close to the Echo device, it will rotate to the direction of the fan noise- and not budge regardless of human voice commands. You can tell Alexa to start or stop motion tracking.

It shares the same screen resolution and processor of the Echo Show 8 Second generation and presumably the 8 would be as good during video calls as the 10- sans rotation. The Echo Show 10 has an AZ1 AI processor that is primarily used to support its motion tracking feature and also provide faster voice response. The audio on the Echo 10 can fill a large room with sound and is of reasonable quality.

Voice recognition is good- however it lacks the ability to distinguish people in a household based on voice or facial recognition. Presumably at some point the Echo Show 15 will have a facial recognition feature, as it is supported by its more powerful AZ2 AI processor.

It is reasonable to look at the 10's products overall quality, appearance, future update availability, etc.- not just a set of isolated features. In this respect the Echo 10 is a mixed bag. It is well done- but not exceptional.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I was excited to get this yesterday, because it addressed one thing that has been missing with the show, the moving screen.
I don't always sit or stand in the same spot when I was asking questions or making calls, so to see the answer on the show, I would run around to the correct side of the screen. So I opened it right away when I got home from work, it setup easy as the devices always do with even with the addition of the movement pattern test. But then I started to use it and it didn't move. I had just had it moving for the test, so I knew it should work and I kept moving around the room...nothing as far as moving the screen goes (the audio responses were always fine.) One time when I was testing it from almost directly in front of it, a little message came up that said movement was impaired because it was too dark (something to that effect). Granted it was dark outside but I had a large screen TV on so it was as light as I usually have it, so I turned on a lamp....no movement....two lamps....no movement and the message came up. Finally turned on the overhead light, in addition to the 2 lamps and the light from the tv...it finally moved. Turned off one of the lamps...no movement. This morning with the sun streaming in the sunroom where I have it positioned, movement works just fine. So apparently to work right, the room has to be lit up like a movie set...which is not a reasonable situation at all times.

Its not can't see clearly across the room dark, but it's not lit up like the middle of a retail store bright either. Who sits in their living room at night lit up like that anyway? This is disappointing, as how can this be used as security, or to check on your house, if it needs that much light? That tells me it can only be used for security/home check in the daytime, which is disappointing. 2. It doesn't handle photos seemlessly like my Google Home Hub does. If it's a phone photo, it throws it in the center and puts a blurred stripe on either side or top and bottom. My Google puts more than 1 on the screen to fill it if needed. It uses the whole screen, not a strip of it. Google hub photos are seemless no matter what you took them on. This is only seemless for 35mm photos. Phone photos are small and look odd on the screen. Altho I shoot a lot in 35 when I travel, most use phones as their primary camera these days. If they can make ads and junk show full screen, they should be able to make photos too. My Echo Show is black. My Google Home Hub is white and on my kitchen counter. Take a look at the photos and see for yourself. Both show photos taken on a phone. Big difference on presentation. I might be swapping the new Echo Show back to the kitchen, if I don't return it.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Eric van der Vlugt,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","I really like almost everything about the new show, with one glaring exception, the offset camera. Since the camera is offset to the upper right side of the screen instead of the center, when it tries to track you in calls or watching shows, the camera centers on you instead of the screen. That means the screen is always swiveled and pointing slightly left of where you are actually standing. It is similar to the previous shows in that way, but the previous versions were stationary so you could center yourself to the screen if you wanted to. Now with the tracking feature, you literally can't center yourself in the camera and on the screen in calls unless you turn off the tracking feature. I have looked through all the settings to try and see if there is a way to change that orientation, but so far I have not found anything. Hopefully, Amazon can address that in an update. How this could have made it out of production without addressing that issue is baffling to me. moving the camera to where the microphone is in the center would have solved this so easily. I'll try it for a few more days, but I think it might be just too annoying unless tracking is turned off, in which case this is being returned since that was the main reason I purchased it.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Ehdeen,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2023","I wanted to use this as a smaller version of my echo show 15 for my desk. I love having a consistently displayed self-updating calendar and to do lists that I can edit from anywhere. I wanted to be able to just glance at my calendar or to-do list from my desk, make the occasional video call, and ask Alexa to add reminders. But the single feature I really want is just to be able to glance at my darn calendar! I can do that with the 15, but not the 10.

Why can’t I just have it statically display these things for me? I love the compact size but now it’s a $200 paperweight because it won’t:

1) consistently display a calendar and/or to do list no matter the settings I tried.
2) when asked to display my calendar, it shows only a daily version whereas I would like to see month/week and then I can scroll.
3) despite disabling the myriad of preset home content features/ads I’m still getting the occasional ad splashed across the screen.
4) insult to injury it seems to detect the bookshelf behind me as a person and keeps reorienting the camera to it even after I updated its “at rest” positioning.

All the Good Names are taken!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2021","My overall complaint is about the feature that I, and probably many others, purchased the Echo show 10 for in the first place: Tracking.
Extremely poorly implemented! I have wyze cameras (pan tilt) that function (seek/tracking) that outperform the show at fractions of the cost.

Tracking is slow, and inaccurate. Always centered on the camera, and not the screen to the viewer. This is a problem, as the camera is not centered on the screen and it's placement is on the far right corner.
This creates a viewing angle that is uncomfortable (and could have been avoided programmatically or by design). Tilting your head results in further movement to ""correct"" so that the viewing angle is almost always ""off"" by several degrees. This leads to another problem with tracking: head vs face tracking. Turning your head signals a position changes needlessly. Ones head facing does not necessary corelate to ones eyes (viewing). Important distinction. So also is the odd viewing angle. The viewing angle could be resolved by calculating position relative to the center of the screen and not the camera. Tracking the eyes would also help with the very often present ""back and forth"" tracking while you are mostly stationary and trying to view the screen. The result now, is that the screen is ""shaking it's head at you"" while you are trying to view what is on the screen.

These issue are by design, and could be fixed with a software update I wager. Honestly, this should have been noticed in testing and quality control. Feels very much BETA (as so often Alexa devices are presented for sale to the public).

Speakers and screen size and quality are perfectly fine. I enjoy these features. Resolution could be better, but acceptable for reading recipes and so forth. Sound is fine for ""kitchen"" listening as well. No major complaints there.",3.0 out of 5 stars
JDC,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2021","Early on we became an Alexa family. We have about 6 throughout the house, and it has become our family intercom system (as well as the obvious other uses). Having gone through a few earlier Echo Shows, I was excited to have this Echo Show 10 in the kitchen! I was especially excited to have it follow me as I cook.

So... first off... it sounds great, and the normal menu functions are there and working just fine. I've noticed it doesn't seem to 'hear' as well as our other Alexa's (this is the first one that we feel we need to repeat ourselves and or say something slower). But there are a few things in Gen1 here that you'll want to be aware of:

1) It needs extra counter space - the swinging screen is a great idea, just remember that putting that glass on the counter next to it is like standing next to a door that swings open and you're in the way. There will need to be a movement zone on your counter.

2) It kinda looks at you -- the follow function isn't half bad. It works. I just wish it looked at me DIRECTLY. It always seems to lock onto me a consistent 20 degrees off. Makes me feel like it has a droopy eye or something ;-)

3) If you pick it up and move it (say to clean your counter), the slightest turn will mean you'll need to recalibrate how much it swings back and forth. The most innocent move on the counter can end up having your screen bump into the walls or not looking where it needs to.

I feel like some of these real world issues will eventually be resolved. Just know - they aren't yet! I give it a total of 3.5 stars",3.0 out of 5 stars
BN1SIX4,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2021","For how much you have to spend you’d expect it’s main function of listening to your voice when you speak to it to work better than older/previous models. I have been thinking about up grading or switching to google but bc I have several smart plugs and devices that connect to the echos I decided that the new version has to perform better. I was wrong. If you have any background noise it still struggles to pick your voice up. My brother and his wife use the google assistant and their device performs much better it seems like with background noise and you can turn on/off multiple things at once while this one you have to wait for the prompt to do a second device. Picture quality is excellent so I’m not going to completely bash the product. I like that it has Hulu Netflix and Amazon prime I do wish it had the ability to add other video streaming services that may not be their fault entirely. I like the follow feature and it has made communication with my parents that live 2k miles away easier and more convenient since they have the same in their home. It doesn’t activate randomly so far like the echo and the dots did and the sound quality is surprisingly good. For $200 I expect the basic functionality part of something to work much better than its much cheaper counter parts.

To sum up it is just like every other Alexa device with a good sound system and a camera/screen that follows you while you talk which you can turn off. My last complaint is and I hope someone at Amazon reads this and responds with a solution is that when you buy a black device instead of a white one the cords should match. It sticks out when you have a white cord attached to a black device.",3.0 out of 5 stars

K. H.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2021","We are an Alexa household having started with the earliest devices to this one.

This one is really big, it doesn't fit in a niche, it can't be hid, it is very present.

Unboxing it was just plain scary, the screen is attached to the barrel of the device and that barrel rotates, freely, very freely so you are trying to unbox it and it is flopping around, rotating around the axis of the device.

Once you have it unboxed, you have to plug in the power adapter which plugs into the bottom of this freely rotating hunk of electronics with that screen that you don't want to break..............very stressful.

Once you get through the setup, where it displays the very wide arc of motion it is capable of, you realize you have this really big device that needs a lot of room to accommodate its footprint and the arc through which it will move. If it bumps ANYTHING, it complains and demands that you clear the space.

Whenever you use it, like setting a timer, then it will follow you as you move in the room. I have it in the kitchen and when there is a recipe on it, I'll appreciate the movement more because as I move around the kitchen, it will be easy to double check the recipe.

I don't know, we have used Echo devices since their inception. They started as one 'hub' and lots of pucks around the house. Then the pucks started to have screens and then the pucks devolved into spheres and it has led to this device the largest, by far, of the Echo devices.

It does work but the size of it has to be accommodated and that makes it a bulky addition to the Echo family, so far my overall reaction is 'meh'.",3.0 out of 5 stars

L.W.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2021","Well for starters the setup was pretty much straight forward, as most of my relevant Amazon Account information appeared to have been preloaded into the device. However when I went to enable the Echo Show to work as a home monitoring camera, so that we could check in or our 10 month old puppy, it would not function. After retrying the setup several times without success, I decided to reset it to “factory settings”. I then re-entered all of my account information which wasn’t hard but was time consuming. Once that was done I was able to enable the camera setting. The other problem is that for the size of it’s speaker you would think that it sounded it great, well be prepared to be disappointed as it sounds like a 1990’s bookshelf stereo. I’m sure that the sound is fine to use for a video call, or while viewing a video, which by the way doesn’t look bad at all on it’s large screen. However if you thought that the Echo could be used as a replacement for a good home wireless High Fidelity speaker system, then think again. Other than that it works pretty much as advertised, just keep in mind that it needs a bigger “foot print” than any other Echo Device due to the size of that screen when it swivels around. Placing lighter items too close will probably result in damage to the item or the Echo.

I have an old 1st edition and it does sound more deeper and spacial that the 3rd version. I have 3 Show v2, couple studio, 2 sub and 2 echo sets. When playing multi room music, it would stop and loud static would broadcast for about 30 seconds then continue playing multiroom. I discovered that the 3rd version was causing the static interference when in follow mode and it rotates. I took off follow mode and changed it to follow only on request. Haven't had the trouble since. It used to happen several times daily while music played. I have Gb internet so bandwidth is not the problem even in a separate vpn.
I'm disappointed with the sound quality as it sounds tinny with very little bass for depth even after adjusting EQ curve. Ver 1 just sounds better. Because of the two major issues with sound and sacrificing nice features, I cannot recommend. If this is your first device it may not be a big deal but compared to ver 1, 2 and 3, this would be the least value for sound especially when it constantly injects 30 sec of white noise too many times daily. It has to remain a stand alone device to use the automatic rotation feature and audio until a patch fixes the white noise in the network but the sound quality is a big let down compared to its predecessors.

Excellent hardware (sound quality/depth, screen resolution, camera quality). Like the form factor as well. Overall features are good, except the goofy and gimmicky motion sensor.

A main use case for me for this product was to use it (by default) as a digital photo frame (which the product detail page clearly states as a supported feature). However, it just does not work. I am not a tech novice and have tried all the options and trouble-shooting. The capability is there, but it just does not execute.

I was surprised and dismayed to find that you have to leave the camera cover open all the time for this feature to work. It would have been nice if Amazon had also added the option to follow your voice (since it IS based on voice activation and technology), instead of the camera needing to see you to be able to move.

I can't imagine that most people would want to keep the camera lens open all the time. What's the point of the camera lens, then? This is a majority security flaw and although the idea is good, the implementation and options of said implementation are fair at best.

Also, I told it per the directions ""Alex, stop moving"" on a Monday night, and on Tuesday when I woke up, Alexa was turned around facing the back. I've since gone to Settings > Motion and toggled off the first option and hopefully, this will permanently fix the issue.

If you already have an Alexa and are thinking about replacing it with this one, save your money. The only thing this does is move left to right and you have to create a security risk by keeping your camera lens open all the time in order to use this feature.

The other observation is that the camera does a great job at zeroing in on me but since the camera is all the way to the right side and mounted straight on the screen (instead of at a slight angle) the display always faces a little bit to the left of me to let the camera look directly at me. I usually want to tap it to the right but doing so leads to a whole process asking me if anything was in the way that it might have bumped into. I don't want to touch it because I feel so bad for the thing.

Mine is sitting on the counter next to the wall and I play ALOT of music through it. I think it sometimes picks up the music through its microphone that is bouncing off of the wall. The poor little dear sometimes stares at the wall like I put it into timeout. There is a setting that prevents its span from going too far around (facing the wall) but that hasn't stopped it.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Matt C,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2021","I have owned just about every Echo device there is. This one is not my favorite. First the PROS: Sound quality is great. I paired it with a echo sub and it sounds awesome. Screen looks good, bright clear images. It is nice to be able to use it as a security camera when away from home to check on dogs while gone. I like that you can speak through it and move the camera with a swipe of your phone. Now the CONS: It does not return to the “idle position” until 10 mins of no movement. So if you talk to it while on one side of the room and then go to the other side of the room when it isn’t following you, then it will stay pointed away from you. Until you call upon it again, then it will swing over to the sound of your voice. There needs to be a timer that you can set until it returns to the “idle position”. It doesn’t follow you if there are two or more people in the room. It will follow the person closest to the screen. The moving screen does work ok if there isn’t anyone else in the room, but since mines in the kitchen, there is always someone else it wants to follow. I like the idea of the moving screen, but it doesn’t work like it should. Debating on wether or not to return it. I’m going to test it out a little more before I make up my mind.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I am not sure if it was only my Alexa that is not working properly or the model itself.

Dustin,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2022","I've had this device for over a year, in a house full of Echo's and Alexa devices. And honestly it has been the worst device I've delt with out of all of them. Most times I have to yell ""Alexa"" for it to recognize my voice. Meanwhile the three other devices in the next rooms are picking it up easily. It has the most issues with Internet connectivity, and it takes the longest to respond to any requests. And when there is music playing from Amazon Music on the connected ""everywhere"" group which involves over 10+ echo devices, it will stop playing a song 15 seconds before the song ends. Every time. The sound output is decent, however a typical new generation Echo Dot paired with the old school Echo subwoofer still sounds way better over it. The display is the same as any other Echo device. But the ""follow me"" setting really needs more user adjustments. I like that the screen follows for a Skype call, but I don't need the screen following me when there is just plain music playing.",3.0 out of 5 stars
tobor,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2023","I've got 9 Echo devices in my home. I've been using Echos (and upgrading to the latest models) since they were first made available. This Echo Show 10 replaced an Echo Show 8 (1st Generation) in my kitchen. I use it multiple times each day to play Spotify, listen to radio (via TuneIn), set timers, etc. The sound quality is very good and I place it only slightly behind my Echo Studio + Echo Sub pair as it pertains to sound quality.

The screen is, likewise, excellent. I have my Show 10 set to rotate a series of fine art prints I've uploaded to Amazon Photos and the colors really pop and look gorgeous on the screen. I find this feature really enhances the ambiance in my kitchen and every time I glance at the screen and see a piece of art I'm glad I purchased the device. I like the screen being larger than the Show 8, although I don't think I'd recommend an expensive ""upgrade"" merely for the screen size.

I have read that many people dislike the number of ads or stories that the Show 10 displays. You can go into settings and select the content you want to see. I've reduced it to only weather and news--everything else is turned off. I almost never see ads and feel that this type of criticism is unwarranted. My Show 10 (like my Show 8) displays content I've allowed and almost nothing more.

The Echo Show 10 loses a star for voice responsiveness. I have it placed in a corner that is pretty wide and open--it's not obstructed in any way. Unfortunately, about 30% of the time the device doesn't ""hear"" a command when I'm standing 4 feet away. Instead, my Echo Studio--which is in an entirely different room--responds. Sometimes it is even worse with an Echo in my bedroom (which is multiple rooms away) responding to my attempt to set a timer whilst in the kitchen. I find it very odd and frustrating. My first generation Echo (the original) did a far better job in this area than the Echo Show 10. And as far as I can tell there is no way to set the mic sensitivity via the Alexa app. That said, the positives still outweigh this negative, but I'm dropping 1 star from my rating.

I'd also add that the ""follow"" feature in which the device's screen moves to face you is not very compelling for me. I can envision other people finding it useful, but for me it seems more like a gimmick. The device is generally reliable following me, but whenever it reaches the edge of the boundary I set it flashes a giant warning message that I'm out of range. That large pop-up is really annoying and there is no way to turn it off. If it didn't flash that warning literally EVERY time I work in the kitchen I might be able to overlook it--as it is, it's just a reminder that Amazon has failed to improve the device. There should be a way to turn off that notification.

The Echo Show 10 is a decent device, but I'm not so sure of the value proposition. Adding a motor to turn the screen increases complexity and cost yet the benefits of this design are not compelling. And because this is the only device in the Echo lineup to employ this feature, Amazon hasn't really prioritized improving Echo Show 10 functionality. I don't know what is going on with the mic sensitivity, but it's not as good as it should be. The sound quality, however, is solid, and the screen is decent and a great size.",4.0 out of 5 stars
A. Pena,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2021","Full disclosure, I receive gift cards from my place of work from time to time and I used some of that money to pay for half of this unit, though it is not related to Amazon of course so this review is fully of my own opinions.

I own a few of the Amazon Echo show units dating back to the original Gen 1 Echo Show (7 inch). I currently still own that unit and had a place in my kitchen for several years. My wife now working from home needed an Echo in her upstairs office (where it was becoming troublesome to reach her from the other end of the house) so instead of purchasing an all new one, we decided based on her casual usage that we would replace the Gen 1 Echo Show with the latest generation for the kitchen. At the time, I wasnt aware of the new Echo Show 10, but was intrigued to find out there was a new version with a motorized screen display. I am somewhat of an early adopter, but my profession is in computer/electrical engineering and wanted to see if this was worth the substantial increase in costs. The gift card funds just help take that sting out of the purchase that made the decision easier over the costs of the non motorized Show product line.

Unboxing:
Unboxing was straight forward if you are familiar with the Show lineup and not much to say other than that reviews had led me to believe the unit was big, but I was not surprised by what I found. Essentially a large speaker base with what appears to be a tablet stuck to it, not that surprising and what anyone would expect. The cable like many others have mentioned on the charcoal colored unit is a bit annoying that it is white, but not the end of the world. Just would have appreciated more attention to this detail. Packaging looked well capable of protecting the unit as it was a box within a box, within another Amazon box, but this is where I have a small gripe. Did we need 3 boxes for this, Amazon, please work on the overuse of packaging for wastage.

Setup:
Setup was pretty standard if you have ever performed an Echo setup, but a bit elongated to perform the turning radius setup limits which is handy if your Show will have objects nearby or walls to contend with. I have none in this case as it is going at the end of the counter bar that divides the Den area with the Kitchen area. It can turn 360 degrees freely and this was easy to see how to limit or run unhindered. The rest of the setup was just confirming the Amazon account, wireless connection, and home screen details. All within about 3 minutes or less.

First impressions:
My first impressions were the unit is very sleek looking and the weight seemed adequate for the unit to be stable on the bench. The screen was perfectly bright and just the right size to view from a reasonable distance. The speed of the rotation as some have mentioned being too slow I found just fine as I want it to be quiet (which it is in motion - perfectly silent) and yet not aggressive in the movements as to call too much attention to the unit. My family thought it was pretty interesting how it can follow if you interact with it, but normally it stay put unless you ask it a question. In locating the person to point at with the voice trigger, I actually found the unit a little less sensitive to the wake command than any of my other generation units including the latest 8 inch and 5 inch Show units (I own 4 x 8 inch units and 4 x 5 inch units, along with 3 echo dots). In fact I have an upstairs Echo Show 8 (open ceiling through the Den into the movie theater room, that many times ""bongs"" to the wake command sooner than the kitchen one will standing within a few feet of this new unit. This isnt a huge issue once you get used to it, but I hope Amazon tweaks the sensitivity of the wake command to be more in line with other models in the lineup. One of the reason I got this new unit was my impressively fast results with the other latest generation Echo Show 8 units being so fast to work a command over the 1st generation.

After a few weeks of usage:
I have found that the unit motorized feature is a little bit of a novelty, but in daily use it has been a welcome change. For the price difference, I am right on the fence of whether I would pay the difference knowing what I know now and I know that may not help anyone reading this, but it is really right there with I would or wouldnt pay the extra. As the price knowingly will come down over time, this should become easier to make a decision.

Sound Quality:
Sound quality is above par for my expectations, as it is more clear than the preceding model. It has more depth to me and sound dispersion to 360 degrees is far better than the rear/side facing speakers of the past. Potentially largely due to the screen being out of the way which is a bit expected. Louder volumes were reached without distortion compared to previous units and the highs were clear and pronounced without overdoing it. Happy with this as an area speaker, but this wont replace your bookshelf stereo for instance. It can be paired with other devices so you can expand this if necessary.

Motion tracking:
As mentioned from others, this is a bit laggy, but in the ""works well enough"" category. It is not quick to jump around, but can trail someone easily walking around. What I found is that it rarely loses focus of the individual completely even though it will trail the motion. And if the user is continuing to speak, it almost never loses track of the user in my testing. Of note, it of course does not track up and down as the motorized function is swivel only, but the wide angle of the lens makes this mostly unnecessary.

Final verdict:
Would I get this again? In this same scenario, definitely, no regrets. Had I needed to pay the entire amount? At $250 at the time of writing while the 8 inch is $109, this is a hard justification, but when we remember that a year ago the previous 10 inch model was selling for $229, it gets a lot easier to see that the extra $20 delivers quite a bit. Better sound, motorized swivel, a better screen, and a much better tilt/angle/level than the previous unit had out of the box. I think this is a win, if it isnt a solid win over the previous generation. I hope that the mic sensitivity gets better with updates, but I dont have many complaints over what is delivered today from this model.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Char, The (Mostly) Happy Shopper","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2023","Here I am again with yet another echo review. Anyone who follows my reviews knows I have quite a few of these things. I'm always buying a new one and then doing the echo shuffle, placing them in different rooms with every upgrade. I have the echo dot 2nd gen (well, had....we'll get to that in a bit), an echo dot 4th generation, three echo show 5's, an echo show 8 and now, with my latest purchase, an echo show 10. I have them all over our house. I've been watching the 10 and 15 for a while now. Then, one day, I got a notification that the 10 had a deal. I took it and noticed they'd give me more off in I traded in one of my other devices. Out went the 2nd gen because I knew, with the upgrade and shuffling, I wouldn't use it anymore. The sadness washed over me. It was our first echo relationship. So many memories. The good times, the bad times. I will look back at them fondly. I took some time to say goodbye before packaging it up and taking it to the UPS drop-off. They say getting over your first is hard, and they are right, but it was time to move on.....

I purchased the 10 and it arrived the next day. Set up, as always, was a breeze. Took less than 5 minutes thanks to the preset up email. The 10 is about the right size for our kitchen (where it replaced the 8, which got moved elsewhere, hence the shuffle) and I love having the bigger screen to watch the news while I get ready for work in the morning. The sound and picture quality are pretty great. I did get a little stand for it so it sits a bit taller, but other than that, it's just about perfect. Just about you say? Yea, just about. My issue is with the one feature that the others I own don't have. Motion detection. I hate it. Why? Well, first, I don't ever use my echos for phone calls. I know some people do and that's cool. Just not my thing. Second, I placed my echo in a corner. It can't swivel without hitting a wall. So, I turned that feature off. Simple enough. Or so I thought. It did an update recently and I walked into my kitchen, only to find it stuck against the wall. It had reset itself. Bad Alexa, bad. I turned the feature off again. It started to move once more, telling me it was stuck. I gave it a good amount of side eye and double checked the settings. It showed that it was turned off. Hmmm. I did what our IT department always says to do when faced with a tech crisis. I turned it off and back on again. I also closed the camera lens, something I had forgotten to do with this one. It hasn't tried moving since. Let's hope it stays that way.

Since it does come with motion detection, one nice thing about it (yes, there is something positive about it I guess) is that even when disabled, the screen can be swiveled. Now, I do like that. I have had to adjust the screen a little depending on where I am in the room or because of the glare of the lights and it's nice to not have to move the whole device. I do sometimes wish you could lock it into place though. No swiveling at all. If there is such a feature (outside of the motion detection disable), I haven't found it yet.

Aside from that, just as with my other echos, I really like it. It's great for checking our blink cameras, watching news or tv, playing music throughout the house, controlling our lights, creating shopping lists, reminders and the like, or just being entertained by asking silly questions. Me and Alexa can have hours of fun with the last one. She's a crazy gal. There are so many things you can do that I doubt I will stop with the 10. As a matter of fact, I know I won't. As Amazon keeps making them, I will probably keep buying them, eventually having one in every single room in our house. I'm honestly pretty close. What will I do then, you ask? Well, we do have a garage and I have a workout shed, so we shall see.....",4.0 out of 5 stars

PMR,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2023","I bought this mainly to use it as a video call unit (I intend to buy a second one soon, which will be installed at a relative's house). My second use is watching the house when I'm away (via the app on my cell) and seeing a couple of cameras I have installed.

That said, here are my PROS and CONS.

PROS:
- Nice screen of a good format and size. The resolution is really good, too.
- Good sound, equivalent to (if not better than) what my Echo 3rd gen produces.
- Should make a nice video call set (more on that when I install the second unit; I will get back here to update my review).
- The screen follows you (most of the time)!

CONS:
- The screen is way too reflective. That makes it hard to read if there's a window behind you.
- A white power cord for a black unit, really, Amazon?! OK, I understand it saves YOU some bucks, but it's an eyesore at my all-black countertop. A black unit should come with a black cord, period. Good thing I had an Echo 3rd gen. with a black cord I could use (my Echo can keep the white cord since it falls hidden behind a piece of furniture).
- While I'm at that... the power cord has a different adaptor than the Echo Dots. So you can only replace the eyesore white cord like I did if you have an Echo (not the dot, but the taller one, which also uses a different adaptor -- come on, Amazon, standardize that stuff!)
- Somewhat harder to hear you... and I can attest to that since I have five other Echo Dots 3rd gen plus an Echo 3rd gen in the house. You call it, it doesn't hear you, and you need to repeat it louder. It's so annoying that sometimes a Dot in a far-away room will reply to your command instead of this unit, which is right on your face.
- Besides, you can say ""Alexa, do [whatever]"" to an echo dot, while you have to call ""Alexa"" (wait for it to find you) and then ""do [whatever]"" on this thing. Not as fast/responsive as the Echo Dots.
- No infrared vision, so don't expect it to be helpful as a night camera to watch your house.
- It does follow you, but sort of ""crooked."" Its camera is off-center, so it usually doesn't ""look at you"" directly but a little sideways. No, there's no way to fine-tune that either. And sometimes, for no good reason, you can walk in front of it, and it won't follow you... I haven't yet figured out why and when it does follow me, even after telling her to ""follow me"" and activating that mode.

Finally, let's be honest: I love what it does, and many years ago, I was impressed with what this technology promised. But almost a decade later, Alexa isn't becoming smarter. It recognizes my face and my voice. But if I tell her my birthday or some other fact about me, she's still incapable of memorizing it (yes, I can create a note, but that's not the same as this thing really KNOWING when my birthday -- or anyone's birthday -- is).

Today, it also should be smart enough to receive two or more commands at once, like ""turn off my office light, turn on my bedroom light, and play music.""

And even though I have a Fire TV at home, it took way too many commands and internet searches until I got this new unit to control it (it kept replying, ""your Fire TV can't do that"" to every command; I finally got it to work, but definitely not a user-friendly set up as I'd have expected).

So the promise of Artificial Intelligence is still in the air. This thing has good voice recognition, but its features and skills are still not worthy of being called ""intelligence.""",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jason Gaines,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2021","UPDATE 4-17-21: Still working fine, no issues. Only thing I wish, is that I had just waited a month to purchase this as it went on sale super quick for $50 less. What’s the point of being an early adopter if it’s a negative?! I’d rather have just waited; next time I will. ;(

UPDATE 3-30-21: Our Video Apps Crashing issue came back, so I contacted Amazon again and they decided it would be best to replace the unit. A new one will be here in another day, so I can see if that one has any issues. I do like the Show 10, but I'm a little less smitten with it then I thought I would be. Again, the motion part is not as useful as one would like due to it's ability to actually track you properly without getting lost. I do really enjoy having a device to watch something in the kitchen while chilling out or cooking, and playing music on it is actually quite nice. Maybe it just needs to grow on me some more, and absolutely have the video apps stop crashing that is a definite.

So we’ve had this for a month now. It’s been fun to get to use it and see what it can do. That being said, it’s not as useful as I thought it would be. This is much less a tablet and more a media player. You can’t customize it like a Kindle or other tablets and put your own apps on it. It does play music really well and it does okay with smart home stuff. But that is an Alexa issue not Echo Show problem. I was hoping we had more customization with this but the OS is pretty closed loop.

Motion: Hit or Miss. it will follow you when you tell it to, but it will lose you easily, especially if you are too close to the unit or move to rapidly. There is a happy space of probably about 5ft to 8ft where it will follow you well. Too close and it will focus on something else, same thing for too far away. It loses you and once it does it forgets who it was following. Too many people around can confuse it as well. If it’s just you and your cleaning dishes or cooking, you should be okay.

Video: we had an issue with our unit crashing any video app such as Prime Video or Netflix after about 5-8mins of watching something. It would just go back to the home screen and forget what you were watching. If you started the app up again you had to start back from where you began as it would not save your progress. Calling support just recommended a factory reset which was going to be our next step anyways, and so far that has corrected the crashing.

Security: it’s easy enough to view the camera on the Show and move it left or right to see what’s around the area. Just remember you can’t move the screen up or down remotely, so if it tilted too far up it will limit your view. Otherwise it works well, and the screen notifies you when someone is remotely viewing on the screen.

Customization: Meh, it’s okay but will take some time getting used to the OS. It works like a tablet in the fact you tap or swipe to get to stuff, but again you can’t add any apps from an App Store. The OS is locked to what it is, and maybe that’s a good thing so it doesn’t get corrupted by junk we all like to add. Still, it limits the functionality and use of this device.

Overall: It’s a sound bar with a video display that can control smart home apps. The sound is really good, loud and crisp. Video is nice and smooth and if you have issues try a reset of the device. Not as full featured as a full on tablet, but pretty good over all. I gave it a four star rating. Really it’s a 4.5, but not a full 5 so I’m not picking that just because they don’t give us half ratings to use. It’s not cheap at $250 new right now, but it is worth the price if you want a good setup for say the kitchen or other room except for living room.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Andrea D. Wilson,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2023","I recently purchased the Echo Show 10 HD smart display from Amazon, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed. The Echo Show 10 delivers an outstanding audio experience that truly stands out. The sound quality is simply amazing, providing a rich audio experience that elevates your entertainment.

The picture quality on this smart display is top-notch as well. The HD display offers crisp and vibrant visuals, making it a pleasure to watch your favorite movies and shows. Whether you're streaming content or catching up on the news, the Echo Show 10's screen display ensures a fantastic viewing experience.

One of the standout features of the Echo Show 10 is its dynamic motion functionality. The fact that the display moves to follow you as you move around is a game-changer, especially during Alexa calls. This means that the person you're talking to can continue to see you as you go about your daily tasks, whether you're cooking, cleaning, or simply multitasking. It adds a whole new level of convenience and connection to your video calls.

While the dynamic motion feature is impressive, it's not always flawless. There are times when the motion can be a bit off, which can be a minor inconvenience. However, I'm optimistic that with future updates and improvements, this feature will become even better over time.

The Echo Show 10 also offers premium sound quality, allowing you to enjoy your music and content with exceptional clarity and depth. The combination of stunning visuals audio creates an all-encompassing entertainment experience that's truly top tier.

In addition to its audio and visual capabilities, the Echo Show 10 provides a versatile platform for doing more. You can effortlessly watch your favorite movies and shows, stay updated with the latest news, and access a wide range of Alexa skills that enhance your daily life.

Overall, the Echo Show 10 HD smart display is an incredible addition to any smart home setup. It offers outstanding sound and picture quality, and its dynamic motion feature makes it a standout device for video calls. While there's room for improvement in the motion aspect, the overall experience is highly satisfying. This device's premium sound and its ability to do so much more make it a worthwhile asset for anyone looking to enhance their home entertainment. You will not be disappointed.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Colleen,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2023","Okay, I'm having fun with Alexa. This morning I said ""Alexa, goodbye"". She replied, ""Let's make like a volcano and blow this place"". I will greet her when I return, and she often has a witty reply. She wakes me up to music which starts playing low then gets louder and louder until I tell her I'm awake. The sound is amazing for such a little speaker. I can hear the ""thumping"" coming from my room when I walk down the hall. Drawbacks, I know there is so much I can do with her that I haven't learned and have had a hard time finding the features. Most I discover by looking at the screen. I just learned I can play Jeopardy and found out about a podcast. I have had her give me reminders at certain times. Such as, ""Colleen, you better start getting ready, you have company coming in an hour."" She created a playlist of my favorite songs, but when I ask her to show me my favorite playlist, she only shows me the first song I added to it. In the end, I've had it about a week and I love it. I just want to know what else I can do. -- UPDATE -- so I have had this a couple of months. I love almost everything about it, except I know there are a lot of things than can be done and finding information on that is difficult. For instance, it let me make an outgoing call, but I don't know how to assign a contact and when I called the person, I didn't know what number to give them to call back. My phone is crap, so this would be a great alternative when I'm home. The screen will show a feature, but when I want to get more information, it has changed to a different screen, and I don't know how to back up to review what it just showed me. I will ask Alexa to go back to last screen and she's confused, I will ask her to tell me about it, and she's confused. For instance, the screen flashed something about a ""Bot"" for cooking and DYI, I wanted to know more about it and couldn't get it back. Or something will flash, but I don't have time to see what it is and I don't know how to bookmark it. Like I said before, I know there are a lot more options out there to utilize, but it doesn't come with any sort of manual. I've gone to YouTube videos, etc.. but haven't find anything to help. Other than that, I love the product and would buy it again.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jay,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2023","Bought this on amazon prime day a few weeks ago. It is currently placed on a kitchen counter between the kitchen and living room in an open concept style house. Purchased mainly for the rotating feature that uses the camera to track the user as they walk around. This and the large screen have been great for working in the kitchen or asking about the weather from the living room. The downside of this feature is that below a certain level of light the device no longer moves the screen to follow you, displaying a message that says ""light level too low, movement disabled."" So at night if we don't have bright kitchen and dining room lights on, it doesn't move; and we largely keep those lights off when not in active use. In our home at night we noticed that just ambient light on from lamps in the room isn't enough for it to follow us. The device really needs something like an infrared sensor so it can work at night time like what Ring security cameras use for night vision. Adding this hardware would make this a must have product for your kitchen and bump this up to 5 stars. Other than that drawback, the included speaker, screen quality, and snappiness of the processor is better than past Eco Shows I've owned (still have the original echo show, 5 inch, and 8 inch models). As far as voice recognition it's the same as other models, although for the team working on Alexa it never understands the word ""closet."" We placed smart lighting in our closet, and she always replied with ""What device?"" and we'd have to yell ""closet"" a second time and it was hit or miss on the second attempt. Out of frustration we renamed the smart lighting to ""bathroom"" and that works 100% in turning on the lights in the closet, but that's been our only real issue with voice recognition.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Mark E Timperley,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2021","My first real Alexa enabled product, if you don't count my Kindle Fire... but more on that later.

First, I bought two Echo Show 10s, one for our kitchen and one for grandma. They were very easy to setup and have worked well so far (4 days in). I'm definitely impressed with the design and the quality of components, from the touch screen, buttons, motion and sound. All physical aspects are very well done. Do you need a screen that moves on its own? Yes! I can't imagine this product without motion. So far, we use the Echo Show 10 to ""drop in"" on grandma virtually, several times a day and every night for dinner. We love this ability! The Echo Show turns to whoever is speaking and zooms in on them, so she feels like she is right there with us and her grandchildren (not 25 feet away, outside a fish bowl). The best part of this technology is that Grandma didn't have to learn how to answer the ""video phone"", since it just connects when we want. In general, it works all by itself in her apartment (mostly) and we can control much of it remotely if needed. I do set and adjust reminders and alarms for her when needed, but beyond that we just ""drop in"" and say hello, whenever.

So that's the awesome part. We are discovering a few annoyances as we go, so I'll share one that is probably unique to this product: The process of adjusting and setting the range of motion is not well thought out. If you only ever did this once and then set the thing in cement, then maybe. But we set it on a counter and have already found that it must be moved for cleaning, to temporarily get it out of the way, or for use in another position. It takes about 4 minutes to reset... which is about 3.5 minutes too long for me. The other annoyances are all about ""Alexa"" so I'll mention them last.

Also, I've described a somewhat ideal grandma use case, so keep in mind that we only live 10 minutes from grandma and have had to drop by and ""fix Alexa"" (turned off, moved, lost wifi, screen rotated by hand) while she and visitors are getting used to it, so it's definitely not a set and forget type of technology, but I'm not going to reduce my rating because of that.

My rating would have been 5 stars, if it wasn't for Alexa herself and the somewhat puzzling UI design, menus, etc. Did I mention my Kindle Fire? Here's my point. You need one to control this thing and use many of the ""Alexa features"" with any level of certainty. You could also use a smartphone with the Alexa app, and we actually use both, but I find the Fire is a bit easier to use. This probably isn't news to someone who already has an Echo, but in case you are new to Alexa, using voice commands to find and select a book or other media for it to show or read by voice, to set a reminder, or just about anything beyond a few words, can be a terribly frustrating experience. It is amazing what it can do, but hopefully, engineers are still hard at work improving voice recognition and comprehension. Until then, my recommendation is to pair them. Echo Show 10 + Kindle Fire (with Alexa off on your Kindle) makes a great product together!

So Alexa, how do you spell frustrating? Her dutiful answer is ""F R U S T R A T I N G"" but also awesome, all at the same time. She doesn't get the joke yet... but given what she is capable of, why would she think I'm joking?",4.0 out of 5 stars
Roxie Muzic,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2021","Prior to this the household has the Gen 1 & 10"" Gen 2 Echo Shows, frankly I prefer the Gen 2 10"" Echo Show for most rooms over this model, but then...with firmware improvement/updates that opinion may change.

Other than the slight reduction in sound (I could care, I have multiple Sonos speakers) and screen resolution (as others have pointed out), the overriding feature of this iteration of Echo Show is the camera and 360 degree motion.

The camera is outstanding in resolution, very outstanding, worth the reduction in sound and screen resolution.

Motion however, needs work, the hardware used in this device to detect stability and motion needs serious firmware tweaking, way to sensitive, everything is ""unstable"", even the most stable. Understanding the need to be cautious, in that this slues around, to follow or view it's human or humans, however, ratchet the sensitivity down some to avoid the error messages that are unfounded when the device is on a stable, unimpeded full motion area. Currently if it even rocks a millimeter when turning, it throws the ""unstable"" error. I ordered two of these 10"" Gen 3 Echo Shows, both are behaving in this fashion. A little tweaking to the firmware of the device should solve this little sensitivity issue I would hope. This is not a game changer for me, this will be refined as customer feedback is received, or at least I have found that their development team is very responsive to these consumer observations. Kudos to them for that.

Next, that obnoxious, unnecessary screen of ""Alexa For Your Day"", for the love of every customer that you have, get rid of this, please, it is not a selling feature. Or, at least give us the option to have it show or not show in the Home Screen toggle switch section of the settings. It really is a ""bummer dude""...... if it keeps it up, it could be a game changer for me.

I can live with the HUGE time notification on the screen, I am old, but not blind, can we scale it down or have an option to scale it down, please, thank you. Not a game changer, but it is quite large you must admit...

All in all for the kitchen or the main floor/office in houses this is a great device, allows camera viewing 360 degrees, great idea for those who do not have indoor cameras already and as an adjunct for those of us who do. Have not used it for recipes in the kitchen yet, but I suspect that this will be a vast improvement over the Gen 2 10"" Echo Show, in that it will follow me in my meandering attempt to cook (hopefully it will not catch me crying on the kitchen floor over cooking fiascos). Phone calls to other Echo Show owners should be improved as I meander when talking to folks as well... I believe as the feedback rolls in, there will be improvements to screen data that pops up uninvited (please, pretty please), and the motion sensitivity concerns.

I am pleased with this purchase, but most likely will replace the rest of my Gen 1 Echos with Gen 2 10"" Echo Shows, this model has limited placement criteria and may not be the best Echo for every spot in the house. I will purchase one additional 10"" Gen 3 Echo Show for my office, but for bedrooms the Gen 2 10"" Echo Show should be sufficient.

As for the white cord, I can live with that all day long...aesthetics in this area are the least of my worries....",4.0 out of 5 stars
Priscilla,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2023","Love the size and the look; However, compared to its sister products I own it is very hard to navigate. 1) I find myself constantly repeating the commands over and over as ""Alexa"" doesn't know that or a lot of ""Hmmmms"" very frustrating; 2) I primarily purchased this to watch TV in the kitchen - well that doesn't seem to be working well either; for starters I cannot download the apps I have on my firestick so that's annoying (please help if avail in this area); if you do actually get to watch content and want to ""pause"" forget asking her via voice she has no clue how to do this, so, I pause manually (usually with my hands full of dirty gloves which also is a pain) so, now we have it paused for a little bit - the screen goes to screensaver mode and the content goes Into the black hole and I cannot retrieve it again or if I'm lucky to retrieve it it is no longer paused and I have to watch from the beginning!!! Super annoying! This is one of the most costly items in the Amazon line and for that reason alone I wish it would work as it's beloved firestick; firetv or even the echo!!! As I have zero issues with these products.

Coqui,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2022","This is my second review after having about 3 months of use. My first review is included below. Presently I have an Echo first Gen, Echo Plus and the Echo Show 10 ( 3rd Gen ) which is the one I am reviewing now. I now have notice that the response time of the new Echo Show 3rd Gen is much higher then my Echo first Gen and my Echo Plus. This is evident when asking a question or requesting some smart home action. It’s taking the Echo Show 10 much more time to response and sometimes it just doesn’t response at all. This is a bit disturbing when doing “Drop In” since it does take much longer to establish the connection and sometimes it times out without even connecting. If I am near the screen I watch for the horizontal line which appears on the bottom of the screen before speaking and it’s taking too much time to appear. My Echo First Gen and Echo Plus response immediately. I have fiber in ( 1 GB ) to my home network and the Echo Show 10 is the closets to the router ( in the same room ), in clear sight without any structural interference. The Echo first Gen and Echo Plus are located farther away in different rooms yet they have a much quicker response time. Hey Amazon do something about this.
First review:
I purchase this Echo Show 10 ( 3rd Gen ) to replace an Echo Show 8 in order to have a bigger screen, better sound and the ability to rotate around that way I can monitor my home when away. Having the bigger screen is always a positive when viewing at different distance since you now have the ability to move around and the screen will follow you. The image quality is the same as the echo show 8 but it is acceptable. I have adjusted the sound quality to my preference and it is a improvement over the echo show 8, but I was expecting more after reading the reviews. Currently I have a Echo 1st Gen, Echo Plus, and my Echo Show 10 connected to my home network and I find that my new Echo Show 10 is slower in responding and sometimes the follow up mode just doesn’t work. I am connect to fiber, 1 gigabit in and have strong signal throughout my home and the Echo Show 10 is located closest with direct sight to the router then the other Echos, therefore I am at the moment a bit intrigued as to why the slow response. I am very satisfied with the remote viewing operation and do use the Drop In constantly to checkin on family members. In general I am satisfied with my purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Sunhawk,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2022","Simply put, Amazon still struggles with the electronics game. While the idea and potential are great, their development team is satisfied with mediocrity. The most glaring deficiencies are as follows:

Ads: I’m tired of everything interactive from Amazon pushing ads. It’s bad enough with my Kindle, but it’s even worse with this Echo Show 10. People want to personalize their devices. Amazon uses it as a platform for pushing products. The worst part is their idea of what is appropriate. While some people don’t care what their children see, I don’t need a device that we utilize in the kitchen pushing Prime and Netflix shows that we don’t want to watch as adults, let alone expose our children to. If we could determine a rating level for ads that would be decent. But, no. We get whatever indecent show pays you for air time. Let us turn it off!

Suggestions: If I want assistance learning everything this device can do, I’ll do the research. I don’t need to be guided day-in and day-out for the lifespan of this device. I also don’t need to be aware of the 4.8 million rinky-dink, third party apps with which the device can be used. Let us turn it off!

Photos: Awesome! Let me load and see a cycling photo show of all all my fami…. Nope. Interrupted by ads.
Oh good. Back to my phot…. Nope. App suggestion.
Yay! That day we went as a family to the state par….. No! I don’t need to know how Alexa can sync with my garage door! Why have a photo show if I only see a photo 10% of the time?!?!

Camera: Awesome! This thing will follow me as I move about the …. What are you looking at Echo? I’m over here. No. Over here.
For some awful reason, they decided to put the camera in the corner and the microphone in the middle. This results in it perpetually being at the wrong angle. It could be compensated for by adjusting the software. Or they could just swap the camera and the microphone spots. It’s common sense. How did their engineers not think of this? More importantly, how did it get through the test team? Oh, wait. We’re the test team. Three generations of user reviews, and they still can’t get it right.

Ultimately, Amazon, this falls on you. Quit pushing ads. Allow us to disable the help/suggestions. Let us have control of our home screens. That’s what people want out of their electronic devices: the ability to make them function for them. Not as a source of advertising revenue for you. Give us control.

Thomas J. LaCalamita,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2021","So this is a cross comparison review. I purchased the echo show 10 and google home max and our family used them side by side for 2 weeks. Googles nest Max is not as good as the echo show 10 in terms of sound quality, volume and versatility but if you have other google products it's still the best choice. Software on both is very good, as good as it gets, integration with Google apps is good but it all boils down to what video calling apps your friends use.

The issues I had with the Google Nest Max:

- the screen is at a fixed angle and has tremendous glare in our Kitchen. Most kitchens have alot of windows and light. We ended up purchasing the $30 swivel stand which was a must. This stand solved the glare problem. Still not half as good as the 360 degree show, which tilted and swivels, following you if you so chose to do.

-the sound quality stinks and the volume is not linear. I mean, it sounds worse than our tiny 1st gen Google nest mini. In most cases you can't hear it at 10 ft away in a vaulted ceiling kitchen without turning it up past 5 of 10. Most of the time it's on Volume 8 sometimes 9. There is some issue with the software where it decides what the volume should be. Watching news in the morning is an exercise in frustration. We don't have this issue on our Google nest mini, volume was normally 5. Maybe something is wrong with it. Unless your 5 ft away, prepare to change the volume every news story. What can I expect when Google placed the speakers the opposite direction of the screen, so you need to place it by a wall, not on an island. It can't hold a candle to the fidelity of the echo show 10, leagues better.

-no web browser
-no aux output to improve sound quality and Bluetooth only works for an input
-the microphones work well but not well enough, theres no sensitivity adjustment.
-price, it's expensive and not competitive when compared to the echo show 10s glitz and glamor.

The issues I had with the echo show 10:
-video app limitations, I only know 2 people who I regularly call who have Alexa apps so that was a deal breaker for me
-security camera that doesn't work in the dark is useless half the time

In short, the Amazon Echo Show 10 won me over.
But if using a Google Duo is a deal breaker I would have kept the Echo Show 10 because it's better in every way. But convincing my family and friends to use Duo was a failed experiment.",4.0 out of 5 stars
John,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2024","The functionality and the inner connection with other items in my home is exemplary. It is nice to be able to have the shopping list and Reminders that can port to my phone so if I’m out at a store I can just simply contact the echo show 10 and get my shopping lists or reminders. The use of the camera while outside of the home is phenomenal and use of it as a motion detecting security camera and the cloud storage give a piece of mind for home monitoring. The echo show 10/3 generation is built. Well, it has good sound, and the visuals are clear without distortion or refresh rate headaches. The only complaint that I have about it is that the camera is on the left side instead of centrally located and ending motion wants to cant the screen slightly to the right. There should be a calibration for centering the screen on you and not the cameras orientation.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jason B,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","I got this to upgrade my current Show 10 that I have. I thought this one would be cool to have the thing follow you when in the kitchen, etc. As it turns out, it is pretty cool...but not cool enough to justify replacing one that is working perfect right now. There were a few things about it that I did not really care for.

1. As others have mentioned, it comes with a white power cord. Yes I know it's petty, but when the unit is black, the cord should be black. Send the white cord with the white units. Most people purchase a particular color to help blend it into the surroundings, having a bright white cord with a dark black unit seems pretty silly and is an easy fix on Amazon's part.

2. The motion part is pretty cool. It does depend on where you have it sitting. We had ours on the island for a short bit and it followed around pretty good. After moving it more into the corner and readjusting the settings, with the camera offset to the right, it wants to turn more to the left and always feels as if it's not really in your line of sight. You don't look to the top right, you are looking at the middle of the screen so it seems to me that having the camera more centered would make more sense. I quickly disabled the motion setting though and just had it sitting in one place.

3. The Live View check in or whatever it's called is pretty cool...but when you have the piece sitting on the counter, unless you are super short, you have it angled up so that you can see it. So then when you initiate the live view and turn the camera around, it's super cool as long as you want to see the ceiling or at least not see anything under about 5 feet in your house. So it's pretty useless for that in my opinion. The other option is just always remember to put the screen back more at a 90 degree angle to the counter before you leave for the day....because everyone will remember to do that!

All in all, it just was not worth the upgrade so it's going back to Amazon. The looks and sound of the unit are great, it sounds good and it looks cool though and I would for sure get one if I did not already have the older version of it.",4.0 out of 5 stars

E. Chen,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2023","The Echo Show works well enough to check on my ring door bell, serve as a photo frame among other tasks that's enhanced with a screen, but the key value for me was video chatting with my family on their Echo Show 10s. Unfortunately, it did not work at first, and I almost returned it. The video calls suffered from extreme lag/freeze (on very fast internet connections), and even the audio was stuttering. After a lot of my own detective work and assistance from Amazon tech support -- I will spare you the details of testing with my sisters who own different versions of Echo Show & Alexa devices etc. -- it turns out that you need to disable the ""enhanced option"" for Echo Show 10 to Echo Show 10 to avoid this insufferable lag issue. To do this, go to the Alexa app on your phone, select ""more"" (lower right corner), select setting, select communication, disable enhanced.

The video chatting is wonderful once it works! The camera follows you around (horizontal only but you can manually tilt it on the vertical axis) and both video and sound are clear. The ability to just say ""Alexa, call ___"" to initiate a video call is invaluable for my tech-challenged parents.

I believe that group call requires enhanced option, which doesn't seem to be working now. Maybe they'll fix this... it's not a big concern for me, and so I didn't try very hard to make it work.

Observation re: Amazon tech support:

Tech support was not easy to find. To chat with them, you need to go to ""Your Orders"" and find the button next to your product. The first agent took about 10 minutes to reply to each sentence... it was excruciating slow to just get ""re-boot your Echo Show."" The second agent I reached solved the issue right away after I provided the results of all my experimentation.

CH,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021","Wow looks like I'm going to be the first review on here. I actually got my unit a day before the release, but I still haven't had enough time to thoroughly review. I do have a few first impressions though:

1) Much smaller in person than what I thought. The screen size is the same as the Gen 2, but it appears substantially smaller. I guess the large triangular shaped back of the Gen 2 never really won me over. The Gen 3 motor is much smaller from my visual perspective. But I know those of you who are into specs will assuredly do the side by side comparison.

2) The screen resolution is the same as the Gen 2. I knew that based on reading specs, but I do wish they opted for a higher resolution. Given that the device has a much sleeker look (in my opinion) it does detract from the design.

3) I wish there was a way to utilize the ""turn to wake word"" capability without having the camera. I understand the two work in tandem in order to turn the screen towards the speaker, but if it could simply turn in the general direction of the speaker via the echolocation feature it would be nice. At least as an option. I generally prefer to not have uncovered cameras connected to the web unless I'm actively using them. I know that the whole point of the Gen 3 is all about the camera and it's rotating base, but I think they should have at least given multiple options in the settings to utilize some/all of the technology.

For those wondering about the performance of the rotating base under normal use, it works really well. I think they've fixed some of the bugs that were pointed out in the reviews from your big tech websites because I couldn't duplicate them. The one issue/weak point I found is that if you get really close and move out of view really quick then it may lose your position. Based on the layout of our home we have to walk right up on the device to get to the kitchen and if this is done quickly then the device may not track us all the way into the kitchen. I'm sure this will be fixed in later updates.

I will update this review as I get more hands on time.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Bryan McMillan,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2021","I bought two and have used for a few weeks now. The motion is nice when using the camera to view inside the room. It may be nice when using for calls but I haven't tried this feature. Neither of mine consistently face the right direction when speaking to the echo. That said, I didn't really purchase these for the motion so I didn't take off any stars for that. I only took off a star for the sound which, given the size of the base, I was hoping would be better. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad... just not as good as I hoped. I was hoping for sound at least as good as my Bluetooth HK speakers. Every aspect of movement and display that I wanted to customize is customizable. The only thing I would like is a longer display time for picture cycling. I have it set to the longest setting and it still seems too fast. The picture quality looks good and the auto brightness does a good job adapting to lighting conditions. I was hoping the Ring doorbell could be set to autodisplay when the doorbell is pressed but I couldn't find any setting for that in the Echo or Ring skill settings. It's kind of clunky to have to say Alexa show the front door... look to see who it is and then if desired say... Alexa answer the front door. The Ring cameras are also slower to load on the Echo than they are on my phone with the Rapid Ring App. Not sure if this is an issue with the Ring skill or the Echo itself. The Echo Show in my living room replaced a 1st Gen Echo and the one in my kitchen replaced a 1st Gen Echo Dot so the Show is a big improvement in every way over these but some things were not as good as I expected. Maybe some of the issues (besides sound) will be worked out with future firmware or skill updates. I would still recommend purchasing and only knocked off one star because I think sound quality could be better even at this price point.

Great concept, has potential-2* So far, I am very disappointed in the performance of this device. I was super excited to upgrade from the Echo show 5 to a larger screen, all the other bells and whistles weren't a main part of my decision making. This device is so unresponsive to the simplest voice commands that it's unbelievable. I have to say ""Alexa"" up to 3 times before it acknowledges and everything I ask it to do has way more of a delayed response than my older devices, Dot & Show 5's. I would be fine if it only would have met the standards of the Show 5 device but it can't compete. Even the volume up and down buttons have delayed response. I wasn't caught up in the motion capabilities but even that is way off, randomly moves in an empty room and often has motion error. It also makes a clicking sound, not sure why, it's not loud enough to be disruptive just unexpected. I am seriously considering returning it and downgrading to the Show 8 instead. It's looks snazzy but it's not easy to navigate and touchscreen lags as well and using the Alexa app has an even more slow response than the voice command.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Ronald M. Chavin,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2021","Advice to the user: Using the touch screen, use your fingers to select ""Settings,"" then select ""Home Content,"" then find ""Rotate Continuously,"" then select ""Off"" (the white color) for ""Rotate Continuously."" Unfortunately, this action will only partially solve the irritating problem of your Echo Show 3-10 moving by itself when you don't want it to move at all.

1st Suggestion for the manufacturer: Just as there is a physical shutter on the Echo Show 8 and Echo Show 3-10 to prevent the camera from snooping like a voyeur, we need a physical way to lock the Echo Show 3-10 in a non-moving configuration so that it can never move when the user does not want it to move. Sometimes, the Echo Show 3-10 moves unwantedly by itself, even if not touched. Sometimes, the Echo Show 3-10 moves unwantedly after the user puts his finger on the touch screen to select something.

2nd Suggestion for the manufacturer: Sometimes, the user will want to see only the beautiful nature wallpapers, which keep changing every minute, without ever seeing suggestions or advertisements of any kind. Curremtly, there is no way to force Echo Show 3-10 to stop showing suggestions or advertisements.

3rd Suggestion for the manufacturer: An extremely high percentage of the people won't be able to turn their Echo Show 3-10 ""On"" during the first day. Why? Because the Power Cord needs to be snapped very tightly into the Echo Show 3-10. Most people will just plug it in without snapping it in tightly. When people begin to panic after their Echo Show 3-10 won't ever turn ""On,"" they will look for a phone number to talk to a technician. There are no call-for-help phone numbers in the instruction booklet, no instructions on how to turn their Echo Show 3-10 ""On,"" no Troubleshooting Tips on what to do if their Echo Show 10 never turns ""On,"" but there is a web link for Device Support.

Advice to the user: Using the touch screen, use your fingers to select ""Settings,"" then select ""Sounds,"" then select ""Equalizer."" On my Echo Show 8, I set the Treble at absolute maximum, the Midrange at absolute minimum, and the Bass at absolute minimum. If I did the same for my Echo Show 3-10, the resulting sound would be too thin. As a result, for my Echo Show 3-10, I set the Treble at absolute maximum, the Midrange at 2 notches higher than absolute minimum, and the Bass at 1 notch higher than the absolute minimum.",4.0 out of 5 stars
teenie,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2023","I have a few of the shows , 3 of the first generation and three of the second generation . They all seem to work good , but thought that maybe I might like the follow me .

I unboxed this and got this set up very easy . Then I placed this on my counter to see how this looks and how well it works.

I use mine mostly to watch videos while doing cooking and crafting in my kitchen . I then used the follow me , it worked great until my kitty got up and started to watch the video. When she moved it followed her and not me , I had a hard time getting the cat away from this , I was watching the Flintstones and she goes bonkers to watch them, when she was a baby kitten I would leave them on for her to have sounds while I was gone.

If you have two people in the area , she will follow both and then it becomes interesting to see where she stops . After nearly a month of this I turned off the follow me , it just became a hassle when I wanted it to be centered straight.

The sound is great while listening to music , that’s one nice feature.

I am not sure I would buy a second one as this needs lots of space to set on my counter .

The best thing on this is while streaming prime videos this just keeps going , unlike the other models they stop playing after six episodes. This is very nice and I don’t have to keep it going .

I would recommend this if you have the space needed for it , otherwise I would get the other design.",4.0 out of 5 stars
F. Templeton,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2021","Package arrive in well built containment. Setup was easy. The main reason I bought it was to replace my Show 10"" tablet that we use to watch Comcast TV at the dinner table. But when I tried to setup to Comcast it reported that the browser was not acceptable. I hope there will be an upgrade to fix this. I was able to watch my remote Amazon Cloud cameras without any difficulty. But when it shows the new Blink camera it displays the view for a minute or two then reverts to the default home screen. I have to continuously tell it to show the Blink view.
As for the ability to detect motion, it reports that it doesn't work in low light. Some times it follows me around the room quite well, but other times it seems to get lost and point in the wrong direction. I find I'm constantly turning motion off or on depending on how well it's working. I recommend that Amazon move the camera to the middle of the bezel so the motion will face the screen more accurately instead of always a little to the left. They should also give us better commands to be able to direct the angle to others instead of just the person who is moving or talking. Such as ""Alexa turn the screen 15 degrees to the left"" or ""Alexa turn the screen 45 degrees to the right."" ""Alexa, hold that position until the next voice command"". ""Alexa keep Silk open for XXX minutes"" or ""Alexa keep the current display on until told to change it"". It's so frustrating to be looking at a web page in Silk and having to turn it on again every couple of minutes. AMAZON: GIVE US MORE CONTROLL!!! Or tell me where to find the list of controls that already exist. All I discovered so far is ""Alexa turn right"" and ""Alexa turn left"" and then it turns about 90 degrees.
I have set the Blink up over a dove's nest with good results but it won't keep the view going more than a couple of minutes.

G. M.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2022","I really have enjoyed the product. It is very practical and is convenient to have around the household. I really enjoy the feature that it recognizes the users face and it personalizes the media in order to cater to that person. The rotating gymic is honestly helpful especially in places like the kitchen were you are always moving around. But i would really like the product to return to a set position after it goes to sleep, as it remains in the position were it was last used. As all Alexa devices it has lots of features and can be really helpfull when you pair it with other devices. So far i have paired it with several lights and enabled a feature that turns on the lights with every alarm which is super useful.

Some imporvements that could be made:
The software on the app is sometimes dogey, when trying to acces the camera sometimes I dont get any image, sometimes I get an error eventhough its conected to the internet and sometimes I get a wierd distorted image that after a minute reverts back.
It would be usefull to set the device that once you finish using it it reverts to the set position eventhough it is moved around using the hands. As if someone pushes the camera, it would stay in that position and does mot revert back.
When the device is hooked to your spotify account, it would stay in the same song for a while and sometimes it drops the connection and stops playing any song. They should improve the conection between spotify app in phone and the device so that these erros dont persist.

Would definitely recomend to another person, but you should wait for when the product is discounted on a sale.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Miles Vincent Bridges,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2022","I use this on a daily basis to set alarms, play music, listen to podcasts, and do weekly reminders. It works incredibly well and its nice to have a good interface to look at while you're setting anything up. The only bummer about it is sometimes it has a hard time tracking your face and will flip around completely away from you even though you're standing right in front of it. Would love a better version, but this works great as is if you're keeping it stationary and pointed at you in a kitchen or office.

Things to keep in mind if you're buying this:
• If you've seen videos of people putting their own sound to routines, nix it now. They got rid of the feature that allowed you to use your own sounds and now apparently its a painful process to do.
• Its not the be all, end all. You still have to set up routines using the alexa app on a phone and go through all the hardship of learning what its actually capable of doing.
• If you're setting up voice operated routines, they have to be EXACT. So if you set up the routine to activate when you say ""Cheeseburgers and Fries"" it won't understand what you want unless you specifically say ""Cheeseburgers and Fries"". No variation will be accepted for the routine.
• This thing gets what I'm saying to it wrong all the time and I don't even have an accent. I'm from Illinois originally and I annunciate fairly well on what I'm saying about 99% of the time and it still has issues picking up what I'm saying correctly.
•It DOES allow for camera monitoring on multiple systems. I have a blink camera setup around my house / garage / etc.. that I can ask it to display camera 1 etc... to see views on the fly. Works extremely well. Would highly recommend setting it up.
• Splurge and get the monthly amazon music. I can spout off anything, including comedy specials and listen to them whenever I want through voice commands. Extremely nice to have even if it costs a bit.",4.0 out of 5 stars
The Engineer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2021","With almost 16k reviews of this written so far; I gave a lot of thought to what I'm going to cover. It's my hope the developers will use this feedback to improve the ""4th Gen"" version.

Stiction versus Friction
========================================
I've placed the Echo on a surface, that is normally covered with a cloth (see pictures). Now, I'm not sure how the drive mechanism works, as to whether the momentum is imparted from the base to the head, or vice-versa. But over a 1 week period of back and forth motion; the base has a tendency to ""twist"" around enough on the cloth, so that any ""motion stop"" settings are now off. Currently, the only way I've been able to resolve the issue, is to place a tile coaster between the base and the cloth.

Needs Night Vision
========================================
People detection does not work, below a certain light level. I first noticed this, after creating a people detection triggered routine; in which Alexa is supposed to turn on the room light, and yell ""Peekaboo, I see you!"" at 100% volume. The only way I got this to work, was to place a nightlight in the same area. Low light levels also cause the Alexa app to mistakenly think the camera's privacy cover is on. Attempting to ""drop in"" on a darkened room causes the app to declare the privacy cover is being used. Again, the immediate solution is a nightlight.

Parallactic Error -- ""You're too close""
========================================
There seem to be many complaints about camera and display tracking. The root cause, is the camera is mounted off to the side; instead of the center of the display. If you are too close to the Echo, and the camera is looking at you, you will feel that the display is ""pointing the wrong way."" You need to be at least 4 or 5 feet away, to overcome this effect.

Newton's First Law versus Motion Stop
========================================
One of the ""cutest things"" Alexa does with this Echo, is to ""wag her head (or tail?)"" if you thank or compliment her. Unfortunately, if this occurs when the display is already positioned at the end of a motion range setting; the display will overshoot the end stop by a few degrees and hit whatever you were trying to protect, LOL.",4.0 out of 5 stars
B,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2021","While the screen and sound are good, the echo show 10, unlike the echo 8 and echo 5, has significant software issues.

Most notably, Home Content Settings are entirely ignored by the device. Regardless of what options you set to be shown or not shown, the device will display ALL home content. For example, we have turned off all home content besides weather, and disabled rotate continuously. Despite this, the Echo 10 continues to display all content, and rotate through it. News, Sports, Covid Tips, Recipes, etc all display constantly despite being turned off in home content settings.

This has grown more and more irritating for us, and we are likely to return the devices if they are not fixed in the next week or two. We were very excited about the larger screen, better speakers, video calling with family, and other features, but seeing headline after headline, games, never ending covid content, and Amazon's corporate advertising for their products is becoming so frustrating that it's ruining our experience with the echo show 10. The echo show 8 and 5 both properly display only the home content we have turned on.

We have discussed with tech support, rebooted the devices, factory reset them, power cycled, gone through settings with tech support, and more, and had confirmed to us that this is a software issue across the entire echo 10 product line that will require Amazon to release an update to fix their devices.

Please fix this issue Amazon, as if it continues our family will all be returning these.

Edit: As of 8/24/2021 Amazon technical support reached out to let us know they had resolved this issue. We tested our devices and all now appear to show only the content we have enabled. Thank you for fixing this issue Amazon! With this fix, we have updated our review to four stars.

We would consider 5 stars if we could get native YouTube integration (rather than being forced to use the built in web browser to use YouTube), and if the OS for show devices were updated to be more similar to a tablet, at least as far as using apps (such as the Fire tablet line) rather than the extremely stripped down user interface that nearly every app currently is. Amazon should integrate an app store, and allow tablet-like navigation rather than forcing the user to talk to Alexa for most functions. Amazon should also allow for more web browsers than just their own 'silk' browser.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Satisfied Shopper,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2021","The microphone picks up the sound of the fan and turn to it even though I'm talking right in front the unit. So best not to have the unit close to distracting noises.
Four persons in the room and this thing moves constantly from one person to the other even though three are not talking.

I find the display ideal for video conferencing as it's very sharp. As of April 12th 2021 you can use the device for Zoom video conferencing meetings and you are able to and raise your hand. No other reactions available though like clapping etc.
I would love if one of the upgrades would be to show the kindle text while it's reading a book.
To get to the web browser you have to tell her google something otherwise she can't understand open a web browser.
Please add app icons just as you would on the fire tablet to make the interface much easier. It would be good to allow copy and paste features as well.

The camera automatically focuses as you move further away during video conferencing which is cool but the sound quality diminishes so you have to increase the volume to hear properly the further away you go.

The photo booth feature is cool. Just ask Alexa to open the photo booth and you can do videos, funny pics etc. With the tools available.

Loading Facebook albums you're limited to the number of albums you can select at a time for the screen saver, do add more photos in the selected albums if you want a greater quantity of images. Having the photos and other options are nice. It's like a mini photo frame with the usual Amazon newsflash and advertisements at times.
Sound quality is not all the best for this price range.
Ok guys, you can go ahead and buy this device now as the benefits are really cool. Especially with the Zoom meeting update feature. I also like the group calling from Alexa as well as being able to call regular phones in the US and UK.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Dorothy Evans,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2023","I love the concept. The execution of it is clunky and awkward. The follow mode doesn’t work as well as it should. You can set the range of motion and the idle position and it’ll “adjust” it based on what it thinks your movement is. Well, it doesn’t stay in the correct set idle position and only tracks well about 50% of the time.
If you want to watch a movie or YouTube video while you’re cooking or puttering in the room where your show is it is great-until you need to control a light or set a timer. It doesn’t pause your video in YouTube or Netflix. It just plain dumps you out of it. If and when you find it again it doesn’t remember where you were in the video. So if you want to watch something from start to finish make sure no one in earshot says the wake work or you have to start over or just give up.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Christi V,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2023",Relatively easy to use. I’m not a big Alexa user so we don’t really do much with it. I like that it shows my pictures. I like that we can look at and get notifications from the ring camera. Which is the only reason I bought it. She did get stuck in a weird loop of repeating motion at one of the cameras even though the ring app had no new notifications. Even tried deleting the camera from Alexa app and re add and didn’t stop. Then randomly quit and went back to normal. If you like interacting with Alexa you will probably love this device I just don’t use it a lot for other things other than what I stated above.,4.0 out of 5 stars
J TAYLOR,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2022","the product is great, a huge upgrade to a home that's alexa-orientated. It solves some of the common challenges, such as having multiple lists and timers, whose management is impossible using just verbal cues. If anyone has tried to cancel one of 5 alarms they have set, they'll know what I mean.
the visual display to augment the conversation is effective, and for things like adjusting lights, etc, it's handy to have the touch-control.
I also like the ability to watch netflix and other services through the device, again, as an augmentation to the kitchen, having hands-free control over a decent screen is very convenient, though the screen isn't huge, so it's more to watch a distracting show than to enjoy a movie on.
the screen following you around, is one of the major features you pay for with this variant however, and this is not perfect. It does a reasonable job of attempting to track the person talking to it, and as you walk around a kitchen, as someone invariably does, it sometimes keeps you front-and-center. But I can tell you my wife is growing hoarse, telling it to stay still and stop tracking, especially as you have kids walking through line of sight, and talking (not to alexa), it gets a little confused. I've also seen it reset its position when it figures you got board of it while washing the dishes, etc.
Scrolling through all your old pictures is another really nice feature my wife in particular loves, but be aware you need to upload all your assets to amazons photo service, and you'll end up scrolling through a bunch of images you don't really want to see, unless you manage your thousands of photos diligently, which I personally do not.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Jason Eckert,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2022","I received the Echo Show 10 as a gift - and in general love it. It has replaced an older Echo in our kitchen, and we have placed it on an island. It works very well on an island, and is my favorite echo device. The following are some device pros and cons:

Pros:

- Despite what I've read in many reviews - the Echo Show 10 does work with YouTube TV (sort of). You need to log in via the Silk brower. YouTube TV works about as well as YouTube does through Silk. The interface is a little clunky, and has crashed a few times. However - once a program is selected, it plays well.
- Availability of video services such as Netflix and Hulu.
- Movement is fun and works fairly well.
- The sound quality, and bass, is simply outstanding.
- Integration with smart home features.
- It does all Amazon Echo functions very well.

Cons:

- I receive a ""Motion is Temporarily Unavailable"" error - more often than I should. This is unfortunately quite common when watching video.
- Screen motion can get confused. There are five people in our house. When motion is enabled, the screen does not know who to follow (when there are multiple people in the room).
- My Echo Show 10 was shipped with a white power cable. I wish it were black ...
- No native YouTube app. (Although YouTube works pretty well in the Silk browser.)
- The advertisements. I have not found a way to disable them. They interrupt the Amazon photos screensaver we have enabled.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Setup was a breeze as was setup with all my other devices. I did have to do a factory reset on it to get the live view on the camera working ( I almost returned it because of it not functioning). The motion tracking is glitchy. I hope that a few updates will make it track better. Aesthetically, I like it more than the Show 10 G2. I think the sound is a little better. Picture quality is good. The ability to tilt the screen is nice (though it would have been great to tilt it via the app when you use live view). Live view is nice. It lets you know on the screen that someone in your house is watching you and the person at home has the option to disconnect them if they feel it's creepy or intrusive. The screen will scan the area you preset when you set it up but again, the ability to tilt up or down is not there so if your screen is angled high, you'll get great views of your ceiling. Like others have said, it would be great to have more customization over the unit such as the clock and Alexa suggestions and font size and style (especially at this price point). The cord being white on my charcoal unit is a non issue for me as my countertops are a dark marble and my walls and wall plugs are white so it blends in better than a black power brick. I got a $100 gift card from Amazon for opening an Amazon account so for $150, it was a great deal.

The screen is clear and bright and it does everything you expect it to do well. The follow mode on the motion works well except for the position of the screen when it is facing you, it isn't pointing directly at you, this is likely due to the camera being on the right side of the device. It always points to the left of your position. and while you can still see the screen just fine, it is annoying. Amazon could easily fix this with a software update so that it automatically compensates for the camera being off-center or they could allow a setting allowing the user to set the 'center' position when it is facing you. There are numerous complaints about this yet is has not been addressed. The only other issue is that they need to allow more content on the home screen, it should have the capabilities like the Show 15. They should also allow 3rd party widgets and some applications from the app store beyond the video apps.

I got a 10 and she got an 8 (10's were no longer on sale). Then our problems began. We could not stay in sync. Audio was never a problem but video was, at best, a still picture. And if it did return to motion, it was about 2 minutes out of sync.
After struggling with this on a daily basis, I thought that the problem was too much audio/video data trying to be uploaded via my Internet provider. Like most providers, my upload speed barely clears 11 Mbps (download speed is 100 Mbps, although I'm supposed to have 200). So I purchased a ECHO 5 to test my theory.
Yesterday, the call was perfect: her with an 8 and me with a 5.
So my recommendation is, stick with ECHO 5's if video calls are important to you. If this is not the need, and you like the idea of a larger screen, then go with an 8 or a 10. If you are using these devices to play movies, listen to music, you'll have no issues with downloads, even at lower speeds. And the picture and sound quality are brilliant.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Gregory Pennington,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2021","I use this device to video chat with my mom, who has a cognitive impairment and lives in a senior residence. The ""drop in"" feature allows me to connect without her needing to take any action to answer the call, and the rotation feature will generally find her, wherever she is in the room. These two features are absolutely amazing for my use case, and the Show has helped us feel much more connected than we could otherwise.

- There are a few hangups. The biggest is that if it becomes unplugged (which can happen sometimes), the show prompts for a password. My mom can't get past this on her own. I understand the intent behind this security feature, but Amazon should allow users who understand the risk the opportunity to disable it.

- Establishing a video connection appears to require a lot of bandwidth. It can take time and sometimes doesn't work when my phone is on 4G. Amazon should have more graceful fallback to low bandwidth modes, including potentially a voice-only fallback, if the connection cannot support video.

- The off center camera is a really weird decision, but it's not a problem at medium or long distances. There can be occasional tracking issues, where the echo gets lost. Generally though I've found tracking and virtual auto-zoom work pretty well.

- I want it to just show the time and photos, when not connected to a call. But there is some content, like Alexa tips, which cannot be disabled.

- The display can be really laggy sometimes, when bringing up a new screen, like the weather. There are many other bugs, but most are minor.

Overall, this is the best device I know of for staying in touch with someone who is elderly or disabled, and I am grateful to have it. With a bit more software maturity, it can be a five star experience.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Randi Coughlin,"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2022","I wasn't sure how I would like this given some of the reviews, but this device is pretty great. Not only can I look up recipes, keep time, and watch shows while in the kitchen now. But I can also creep in on my cats when I'm away and see what they're up to while I'm away (always on the counter when I'm not here apparently...jerks!). I also love that I can connect this to my personal calendar. I am one of those people who live by my calendar so I love that it tells me what's happening day to day and coming up. I've also never really used routines until i got this device. They're pretty cool when you have a screen to leverage.

The 1 major flaw, which many others have noted in their reviews, is the placement of the camera and how that affects the ""follow my face"" feature. Because the camera is located in the right upper corner it does not seem to ""follow"" very well and constantly bumps into things. I did try to adjust the ""follow"" range, and that did not work very well so I eventually just turned it off to avoid more frustration. In all fairness, it's a cool idea but not at all necessary.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The reason I gave it 4 stars is more of an Alexa issue. I really wish that Amazon would find a way to allow me to not see sponsored content. I don’t think it’s fair to show that given the amount of money I paid for the device.

R. Simons,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2021","I want to like this device so severely. Finally, I decided to take the plunge and get the most recent Echo Show 10. Let's start with a bit of background.
I own a first-generation Echo, three first Gen Echo Dots, an echo spot, and a First Gen Echo Show. I've had the second and third-gen Echo Dots (that I gave to my sisters), and I purchased an echo show five and a first-gen echo show for my parents.

Pros:
The movement of the screen is incredible, and it follows pretty well.
The screen is big and clear, easy to understand what is on it.
I love the sound
It responds to commands well when it hears me (more on that below), like all the other echos I've had before.

Cons:
There are times when I call out to it, and it doesn't hear me. I could be 10 feet away from it, and it won't listen to me anymore. We got it, so we didn't have to yell for one of the bedroom echo's to turn on our lights in the living room. Now, we still have to yell at times because it just doesn't hear us. There are other times where it won't listen to us, then we cry, and one of the bedroom echos picks it up, and the Show sits there.
I'm not too fond of the ads and the Alexa for your day, and those are annoying.

Conclusion:
Aside from the annoyances above, it is excellent. We bought a second one for my mother-in-law.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Austin Allen,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2021","Like the insect exhibit at the zoo this Alexa is very buggy. I still want to say the coolness factor and the fact it works about the same as all my other Alexa devices makes it worth it (plus i got it on sale, i would have kinda been disappointed at full price).

The timers will overlap each other on the screen so its just a hodgepodge of numbers in the upper corner.

The follow feature is basically still in beta as it needs lots of help and takes time to figure out who is talking if there are 2 people in the room.

Speakers are very nice, big improvements I have seen from my first gen Alexa to this one. Is it an Apple homepod or Bose? No. But I don't have the same appreciation for audio as others, so to me its pretty much fine if it is clear and clean sounding.

Screen size is nice, i am not sure I am gonna watch hulu or netflix on it, but Its nice for recipes and music, reminders since mine sits near the kitchen/great room area.

Overall i'd wait for a discount to grab one knowing it has bugs needing continued development before its really ready for everyday consumers. I like to grab things a few months after they come out to give time to get the major bugs out, but still accept it might need some updates before its perfect.

4/5 stars for coolness and the fact that it still functions as any other Alexa. If the bugs are fixed then this is an easy 8/5 stars, but they are just kinda rough for the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars
L R,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2022","We purchased this to add to our kitchen. The clubs quality of the speaker is better than expected. We like the larger screen for things like recipes. We like that it moves with us to help with video chat with other rooms in our house or the outside cameras.
Things that I would like to see improved or maybe we haven’t figured out how to work that yet are:
1) our microwave keeps disconnecting so we are unable to use the show to control that, which is one reason we purchased this product
2) some commands such as asking Alexa to play music in our home doesn’t always function properly and must be said multiple times before it works on this product vs our others
3) we would like to be able to pull up favorite recipes we have saved on our phones/iPads onto the echo show screen and so far we have not figured out how to do that without asking Alexa to open Google then manually searching for the specific recipe
4) Alexa stops playing music while I have a recipe open. Cooking without music just doesn’t work. One reason we purchased this was to have one device in our kitchen that does all the work.
Overall we’re satisfied with this product. We will continue to research to try to work out the kinks or hope that Amazon makes some updates to allow this to work to the full potential we would like it to.",4.0 out of 5 stars
TJ,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2021","The Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) works as expected. Both the screen and audio are better than the predecessor, though there is still room for improvement for the price. I will say once you've used the large screen it will be hard to go back, this is a major strength.

Room from improvement:

- The ""follow"" feature which moves the screen: I would have the camera fixed in its home position unless you're:
- On a call
- Dropping in
- Or in guard mode

Yes, you could manually close the shutter but then you need to walk to it and manually open it when you want to answer a call (who wants that). Having the camera move when you're playing music or just walking around can give you the feeling of having your every moved watched by someone on the other end (not exactly a warm and fuzzy).

- Zoom feature, (yes I know its coming) Now that you have a 13 megapixel camera, it would be great to have the echo ID the direction of the person speaking and zoom in (even when there are multiple individuals in the room and zoom in). I understand zoom is coming, it will be interesting to see how Amazon pulls it off. Though the movement is a nice, having a close up of the person speaking to be is more important and would really be a significant enhancement, especially if you're more than 7 or 8 feet away from the camera.

- Audio, though much better than the previous gen, could be tweaked a bit.

Having said all that I like the Echo Show 10 3rd gen and recommend it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Ivan Infante,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2021","Our home is heavily reliant on Amazon devices. Each room has one so I've been a first gen user from the very beginning. The sound is great and better than previous gens. I like the feature that it follows you as you walk around the room so its been great from that aspect as well. The one problem I have constantly is that it doesn't hear me as well as the other's I've had. My wife and I find that we need to repeat ourselves quite often. The other problem which I hope is a feature they include with the next gen is that the screen can also tilt automatically when you use it as a home security camera. A few weeks ago we left on vacation and we thought we forgot something at home. It seemed perfect to open the Alexa app and use the camera to see if we left the item on the kitchen counter. However, the lack of tilt killed the feature since the screen was tilted up and I mostly saw the ceiling and very little kitchen counter. Otherwise, I see it as an improvement from previous generations but I sure hope Amazon takes the tilt into consideration as that will make this just perfect.

The other thing I've noticed is a bug in the software. When you have a timer running and just want to glace at the screen... it overlaps the clock time on the top right hand corner. The overlap makes the timer and clock hard to see. I wish they would change this where logic would say if you have a timer... show clock on top and timers right beneath them.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Ron,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2021","For starters, there is no main menu screen. It just goes through recently done actions or music played and runs ads for different things. I do like the aod with the time and date and weather. The camera does not follow you properly, it doesn’t turn to you correctly more than half the time when you talk to it initially. If you touch the screen too hard it will tell you that it has bumped into something every time. After being bumped it goes limp and decides to just roll until it finds it’s own new settling spot. It’s very confusing to use compared to other echos shows I’ve used. The web browser is very slow even with my wireless speeds over 900mbps. When viewing my camera with this device, it constantly says buffering over and over and has a 10 second delay to real time. On every other device I use to view my cameras, it is in real time and it never buffers. The power cable is white and I have a black device, not a good look at all. The power cable is also far too short. It limits where it can be placed dramatically. I’ve had this since release day and I still have not had any updates other than the 3 it required after unboxing. If it’s not improved by the end of the week I will likely be sending it back. I do not see anything worth a higher price tag for this at the current time. If they get rid of all the bugs and make the software better in an update, THEN MAYBE it will be worth the high price.

Fran,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2021","I am a huge Echo fan. I have the original, a dot, Echo auto, Echo Show 5 and I was very excited to get the Echo Show 10 3rd gen. I was looking forward to using it for multiple tasks in the kitchen. Especially movies while working. I have been disappointed with the entertainment side of the 10. Every time I try to watch Hulu, it tells me ""something went wrong."" At times, it seems to even get confused with locating Prime Video. It seems getting movies on Prime and Netflix is hit or miss. I can never get Hulu on the Echo Show 5 or the 10. This has been a hugh disappointment. It continuously tells me NPR is not available. The Food Kitchen recipe feature works great. I can save and view any recipes. That has been a pleasure. I use the Echo 10 every day. If you don't care about Hulu or watching movies, it's great. Otherwise, you would be better off sticking to a less expensive version. I continue to be more than satisfied with my Echo Auto, Echo Dot, and original Echo. I am happy with the Echo Show 5 but I did not have the same expectations with that Show that I did when purchasing the Show 10.

6/18/21 This is an update to my original review. I contacted Echo support and they were able to resolve the problem. James was great and I can now watch Hulu live tv on my Echo Show 10.

Daiwan Smith,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2021","Out of the box: the Echo 10 3 Gen has great build quality and a solid feel. The rotary motor is smooth and moves effortlessly.

Setup: setup was simple requires some software updates on initial load up. Motion setup was ok, be sure to have a device on stable surface. The smallest detection in surface movement will cause the initial motion setup to fail. This can be a bit frustrating, but not a game changer. Hopefully a software update will help reduce surface movement sensitivity.

Sound: music is great on the device and clear has some really great lows with little to no distortion at max volume.

Video call quality: this is an awesome piece of tech I have had several video calls and the human detection and following is eerie but great. Voices and picture comes across clear on the device. Be sure not to accidentally bump the screen while in motion or this will cause the motion to stop. However, saying ""Alexa, Follow me"" will rengage the motion detection.

Be cautious of taking the device to max range, the device does not do a complete 360. Taking the device to max range may cause the camer/screen to bounce back and forth to try and capture the best angle. Make sure you are in a well lit room as the motion detection will remain unusable in low light situations

Overall: I am happy with the product it still retains a lot of the great Alexa features and integrates well with my smarthome setup.

Paul O,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","This is a revised review - I bought a unit the first week it became available which was returned, and recently bought this second replacement unit.
Best to look at Alexa and Zignee features separately -
For Alexa features, the 10 great. Same features as ole units, with the addition of the ability to have the frame track you so you can always see the screen clearly, and the ability to view the camera from the Alexa app and look around the room. If you dont want the tracking motion, it can be turned off in the settings. You can also block remove viewing in the app, and even when enabled, a notice is displayed that someone is using the camera.
For Zigbee features - currently this is OK, but not great. While there are good zigbee contact sensors and motion sensors, you may struggle to find something suitable for things like moisture sensors or garage openers.
There are moisture sensors and garage openers that will work with Alexa, but these often wireless and require a separate account (versus just connecting directly via zigbee), so you may find yourself managing additional accounts associated with these devices.
This is in contrast to something like smartthings (z-wave) which seems to have a lot more options in terms of devices that can connect directly to their hub (i.e. without additional accounts).
Im guessing this is just a relatively new feature for these echo hubs and more devices aside from contact and motion sensors will become available that connect directly via zigbee.
Even with the shortcomings on the zigbee front this is worth taking a look at - i would say 3.5 stars (rounded up to 4).",4.0 out of 5 stars
James Z.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2023","This is probably my favorite type of Echo, and it's great to have on the end of a counter or island in a kitchen or other place where you're moving around a lot. It doubles as a camera since you can drop in and pan the device to look around (unless you have smart motion disabled). It's also a reasonably sized screen if you're watching something casually, but the screen is too small to watch from any distance or if you're really invested in what you're watching.

The downsides are that it seems to struggle with any sort of background noise and won't always hear you correctly as a result. It also has some glitches, like sometimes it will be playing something and you can't make it stop unless you unplug it, and occasionally it stops responding audibly even though it is responding on screen silently and again, there's nothing you can do but unplug it. I still recommend it, but these are annoying issues.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The feature that allows it to follow you around works 40 percent of the time and most of the time, the screen is facing in an inconvenient direction. You really have to be in the Amazon ecosystem to get the full functionality of this device, such as amazon music and movies or ordering groceries and household supplies from amazon.

2) The fact that you can't move the camera in a dark room is DUMB. I repeat, you can't move the camera around in a dark room, or a room with blue light, or any darker color. It stops you and says ""motion deactivated because there is not enough light"", whether you're trying to move it in a dark room with your voice or through the app.

3) Calls to my friends' Echo show devices should be easier. But that's less a gripe about this echo device and more about all of them.

4) Using the Alexa app on the iPad and trying to move the camera from left to right is a pain. Because the mute button is below the video stream, it thinks I'm trying to scroll up and down constantly and I keep having to fight to see the entire stream and not just the mute/end stream buttons.

Other than these gripes, this is a pretty cool and innovative device. Nice sound, cool that you can move the device around - if you're going to do it for security while you're away from home, you'll definitely need smart lights that you can turn on and off remotely, too, given how something as simple as the dark renders the Echo Show 10 3rd Gen an overpriced Echo Show 2nd Gen.",4.0 out of 5 stars

It works just like the regular Alexa's but with Big display.
The music shows the words and you can sing along.
Sound is pretty good.

If your broke and bitch a lot don't buy this. Also don't buy this if you have slow internet service. I'm sure that is why some people are having problems.
But if your easy to please just buy it you wont be disappointed. Unless you get one that really is defective. This is my 8th Amazon Alexa device and I'm ready to trade in my other ones. I like they give you $25 trade in. Because my trades ins all work good still. Id rather know they are going to a new home than get stuffed in a closet.
I only gave it 4 Stars because I never give anything or anyone 5 Stars. I'm sure the bad reviews on this are from Pro Google Home Users. I have a Google home also. I tell you its great too. Just buy both and be happy!",4.0 out of 5 stars
BornForTech,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2022","So let's look at the model Echo Show 10 itself. Thought it was going to be something like putting a tablet on top of an Apple Home Pod (first gen). Well....it's not. Keep forgetting the Echo Show devices are not tablet user interface devices and the sound quality is not even close to the Home Pod, so just a tad disappointed with that. That said, I do really like the device. I don't have a problem with the Echo UI, in fact i kinda like it better than a tablet. The sound isn't bad, it just isn't what I was hoping for after looking at the design and certainly the price point. The screen and camera quality are really quite good, although when I watch the home screen transition from one picture to another the transition is not super smooth, like maybe the processor is a little under-powered. Not sure about that one tho. The motion feature is nice that it moves to ""look at"" whoever in the room is talking to it (nice feature), the problem is you can turn the motion off, close the camera and still it's gonna move to what ever section of the house has the brightest light. That is so annoying. I might want it to stay looking ""at me"" and not move around so I ask it to play something, turn any motion option OFF and it will eventually move anyway. Drives me up the wall. I think that could probably be addressed in a software OS fix, hopefully soon. Also, when you talk to it, it will move around a lot like it's trying to figure out where you are exaclty. All in all, it isn't a bad device for the living room, picture, sound, camera all nice, just needs the motion adjusted to ""don't move"" means ""don't move"" and they could probably upgrade the processor or maybe adjust the OS a little. If you need an Echo Show and you are only going to purchase one AND don't need it to function as a hub, I'd go with the Echo Show 8 (2021). Otherwise, wait for some changes to this model. Gave it 4 stars for all nice features, but minus one big star for the motion. Does play live video feeds like ABC News really well, that's a plus...and my favorite Sci-Fi (Expanse) looks amazing on it too. If they fix any issues I'll update this review. Hope it helps.
Review Update 9/3/2022: So I moved the Echo 10 into a different room where the lighting was more even and that stopped most of the moving around problems. Then one day it seemed to want to move again and when I was finished a screen popped up that asked if I wanted to change the direction limits. I said yes and it had a great feature I wasn't aware of that let me set the boundaries to the smallest movement possible. With those two changes I have updated my 4 stars to 5. Problems solved and now I don't have to constantly look at the back of the screen. Very happy, really like this product. Thinking about buying another one to replace an Echo 5. The 5 is amazing, but I've gotten to the point where I just want the biggest screen possible, thus the only reason to replace the 5. Good luck, hope this info helps!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Vlad,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021","I was enthusiastic when I ordered my Echo Show 3rd Gen. It was supposed to be a robot but not quite. Awesome speakers, great camera, rotating screen?! I got it out of the box, set it up and although I was a bit thrown off by the white cord sticking out of the black unit like a sore thumb, I really didn’t have major issues. The problem was that after using it for a bit longer bugs started to pop out.
Bugs observed:
- Screen rotates past you.
- Barely touching the screen for an action result in a path is blocked message.
- Can’t rotate at night because if an area is lit dimly will result in motion stopping and an error message
- Some error messages disappear pretty quickly
- During a video call the zooming, orienting of the lenses is not quite right
- Sometimes it won’t respond to the wake up word.
Hardware wise though, this one is better in every regard than its predecessor, which I considered a 5 star product, so the potential is there. So, while I think they would have benefited from a bit more of development time, I think the potential is there. Hopefully, they can do a firmware update to correct the issues. At this point I am not returning it, but if you haven’t bought it, I would wait for a few updates.
UPDATE JAN2022 (Raised one star):
Some of the most annoying bugs have been fixed but not all of them have. However, the improvements are significant enough that I would consider purchasing another one if on sale. If not,the current Gen Show 8 is really good too.
UPDATE JUL2022 (Raised another star)
This is what I expected when I ordered this device. Haven’t had a bug in a while. Screen rotation is significantly better, stopping at the correct spots and following better. Additionally, a friend that ordered a current gen black Echo Show 8, received a black power cord with it; it appears that Amazon is moving in the right direction with the power cords. Given that those were my main issues with the device, I raised it a star.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Matthew,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024","These features blew my mind. It is very big, has a MOTOR to ROTATE! And looks nice. It’s a bit lacking in responsiveness but the amazing features such as head tracking and face recognition made up. Would buy again!",5.0 out of 5 stars
C,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021","The new Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is a big improvement over the previous 2nd Gen version. The Show 10 is now attached to a swivel base that lets the Show 10 constantly rotate to face you as you move around the room. Other changes include: a new speaker configuration, MUCH better camera, better processor, and Amazon Sidewalk support. Here are my thoughts so far:

THE GOOD:

-SETUP – Setup was super easy. The Show came configured to my account, I didn't have to log in or even enter wifi passwords. It connected, downloaded some updates, and then walked me through customizing the range of motion.
-MOTION- This is the most obvious new improvement. The Show 10 will now track your movement and turn to face you as you move around the room. The Show seems to have very good facial tracking, and it will rotate on its horizontal axis to follow you (you can also manually tilt the screen up and down to your desired vertical position.) We tested this while playing movies and while viewing our remote cameras, and it worked perfectly. We also tested with multiple people in the room; and the Show seems to lock onto one face and moves to follow that face, until it can't see that face anymore and will move to another face. Or if someone uses the Wake Word “Alexa,” it will turn toward where that voice was coming from. This also works for video calls, though we noticed that on video calls the Show will rotate to try to keep ALL of our faces in view. Sometimes this might mean it faces in between two people so that the camera can see both of us, and then automatically zooms the camera in or out to adjust. Which brings me to the next big improvement:
-13MP CAMERA – We were very impressed with the quality of the new camera, and with the tracking technology it uses. Not only are images crisp and detailed on video calls, but the camera will actually automatically zoom in and out to adjust to the people in the shot. For example I can back up from my kitchen into the living room, and the camera will zoom in and follow me. When you combine this with the movement and facial tracking, it is almost like having your own camera man follow you around the room on your call. The family members we called said they could see so much more detail. There is also now a physical shutter that you can close to cover the camera if you want to.
-SPEAKERS – The old 2nd Gen Show 10 had dual 2” neodymium drivers, but this new 3rd Gen Show 10 has two 1” tweeters and a 3” woofer. I can definitely tell the difference, although I really don't use the Show for listening to music very often. In testing out a few songs, I noticed that the new 3rd Gen seems louder at max volume, and less muffled. Definitely an improvement, though maybe not quite on the level of the Echo Studio.
-PROCESSOR – The new Show 10 has both an upgraded main processor, and also a second Amazon AZ1 processor. This should result in slightly faster repose times, and better future performance; although I really haven't been able to tell much of a difference so far. AZ1 is supposed to be faster and more efficient, and allow voice commands to be processed locally instead of having to go to the cloud; so we'll see if this is noticeable in the future.
-ZIGBEE/SIDEWALK – The previous version included a Zigbee hub, but this version also includes Amazon Sidewalk compatibility. Sidewalk is a long range connection technology that Amazon plans to use for devices that will be able to reach much further; (the initial announcement estimated up to half a mile). This technology isn't really being used yet, but it is nice to know this future tech is built in.

THE BAD:

-WHITE POWER CORD – Yes, for some reason that same white power cord that ships with the Echo 4th Gen is also included for this Show 10. No matter what color Show you get (I got black), you still get a white power cord. I'm a little surprised that they went with this decision again, but it really doesn't bother me much at all. Just thought I'd mention it in case that matters to you.
-LARGE FOOTPRINT – Since the device rotates, you really have to be careful about where you put it. The Show 10 comes with a footprint guide, that suggests that you make sure you have enough space around the device to avoid the screen knocking over a glass of water, for example. This also wasn't a big deal for me, but keep in mind you will probably need more space than the previous version. The specs recommend a 10” by 15” space, but I think you could get away with less.

*Note – You can disable the movement by saying “Alexa disable Motion,” or by turning it off in the Alexa app on your phone. Also, when you first setup your Show, there is a slider bar that let's you choose how far the screen should rotate in each direction. It seems to go almost 360 degrees maximum, but you can limit the radius so it turns much less. You can also change this in the 'Motion' menu under Settings.

Overall, I am VERY pleased with this new Show 10. The camera clarity is great, and the face tracking technology is so impressive; there's just nothing else like it for video calls to our family. This is a huge upgrade!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Vincent,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","I have owned the last two Generation Echo Shows. The Echo Show 1 & Echo Show Gen 2. The Echo Show 10 solves all the issues that the first two devices had, and adds even more features jam packed into one great device.

Now before I get into the meat and potatoes — let me tell you about the truly magical experience I have had with this device. It arrived in a box almost double the size of the previous model — and this device is BIG! The screen is huge! The speaker is also apparently much more powerful than the last generation — and I can tell, that is most definitely the case.

But the true magic comes when you power on and set up the Echo. The Amazon team really did wonders creating this device. Both the camera and the AI in this thing are crazy good. Assuming you have motion enabled, as soon as you say the wake word, i.e., “Alexa” the device honed in on my direction, rotated towards me, and began listening.

If you walk around the room, this device follows you. You can’t understand how cool this is until you try it out. I would upload a video, but I’m sure you can look it up on YouTube, and there will likely be hundreds of reviews showcasing it here.

There’s something about the tracking technology that Amazon has gotten just right. I called up my Grandma who has my old first gen echo show, and she didn’t even realize we were conversing as I was walking around my room. She thought I was just stationary the whole time. When I pointed it out and showed to her, her jaw dropped.

The way the camera zooms in on you, and the range of video it can show is phenomenal. I can jump onto my bed (my echo is on my nightstand) and the echo will zoom in and focus on me. When I go off the side of my bed, it follows zooming out, and can follow my body all the way as I walk back across the room towards the device.

It all feels so natural. The only thing that is missing would be if the Echo device itself moved! You can now have a conversation with someone when moving around your environment, without having to remain stationary.

In a kitchen, a home gym, or anywhere you’d want to talk with someone actively, this device would be really extraordinary to play with, especially during covid times.

I use my device in my room as an Alarm clock — so previously, my camera would be staring across the room as to not let me look at the screen if needed (for time/alarms, etc). Now, with the camera cover, I feel much more comfortable covering the camera and rotating the device to look towards me at night.

Now, take these into consideration as you decide if you want to purchase:

First, if you want to get the latest and greatest Echo device, the purchase is a no brainer. I am an Amazon loyalist, and can say that even from first impressions, this device blows all other Amazon devices I’ve owned away.

Second, if you’re a user who doesn’t mind the camera being uncovered, then you’ll have no problem with this device. You’ll love it. The motion features will be left on 16/7 for me. I wouldn’t be comfortable allowing having the camera on while I’m sleeping (and staring at me), but for a public area in your home — who cares? I wouldn’t mind, I’d leave it on all day — it following you around is magical.

Third, if you fall into the second issue above, you CAN use the camera cover to disable motion. If you don’t mind sliding the cover open and closed every morning/night, this could work for a nightstand alarm clock, and the hassle/inconvenience would be worth it.

Pros:
- Motion is magical
- Camera is high definition
- Sound is great. Music sounds lively. Lyrics on screen that follow you around the room
- Adaptive screen dimming still works even when camera/motion is blocked/disabled
- You can manually rotate the device when motion is off i.e. I’m going to bed, to point it towards me. I don’t know if that’s safe for the motor — I’ll ask Amazon!

Cons:
- If your room doesn’t have a full range of motion, the Echo might get confused when following you around. Since it is on my nightstand, the echo really only needs to turn about 90° to see in front if itself, and when I go to the left of my room. If I go to exit my room, it might start losing tracking, which could probably fixed in a future OS update (to halt moving at a specific point, which it already does).

Bottom Line: I 100% recommend this as an upgrade to an old device or a new device for any potential Echo owners. If you don’t feel comfortable with the motion controls, turn them off, but you won’t get the full package and what I think is the biggest selling point of this device. Put this in a public room and try it out — you won’t regret it.

EDIT: After seeing more reviews a few points to mention:

1. White power cord. Who cares? You dock a star for this? Don’t listen to normies giving poor reviews who think the color of a power cord which is draped out of sight will have any effect on how the device improves over it’s predecessor
2. Complaints over resolution: if you’re not buying this thing to watch full-fledged movies on, it’s fine. You won’t notice.
3. Complaints over tracking: it won’t track you with the camera in the dark. A future models can probably have an infrared light added (similar to FaceID) to fix that problem.
4. I saw someone complaining about Airplay and multiroom audio. Echo devices support multiroom audio through Amazon’s Ecosystem — not bluetooth. It has never supported that. Why would you expect this to change without notice?

Don’t listen to the haters. People reviewing are acting as if this device isn’t 5x better than the last generation of the Show. Motion is a stellar addition that would bring moving smart devices into the mainstream. No one here knows what a
the Facebook Portal is, because there was never a solid backing behind the product line. Echos are in homes across America, and I’m sure that this will lead to better smart devices from Amazon in the future.

For reference, I have owned an: Echo Show 1, Echo Show 2, Echo Dot, and have coded ~5 Alexa Skills. I know these devices. This gen is great. Give it 1 month and these will be 5/5. These reviews all read so fake. Who purchases a device and returns it same-day due to a different colored power cord? Who returns a device that doesn’t do something they expected when it was never said the device did it?

Low-information consumers and people with too high expectations... there’s a reason why it’s called PRE-ORDERING, because you KNOW you are going to like it and/or take what you get. No one forced you to buy a day 1 device.

TL;DR: Don’t listen to bad reviews. Buy this if you’re in the market.",5.0 out of 5 stars

kenya Garcia,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2024","I recently started using the Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen). Here’s a review focusing on its convenience:
Convenience:

The Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is an incredibly convenient addition to my home. The standout feature is its ability to move and follow me around the room. The smart display’s motorized base means it rotates to keep me in view during video calls or while watching recipes and tutorials. This hands-free feature is fantastic for multitasking—whether I’m cooking, working out, or just moving around the room, the Echo Show 10 stays with me, ensuring I never miss a beat.

1. Smart Movement:

The Echo Show 10’s ability to automatically pivot and track me during video calls or while I’m interacting with it is a game-changer. No more awkward adjustments or missed moments—this device ensures I stay in the frame and can see the screen clearly, regardless of where I move.

2. Crystal-Clear Display:

The HD display is vibrant and sharp, making it perfect for watching videos, browsing photos, or following along with recipes. The 10.1-inch screen size is just right—not too big and not too small—offering an excellent viewing experience without dominating my countertop or desk space.

3. Premium Sound Quality:

The sound quality is top-notch, with rich, clear audio that fills the room. Whether I'm listening to music, catching up on the news, or watching a movie, the Echo Show 10 delivers an immersive audio experience. The built-in speakers are powerful and provide crisp sound, enhancing the overall convenience of the device.

4. Voice-Controlled Smart Home Hub:

Integrated with Alexa, the Echo Show 10 acts as a central hub for my smart home devices. I can control lights, thermostats, and other smart gadgets with simple voice commands. The convenience of managing my smart home from a single device, especially with voice commands, simplifies my daily routines.

5. Video Calling Made Easy:

The Echo Show 10 simplifies video calls with its high-definition camera and auto-framing feature. It’s easy to connect with family and friends, and the camera ensures that everyone in the room is visible and in focus. Plus, the privacy shutter provides peace of mind when not in use.

6. Interactive Features:

The touch screen interface is intuitive and responsive, making it easy to interact with apps, view photos, or check the weather. The device integrates seamlessly with various services, including Amazon services and third-party apps, enhancing its versatility.

7. Home Automation Integration:

The Echo Show 10 works well with other smart home devices, allowing me to automate tasks and create routines. Setting up routines for daily tasks like turning on the lights or adjusting the thermostat is straightforward, making home management more efficient.

Cons:

While the Echo Show 10 excels in convenience, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider:

1. Size and Placement:

The device is relatively large and requires a bit of space. Its size might be a consideration if you have a smaller kitchen or desk area.

2. Price Point:

It is on the higher end of the price spectrum for smart displays. While the features justify the cost, it may not be the most budget-friendly option for everyone.

3. Motion Tracking Sensitivity:

While the motion tracking is a fantastic feature, it can sometimes be overly sensitive. In certain lighting conditions or with rapid movements, the device may have difficulty keeping up.

Final Thoughts:

The Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is a highly convenient and feature-rich smart display. Its ability to move and track users, combined with excellent sound quality and a sharp HD display, makes it a valuable addition to any smart home. Despite a few minor considerations regarding size and price, the Echo Show 10’s functionality and ease of use make it a worthwhile investment for those looking to enhance their smart home experience.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Jace,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2024","This is by far our family’s favorite Amazon product. We started with an echo dot (2nd gen) in 2017, then fire tv sticks, plug ins, fire tablets, echo auto and echo shows. We pretty much have an alexa/echo device in each rooms.
It was very easy to install especially if you already have an amazon account. Also, check out their trade-in program. Take advantage of upgrading your echo devices and experience how amazon develops their products and try their best to give customers great and reliable products.
Now, this Echo Show 10 does a lot of work in our home. I won’t discuss about any technical things about it since I do not speak that language. However I will review this from a Mom’s standpoint.
As a parent of curious kids, you’ll get hundreds of questions a day. Sometimes you’d know the answers and there are times you don’t. The device helps me with that. Sure the other echo dots can do it but having a screen that follows you is more fun and more informative for kids. It makes my kids interested in current events as it shows news articles and photos. It would give some facts and interesting topics for us to discuss further. Of course, my kids will do their own research and it keeps them more interested. From music, history, conversation, spelling, you name it, it would have the answers.
Next is the camera feature, any approved contacts can drop in on this device. It’s amazing since they could pretty much video call other relatives that have alexa app or devices. It makes us feel more connected with our loved ones that can’t operate phones to video call.
So aside from connecting us with humans, it connects us to other non humans; my vacuum cleaner, air purifier, lights, window blinds and so much more. It helps me multi task. As a mom, life gets busy and I forget a lot of things! I rely on this device to remind me about my schedule, chores, shopping lists, recipes, etc. I do have other ways to remind myself about things but it helps that there’s a device that will show me and tell me to do it. It makes me remember more when I see my list and this thing does it for me without all the paper clutter.
Then there’s more features to explore!
It helps me so I wish other moms would have something like this to will help them everyday.",5.0 out of 5 stars

RBrylawski,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2024","We've had one of the early Echo Shows for a few years now and while it was fine, it was starting to show its age, so it got moved to a bedroom and after looking at all the new models I chose the newest Echo Show 10 (3rd generation). It's quite an upgrade in every way.

The screen is bigger and high definition at 10.1"" and it follows you around as you move around, which for a kitchen application is great. I can be using the Echo Show while I'm cooking and moving from counter to counter and the screen stays with me.

One of the biggest advantages of this new Echo Show is the speaker. It's really a big speaker and the moving screen is mounted to the speaker. But the output of the speaker is quite remarkable and music actually sounds terrific on it. The speakers deliver realistic sound which is directional.

Like most of the Echo Shows, once you've set up one through the Alexa app on your iPhone, setup is a breeze. In fact, when you order this 3rd gen Echo Show, you answer some questions about your network at home and out of the box it basically sets itself up. Though, I must admit the first one we received wouldn't connect and Amazon immediately sent a replacement device, which did work.

You can use this for video calls and it even has a 13PM digital camera which you can use to take a selfie. You can integrate as many photos as you want to the display from your cell phone or Amazon Photos collection if you use Amazon Photos to store your pictures (we do, actually). You can open the app and see what's happening in your kitchen or speak to someone in the kitchen from anywhere. If you have a Ring Doorbell, you can just say Alexa, show me my Ring Doorbell. Or ask Alexa to pull up a recipe quickly if you need one. It's all just so easy to use.

The options to integrate things like your car, security system, smart devices, are pretty much endless and super easy to set up as well.

All in all, I couldn't be happier with my decision to move up to the Echo Show 10!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Contacted Amazon who only stated that they will send a new system and they will provide a return label. What they don’t tell you is that you must send the system back and a replacement is not on the way. You must wait until they receive your item and they will see if they can repair or replace it with a possibility it will be a refurbished item. There’s more to this issue that will be too long to explain. Just know you can get numerous representatives telling you different things. Totally disappointed in this awful process.

It was sort of spooky that the screen would always face her if she got up and walked around, but she has finally found that useful.

The sound is great! We had the original Echo in her office area, the one like a Pringles can. It had such a great sound, but it started not recognizing us trying to get it to do commands.

I put one of the hockey puck style Echo's on her desk, and the sound was just ok.

My wife listens to music all day on her Echo, so when I put this in place of the puck one, she was really happy with the sound. You get the full range of music on the Show.

Also, she loves it's like a tablet too that she can ask Alexa to look up things for her.

It's really easy to setup. Also, for multiple users. It knows my wife's voice, and knows when I'm speaking and acknowledges who is talking which is wild.

AFMerc,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2024","I recently purchased the Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) in Glacier White, and it has truly transformed my home into a hub of seamless connectivity and entertainment. The 10.1"" HD screen is a game-changer, designed to follow me around, ensuring that video calls, recipes, and shows are always right where I need them. The premium directional sound from the speakers elevates the entire experience, making every interaction immersive and enjoyable.

One standout feature is the 13 MP camera with auto-framing and motion tracking. Whether I'm video calling friends or capturing a quick snapshot, the camera keeps me front and center, ensuring I never miss a moment. The smart home integration is a breeze – I've set up Zigbee and Matter devices effortlessly, and now I can ask Alexa to control lights, show security camera feeds, and adjust thermostats without the need for a separate hub.

The Echo Show 10 has become my ultimate kitchen companion, offering personalized recipes, hands-free cooking with step-by-step instructions, and convenient timers. The ability to turn the home screen into a digital frame using Amazon Photos adds a personal touch to my living space. I appreciate the emphasis on privacy, with features like a mic/camera off button and a built-in camera shutter, giving me full control over when and how my device interacts with me. Overall, the Echo Show 10 has exceeded my expectations, seamlessly blending smart functionality with entertainment and privacy in one elegant device.

The video quality is perfect, and we can hear each other without any problems. We watch YouTube videos and play Sirius XM stations all by voice command. We tell it when to start music and when to stop, including playing music for one hour after we leave the house for the pets. The speaker quality is very good and enjoyable. We set timers and reminders and alarms. Alexa suggests videos to watch and tells us jokes. The screen rotates automatically to remain facing my direction as I move about the kitchen, including during video chats where both callers are moving around the kitchen. We ask Alexa questions and she gives us answers from the Internet. I can tell Alexa to call someone in my phone list, she will dial the call, and I have the entire (non-video) phone conversation via the Alexa device and speaker (not my phone.) Alexa is connected to Amazon, so the device keeps me up to date on the status of my orders as soon as they ship, counting down the days to arrival, and letting me know a package has arrived on my doorstep. It gives me weather alerts for my town, and also my son's town. It saves recipes for me. And we probably don't use half of what it can do. It's great.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Troy,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2021","The new Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is a big improvement over the previous 2nd Gen version. The Show 10 is now attached to a swivel base that lets the Show 10 constantly rotate to face you as you move around the room. Other changes include: a new speaker configuration, MUCH better camera, better processor, and Amazon Sidewalk support. Here are my thoughts so far:

THE GOOD:

-SETUP – Setup was super easy. The Show came configured to my account, I didn't have to log in or even enter wifi passwords. It connected, downloaded some updates, and then walked me through customizing the range of motion.
-MOTION- This is the most obvious new improvement. The Show 10 will now track your movement and turn to face you as you move around the room. The Show seems to have very good facial tracking, and it will rotate on its horizontal axis to follow you (you can also manually tilt the screen up and down to your desired vertical position.) We tested this while playing movies and while viewing our remote cameras, and it worked perfectly. We also tested with multiple people in the room; and the Show seems to lock onto one face and moves to follow that face, until it can't see that face anymore and will move to another face. Or if someone uses the Wake Word “Alexa,” it will turn toward where that voice was coming from. This also works for video calls, though we noticed that on video calls the Show will rotate to try to keep ALL of our faces in view. Sometimes this might mean it faces in between two people so that the camera can see both of us, and then automatically zooms the camera in or out to adjust. Which brings me to the next big improvement:
-13MP CAMERA – We were very impressed with the quality of the new camera, and with the tracking technology it uses. Not only are images crisp and detailed on video calls, but the camera will actually automatically zoom in and out to adjust to the people in the shot. For example I can back up from my kitchen into the living room, and the camera will zoom in and follow me. When you combine this with the movement and facial tracking, it is almost like having your own camera man follow you around the room on your call. The family members we called said they could see so much more detail. There is also now a physical shutter that you can close to cover the camera if you want to.

Nonsha,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2021","First of all I love this thing. For what it does, it's pretty amazing. Is it worth $250.00... probably not in my opinion. Integration and usage is really good for house devices is really cool. I love that I can view security CAMs via the screen. I have no issues with the ease of use.

A few issue though... There are a lot of things you ask Alexa and she has no clue or just will not respond. Also... And I know parents allow there kids around this thing, but it should have an Adult Mode that can be toggled on and off. If I ask an adult type question or ask for a joke (as an adult), it should give me an adult type answer, not I don't know that or no answer at all, or some stupid kid joke. That is not the unit's issue I know. It's the software; it's how Amazon designed it to make it family friendly. I get it, but there are some of us who DO NOT have kids, and would like something a little more adult orientated or at least less family orientated. Little issue not a deal breaker. As for skills... Most are worthless. (Tried lots of them, MOST are not good.) They either do not work, want you to pay, or are just flat out stupid. But again that is not 'cause of this unit, it's software in general for all Echos. One other little annoyance. I should be able to turn off any content or suggestions of content that I wish (in the settings) so it does not keep asking me if I want to watch whatever or listen to whatever. I do not need prompts for watching news or TV shows and movies. (That is why I have a TV.) I'll make up my own mind what content I wish to view. And you should be able to turn off or on the lyrics while a song is playing. I do not need to see all the words of a song on Amazon Music. Play the music, do not show the words. If I want to see them then give the option to turn on that feature.

OK other than the above, would I recommend this unit. Yes, because of the screen interface. Makes it better I think. Could you just as easily have an earlier version of the show (cheaper version) without this one. Yes. Is it a nice toy? Yes. Would I buy it again. Yes if the price was cheaper. Maybe if it was about $100.00 less.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I.M. Anamazoner,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2023","If, before the invention of the Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen), I had been tasked with creating the perfect smart display for my split downstairs situation, frankly, I wouldn't have had enough imagination to dream up the design of this device.

Situated between my kitchen-dining area on the one side and my living room on the other, lies a media niche, atop which now rotates my new Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen). It replaces an Echo Show 8 (1st gen) smart display -- another fine device. The Show 10 improves on the Show 8 for me by, of course, rotating toward me when I'm on either side of the media niche, and by allowing me to set the display perpendicular to the ground, not angled like the Show 8, which is better suited for that reason on a lower surface (like a table or counter).

Before buying my Show 10, I read some negative reviews about ad-sponsored pictures that occasionally rotate onto what the Show 10 displays. As a complaint, give me a break. First these unobtrusive pictures appear very infrequently in my experience. Plus they also show up on my other Echo shows (both 8's). And finally, if they help Amazon pay for the conveniences that my Echo devices provide, I have no problem with that!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Set up was really easy and setting up my automation was relatively simple and quick. I am sure that I am not using this product to its fullest capabilities, but I am constantly learning what it can do so I will probably love it more as I learn more.

I do have an echo show 5 from a few years ago, and I don't get too much use out of it, due to the fact that it is too small too see but this echo 10, is a real fun thing to play with. Firstly, I really like the speakers. Played music out of it and I was really impressed. Now, I don't geek out with speakers so I can't compare it with high end speakers but, I will say to me, it sounds very nice. I really like the feature that if you call it ""alexa"", then it'll turn and face you wherever you are ain't the room. It is not a 360 turn though (not sure why) but very close to it. Anyway, very nice and big enough screen. Obviously very responsive. Can be used as a drop in security feature, such as when you're out of the house and want to check in on the dogs, you can.

Cons:

Blake,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2024","We have owned our Echo 11 for six months or longer and really enjoy it. Could use a lock screen feature with a passcode for kids at night time. Heck, you have AI, use the camera for face recognition like Apple. The UI could be much easier to operate. Music and shows sound and look great and the Apple Music link is nice. Please just add the lock screen feature.",4.0 out of 5 stars

David A Gilland,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024",We have owned the previous GEN of this device. Thinking this GEN would be better we purchased two. After a year and a half the WIFI connectivity failed and after getting the run around from Technical Support the only option is to trade it in for a new one at a 20% discount. It was a decent unit up until the WIFI unit failed and Amazon was of no use in resolving the problem.,1.0 out of 5 stars
J Schaeffer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024","Overall, I loved this Echo. I have a variety of Echo devices throughout my home, and this was my favorite one, until a little after 2 years old it quit working. I have tried everything recommended in the forums and have asked for the assistance of Amazon (the rep was extremely rude, and absolutely no help.) It will not stay connected to my wifi. I have moved it around (it was already the closest device to the router), shut down most everything in the house, turned it on and off, reset my router, and a host of other things. It will connect, but within 5 minutes, it drops the connection. For the price, it should still be working. I looked at ordering another Echo, but this one has no trade-in value. If this is such a great device, why is it not even listed for trade-in. My guess, they are having a lot of trouble with them and don't want them back. I have had Amazon Kindles and Echos since the Kindle was first released, but I may be done with Amazon's devices.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Lance Q. Homer,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024","I bought this for my elderly mother so that she could see family photos, have a calendar of events easily available and so that we could drop-in on her in case she was stuck in her bed. When paying $250, I didn't expect it to be pushing ads all the time. Moreover, some basic UI features just aren't there. I would love for it to go the photos as screen saver and have the option to also display the time over the photo. Nope! Anyway to make it so she see just the widgets I want her to see? Nope. There isn't really another option for drop-in like the Alexa Show so that one feature is keeping me from returning it.",3.0 out of 5 stars

However, some of the content itself is quite uninteresting (such as the polls), and the **advertisements** are a major annoyance for me. Lately, the ads have been showing more frequently, turning my Echo Show into a billboard in my kitchen. Despite repeatedly asking to not show certain ads, they persist. What's even more frustrating is that when I approach the screen to interact with the content (to press the unlike button), the ad immediately disappears, jumping to another screen without giving me the chance to dislike it.

I've tried unchecking options in the setup to reduce ads, but nothing seems to work. This issue with the advertisements is the main factor behind my disappointment and lower rating. If you don't mind having a billboard in your home, go for it.",2.0 out of 5 stars

kenya Garcia,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2024","I recently started using the Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen). Here’s a review focusing on its convenience:
Convenience:

The Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is an incredibly convenient addition to my home. The standout feature is its ability to move and follow me around the room. The smart display’s motorized base means it rotates to keep me in view during video calls or while watching recipes and tutorials. This hands-free feature is fantastic for multitasking—whether I’m cooking, working out, or just moving around the room, the Echo Show 10 stays with me, ensuring I never miss a beat.

1. Smart Movement:

The Echo Show 10’s ability to automatically pivot and track me during video calls or while I’m interacting with it is a game-changer. No more awkward adjustments or missed moments—this device ensures I stay in the frame and can see the screen clearly, regardless of where I move.

2. Crystal-Clear Display:

The HD display is vibrant and sharp, making it perfect for watching videos, browsing photos, or following along with recipes. The 10.1-inch screen size is just right—not too big and not too small—offering an excellent viewing experience without dominating my countertop or desk space.

3. Premium Sound Quality:

The sound quality is top-notch, with rich, clear audio that fills the room. Whether I'm listening to music, catching up on the news, or watching a movie, the Echo Show 10 delivers an immersive audio experience. The built-in speakers are powerful and provide crisp sound, enhancing the overall convenience of the device.

4. Voice-Controlled Smart Home Hub:

Integrated with Alexa, the Echo Show 10 acts as a central hub for my smart home devices. I can control lights, thermostats, and other smart gadgets with simple voice commands. The convenience of managing my smart home from a single device, especially with voice commands, simplifies my daily routines.

5. Video Calling Made Easy:

The Echo Show 10 simplifies video calls with its high-definition camera and auto-framing feature. It’s easy to connect with family and friends, and the camera ensures that everyone in the room is visible and in focus. Plus, the privacy shutter provides peace of mind when not in use.

6. Interactive Features:

The touch screen interface is intuitive and responsive, making it easy to interact with apps, view photos, or check the weather. The device integrates seamlessly with various services, including Amazon services and third-party apps, enhancing its versatility.

7. Home Automation Integration:

The Echo Show 10 works well with other smart home devices, allowing me to automate tasks and create routines. Setting up routines for daily tasks like turning on the lights or adjusting the thermostat is straightforward, making home management more efficient.

Cons:

While the Echo Show 10 excels in convenience, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider:

1. Size and Placement:

The device is relatively large and requires a bit of space. Its size might be a consideration if you have a smaller kitchen or desk area.

2. Price Point:

It is on the higher end of the price spectrum for smart displays. While the features justify the cost, it may not be the most budget-friendly option for everyone.

3. Motion Tracking Sensitivity:

While the motion tracking is a fantastic feature, it can sometimes be overly sensitive. In certain lighting conditions or with rapid movements, the device may have difficulty keeping up.

Final Thoughts:

The Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is a highly convenient and feature-rich smart display. Its ability to move and track users, combined with excellent sound quality and a sharp HD display, makes it a valuable addition to any smart home. Despite a few minor considerations regarding size and price, the Echo Show 10’s functionality and ease of use make it a worthwhile investment for those looking to enhance their smart home experience.",5.0 out of 5 stars

a_yu,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024","The wifi stopped working on the device 3 years after purchase. Amazon said the device was outside of the 1 year warranty and offered a 15% discount on purchase of a new one.

Because the price had increased to $250, the device was actually more expensive to purchase the 2nd time even with the discount. I would not pay more for a 2nd device that originally broke on its own.

Even if I considered buying this again, I have no confidence that the device will not break again.

With my experience on this device, I'm not buying anymore Echo devices (I think a simple kitchen timer is sufficient and will last longer).

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2024","Firstly, the Echo is an ad machine mostly for Amazon products. You cannot turn off ads. If you like a large clock display don't expect it to stay large on your screen all the time because during the all day everyday ads showing the clock display is reduced significantly. Watching movies is another thing you won't do much of unless it's from Prime. Music is a no go unless you pay for a service. Amazon is a pay for everything. I mean, remember 1 day shipping? Yea, you pay more now and there's no guarantee if it will arrive in one day or 10. Video calls are a nuisance due to freezing video/audio issues. The biggest thing is Amazon doesn't listen to customer complaints about the Echo Show products. The lack of improvement or features since 2020 is proof of that.",1.0 out of 5 stars

BornForTech,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2022","So let's look at the model Echo Show 10 itself. Thought it was going to be something like putting a tablet on top of an Apple Home Pod (first gen). Well....it's not. Keep forgetting the Echo Show devices are not tablet user interface devices and the sound quality is not even close to the Home Pod, so just a tad disappointed with that. That said, I do really like the device. I don't have a problem with the Echo UI, in fact i kinda like it better than a tablet. The sound isn't bad, it just isn't what I was hoping for after looking at the design and certainly the price point. The screen and camera quality are really quite good, although when I watch the home screen transition from one picture to another the transition is not super smooth, like maybe the processor is a little under-powered. Not sure about that one tho. The motion feature is nice that it moves to ""look at"" whoever in the room is talking to it (nice feature), the problem is you can turn the motion off, close the camera and still it's gonna move to what ever section of the house has the brightest light. That is so annoying. I might want it to stay looking ""at me"" and not move around so I ask it to play something, turn any motion option OFF and it will eventually move anyway. Drives me up the wall. I think that could probably be addressed in a software OS fix, hopefully soon. Also, when you talk to it, it will move around a lot like it's trying to figure out where you are exaclty. All in all, it isn't a bad device for the living room, picture, sound, camera all nice, just needs the motion adjusted to ""don't move"" means ""don't move"" and they could probably upgrade the processor or maybe adjust the OS a little. If you need an Echo Show and you are only going to purchase one AND don't need it to function as a hub, I'd go with the Echo Show 8 (2021). Otherwise, wait for some changes to this model. Gave it 4 stars for all nice features, but minus one big star for the motion. Does play live video feeds like ABC News really well, that's a plus...and my favorite Sci-Fi (Expanse) looks amazing on it too. If they fix any issues I'll update this review. Hope it helps.
Review Update 9/3/2022: So I moved the Echo 10 into a different room where the lighting was more even and that stopped most of the moving around problems. Then one day it seemed to want to move again and when I was finished a screen popped up that asked if I wanted to change the direction limits. I said yes and it had a great feature I wasn't aware of that let me set the boundaries to the smallest movement possible. With those two changes I have updated my 4 stars to 5. Problems solved and now I don't have to constantly look at the back of the screen. Very happy, really like this product. Thinking about buying another one to replace an Echo 5. The 5 is amazing, but I've gotten to the point where I just want the biggest screen possible, thus the only reason to replace the 5. Good luck, hope this info helps!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Vlad,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021","I was enthusiastic when I ordered my Echo Show 3rd Gen. It was supposed to be a robot but not quite. Awesome speakers, great camera, rotating screen?! I got it out of the box, set it up and although I was a bit thrown off by the white cord sticking out of the black unit like a sore thumb, I really didn’t have major issues. The problem was that after using it for a bit longer bugs started to pop out.
Bugs observed:
- Screen rotates past you.
- Barely touching the screen for an action result in a path is blocked message.
- Can’t rotate at night because if an area is lit dimly will result in motion stopping and an error message
- Some error messages disappear pretty quickly
- During a video call the zooming, orienting of the lenses is not quite right
- Sometimes it won’t respond to the wake up word.
Hardware wise though, this one is better in every regard than its predecessor, which I considered a 5 star product, so the potential is there. So, while I think they would have benefited from a bit more of development time, I think the potential is there. Hopefully, they can do a firmware update to correct the issues. At this point I am not returning it, but if you haven’t bought it, I would wait for a few updates.
UPDATE JAN2022 (Raised one star):
Some of the most annoying bugs have been fixed but not all of them have. However, the improvements are significant enough that I would consider purchasing another one if on sale. If not,the current Gen Show 8 is really good too.
UPDATE JUL2022 (Raised another star)
This is what I expected when I ordered this device. Haven’t had a bug in a while. Screen rotation is significantly better, stopping at the correct spots and following better. Additionally, a friend that ordered a current gen black Echo Show 8, received a black power cord with it; it appears that Amazon is moving in the right direction with the power cords. Given that those were my main issues with the device, I raised it a star.",5.0 out of 5 stars

tobor,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2023","I've got 9 Echo devices in my home. I've been using Echos (and upgrading to the latest models) since they were first made available. This Echo Show 10 replaced an Echo Show 8 (1st Generation) in my kitchen. I use it multiple times each day to play Spotify, listen to radio (via TuneIn), set timers, etc. The sound quality is very good and I place it only slightly behind my Echo Studio + Echo Sub pair as it pertains to sound quality.

The screen is, likewise, excellent. I have my Show 10 set to rotate a series of fine art prints I've uploaded to Amazon Photos and the colors really pop and look gorgeous on the screen. I find this feature really enhances the ambiance in my kitchen and every time I glance at the screen and see a piece of art I'm glad I purchased the device. I like the screen being larger than the Show 8, although I don't think I'd recommend an expensive ""upgrade"" merely for the screen size.

I have read that many people dislike the number of ads or stories that the Show 10 displays. You can go into settings and select the content you want to see. I've reduced it to only weather and news--everything else is turned off. I almost never see ads and feel that this type of criticism is unwarranted. My Show 10 (like my Show 8) displays content I've allowed and almost nothing more.

The Echo Show 10 loses a star for voice responsiveness. I have it placed in a corner that is pretty wide and open--it's not obstructed in any way. Unfortunately, about 30% of the time the device doesn't ""hear"" a command when I'm standing 4 feet away. Instead, my Echo Studio--which is in an entirely different room--responds. Sometimes it is even worse with an Echo in my bedroom (which is multiple rooms away) responding to my attempt to set a timer whilst in the kitchen. I find it very odd and frustrating. My first generation Echo (the original) did a far better job in this area than the Echo Show 10. And as far as I can tell there is no way to set the mic sensitivity via the Alexa app. That said, the positives still outweigh this negative, but I'm dropping 1 star from my rating.

I'd also add that the ""follow"" feature in which the device's screen moves to face you is not very compelling for me. I can envision other people finding it useful, but for me it seems more like a gimmick. The device is generally reliable following me, but whenever it reaches the edge of the boundary I set it flashes a giant warning message that I'm out of range. That large pop-up is really annoying and there is no way to turn it off. If it didn't flash that warning literally EVERY time I work in the kitchen I might be able to overlook it--as it is, it's just a reminder that Amazon has failed to improve the device. There should be a way to turn off that notification.

The Echo Show 10 is a decent device, but I'm not so sure of the value proposition. Adding a motor to turn the screen increases complexity and cost yet the benefits of this design are not compelling. And because this is the only device in the Echo lineup to employ this feature, Amazon hasn't really prioritized improving Echo Show 10 functionality. I don't know what is going on with the mic sensitivity, but it's not as good as it should be. The sound quality, however, is solid, and the screen is decent and a great size.",4.0 out of 5 stars
C,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021","The new Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is a big improvement over the previous 2nd Gen version. The Show 10 is now attached to a swivel base that lets the Show 10 constantly rotate to face you as you move around the room. Other changes include: a new speaker configuration, MUCH better camera, better processor, and Amazon Sidewalk support. Here are my thoughts so far:

THE GOOD:

-SETUP – Setup was super easy. The Show came configured to my account, I didn't have to log in or even enter wifi passwords. It connected, downloaded some updates, and then walked me through customizing the range of motion.
-MOTION- This is the most obvious new improvement. The Show 10 will now track your movement and turn to face you as you move around the room. The Show seems to have very good facial tracking, and it will rotate on its horizontal axis to follow you (you can also manually tilt the screen up and down to your desired vertical position.) We tested this while playing movies and while viewing our remote cameras, and it worked perfectly. We also tested with multiple people in the room; and the Show seems to lock onto one face and moves to follow that face, until it can't see that face anymore and will move to another face. Or if someone uses the Wake Word “Alexa,” it will turn toward where that voice was coming from. This also works for video calls, though we noticed that on video calls the Show will rotate to try to keep ALL of our faces in view. Sometimes this might mean it faces in between two people so that the camera can see both of us, and then automatically zooms the camera in or out to adjust. Which brings me to the next big improvement:
-13MP CAMERA – We were very impressed with the quality of the new camera, and with the tracking technology it uses. Not only are images crisp and detailed on video calls, but the camera will actually automatically zoom in and out to adjust to the people in the shot. For example I can back up from my kitchen into the living room, and the camera will zoom in and follow me. When you combine this with the movement and facial tracking, it is almost like having your own camera man follow you around the room on your call. The family members we called said they could see so much more detail. There is also now a physical shutter that you can close to cover the camera if you want to.
-SPEAKERS – The old 2nd Gen Show 10 had dual 2” neodymium drivers, but this new 3rd Gen Show 10 has two 1” tweeters and a 3” woofer. I can definitely tell the difference, although I really don't use the Show for listening to music very often. In testing out a few songs, I noticed that the new 3rd Gen seems louder at max volume, and less muffled. Definitely an improvement, though maybe not quite on the level of the Echo Studio.
-PROCESSOR – The new Show 10 has both an upgraded main processor, and also a second Amazon AZ1 processor. This should result in slightly faster repose times, and better future performance; although I really haven't been able to tell much of a difference so far. AZ1 is supposed to be faster and more efficient, and allow voice commands to be processed locally instead of having to go to the cloud; so we'll see if this is noticeable in the future.
-ZIGBEE/SIDEWALK – The previous version included a Zigbee hub, but this version also includes Amazon Sidewalk compatibility. Sidewalk is a long range connection technology that Amazon plans to use for devices that will be able to reach much further; (the initial announcement estimated up to half a mile). This technology isn't really being used yet, but it is nice to know this future tech is built in.

THE BAD:

-WHITE POWER CORD – Yes, for some reason that same white power cord that ships with the Echo 4th Gen is also included for this Show 10. No matter what color Show you get (I got black), you still get a white power cord. I'm a little surprised that they went with this decision again, but it really doesn't bother me much at all. Just thought I'd mention it in case that matters to you.
-LARGE FOOTPRINT – Since the device rotates, you really have to be careful about where you put it. The Show 10 comes with a footprint guide, that suggests that you make sure you have enough space around the device to avoid the screen knocking over a glass of water, for example. This also wasn't a big deal for me, but keep in mind you will probably need more space than the previous version. The specs recommend a 10” by 15” space, but I think you could get away with less.

*Note – You can disable the movement by saying “Alexa disable Motion,” or by turning it off in the Alexa app on your phone. Also, when you first setup your Show, there is a slider bar that let's you choose how far the screen should rotate in each direction. It seems to go almost 360 degrees maximum, but you can limit the radius so it turns much less. You can also change this in the 'Motion' menu under Settings.

Overall, I am VERY pleased with this new Show 10. The camera clarity is great, and the face tracking technology is so impressive; there's just nothing else like it for video calls to our family. This is a huge upgrade!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Vincent,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","I have owned the last two Generation Echo Shows. The Echo Show 1 & Echo Show Gen 2. The Echo Show 10 solves all the issues that the first two devices had, and adds even more features jam packed into one great device.

Now before I get into the meat and potatoes — let me tell you about the truly magical experience I have had with this device. It arrived in a box almost double the size of the previous model — and this device is BIG! The screen is huge! The speaker is also apparently much more powerful than the last generation — and I can tell, that is most definitely the case.

But the true magic comes when you power on and set up the Echo. The Amazon team really did wonders creating this device. Both the camera and the AI in this thing are crazy good. Assuming you have motion enabled, as soon as you say the wake word, i.e., “Alexa” the device honed in on my direction, rotated towards me, and began listening.

If you walk around the room, this device follows you. You can’t understand how cool this is until you try it out. I would upload a video, but I’m sure you can look it up on YouTube, and there will likely be hundreds of reviews showcasing it here.

There’s something about the tracking technology that Amazon has gotten just right. I called up my Grandma who has my old first gen echo show, and she didn’t even realize we were conversing as I was walking around my room. She thought I was just stationary the whole time. When I pointed it out and showed to her, her jaw dropped.

The way the camera zooms in on you, and the range of video it can show is phenomenal. I can jump onto my bed (my echo is on my nightstand) and the echo will zoom in and focus on me. When I go off the side of my bed, it follows zooming out, and can follow my body all the way as I walk back across the room towards the device.

It all feels so natural. The only thing that is missing would be if the Echo device itself moved! You can now have a conversation with someone when moving around your environment, without having to remain stationary.

In a kitchen, a home gym, or anywhere you’d want to talk with someone actively, this device would be really extraordinary to play with, especially during covid times.

I use my device in my room as an Alarm clock — so previously, my camera would be staring across the room as to not let me look at the screen if needed (for time/alarms, etc). Now, with the camera cover, I feel much more comfortable covering the camera and rotating the device to look towards me at night.

Now, take these into consideration as you decide if you want to purchase:

First, if you want to get the latest and greatest Echo device, the purchase is a no brainer. I am an Amazon loyalist, and can say that even from first impressions, this device blows all other Amazon devices I’ve owned away.

Second, if you’re a user who doesn’t mind the camera being uncovered, then you’ll have no problem with this device. You’ll love it. The motion features will be left on 16/7 for me. I wouldn’t be comfortable allowing having the camera on while I’m sleeping (and staring at me), but for a public area in your home — who cares? I wouldn’t mind, I’d leave it on all day — it following you around is magical.

Third, if you fall into the second issue above, you CAN use the camera cover to disable motion. If you don’t mind sliding the cover open and closed every morning/night, this could work for a nightstand alarm clock, and the hassle/inconvenience would be worth it.

Pros:
- Motion is magical
- Camera is high definition
- Sound is great. Music sounds lively. Lyrics on screen that follow you around the room
- Adaptive screen dimming still works even when camera/motion is blocked/disabled
- You can manually rotate the device when motion is off i.e. I’m going to bed, to point it towards me. I don’t know if that’s safe for the motor — I’ll ask Amazon!

Cons:
- If your room doesn’t have a full range of motion, the Echo might get confused when following you around. Since it is on my nightstand, the echo really only needs to turn about 90° to see in front if itself, and when I go to the left of my room. If I go to exit my room, it might start losing tracking, which could probably fixed in a future OS update (to halt moving at a specific point, which it already does).

Bottom Line: I 100% recommend this as an upgrade to an old device or a new device for any potential Echo owners. If you don’t feel comfortable with the motion controls, turn them off, but you won’t get the full package and what I think is the biggest selling point of this device. Put this in a public room and try it out — you won’t regret it.

EDIT: After seeing more reviews a few points to mention:

1. White power cord. Who cares? You dock a star for this? Don’t listen to normies giving poor reviews who think the color of a power cord which is draped out of sight will have any effect on how the device improves over it’s predecessor
2. Complaints over resolution: if you’re not buying this thing to watch full-fledged movies on, it’s fine. You won’t notice.
3. Complaints over tracking: it won’t track you with the camera in the dark. A future models can probably have an infrared light added (similar to FaceID) to fix that problem.
4. I saw someone complaining about Airplay and multiroom audio. Echo devices support multiroom audio through Amazon’s Ecosystem — not bluetooth. It has never supported that. Why would you expect this to change without notice?

Don’t listen to the haters. People reviewing are acting as if this device isn’t 5x better than the last generation of the Show. Motion is a stellar addition that would bring moving smart devices into the mainstream. No one here knows what a
the Facebook Portal is, because there was never a solid backing behind the product line. Echos are in homes across America, and I’m sure that this will lead to better smart devices from Amazon in the future.

For reference, I have owned an: Echo Show 1, Echo Show 2, Echo Dot, and have coded ~5 Alexa Skills. I know these devices. This gen is great. Give it 1 month and these will be 5/5. These reviews all read so fake. Who purchases a device and returns it same-day due to a different colored power cord? Who returns a device that doesn’t do something they expected when it was never said the device did it?

Low-information consumers and people with too high expectations... there’s a reason why it’s called PRE-ORDERING, because you KNOW you are going to like it and/or take what you get. No one forced you to buy a day 1 device.

TL;DR: Don’t listen to bad reviews. Buy this if you’re in the market.",5.0 out of 5 stars

kenya Garcia,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2024","I recently started using the Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen). Here’s a review focusing on its convenience:
Convenience:

The Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is an incredibly convenient addition to my home. The standout feature is its ability to move and follow me around the room. The smart display’s motorized base means it rotates to keep me in view during video calls or while watching recipes and tutorials. This hands-free feature is fantastic for multitasking—whether I’m cooking, working out, or just moving around the room, the Echo Show 10 stays with me, ensuring I never miss a beat.

1. Smart Movement:

The Echo Show 10’s ability to automatically pivot and track me during video calls or while I’m interacting with it is a game-changer. No more awkward adjustments or missed moments—this device ensures I stay in the frame and can see the screen clearly, regardless of where I move.

2. Crystal-Clear Display:

The HD display is vibrant and sharp, making it perfect for watching videos, browsing photos, or following along with recipes. The 10.1-inch screen size is just right—not too big and not too small—offering an excellent viewing experience without dominating my countertop or desk space.

3. Premium Sound Quality:

The sound quality is top-notch, with rich, clear audio that fills the room. Whether I'm listening to music, catching up on the news, or watching a movie, the Echo Show 10 delivers an immersive audio experience. The built-in speakers are powerful and provide crisp sound, enhancing the overall convenience of the device.

4. Voice-Controlled Smart Home Hub:

Integrated with Alexa, the Echo Show 10 acts as a central hub for my smart home devices. I can control lights, thermostats, and other smart gadgets with simple voice commands. The convenience of managing my smart home from a single device, especially with voice commands, simplifies my daily routines.

5. Video Calling Made Easy:

The Echo Show 10 simplifies video calls with its high-definition camera and auto-framing feature. It’s easy to connect with family and friends, and the camera ensures that everyone in the room is visible and in focus. Plus, the privacy shutter provides peace of mind when not in use.

6. Interactive Features:

The touch screen interface is intuitive and responsive, making it easy to interact with apps, view photos, or check the weather. The device integrates seamlessly with various services, including Amazon services and third-party apps, enhancing its versatility.

7. Home Automation Integration:

The Echo Show 10 works well with other smart home devices, allowing me to automate tasks and create routines. Setting up routines for daily tasks like turning on the lights or adjusting the thermostat is straightforward, making home management more efficient.

Cons:

While the Echo Show 10 excels in convenience, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider:

1. Size and Placement:

The device is relatively large and requires a bit of space. Its size might be a consideration if you have a smaller kitchen or desk area.

2. Price Point:

It is on the higher end of the price spectrum for smart displays. While the features justify the cost, it may not be the most budget-friendly option for everyone.

3. Motion Tracking Sensitivity:

While the motion tracking is a fantastic feature, it can sometimes be overly sensitive. In certain lighting conditions or with rapid movements, the device may have difficulty keeping up.

Final Thoughts:

The Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) is a highly convenient and feature-rich smart display. Its ability to move and track users, combined with excellent sound quality and a sharp HD display, makes it a valuable addition to any smart home. Despite a few minor considerations regarding size and price, the Echo Show 10’s functionality and ease of use make it a worthwhile investment for those looking to enhance their smart home experience.",5.0 out of 5 stars
A. Pena,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2021","Full disclosure, I receive gift cards from my place of work from time to time and I used some of that money to pay for half of this unit, though it is not related to Amazon of course so this review is fully of my own opinions.

I own a few of the Amazon Echo show units dating back to the original Gen 1 Echo Show (7 inch). I currently still own that unit and had a place in my kitchen for several years. My wife now working from home needed an Echo in her upstairs office (where it was becoming troublesome to reach her from the other end of the house) so instead of purchasing an all new one, we decided based on her casual usage that we would replace the Gen 1 Echo Show with the latest generation for the kitchen. At the time, I wasnt aware of the new Echo Show 10, but was intrigued to find out there was a new version with a motorized screen display. I am somewhat of an early adopter, but my profession is in computer/electrical engineering and wanted to see if this was worth the substantial increase in costs. The gift card funds just help take that sting out of the purchase that made the decision easier over the costs of the non motorized Show product line.

Unboxing:
Unboxing was straight forward if you are familiar with the Show lineup and not much to say other than that reviews had led me to believe the unit was big, but I was not surprised by what I found. Essentially a large speaker base with what appears to be a tablet stuck to it, not that surprising and what anyone would expect. The cable like many others have mentioned on the charcoal colored unit is a bit annoying that it is white, but not the end of the world. Just would have appreciated more attention to this detail. Packaging looked well capable of protecting the unit as it was a box within a box, within another Amazon box, but this is where I have a small gripe. Did we need 3 boxes for this, Amazon, please work on the overuse of packaging for wastage.

Setup:
Setup was pretty standard if you have ever performed an Echo setup, but a bit elongated to perform the turning radius setup limits which is handy if your Show will have objects nearby or walls to contend with. I have none in this case as it is going at the end of the counter bar that divides the Den area with the Kitchen area. It can turn 360 degrees freely and this was easy to see how to limit or run unhindered. The rest of the setup was just confirming the Amazon account, wireless connection, and home screen details. All within about 3 minutes or less.

First impressions:
My first impressions were the unit is very sleek looking and the weight seemed adequate for the unit to be stable on the bench. The screen was perfectly bright and just the right size to view from a reasonable distance. The speed of the rotation as some have mentioned being too slow I found just fine as I want it to be quiet (which it is in motion - perfectly silent) and yet not aggressive in the movements as to call too much attention to the unit. My family thought it was pretty interesting how it can follow if you interact with it, but normally it stay put unless you ask it a question. In locating the person to point at with the voice trigger, I actually found the unit a little less sensitive to the wake command than any of my other generation units including the latest 8 inch and 5 inch Show units (I own 4 x 8 inch units and 4 x 5 inch units, along with 3 echo dots). In fact I have an upstairs Echo Show 8 (open ceiling through the Den into the movie theater room, that many times ""bongs"" to the wake command sooner than the kitchen one will standing within a few feet of this new unit. This isnt a huge issue once you get used to it, but I hope Amazon tweaks the sensitivity of the wake command to be more in line with other models in the lineup. One of the reason I got this new unit was my impressively fast results with the other latest generation Echo Show 8 units being so fast to work a command over the 1st generation.

After a few weeks of usage:
I have found that the unit motorized feature is a little bit of a novelty, but in daily use it has been a welcome change. For the price difference, I am right on the fence of whether I would pay the difference knowing what I know now and I know that may not help anyone reading this, but it is really right there with I would or wouldnt pay the extra. As the price knowingly will come down over time, this should become easier to make a decision.

Sound Quality:
Sound quality is above par for my expectations, as it is more clear than the preceding model. It has more depth to me and sound dispersion to 360 degrees is far better than the rear/side facing speakers of the past. Potentially largely due to the screen being out of the way which is a bit expected. Louder volumes were reached without distortion compared to previous units and the highs were clear and pronounced without overdoing it. Happy with this as an area speaker, but this wont replace your bookshelf stereo for instance. It can be paired with other devices so you can expand this if necessary.

Motion tracking:
As mentioned from others, this is a bit laggy, but in the ""works well enough"" category. It is not quick to jump around, but can trail someone easily walking around. What I found is that it rarely loses focus of the individual completely even though it will trail the motion. And if the user is continuing to speak, it almost never loses track of the user in my testing. Of note, it of course does not track up and down as the motorized function is swivel only, but the wide angle of the lens makes this mostly unnecessary.

Final verdict:
Would I get this again? In this same scenario, definitely, no regrets. Had I needed to pay the entire amount? At $250 at the time of writing while the 8 inch is $109, this is a hard justification, but when we remember that a year ago the previous 10 inch model was selling for $229, it gets a lot easier to see that the extra $20 delivers quite a bit. Better sound, motorized swivel, a better screen, and a much better tilt/angle/level than the previous unit had out of the box. I think this is a win, if it isnt a solid win over the previous generation. I hope that the mic sensitivity gets better with updates, but I dont have many complaints over what is delivered today from this model.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Char, The (Mostly) Happy Shopper","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2023","Here I am again with yet another echo review. Anyone who follows my reviews knows I have quite a few of these things. I'm always buying a new one and then doing the echo shuffle, placing them in different rooms with every upgrade. I have the echo dot 2nd gen (well, had....we'll get to that in a bit), an echo dot 4th generation, three echo show 5's, an echo show 8 and now, with my latest purchase, an echo show 10. I have them all over our house. I've been watching the 10 and 15 for a while now. Then, one day, I got a notification that the 10 had a deal. I took it and noticed they'd give me more off in I traded in one of my other devices. Out went the 2nd gen because I knew, with the upgrade and shuffling, I wouldn't use it anymore. The sadness washed over me. It was our first echo relationship. So many memories. The good times, the bad times. I will look back at them fondly. I took some time to say goodbye before packaging it up and taking it to the UPS drop-off. They say getting over your first is hard, and they are right, but it was time to move on.....

I purchased the 10 and it arrived the next day. Set up, as always, was a breeze. Took less than 5 minutes thanks to the preset up email. The 10 is about the right size for our kitchen (where it replaced the 8, which got moved elsewhere, hence the shuffle) and I love having the bigger screen to watch the news while I get ready for work in the morning. The sound and picture quality are pretty great. I did get a little stand for it so it sits a bit taller, but other than that, it's just about perfect. Just about you say? Yea, just about. My issue is with the one feature that the others I own don't have. Motion detection. I hate it. Why? Well, first, I don't ever use my echos for phone calls. I know some people do and that's cool. Just not my thing. Second, I placed my echo in a corner. It can't swivel without hitting a wall. So, I turned that feature off. Simple enough. Or so I thought. It did an update recently and I walked into my kitchen, only to find it stuck against the wall. It had reset itself. Bad Alexa, bad. I turned the feature off again. It started to move once more, telling me it was stuck. I gave it a good amount of side eye and double checked the settings. It showed that it was turned off. Hmmm. I did what our IT department always says to do when faced with a tech crisis. I turned it off and back on again. I also closed the camera lens, something I had forgotten to do with this one. It hasn't tried moving since. Let's hope it stays that way.

Since it does come with motion detection, one nice thing about it (yes, there is something positive about it I guess) is that even when disabled, the screen can be swiveled. Now, I do like that. I have had to adjust the screen a little depending on where I am in the room or because of the glare of the lights and it's nice to not have to move the whole device. I do sometimes wish you could lock it into place though. No swiveling at all. If there is such a feature (outside of the motion detection disable), I haven't found it yet.

Aside from that, just as with my other echos, I really like it. It's great for checking our blink cameras, watching news or tv, playing music throughout the house, controlling our lights, creating shopping lists, reminders and the like, or just being entertained by asking silly questions. Me and Alexa can have hours of fun with the last one. She's a crazy gal. There are so many things you can do that I doubt I will stop with the 10. As a matter of fact, I know I won't. As Amazon keeps making them, I will probably keep buying them, eventually having one in every single room in our house. I'm honestly pretty close. What will I do then, you ask? Well, we do have a garage and I have a workout shed, so we shall see.....",4.0 out of 5 stars

The sound quality from the speaker is good, much better than my echo show 5. The screen size is perfect for my kitchen, on the counter. Fits well in this otherwise wasted space and looks great.
I have it connected to my ring cameras and it alerts if someone's at my door. I also connected my Spotify to it and I can play music on all three of my echo shows at the same time, in multiple rooms. It is playing a slideshow of my photos too, which I have stored on Amazon photos. I enjoy having the ability to personalize the display.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Also I would heavily like to include that Alexa routines are very lacking and custom routine sucked and I hated that alexa wanted to speak everytime you issued a custom routine I could get her to stop talking no matter what I tried also routines should have if then, elseif then, else then, and the ability to cancel another routine.

J,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023","We're approaching the two year mark with the Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) in our kitchen and as such it has been used heavily. We've tinkered around with just about every bell and whistle that is available on it. Ultimately, we've decided that it is just a poor design across the board and consequently a frustrating user experience.

Honestly, most of these ""bells and whistles"" really aren't something anyone would make use of other than to ""try them out"" once as we've done. The news and sports widgets may interest you, but I feel like we are drowning in those two types of widgets on every screen we encounter these days; phone, watch, PC, work laptop, home laptop, tablet, TV. I feel like I have enough news, weather, and sports widgets to last me a lifetime at this point.

We ended up disabling everything except the rotating photos, so it's nothing more than a glorified digital photo frame for us. It's decent for that, but frankly the majority of digital photo frames out there will do a better job. Just stick an Echo Dot next nearby for Alexa...

As far as the lackluster photo experience, for example, you can't make it default to photo frame mode, or even force it to stay in that mode for an extend period of time. It always ends up back at the home screen after awhile. So, if you set it up to do so, you end up with rotating Amazon Photos photos on the ""home screen"" which you get forced to. The home screen photos are decent but, just like everything else in the Echo Show, still feels buggy and clunky. When you set a 10 second or 30 second photo rotation (or whatever) it definitely doesn't follow that setting. Sometimes it will hang on a photo for several minutes, other times it will rotate in 10 seconds. It feels like that setting is for Photo Frame mode, which (as mentioned) is essentially a useless feature, since it does not stay persistent.

Another drawback while being forced into the home screen for making it a digital photo frame is the clock/date are in the bottom left hand corner, and they are absolutely massive. They cannot be adjusted or disabled, as most everything else on the device... very little customization options. We have like 700 clocks in our kitchen, and would totally be fine with disabling the Echo Show clock... Often it will rotate to a photo and then the focal point of the photo ends up blocked by the huge clock. This happens a lot to us because we end up taking family selfies, and (having the longest arms currently) I normally take them, so I end up in the upper right of the photo, with the wife more towards the left, and then the kids in the bottom left... so, the huge clock cuts the kids out of the picture and most of the time half of my wife gets cut. That clock really does wreck a ton of photos, family selfies or not. Long story short the photo experience is decent, but there are way better options/devices out there, especially since the other options will integrate with other services such as Apple or Google photos, but with the Echo Show you are forced into Amazon Photos which is severely lackluster compared to the ""other two""...

Aside from the photos I have no idea why anyone would like this device, let alone rate it 5 stars. The speaker looks like it should be awesome, but it's also lackluster. The hardware just kinda sucks... it is quite sluggish in terms of performance.

We do have Spotify integration set up and do also use that a bit just because my kids play music on alexa in general a lot... but, if you have read this far, then it's not going to be a shocker when you hear we feel the Echo Spotify app is a clunky, sluggish, and just overall lackluster experience when compared to the Apple, Android, PC, Mac, and Web Spotify apps.

It seems like it could be great for video calls. We did try that some when I was traveling for work and it's just too sluggish and clunky, we always ended up flipping over to our phones. Also forget the ""follow me"" screen rotation mode thing, it sounds cool, but works like garbage. Same with streaming videos in general, just doesn't work well, I'd rather just use a small phone.

All of that said, having a digital alexa photo frame is decent enough... These things aren't too pricey, especially when you catch them during Amazon's big sales...

But.... the two straws which broke the camel's back, and makes me want to go office space this thing, are:

a) Our family loves shopping on Amazon, we spend a disgusting amount on Amazon every year, so take this point for what it is... but in pure slime ball fashion Amazon forces advertisements on the screen which pop up periodically trying to get you to buy random stuff. Sometimes, this stuff may not even be something you'd like advertised to your kids or guests. There is absolutely no way to disable these ads. So they charge you 100 to 300 bucks for something like this, and force their ads on to you. That in and of itself should be a hard stop for anyone considering one of these.

b) I'm not sure how this next point is working behind the scenes over there at Amazon, but it appears that any new or updated feature forces itself to be turned on (even after previously disabling it). This is a regular occurance. Like I said we've literally disabled everything, but things just pop up out of nowhere, or are periodically turned back on, such as news, sports, joke of the day, etc etc. And nope, it's not my kids messing with it, they can't even reach it.

TTLD;, the Echo Show 10 kinda sucks, part due to hardware issues, but bigger part due to software issues, which leads me to believe whatever version comes next will also suck. That said, 45,458 reviews as of this post, and 4.5 stars... so the masses appear to love this big weird clunky rotating wonky crappy weak sauce robot tablet... :D",1.0 out of 5 stars

PMR,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2023","I bought this mainly to use it as a video call unit (I intend to buy a second one soon, which will be installed at a relative's house). My second use is watching the house when I'm away (via the app on my cell) and seeing a couple of cameras I have installed.

That said, here are my PROS and CONS.

PROS:
- Nice screen of a good format and size. The resolution is really good, too.
- Good sound, equivalent to (if not better than) what my Echo 3rd gen produces.
- Should make a nice video call set (more on that when I install the second unit; I will get back here to update my review).
- The screen follows you (most of the time)!

CONS:
- The screen is way too reflective. That makes it hard to read if there's a window behind you.
- A white power cord for a black unit, really, Amazon?! OK, I understand it saves YOU some bucks, but it's an eyesore at my all-black countertop. A black unit should come with a black cord, period. Good thing I had an Echo 3rd gen. with a black cord I could use (my Echo can keep the white cord since it falls hidden behind a piece of furniture).
- While I'm at that... the power cord has a different adaptor than the Echo Dots. So you can only replace the eyesore white cord like I did if you have an Echo (not the dot, but the taller one, which also uses a different adaptor -- come on, Amazon, standardize that stuff!)
- Somewhat harder to hear you... and I can attest to that since I have five other Echo Dots 3rd gen plus an Echo 3rd gen in the house. You call it, it doesn't hear you, and you need to repeat it louder. It's so annoying that sometimes a Dot in a far-away room will reply to your command instead of this unit, which is right on your face.
- Besides, you can say ""Alexa, do [whatever]"" to an echo dot, while you have to call ""Alexa"" (wait for it to find you) and then ""do [whatever]"" on this thing. Not as fast/responsive as the Echo Dots.
- No infrared vision, so don't expect it to be helpful as a night camera to watch your house.
- It does follow you, but sort of ""crooked."" Its camera is off-center, so it usually doesn't ""look at you"" directly but a little sideways. No, there's no way to fine-tune that either. And sometimes, for no good reason, you can walk in front of it, and it won't follow you... I haven't yet figured out why and when it does follow me, even after telling her to ""follow me"" and activating that mode.

Finally, let's be honest: I love what it does, and many years ago, I was impressed with what this technology promised. But almost a decade later, Alexa isn't becoming smarter. It recognizes my face and my voice. But if I tell her my birthday or some other fact about me, she's still incapable of memorizing it (yes, I can create a note, but that's not the same as this thing really KNOWING when my birthday -- or anyone's birthday -- is).

Today, it also should be smart enough to receive two or more commands at once, like ""turn off my office light, turn on my bedroom light, and play music.""

And even though I have a Fire TV at home, it took way too many commands and internet searches until I got this new unit to control it (it kept replying, ""your Fire TV can't do that"" to every command; I finally got it to work, but definitely not a user-friendly set up as I'd have expected).

So the promise of Artificial Intelligence is still in the air. This thing has good voice recognition, but its features and skills are still not worthy of being called ""intelligence.""",4.0 out of 5 stars

Jace,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2024","This is by far our family’s favorite Amazon product. We started with an echo dot (2nd gen) in 2017, then fire tv sticks, plug ins, fire tablets, echo auto and echo shows. We pretty much have an alexa/echo device in each rooms.
It was very easy to install especially if you already have an amazon account. Also, check out their trade-in program. Take advantage of upgrading your echo devices and experience how amazon develops their products and try their best to give customers great and reliable products.
Now, this Echo Show 10 does a lot of work in our home. I won’t discuss about any technical things about it since I do not speak that language. However I will review this from a Mom’s standpoint.
As a parent of curious kids, you’ll get hundreds of questions a day. Sometimes you’d know the answers and there are times you don’t. The device helps me with that. Sure the other echo dots can do it but having a screen that follows you is more fun and more informative for kids. It makes my kids interested in current events as it shows news articles and photos. It would give some facts and interesting topics for us to discuss further. Of course, my kids will do their own research and it keeps them more interested. From music, history, conversation, spelling, you name it, it would have the answers.
Next is the camera feature, any approved contacts can drop in on this device. It’s amazing since they could pretty much video call other relatives that have alexa app or devices. It makes us feel more connected with our loved ones that can’t operate phones to video call.
So aside from connecting us with humans, it connects us to other non humans; my vacuum cleaner, air purifier, lights, window blinds and so much more. It helps me multi task. As a mom, life gets busy and I forget a lot of things! I rely on this device to remind me about my schedule, chores, shopping lists, recipes, etc. I do have other ways to remind myself about things but it helps that there’s a device that will show me and tell me to do it. It makes me remember more when I see my list and this thing does it for me without all the paper clutter.
Then there’s more features to explore!

Jason Gaines,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2021","UPDATE 4-17-21: Still working fine, no issues. Only thing I wish, is that I had just waited a month to purchase this as it went on sale super quick for $50 less. What’s the point of being an early adopter if it’s a negative?! I’d rather have just waited; next time I will. ;(

UPDATE 3-30-21: Our Video Apps Crashing issue came back, so I contacted Amazon again and they decided it would be best to replace the unit. A new one will be here in another day, so I can see if that one has any issues. I do like the Show 10, but I'm a little less smitten with it then I thought I would be. Again, the motion part is not as useful as one would like due to it's ability to actually track you properly without getting lost. I do really enjoy having a device to watch something in the kitchen while chilling out or cooking, and playing music on it is actually quite nice. Maybe it just needs to grow on me some more, and absolutely have the video apps stop crashing that is a definite.

So we’ve had this for a month now. It’s been fun to get to use it and see what it can do. That being said, it’s not as useful as I thought it would be. This is much less a tablet and more a media player. You can’t customize it like a Kindle or other tablets and put your own apps on it. It does play music really well and it does okay with smart home stuff. But that is an Alexa issue not Echo Show problem. I was hoping we had more customization with this but the OS is pretty closed loop.

Motion: Hit or Miss. it will follow you when you tell it to, but it will lose you easily, especially if you are too close to the unit or move to rapidly. There is a happy space of probably about 5ft to 8ft where it will follow you well. Too close and it will focus on something else, same thing for too far away. It loses you and once it does it forgets who it was following. Too many people around can confuse it as well. If it’s just you and your cleaning dishes or cooking, you should be okay.

Video: we had an issue with our unit crashing any video app such as Prime Video or Netflix after about 5-8mins of watching something. It would just go back to the home screen and forget what you were watching. If you started the app up again you had to start back from where you began as it would not save your progress. Calling support just recommended a factory reset which was going to be our next step anyways, and so far that has corrected the crashing.

Security: it’s easy enough to view the camera on the Show and move it left or right to see what’s around the area. Just remember you can’t move the screen up or down remotely, so if it tilted too far up it will limit your view. Otherwise it works well, and the screen notifies you when someone is remotely viewing on the screen.

Customization: Meh, it’s okay but will take some time getting used to the OS. It works like a tablet in the fact you tap or swipe to get to stuff, but again you can’t add any apps from an App Store. The OS is locked to what it is, and maybe that’s a good thing so it doesn’t get corrupted by junk we all like to add. Still, it limits the functionality and use of this device.

Overall: It’s a sound bar with a video display that can control smart home apps. The sound is really good, loud and crisp. Video is nice and smooth and if you have issues try a reset of the device. Not as full featured as a full on tablet, but pretty good over all. I gave it a four star rating. Really it’s a 4.5, but not a full 5 so I’m not picking that just because they don’t give us half ratings to use.

J. Fernandez,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","First the camera is offset, so the screen is always offset when it follow you, that is when it does actually follow you, because more than half of the time it does not, and God forbid you try to touch the monitor, because it will constantly tell you the screen has bumped into something... It has way too many bugs in the software ... I am not at all impressed with this update, because it doesn't seem like a lot of thought went into this model!

BUT ... My biggest gripe has to do with the electrical cord, it is way too short, and plugs into the bottom of the base, which is also insanely difficult to reach without the monitor swinging all around, and good forbid you have to unplug it for any reason, because it will constantly make you put in your password over and over!

I am sorry, but this update is a big fail! It is definitely not ready for consumers! They really should have worked out the bugs before releasing it to the public! This unit truly seems like it should be in beta testing still, because it has way too many issues that need to be addressed!

Update: The advertisement makes it look as if you can use the device to scan one’s surroundings, when not at home, but what only the small print reveals, which most people will miss, that it only does this FOR A PRICE AND with a SUBSCRIPTION to HOME GUARD plus!

At $250, this should have been included, at least for a year, free of charge! I bought this believing I could scan a room, from my mobile device, only to find out ... you can’t, NOT EVEN WHEN YOU ARE AT HOME! Really Amazon, you couldn’t include that at least for a year free! As a prime member, for many years, I find this totally unacceptable, from a billion dollar company, that is charging way too much for this device! Do yourself a favor and wait until Amazon addresses the many issues and bugs this device does have at the present time!

Xtra, And apparently there is no way to pair the Amazon Remote in the software! I have search high and low for a way to pair my remote, but the option is no longer in the settings on the device or app!

After several months of owning this device I can say with all honesty it is the WORST device and echo show I have EVER owned!, along with the new Echo, Amazon has me truly believing it is time to cancel all my Amazon accounts, because the majority of their devices don’t work like they claim! If I have to yell one more command to turn play a show on Hulu and Netflix only to told you cannot play HULU or NETFLIX on this device, I will start looking for devices that actually do …. Amazon really needs to get on the ball, because I am quickly losing faith in all their products and services!",1.0 out of 5 stars
JD,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2023","*Updated 11/23/23* - so it appears that Amazon reintroduced a toggle in the ""Home Screen"" section this month to turn off the highly annoying ""things Alexa can do"" or ""things to try"" interruptions and it seems to be working at this point. I increased my rating to 3 stars.

Original review
Echo Show 10 - in use for 3 months. I have 4 other echo audio-only devices and a variety of other smart home devices - nearly 50 in total. I added the Echo show as a central device in the kitchen/great room where I could monitor selected security cameras and use the numerous other features WHEN I ASK IT TO (see below).

The GOOD News - the Echo Show handles all of the Alexa capabilities and provides basic integration with my smart home environment. The 10"" screen is good quality and adds a number of useful video features like displaying recipes, streaming videos, video calls, video monitoring of security cameras, etc... The sound quality is good - perhaps a tick better than the audio-only Echo balls. Almost certainly you will find something useful in the broad array of capabilities. The feature for the display to ""follow you"" around the room is interesting, but after a while it started feeling creepy so I turned it off - but I can see where that would be useful to some depending on how you are using the device.

The BAD news -
(1) At times I want to use this device to monitor one of my security cameras without interruption - unless I specifically ask the Echo Show 10 to do something else. Although there are a bunch of ""home screen"" settings where you can select whether you want a rotation of content (pictures, recipe ideas, news, ""suggested"" movies, social media drivel, etc.) to appear on the Alexa screen while it is awaiting your next command - in my case I don't want ANY of these things to interrupt my camera feed, so I turned them ALL off. Despite doing so, the device regularly stops the camera feed to display a ""things to try"" or ""things Alexa can do"" screen. REALLY ANNOYING and per my conversation with Amazon yesterday (10/11/23) there is no way to prevent the device from doing that. I find myself having to re-start my camera feed all day long. If you are contemplating using the Echo Show 10 to monitor a baby-cam, security cam, or some other static content display (e.g. bedside clock), just be aware that Amazon have decided that having Alexa tell you what else you should try is always more important than whatever else you have the Echo 10 doing. (At one point, there was a toggle to turn ""things to try"" off, but it didn't really work and that toggle disappeared a few weeks ago)
2) The integration with non-Amazon-branded smart home devices is still pretty weak and while I eventually got everything to a basic level of integration - it was a pain and took far too much troubleshooting. I recognize that integration requires coordinated action by the smart home device vendors and Amazon, but it needs to be much clearer what ""Alexa Enabled"" means. Often the integration is the absolute barest minimum (e.g. voice control to turn something on/off) and nothing more. As an example, my fancy AI security camera can tell me what it is seeing (a person, a car, a herd of buffalo, etc..) - the Echo Show 10 advertises a ""person detection"" announcement feature, but inexplicably when a person IS detected by my AI camera, instead of showing me the camera, it shuts OFF the video feed to display a text message - ""Person detected in driveway cam"" - Huh? And the Echo can't announce the car or anything else that the camera sees. Amazon should be pushing themselves and their ""Alexa Enabled"" partners aggressively towards the new ""Matter"" home automation integration standards to make it far easier to setup and clearer what capabilities you are really getting than at present.

Good luck!",3.0 out of 5 stars

I have a variety of Echo devices throughout my home, and this was my favorite one, until a little after 2 years old it quit working. I have tried everything recommended in the forums and have asked for the assistance of Amazon (the rep was extremely rude, and absolutely no help.) It will not stay connected to my wifi. I have moved it around (it was already the closest device to the router), shut down most everything in the house, turned it on and off, reset my router, and a host of other things. It will connect, but within 5 minutes, it drops the connection. For the price, it should still be working. I looked at ordering another Echo, but this one has no trade-in value. If this is such a great device, why is it not even listed for trade-in. My guess, they are having a lot of trouble with them and don't want them back.

RBrylawski,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2024","We've had one of the early Echo Shows for a few years now and while it was fine, it was starting to show its age, so it got moved to a bedroom and after looking at all the new models I chose the newest Echo Show 10 (3rd generation). It's quite an upgrade in every way.

The screen is bigger and high definition at 10.1"" and it follows you around as you move around, which for a kitchen application is great. I can be using the Echo Show while I'm cooking and moving from counter to counter and the screen stays with me.

One of the biggest advantages of this new Echo Show is the speaker. It's really a big speaker and the moving screen is mounted to the speaker. But the output of the speaker is quite remarkable and music actually sounds terrific on it. The speakers deliver realistic sound which is directional.

Like most of the Echo Shows, once you've set up one through the Alexa app on your iPhone, setup is a breeze. In fact, when you order this 3rd gen Echo Show, you answer some questions about your network at home and out of the box it basically sets itself up. Though, I must admit the first one we received wouldn't connect and Amazon immediately sent a replacement device, which did work.

You can use this for video calls and it even has a 13PM digital camera which you can use to take a selfie. You can integrate as many photos as you want to the display from your cell phone or Amazon Photos collection if you use Amazon Photos to store your pictures (we do, actually). You can open the app and see what's happening in your kitchen or speak to someone in the kitchen from anywhere. If you have a Ring Doorbell, you can just say Alexa, show me my Ring Doorbell. Or ask Alexa to pull up a recipe quickly if you need one. It's all just so easy to use.

The options to integrate things like your car, security system, smart devices, are pretty much endless and super easy to set up as well.

All in all, I couldn't be happier with my decision to move up to the Echo Show 10!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Andrea D. Wilson,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2023","I recently purchased the Echo Show 10 HD smart display from Amazon, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed. The Echo Show 10 delivers an outstanding audio experience that truly stands out. The sound quality is simply amazing, providing a rich audio experience that elevates your entertainment.

The picture quality on this smart display is top-notch as well. The HD display offers crisp and vibrant visuals, making it a pleasure to watch your favorite movies and shows. Whether you're streaming content or catching up on the news, the Echo Show 10's screen display ensures a fantastic viewing experience.

One of the standout features of the Echo Show 10 is its dynamic motion functionality. The fact that the display moves to follow you as you move around is a game-changer, especially during Alexa calls. This means that the person you're talking to can continue to see you as you go about your daily tasks, whether you're cooking, cleaning, or simply multitasking. It adds a whole new level of convenience and connection to your video calls.

While the dynamic motion feature is impressive, it's not always flawless. There are times when the motion can be a bit off, which can be a minor inconvenience. However, I'm optimistic that with future updates and improvements, this feature will become even better over time.

The Echo Show 10 also offers premium sound quality, allowing you to enjoy your music and content with exceptional clarity and depth. The combination of stunning visuals audio creates an all-encompassing entertainment experience that's truly top tier.

In addition to its audio and visual capabilities, the Echo Show 10 provides a versatile platform for doing more. You can effortlessly watch your favorite movies and shows, stay updated with the latest news, and access a wide range of Alexa skills that enhance your daily life.

Overall, the Echo Show 10 HD smart display is an incredible addition to any smart home setup. It offers outstanding sound and picture quality, and its dynamic motion feature makes it a standout device for video calls. While there's room for improvement in the motion aspect, the overall experience is highly satisfying. This device's premium sound and its ability to do so much more make it a worthwhile asset for anyone looking to enhance their home entertainment. You will not be disappointed.",4.0 out of 5 stars
daveinlaca,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2021","The idea of the Echo Show 10 is such a game changer, I was ready to make it the hub of my music and entertainment center at home. Echo already controls my television remote, my lights, and my spotify. With the Show, I was expecting it to do the same with photos and other features.

Unfortunately, nearly every feature I was excited about underdelivered.

Photo Booth
I was most excited about the idea of telling my show ""Alexa, take a picture"", have it find me and my friends and snap a selfie. What a great addition to parties! And while the camera has improved, the lighting adaptation has not. Most of the photos came out extremely average if the lighting wasn't perfect. The kind of quality I would have expected to post on my MySpace in 2006.

The other great addition was the ability to tell my Show, ""Alexa, take a video"". It did a good job of finding me, but every video has to end with you saying ""Alexa, stop video."" I called customer service, certain that there must be a gesture I could assign, or perhaps a way to set a time and have Alexa take a 10 second video. But no, after exploring all options like ""routines"" and ""IFTT"" every video has to end with you telling Alexa to stop.

There's also no way to get the photos and videos straight to your phone, so you're stuck waiting for it to upload to Amazon Photos, then going into your phone, opening Amazon Photos, finding what you want, then downloading, then editing the end of that video so it doesn't end with your stop command. Clunky and unnecessary when there are so many easy ways they could have programmed all this to work better.

MUSIC
I was excited about the lyrics feature on Amazon Music. They advertised ""Have your own karaoke night!"" But there are almost no karaoke songs on Amazon Music. They are plentiful on Spotify and other music services. A speaker with a screen makes karaoke such an obvious use, that it's shocking there's no way to do it. Either you can bring up the lyrics with the original song and vocals, or you can stream Spotify, but then the lyrics don't come up. Looked for third party solutions, but they were all just a few karaoke songs for small children. Another wasted opportunity.

SOUND
The sound was good. I was expecting it to be more like the Echo Studio with a screen, but the speaker is much smaller. Solid, but nothing that impressive. I ended up buying the Echo Sub to pair to it and that improved the sound greatly. Now my music sounds like a sound system...IF I STREAM FROM A SERVICE.

I write and produce music, so a lot of times I like to play my own music from my phone. To do that you need to pair your phone with your echo, at which point the echo acts just like a bluetooth speaker. That's fine, except now the Echo Sub no longer works, since that connects to your echo through bluetooth as well. So that great bassy sound I get with regular music isn't available for my own music if I play through my phone via iTunes or Soundcloud. Yet another opportunity missed.

YOUTUBE
YouTube...works. You access it through a web browser which is just clunky. The promise of a user friendly youtube playing all your videos and exploring and going down a youtube hole on a Friday night just doesn't work through the browser the way a dedicated app would.

FACES
It may not make sense to complain about a feature that isn't included that was never promised, but with echo having a screen, it seems like a logical step to create skins/faces that mimic what Alexa is saying. i picture a translucent face, like Snow White's mirror, or something cartoony. I'm surprised a third party developer wouldn't have made something like this available, and it would give the Show that much more of a personality.

Overall, I enjoy using the Echo Show 10. There seem to be a lot of kinks and falls short of its potential, but I knew that being an early adopter and purchasing the day it became available. And while most of these things are little frustrations, a big frustration is that only about a month after purchasing, Amazon has dropped the price $40, effectively punishing the early adopters for getting behind their product. That, along with my other issues, dropped my review from the five stars I wanted to give, down to the three I gave it.

Hope this helps others!",3.0 out of 5 stars
Nury Gonzalez,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2024","I have always liked in general all the Amazon brand products, but the electronics draw my attention, but much more in 2022 when I bought my Eco show, and I was happy with my purchase but even more in September 2023, on this date my kitchen stove exploded and the whole kitchen are got on fire, I always liked having my Echo show in the kitchen, I listen to music watch my shows see recipes a number of things while I cook or do the cleaning, that afternoon the firefighters arrived and they did what they do put the Fire off, now remember my Echo show had already received all the heat and on top of that the jet of water; the next day when we saw everything that had burned I remembered my speaker!!, and I thought oh my Echo burn, I cleaned it put it to the side after two days that I was going to put it in the trash, I realized that it didn't look so bad and I decided to plug it in and to my surprise it worked, almost a year after the fire it is still working, and with all this History the only thing I can say is that Echo show is EXCELLENT!!!!

Contacted Amazon who only stated that they will send a new system and they will provide a return label. What they don’t tell you is that you must send the system back and a replacement is not on the way. You must wait until they receive your item and they will see if they can repair or replace it with a possibility it will be a refurbished item. There’s more to this issue that will be too long to explain. Just know you can get numerous representatives telling you different things. Totally disappointed in this awful process.

Colleen,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2023","Okay, I'm having fun with Alexa. This morning I said ""Alexa, goodbye"". She replied, ""Let's make like a volcano and blow this place"". I will greet her when I return, and she often has a witty reply. She wakes me up to music which starts playing low then gets louder and louder until I tell her I'm awake. The sound is amazing for such a little speaker. I can hear the ""thumping"" coming from my room when I walk down the hall. Drawbacks, I know there is so much I can do with her that I haven't learned and have had a hard time finding the features. Most I discover by looking at the screen. I just learned I can play Jeopardy and found out about a podcast. I have had her give me reminders at certain times. Such as, ""Colleen, you better start getting ready, you have company coming in an hour."" She created a playlist of my favorite songs, but when I ask her to show me my favorite playlist, she only shows me the first song I added to it. In the end, I've had it about a week and I love it. I just want to know what else I can do. -- UPDATE -- so I have had this a couple of months. I love almost everything about it, except I know there are a lot of things than can be done and finding information on that is difficult. For instance, it let me make an outgoing call, but I don't know how to assign a contact and when I called the person, I didn't know what number to give them to call back. My phone is crap, so this would be a great alternative when I'm home. The screen will show a feature, but when I want to get more information, it has changed to a different screen, and I don't know how to back up to review what it just showed me. I will ask Alexa to go back to last screen and she's confused, I will ask her to tell me about it, and she's confused. For instance, the screen flashed something about a ""Bot"" for cooking and DYI, I wanted to know more about it and couldn't get it back. Or something will flash, but I don't have time to see what it is and I don't know how to bookmark it. Like I said before, I know there are a lot more options out there to utilize, but it doesn't come with any sort of manual. I've gone to YouTube videos, etc.. but haven't find anything to help. Other than that, I love the product and would buy it again.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Jay,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2023","Bought this on amazon prime day a few weeks ago. It is currently placed on a kitchen counter between the kitchen and living room in an open concept style house. Purchased mainly for the rotating feature that uses the camera to track the user as they walk around. This and the large screen have been great for working in the kitchen or asking about the weather from the living room. The downside of this feature is that below a certain level of light the device no longer moves the screen to follow you, displaying a message that says ""light level too low, movement disabled."" So at night if we don't have bright kitchen and dining room lights on, it doesn't move; and we largely keep those lights off when not in active use. In our home at night we noticed that just ambient light on from lamps in the room isn't enough for it to follow us. The device really needs something like an infrared sensor so it can work at night time like what Ring security cameras use for night vision. Adding this hardware would make this a must have product for your kitchen and bump this up to 5 stars. Other than that drawback, the included speaker, screen quality, and snappiness of the processor is better than past Eco Shows I've owned (still have the original echo show, 5 inch, and 8 inch models). As far as voice recognition it's the same as other models, although for the team working on Alexa it never understands the word ""closet."" We placed smart lighting in our closet, and she always replied with ""What device?"" and we'd have to yell ""closet"" a second time and it was hit or miss on the second attempt. Out of frustration we renamed the smart lighting to ""bathroom"" and that works 100% in turning on the lights in the closet, but that's been our only real issue with voice recognition.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Mark E Timperley,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2021","My first real Alexa enabled product, if you don't count my Kindle Fire... but more on that later.

First, I bought two Echo Show 10s, one for our kitchen and one for grandma. They were very easy to setup and have worked well so far (4 days in). I'm definitely impressed with the design and the quality of components, from the touch screen, buttons, motion and sound. All physical aspects are very well done. Do you need a screen that moves on its own? Yes! I can't imagine this product without motion. So far, we use the Echo Show 10 to ""drop in"" on grandma virtually, several times a day and every night for dinner. We love this ability! The Echo Show turns to whoever is speaking and zooms in on them, so she feels like she is right there with us and her grandchildren (not 25 feet away, outside a fish bowl). The best part of this technology is that Grandma didn't have to learn how to answer the ""video phone"", since it just connects when we want. In general, it works all by itself in her apartment (mostly) and we can control much of it remotely if needed. I do set and adjust reminders and alarms for her when needed, but beyond that we just ""drop in"" and say hello, whenever.

So that's the awesome part. We are discovering a few annoyances as we go, so I'll share one that is probably unique to this product: The process of adjusting and setting the range of motion is not well thought out. If you only ever did this once and then set the thing in cement, then maybe. But we set it on a counter and have already found that it must be moved for cleaning, to temporarily get it out of the way, or for use in another position. It takes about 4 minutes to reset... which is about 3.5 minutes too long for me. The other annoyances are all about ""Alexa"" so I'll mention them last.

Also, I've described a somewhat ideal grandma use case, so keep in mind that we only live 10 minutes from grandma and have had to drop by and ""fix Alexa"" (turned off, moved, lost wifi, screen rotated by hand) while she and visitors are getting used to it, so it's definitely not a set and forget type of technology, but I'm not going to reduce my rating because of that.

My rating would have been 5 stars, if it wasn't for Alexa herself and the somewhat puzzling UI design, menus, etc. Did I mention my Kindle Fire? Here's my point. You need one to control this thing and use many of the ""Alexa features"" with any level of certainty. You could also use a smartphone with the Alexa app, and we actually use both, but I find the Fire is a bit easier to use. This probably isn't news to someone who already has an Echo, but in case you are new to Alexa, using voice commands to find and select a book or other media for it to show or read by voice, to set a reminder, or just about anything beyond a few words, can be a terribly frustrating experience. It is amazing what it can do, but hopefully, engineers are still hard at work improving voice recognition and comprehension. Until then, my recommendation is to pair them. Echo Show 10 + Kindle Fire (with Alexa off on your Kindle) makes a great product together!

So Alexa, how do you spell frustrating? Her dutiful answer is ""F R U S T R A T I N G"" but also awesome, all at the same time. She doesn't get the joke yet... but given what she is capable of, why would she think I'm joking?",4.0 out of 5 stars

Roxie Muzic,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2021","Prior to this the household has the Gen 1 & 10"" Gen 2 Echo Shows, frankly I prefer the Gen 2 10"" Echo Show for most rooms over this model, but then...with firmware improvement/updates that opinion may change.

Other than the slight reduction in sound (I could care, I have multiple Sonos speakers) and screen resolution (as others have pointed out), the overriding feature of this iteration of Echo Show is the camera and 360 degree motion.

The camera is outstanding in resolution, very outstanding, worth the reduction in sound and screen resolution.

Motion however, needs work, the hardware used in this device to detect stability and motion needs serious firmware tweaking, way to sensitive, everything is ""unstable"", even the most stable. Understanding the need to be cautious, in that this slues around, to follow or view it's human or humans, however, ratchet the sensitivity down some to avoid the error messages that are unfounded when the device is on a stable, unimpeded full motion area. Currently if it even rocks a millimeter when turning, it throws the ""unstable"" error. I ordered two of these 10"" Gen 3 Echo Shows, both are behaving in this fashion. A little tweaking to the firmware of the device should solve this little sensitivity issue I would hope. This is not a game changer for me, this will be refined as customer feedback is received, or at least I have found that their development team is very responsive to these consumer observations. Kudos to them for that.

Next, that obnoxious, unnecessary screen of ""Alexa For Your Day"", for the love of every customer that you have, get rid of this, please, it is not a selling feature. Or, at least give us the option to have it show or not show in the Home Screen toggle switch section of the settings. It really is a ""bummer dude""...... if it keeps it up, it could be a game changer for me.

I can live with the HUGE time notification on the screen, I am old, but not blind, can we scale it down or have an option to scale it down, please, thank you. Not a game changer, but it is quite large you must admit...

All in all for the kitchen or the main floor/office in houses this is a great device, allows camera viewing 360 degrees, great idea for those who do not have indoor cameras already and as an adjunct for those of us who do. Have not used it for recipes in the kitchen yet, but I suspect that this will be a vast improvement over the Gen 2 10"" Echo Show, in that it will follow me in my meandering attempt to cook (hopefully it will not catch me crying on the kitchen floor over cooking fiascos). Phone calls to other Echo Show owners should be improved as I meander when talking to folks as well... I believe as the feedback rolls in, there will be improvements to screen data that pops up uninvited (please, pretty please), and the motion sensitivity concerns.

I am pleased with this purchase, but most likely will replace the rest of my Gen 1 Echos with Gen 2 10"" Echo Shows, this model has limited placement criteria and may not be the best Echo for every spot in the house. I will purchase one additional 10"" Gen 3 Echo Show for my office, but for bedrooms the Gen 2 10"" Echo Show should be sufficient.

As for the white cord, I can live with that all day long...aesthetics in this area are the least of my worries....",4.0 out of 5 stars

Sleepstate AZ,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","I love that I can have it look up information, ask it how to spell since I seem to have forgotten how to myself. lol. what I really love is being able to see and talk to my 2 cats when I'm not home. I can leave them for a few days and able to keep an eye on them and make sure they have what they need, the temperature is right and that they are ok. They can see me on this 10 also which is important to them. If I see they need food, water or haven't seen them cross the camera path I know to have my neighbor come check things. I have the Echo 8 in another room and have a Ring overlooking my living/dining rooms and kitchen so I can watch over my cats. It's nice to be able to leave town for a few days and not have to place them in a kennel. I don't go further than 250 miles driving so can get back in 4 hours if they need me too",5.0 out of 5 stars

I was not used to the screen displays which include weather, current amazon purchases and purchase history, nor was I expecting periodic shopping suggestions. It works well for doing the same commands that an echo dot can do, plus the advantage of seeing visuals. It is actually a very nice home automation device with good sound quality and sensitivity.

Peter Susi,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2023","--- UPDATE: (8/1) I received a call claiming to be from Amazon about my review, but the first thing they wanted me to do was confirm my name and account info - MAJOR RED FLAG. I declined, and asked for details and the caller hung up. However, I got a follow-up email from Amazon customer service that mentioned the phone call, and sought to ""help resolve the issues you’ve encountered and gather any additional feedback"". Unfortunately, that email included no information addressing any of the issues below. As far as I can tell the CS agent read neither my review, nor Amazon's public statements warning users not to disclose account information to callers from unknown numbers. -----

***What I wanted:***

A ""third screen"" organizer that could show me a dashboard of calendar entries, weather, to do, etc. Maybe something like THE PICTURES THEY USE TO ADVERTISE IT (See Pic #2 - ""Taylor's Birthday"" displayed next to weather, a podcast, and the time). Also, a screen to play YouTube or Twitch videos as I putter on something else.

***What I got:***

- Home screen is ONLY a rotating set of cards. You have no other options. There is no dashboard style option, no quick launch (you can use ""Tap to Alexa"" as a really mediocre one, kinda). The assumption is that in a world of touchscreens you must only want to shout at your devices.
- The Home screen is not even in your control. You can add pictures, and turn off some things, but Amazon will also randomly add whatever nonsense they think you want. You cannot adjust the rotation speed. Heck, you can't even make the clock overlay bigger.
- You cannot add utility to this home screen. You can't add widgets (they only live on a slide-out panel, and that closes after 10s). You can't adjust how the time and weather are displayed, or set the calendar slide to show things in a useful view. You can't add a big easy ""Open my YouTube Playlist"" button. You get pictures, ads, and gimmicks - end of list.
- That dashboard view (""Taylor's Birthday"") from Amazon's promotional materials - THIS DEVICE DOESN'T DO THAT
- You can technically watch YouTube, eventually. That is until it crashes. Because you need to use Silk, since they didn't include an app for the #2 site on the internet. (Actually, this runs on Android so they REMOVED that stock functionality)
- You can Technically view Twitch, in that the website loads for a few minutes. But you cannot login or use chat because Twitch.tv does not support the Silk browser. Yes, they are both owned by Amazon.
- The screen follows you around the room, or your dog, or any noise, or no noise. It also tries to follow you while you're using the touch screen so you end up chasing it back and forth.
- Interacting with this thing is so SLOOOOOW - How is a new device this underpowered?
- Sure, it does Video calls... which I don't care about because I already have a phone and I spend all day on MS Teams.
- Technically it has Follow-along recipes... No, not the recipes I have on my phone, or the one I found online. There's no way to share a link to this thing, and If I find a video on YouTube, I can't really even watch it.

This isn't even the nitpicky stuff, like when my headphones power off at 2 AM Alexa insists that we all wake up and hear about it, and there's no way to disable it.

Once you get past the gimmick turntable base, this thing is slow, unresponsive, buggy, and very limited in functionality. It is the epitome of ""Technically does what we promised, but not the way you probably want it to, or very well at all"".

Most of the ""Skills"" (Apps) are slower than just taking your phone out of your pocket. ""Is it going to rain?""
Option A: Look at your phone: picture of rain clouds on the weather widget - 2 seconds.
Option B: Ask Alexa - ""Right now in your area it's 64 degrees and partly cloudy with light wind..."" only after slowly describing what can be seen out of any window will she tell you if it's going to rain. And that's *only* if she heard you correctly! There's a good chance you'll get ""Shuffling songs by the Weatherman and similar artists, on Amazon Music"" instead.

Despite being built on an android OS, so much basic functionality has been stripped out of this thing it's infuriating. I can get apps on my WATCH that are easier to use and faster than the barely functional ""Skills"" I can occasionally find from 3rd parties since there is almost no support for this thing. Everything I figure should work out of the box requires sideloading something to connect to IFTTT so I can get another device to do the actual work. Heck, even YouTube - most sites tell you that ""You can make YouTube music work, just Bluetooth connect your phone to the echo!"" because the Echo refuses to run anything that isn't some gimmicky ""Read me my email slowly"" or ""display rotating pictures"" nonsense.

I cannot stress this enough: The best digital experience I can achieve with the Echo Show is by leaning my aging Samsung Tablet against it and launching the stock YouTube app.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Priscilla,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2023","Love the size and the look; However, compared to its sister products I own it is very hard to navigate. 1) I find myself constantly repeating the commands over and over as ""Alexa"" doesn't know that or a lot of ""Hmmmms"" very frustrating; 2) I primarily purchased this to watch TV in the kitchen - well that doesn't seem to be working well either; for starters I cannot download the apps I have on my firestick so that's annoying (please help if avail in this area); if you do actually get to watch content and want to ""pause"" forget asking her via voice she has no clue how to do this, so, I pause manually (usually with my hands full of dirty gloves which also is a pain) so, now we have it paused for a little bit - the screen goes to screensaver mode and the content goes Into the black hole and I cannot retrieve it again or if I'm lucky to retrieve it it is no longer paused and I have to watch from the beginning!!! Super annoying! This is one of the most costly items in the Amazon line and for that reason alone I wish it would work as it's beloved firestick; firetv or even the echo!!! As I have zero issues with these products. I find myself extremely frustrated every time I try to operate this product and it doesn't seem to be getting better after I have watched and tried dozens of ""how to's"" ; it just seems limited, sensitive and honorary to me and my needs - unless I am not using it as it's intended purpose. Nevertheless, unfortunately this does not get the 5 star rating from me.",4.0 out of 5 stars

nadanix,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021","I will give my 5 cents to this device. The unboxing experience is uneventful, however a warning here: You do need a smartphone or tablet to be setup with Alexa or this will not work. That is nowhere mentioned in the advertisement. The Alexa software is by far one of the worst I have seen in years. There is no real menu, you have to scroll through pages and pages of stuff, cluttered with things that are not helpful and confusing. Pictures and advertisement do not belong in a menu. The structure again, horrific.
Neither on the Alexa app or on the device itself is a home screen where you see all your apps.
It’s a cluster of menus, very hard to navigate.
Now, to our device. The first thing I turned off was motion. The screen does a lousy job following you and always seems to be angled off. Even when you turn motion off, every time you hit the screen to use a menu, the screen will bounce around and you need two hands. One to hold the screen and one to use the menu. The touchscreen is very unresponsive and often needs multiple touches to respond. There is a lot of glare coming from the display as well
The sound is good (not great) for a small device and you can pair Apple Music if you don’t want use Amazon Music. Warning: This device is not Airplay compatible, so it will not work in a multi-room setting in the Apple ecosystem. You can stream directly or from your phone via Bluetooth, to a single device. If you have a TuneIn Radio account you can stream from that, but I have not figured out yet how you play your favorites. The Echo will respond to stuff like “play NPR Radio on TuneIn” This device has no way to create or view playlists or use existing playlists in Apple Music.
The amount of consent you have to give to let the Echo read your calendar in your email account is worrisome. I decided against it because exposing your email account to Amazon simply is not my cup of tea. The build in web browser needs work. It is super-slow and will just stop working for no reason. I have the Echo now 2days and had multiple occurrences of freezing screens and the entire Echo going dark. This also happened to me in Food Network.
I turned on the news and when I came back to the kitchen 10 minutes later, the screen is dark. It simply stops, without command. The “try Alexa” feature is a nagging unstoppable insult and can get you mad enough to go the psych ward. No matter what, you cannot turn it off fully.
So after careful consideration and two days of use I decided to keep it a couple more days and wait for a software update. Amazon do you hear me? Add an option to turn off “try Alexa”. Give this thing a real menu. If not, you will get it back before the end of next week.
Edit: Now, on day three, it starts to just turn off. There is no setting to prevent that. Alexa is tired and goes to sleep. I am tired too and today Echo goes home to Amazon.",1.0 out of 5 stars
